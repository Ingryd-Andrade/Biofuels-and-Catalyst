AB  - Hyperthermal acid hydrolysis pretreatment of Eucheuma denticulatum was carried out using 12% (w/v) seaweed slurry and 90 mM H3PO4 at 150°C for 10 min. The use of Candida lusitaniae with adaptive evolution was evaluated for ethanol fermentation. The levels of ethanol production by separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) at 72 h with non-adapted and adapted C. lusitaniae were 10.1 g/l with ethanol yield (YEtOH) of 0.23, and 18.1 g/l with YEtOH of 0.45, respectively. Adaptive evolution was employed in this study to improve the efficiency of ethanol fermentation. Development of the SHF process could enhance the overall ethanol fermentation yields of the red seaweed E. denticulatum. © 2017, The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - The results of a study on the activity and operational stability of an Au–Pd/MFI/Al2O3 catalyst in the reaction of ethanol conversion into a gasoline fraction of hydrocarbons are reported. In the presence of the Au–Pd/MFI/Al2O3 catalyst, ethanol was almost completely converted into an alkane–aromatic fraction of C3–C11 hydrocarbons at 300°C in an atmosphere of Ar; the yield of this fraction was as high as 90% on a feed carbon basis. It was established that, in the presence of the bimetallic Au–Pd catalyst, the yield of the target fraction increased by 10%, as compared with that on a monometallic Au-containing sample. The Au–Pd/MFI/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited much higher stability in a long-term experiment in comparison with the previously tested pilot sample of Pd–Zn/MFI/Al2O3. After a 40-h operation, the yield of the target fraction of C3+ hydrocarbons in the presence of the Au–Pd/MFI/Al2O3 catalyst decreased by 15%. The treatment of the catalyst with hydrogen led to the complete restoration of its activity. The structure of the Au–Pd active constituents was studied by transmission electron microscopy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. methods of the and microscopy. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol production is growing annually. However, as a negative aspect of this growth occurs a competition between the production of alcohol and food. Among the alternatives for the production of ethanol, the Cyperus esculentus presents approximately 32% of starch. The starch must undergo the hydrolysis process, in which the breaking of the polymer chains of the starch occurs and thus the formation of reducing sugars. In this work, the hydrolysis of the starch present in Cyperus esculentus through the phosphoric acid pathway was performed. To evaluate the best hydrolysis condition with phosphoric acid, the experimental design 22. The variables used were the temperature and reaction time. The best response obtained was the temperature of 110 °C with a time of 120 minutes, producing 0.195 mg.L-1 of reducing sugar and 76.80% of ethanol content. Regarding the kinetic study, a new test was carried out using the temperatures of 70, 90 and 110 °C with a time of 120 minutes to discover the reaction order and the ionization constant. The values of k found for hydrolysis using H3PO4 with first order kinetics were: k70 = 0.0271; K90 = 0.0225 and k110 = 0.0220 min-1, therefore k70&gt; k90&gt; k110 indicating that the reaction was slower at the temperature of 110 °C.

AB  - Activated carbon monoliths (ACMs) were fabricated by H2O activation using powdered fast pyrolytic char (PFPC) as a raw material and bio-oil phenol-formaldehyde (BPF) resin as a binder. The effects of the ratio of BPF resin to PFPC on textural and chemical-surface properties of the ACMs were investigated using elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The adsorption capacity and mechanical properties under different conditions were examined by N2 adsorption analysis and compression strength, respectively. The results indicated that the optimal ratio was 20 wt.% BPF resin binder. The compression strength of ACMs with a carbon content of 79.7 wt.% reached 3.74 MPa, while the BET surface area and total pore volume were 731.3 m2/g and 0.589 cm3/g, respectively. ACMs appeared to be mainly mesoporous with low graphitization and contained multiple functional groups such as alkyl, esters, ether, phenol, olefin, etc.

AB  - The catalytic effects of N-hydroxyl phthalimide combined with various transition metal salts on the oxidative breakage of C-C bond of lignin by O2 under mild conditions were studied. 1, 2-diphenylethane was adopted as the model compound of lignin C-C bond. It was found that Mn(OAc)2 showed the highest promotion effect on the catalytic activity of NHPI among the soluble cobaltous, manganous and cupric salts. The oxidative breakage of C-C bonds led to the production of benzyl aldehyde and benzoic acid with high selectivity. 1, 2-Diphenyl ethanone was found to be the primary product. Either increase the reaction temperature, Mn(OAc)2 amount as well as the reaction time favored the C-C bond cleavage. Total selectivity of benzyl aldehyde and benzoic acid up to 76.5% was achieved in acetic acid under the conditions of 90℃ and 1.0 MPa O2 for 8 h by using 10% NHPI and 1% Mn(OAc)2 with respect to the amount of benzyl phenyl ether as the catalyst. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the utilization of the waste cooking oil (WCO) as fuel for diesel engine or also known as compression ignition (CI) engine. The WCO is an alternative biofuel to provide the receding supply of world crude oil as well as recycling the waste. The physiochemical properties of WCO are considered lower than conventional diesel fuel as its density is higher and volatility is lower. Thus the WCO is less prone to evaporate, diffuse and combust during the combustion process. As the matter of fact, the WCO cannot be used as it is because it will create clogging problem at the fuel filter and injector. Therefore, this project has mixes the WCO with conventional petrol fuel (RON95) which is lower density and higher volatility than WCO. The mixing ratio of the WCO and the RON95 was set in the range of 5 to 25 percent of volume based. Initially, the mixing fuel properties such as density and calorific value were investigated. Then, the mixes fuels were tested on the engine performance and the results are compared with the baseline diesel fuel. Based on the results found in this project, lower percentage of WCO (25% of RON95 and 75% of WCO) is suitable to be used for lower engine speed while higher percentage of WCO (5% of RON95 and 95% of WCO) produces a better result at higher engine speed. Nevertheless, the results of all fuel blends are poorer than the conventional diesel fuel. Hence, this project recommends further investigation to be made before WCO can fully utilise although it has potential to be used as fuel in diesel engine. © 2017 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering.

AB  - Biofuels derived from renewable biomass has been the focus of bio-based economy. Especially the development of new processes and facilities from lignocellulosic waste for advanced biofuel production represents an important field for academic research and industrial innovation within bioenergy development. The technical pathways for advanced biofuel production include the processes of cellulosic ethanol through lignocellulose hydrolysis-sugar fermentation, two-step hydrogenation (hydrodeoxygenation and hydroisomerization) of oils and fats (HVO), biomass gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis, biomass pyrolysis-upgrading of bio-oil and hydrotreating of algae oil via thermochemical, biochemical and hybrid conversions. Bio-oil, syngas, and sugars are used as platform chemicals. The progress of advanced biofuel development and the project activities in foreign countries were reviewed, which used lignocellulosic biomass, energy crops, municipal solid waste and organic waste as feedstock. The policies and regulations of advanced biofuels in America, Brazil, European Union and Canada, were described and compared. The current status of commercial and demonstration-scale facilities for advanced biofuel production was also discussed, mainly following the conversion processes of lignocellulosic ethanol, hydrotreated oils/fats (HVO) and biomass gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis. Although advanced biofuels have advantages for sustainable development, energy security and low carbon emission, the overall production and develop pathways cannot have cost parity with fossil-based fuels. The key barriers associated with its high cost include the unreliable feedstock availability, high production cost and uncertainty of policies. Biomass feedstock, especially lignocellulosic biomass, has huge annual amount worldwide, yet the significant hurdles for collecting, transportation and storage of biomass are needed to overcome in the scale-up of advanced biofuel production. And the limited lignocellulosic feedstock supply is also the result of uncertainties associated with its demand in the current market. Technical risk associated with scaling-up facilities is another restraining factor for investors due to the complexity of lignocellulosic feedstock and its conversion technologies, compared with starch-based corn ethanol. Financial support for pilot and demonstration plants can provide a valuable opportunity to validate technology from lab scale to commercial scale. Thus it would significantly reduce the technical and financial risks for new technology deployment. Cheap crude oil price in recent years is another reason, which resulted in the lack of policy irritation intention from government. As a consequence, the inconsistent developments of advanced biofuels cause its slowdown, and then form a vicious circle for limited feedstock supplements. The assessment of advanced biofuel in China was also discussed and its future development prospect was proposed. Due to the concern of food security in China, the only solution of biofuel production is using waste biomass via advanced technologies. HVO process is relatively easy and mature due to the utilization of bolt-on technologies by introduction of the advanced biofuel refineries into the existing petroleum refinery. Expanding the sources of oil feedstock by screening oil-fixing microorganisms, planting oil plant on marginal land will guarantee its long-term development in China. Cellulosic ethanol, bio-gasoline and biodiesel from lignocellulosic feedstock are essential guarantee for its perspective production. It is necessary to financially support cellulosic ethanol facilities of 100000 t/a and gasification-Fischer Tropsch facilities of 10000 t/a to demonstrate advanced biofuel production. And consistent policy measures are needed to provide investors with certainty about the future growth of advanced biofuel production in China, such as national mandatory addition of biofuel in transportation fuel, and adequate investment on demonstration project. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Intensive studies are being conducted to improve alternative energy resources due to a significant increase in the risks arising from the use of oil based energy in recent years. Biomass, ethanol and biodiesel are the most important alternative energy resources are renewable, recyclable and non-polluting. Biodiesel has caused an increase in food prices and has made it difficult to obtain food in some less developed countries, due to the allocation of agricultural land for the cultivation of oil crops rather than food production, to gain more profit. Therefore, microalgae, which can grow easily in fields not used for agriculture and for which per hectare yield is very high when compared with other biodiesel resources; appear to be a new biodiesel resource. In this study, the Chlorella protothecoides species belonging to the class Chlorophyceae were examined, suitability for biofuel production, large amount of oil, different temperature requirements. The effect of some growing parameters of this species, on different light intensity (172 lux, 186 lux and 265 lux) and different light cycles (12/12, 18/6, 6/18 and 24/0) on cell numbers, pH and conductivity values, has been investigated. According to the results of this study, it was determined that the effect of both light cycles and light intensity are important for cell numbers, pH, conductivity and salinity values. © by PSP.

AB  - The present study aims to improve the oxidation stability of wild apricot kernel oil biodiesel (WAKOB) by using natural antioxidants of Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn). Biodiesel was synthesized at different catalyst (NaOH) concentrations, reaction temperatures, reaction time intervals and methanol-to-oil molar ratios. Thermal oxidative stability measurements were carried out according to EN14112 using a Rancimet instrument. Our results showed a high yield of biodiesel (97±1.092) at 65oC in the presence of 1% NaOH (%w/w oil) and methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1 and for the time duration of 60 min. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) confirmed the conversion percentage of kernel oil into biodiesel, which was further evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and refractometer analyses. Methanolic fraction of Tartary buckwheat leaves (MTBWLF) was standardized to contain the highest amount of phenolics (209 mg gallic acid/100 g).

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuel for energy production is one of the major problems being faced worldwide. As an alternative to fossil fuels, first and second generation biofuel was developed from corn, grains and lignocellulosic agricultural residues. These generations are inefficient in achieving the desired rate of biofuel production, climate change mitigation and economic growth. Therefore, third generation biofuel specifically derived from microalgae have proved to be a promising unconventional energy source. Microalgae are microscopic organisms that grow in salt or fresh water and have been used for producing metabolites, cosmetics and for energy production. The conventional approaches used for biofuel production include pyrolysis, gasification, direct combustion and thermomechanical liquefaction. The search for biological and eco-friendly approaches led to the emergence of Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), which provide a new solution to energy crisis. Integration of photosynthetic organisms such as microalgae into MFC resulted in a new approach i.e. Microbial Solar Cell, which can convert solar energy into electrical energy via photosynthesis. Microbial solar cells have broad range application in wastewater treatment, biodiesel processing and intermediate metabolite production.

AB  - In this study, a two-stage fluidized bed gasifier was used to investigate the effect of the equivalence ratio (ER) and steam/biomass ratio (S/B) on the synthetic gas distribution while activated carbon (AC) was added as the bed material in secondary gasifier (Stage II). The experimental results showed that when the empty bed (without the bed material) was used for the Stage II reaction, the hydrogen (H2) content in the synthetic gas emitted from the Stage II reactor was 2–3 mol% higher than that from the first-stage gasifier (Stage I). It was supposed that using the Stage II reactor prolongs the reaction time and thereby increases the H2 production. Besides, when the AC was added in the Stage II gasifier, the H2 concentration, the total gas yield, and gas heating value reached their maximum (30 mol%) when ER and S/B were 0.3 and 1.5, respectively. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Concentration and purification of ethanol and other biofuels from fermentations are energy-intensive processes, with amplified costs at smaller scales. To circumvent the need for these processes, and to potentially reduce transportation costs as well, we have previously investigated bio-hybrid fuel cells (FCs), in which a fermentation and FC are closely coupled. However, long-term operation requires strictly preventing the fermentation and FC from harming each other. We introduce here the concept of the vapor-fed bio-hybrid FC as a means of continuously extracting power from ongoing fermentations at ambient conditions. By bubbling a carrier gas (N2) through a yeast fermentation and then through a direct ethanol FC, we protect the FC anode from the catalyst poisons in the fermentation (which are non-volatile), and also protect the yeast from harmful FC products (notably acetic acid) and from build-up of ethanol. Results: Since vapor-fed direct ethanol FCs at ambient conditions have never been systematically characterized (in contrast to vapor-fed direct methanol FCs), we first assess the effects on output power and conversion efficiency of ethanol concentration, vapor flow rate, and FC voltage. The results fit a continuous stirred-tank reactor model. Over a wide range of ethanol partial pressures (2-8 mmHg), power densities are comparable to those for liquid-fed direct ethanol FCs at the same temperature, with power densities &gt;2 mW/cm2 obtained. We then demonstrate the continuous operation of a vapor-fed bio-hybrid FC with fermentation for 5 months, with no indication of performance degradation due to poisoning (of either the FC or the fermentation). It is further shown that the system is stable, recovering quickly from disturbances or from interruptions in maintenance. Conclusions: The vapor-fed bio-hybrid FC enables extraction of power from dilute bio-ethanol streams without costly concentration and purification steps. The concept should be scalable to both large and small operations and should be generalizable to other biofuels and waste-to-energy systems. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Due to the rising price of crude oil, biofuel is being considered as a global alternative for fossil fuels to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Diesel blended with bio fuel is currently being widely adopted in many countries. The Taiwanese government has been enforcing the adoption of B2 since 2010. However, there have remained consistent concerns about engine durability related to the use of biofuel, especially regarding after-treatment systems. A selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) has been utilized recently to reduce NOX emission in order to meet the Euro IV and V emission standards. To evaluate the impact of biodiesel on the durability of engines equipped with the SCR system, a long-term testing program was organized for the purposes of this study. The results can be used as a reference for the development of marketing promotion strategies as well as government policies in Taiwan. B8 diesel fuel (8 vol% biodiesel) was employed in a commercial heavy duty common-rail fuel injection engine for testing purposes to determine its influence on the durability of engine components and the SCR system. After a 1000-hour full load test operation, the key components of the engines, including the injector, piston ring, and catalyst were analyzed and characterized through a series of inspections to identify the degree of decay and wear behavior. In addition, the engine performance was evaluated with the SAE J1995 test procedure, and the emissions were measured using the ETC test procedure at each maintenance stage and after the durability test to determine any variations in performance and emissions. Furthermore, non-regulatory emissions, such as PM2.5, PM diameter distributions, and particle numbers, which have been proved to be critically important in terms of causing cancer from diesel engine emissions, were also evaluated in this study. It was found that the standard deviation of performance and emissions varied less than 3% when the diesel engine was fueled with B8 biodiesel. The results also indicated that the SCR system still maintained conversion efficiency at 70∼95% after the 1000hr durability tests. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - Coprocessing of bio-oil and petroleum fraction is a prospective way of bio-oil upgrading. The upgrading is a complex combination of kinetic and transport processes. An overall kinetic model was developed considering the internal diffusion and the catalyst deactivation in this paper. First, the parameters of intrinsic kinetics model were calculated by the experimental data obtained in a fixed-bed reactor with a fine powder catalyst particle (0.32 mm). Using the intrinsic kinetic parameters and gas–solid catalysis theory, an effectiveness factor model was developed to evaluate the effect of internal diffusion on coprocessing. Then the kinetic model rB=a×η×rB0 was established based on the effectiveness factor model and the deactivation rate equation. The effectiveness factor η and liquid yields at different reaction conditions predicted by this kinetic model agreed closely with the experimental results. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Until now there are few reports on fast pyrolysis of Arundo donax for bio-oil, though it has a huge yield.In order to investigate the feasibility of Arundo donax used as pyrolysis raw material and obtain high quality bio-oil, a two-stage fixed-bed reactor was designed to perform the fast pyrolysis of Arundo donax using HZSM-5 as the catalyst.The effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalytic temperature and the height of catalytic layer on the product distribution, liquid and non-condensable gas components were studied.The results show that the maximum liquid yield of 49.53% is obtained at 500℃. The presence of the catalyst reduces the yields of the liquid as well as the contents of the oxygen compounds like acids, aldehydes, esters and ketones while increasing the contents of light phenols and aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil phase.Considering the results obtained at different catalytic temperatures and heights of catalytic layer, it can be concluded that the quality of the bio-oil has a significant improvement when the catalytic temperature is 500℃ and the height of catalytic layer is 10 cm. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Tianjin University(Science and Technology).

AB  - Tung’s fruits (Aleurites fordii) produce oil of great applicability in the market of painting and covering due to its drying characteristics. Tung’s oil may be an alternative for the production of new biofuels. In this study, it was evaluated the energetic potential of the fruit, oil and biodiesel obtained from the Tung. The average yielding of the extracted seed oil was 50.6%, a value similar to those presented in literature. Moreover, its density presented a value of 931.5 g L-1 and its acid index, 4.5 mg KOH g-1. In the last step of this study, biodiesel was produced by basic methyl route using potassium hydroxide. The specific mass of the produced biodiesel was 909.2 kg m-3 at 20°C; its acid index was 0.473 mg KOH g-1 and its flash point was 178°C. The values of heating values in natura and the low level of ashes in the residual biomass makes the Tung’s fruits a promising renewable clean source of energy of second generation fuel. © 2017 Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Increasing demand in transport fuel lead to discovery of Jatropha, Pongatnia plants along with Microalgae for biofuel production. In the present work Biodiesel was produced from Lipase mediated trans-esterification of Algal oil obtained from Botryococcus braunii. Before trans-esterification, Free Fatty Acid(FFA) content in algal oil was reduced and yield of biodiesel was 68.70%, 92% before and after the reduction of FFA respectively. Since lipase is non-toxic, recyclable, and lipase mediated trans-esterification can be carried out at 35°-40° C. Based on these observations lipase mediated trans-esterification is more beneficial than chemical trans-esterification, which can be carried out at 60°-65°C. Copyright © EM International.

AB  - The increasing population and economic growth with all its activities will increase energy demand in all sectors of energy users. Biofuels are fuels derived from organic matter, including kapok seeds. In this study, a catalytic cracking catalyst method with NiO/Al2O3 as catalyst was carried out. Some stages used in this study were the synthesis catalyst, which is a calcination process of the mixture consisting Ni(NO3) ·6H2O, Al(NO3)3 ·9H2O, and polyetylen glycol. The catalyst was analyzed using X-ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscope and tested for catalytic cracking process of kapok seed oil in microwave assisted. Products from the cracking process are analyzed by Gas Chromatography method to determine the product formation which towards gasoline, kerosene, or solar. Reusability catalyst test was done by using catalyst repeatedly. NiO/Al2O3 catalyst which is made from a simple heating method has more organized structure and also can increase the crystallinity of catalyst. Feed type without methanol and catalyst addition is directing the cracking process toward solar fraction. Feed type with catalyst addition refers to cracking process toward kerosene fraction. And feed type with methanol and catalyst addition can help the cracking process to produce gasoline fraction. Using catalyst repeatedly can decrease biofuel product because of coke formation and catalyst poisoning which can decrease the selectivity of catalyst. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - Hastelloy, a Ni containing alloy, was investigated to improve its catalytic activity on bio-oil steam reforming by oxidation pretreatment. Methanol as the major composition of bio-oil was used as a model compound. The untreated Hastelloy presented low methanol conversion with high selectivity of methane. After oxidation pretreatment, the Hastelloy showed good activity towards methanol steam reforming. The Cr and Mn promoters on the surface increased with the increase of oxidation temperature, resulting in the improvement of steam reforming activity. The Ni alloy appeared after pretreatment and controlled the oxidation state of Ni, leading to the decrease of methanation. The oxidation pretreatment at 1273 K provided the highest catalytic performance, but the agglomeration apparently occurred. The scales on the surface combined together when the oxidation was longer than two hours. Therefore, the optimal oxidation pretreatment condition was at 1273 K for two hours. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - An exploration of biodiesel preparation from nontraditional oil is one of the efficacious practice to answer a finite amount of raw materials of higher expenses. The main aim of this study is to upgrade the reaction process parameters (lauric acid to methanol molar ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and % (w/w) PE-Si catalyst loading) for the preparation of fuel grade esters (methyl laureate) derived from lauric acid. Therefore, in the present work, a silica anchored sulfonic acid mediated polyol (PE-Si) composite was prepared via chloro-sulfonation of pentaerythritol and employed as an environmentally benign catalyst for single step conversion of lauric acid to fuel grade esters via esterification reaction. The PE-Si composite was evaluated by FT-IR, XRD, TPD-NH3, SEM, TGA-DTA and BET surface area analysis. Whereas, the synthesized methyl laureate (ML) was clearly evaluated by FT-IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Besides, fuel properties of fuel grade esters were measured and compared with ASTM fuel standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In several our publications energetic efficiency of biofuel production was defined as a ratio of the amount of energy obtained in a form of biofuel to the sum of energy contributions necessary to conduct production processes on all the production stages. It was also shown that such a definition enables subsequent inclusion of production steps due to additivity of reciprocals of energetic efficiency determined separately for each step. In the present work, several scenarios of the transport of biomass between plantation and industrial facility converting biomass into biofuel are considered, appropriate values of energetic efficiency are computed and compared. The analysis is confined to biodiesel production based on rapeseed. The results show substantial differences caused by various approaches to that stage of transport.

AB  - Taiwan is an island in East Asia that strongly depends on imported fossil fuels. To reduce emissions and pollutants, there is interest in wind and solar energy. The current solar energy systems convert solar energy into electricity with high capital cost because of their low efficiency and high operational costs. This paper presents the position of renewable energy methods in Taiwan and the benefits of its expansion. This research suggests that the use of Photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors and wind turbines can provide appropriate solutions for electricity production due to the benefits of the long duration of insolation of solar collectors and the energy density of wind turbines. However, there are several challenges and problems that must be solved (land conditions and geographical positions are not appropriate for PV/T installation and wind energy system, respectively). Finally, a series of suggestions is presented to solve the economic problems associated with wind and solar energy systems. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Aims: Evaluate the use of polyethyleneimines (PEIs) as membrane permeabilizers to improve the responses and sensitivity of a bacterial bioreporter strain to viologens. Methods and Results: The responses from E. coli str. EBS, i.e., E. coli BW25113 carrying plasmid pSDS, when exposed to five different viologens were characterized, as were the toxicities of seven different PEIS, including two linear and five branched species. Based on these results, benzyl viologen led to the greatest responses, and 0·8-kDa branched PEI (BPEI) was the least toxic of the PEIs tested and, therefore, both were selected for the subsequent tests. The bioluminescence and relative responses from E. coli str. EBS exposed to various concentrations of 0·8 kDa BPEI identified 400 mg l−1 as the optimal concentration. Using this concentration, tests were performed with all five of the viologens. Conclusions: The responses from E. coli str. EBS to the viologens were improved, with the maximum relative bioluminescence values increasing between 5·6 and 16·5-fold. The minimum detectable levels for four of the viologens were likewise improved 2- to 4-fold. Significance and Impact of Study: Improving bacterial membrane permeability in a controlled manner using BPEIs can improve biosensing of toxic compounds, as well as be used in biofuel and bioenergy applications where membrane permeability to a solute is important. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - The expression of cell wall degrading enzymes in bioenergy crops has been proposed as a cost-effective method to produce fuel and chemicals. In this study, the thermoregulated intein-modified endo-β-1,4-xylanases GH10 and GH11 (iXyn GH10 and iXyn GH11) were expressed in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Two xylanase-expressing lines (Alamo background genetics) were compared to the wild type (Alamo genetics) to determine their composition, pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and ethanol fermentation. Three switchgrass samples with similar carbohydrate contents performed differently under four selected pretreatment conditions utilizing ammonia, oxalic acid/ferric chloride, sodium carbonate, or sodium hydroxide. Pretreated iXyn samples had higher glucan and lower xylan concentrations compared to the pretreated Alamo. An increased rate of glucose production and a higher glucan conversion ratio were observed in both iXyn lines. Pretreated iXyn samples required less exogenous enzyme to achieve similar levels of saccharification. Ethanol production increased from the glucan portion of the pretreated iXyn lines. However, the overall yield may vary depending upon the characteristics of the yeast and its conversion processes. © 2017

AB  - Bio-oil is the main product of biomass pyrolysis, which is considered as a promising replacing fuel for fossil oil. But the high oxygen, high viscosity, low heat value and poor stability of bio-oil make it difficult to apply directly. Thus study on the improvement of bio-oil quality is very necessary. Different mass fractions (5%~25%) of methanol, ethanol, octanol and its two mixed alcohols were used to improve the heavy oil quality which was pyrolysed from pine nut. The physical and chemical properties and storage time of heavy oil with alcohol additive were investigated. The results showed that the addition of alcohol additives could significantly reduce the viscosity, water content and pH value of heavy oil, and enhance its heat value. Simultaneously, the contents of phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ketones in the heavy oil were decreased, and the contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and alcohols were increased. The heavy oil adding mixed alcohol showed a better stability, and its viscosity and water content were only increased slightly after 56 d. After adding methyl-octanol mixture and stored for 56 d, the viscosity of the heavy oil was 980 mPa·s, and water content was 21.02%. The growth rate was only a half of the original heavy oil. With the increase of methyl-octanol mixture additive amount, the heat value of heavy oil was increased. When the addition amount was 25%, the heat value was 32.66 MJ/kg. However, it was found that the combustion performance was the best when adding 20% of methyl-octanol mixture; the weight loss rate of combustion section was the largest and the amount of ash after combustion was minimal. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - To enhance the yield of alkyl levulinates, a mixed-acid catalyst system consisting of CrCl3 and H3PO4 was investigated for the transformation of furfuryl alcohol (FA). The CrCl3-H3PO4 system exhibited a positive synergistic catalytic activity for the synthesis of alkyl levulinates, which was especially obvious for n-butyl levulinate (BL) synthesis. The strongest synergic effect of mixed-acid system for BL production was achieved at the CrCl3 molar ratio of 0.3 (based on total moles of CrCl3 and H3PO4). Furthermore, the mixed-acid systems consisting of Cr-salts combined with H3PO4 and its salts in catalyzing FA conversion to BL were evaluated, and the evolution process of FA to produce BL was explored in the presence of CrCl3-H3PO4, sole CrCl3, and sole H3PO4. A possible synergistic catalytic pathway of CrCl3 combined with H3PO4 was proposed. Finally, the key process variables were examined. Under optimal conditions, a high BL yield of 95% was achieved from 99% FA conversion catalyzed by the synergy of CrCl3 and H3PO4.

AB  - Background: The replacement of leaded high octane aviation gasoline with an unleaded renewable alternative would decrease the emissions of lead and fossil-derived carbon into the atmosphere. Replacement has been limited by the requirement of a very high octane number in many existing general aviation aircraft engines. Method: Two separate process pathways were developed that generate an unleaded octane fuel with a motor octane number >96 from triglyceride oils (TGs), such as crop oils and algae oil. A series of experiments coupled with process simulations was used to verify the feasibility of both pathways and to provide preliminary laboratory scale data that could form the basis for further development towards a commercial technology. In the first pathway, TG oil is catalytically cracked to produce a high concentration of simple aromatic hydrocarbons. These aromatic hydrocarbons are then alkylated using propylene to form a mixture, which after purification acquires fuel properties compliant with those in the ASTM specification for 100 octane low lead aviation gasoline (100LL AvGas). In the second process pathway, the aromatic hydrocarbons are isolated after cracking using a sulfolane solvent extraction process to increase alkylation efficiency and fuel quality. Result: The results demonstrate that it is technically feasible to produce a replacement for 100LL AvGas using either pathway, and thus these strategies may be attractive candidates for commercialization. © 2017 Seames et al.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a viable option for the production of renewable energy and agricultural resources from diverted organic waste streams. This high temperature thermochemical process yields material with beneficial reuses, including bio-oil and biochar. Gaseous forms of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are also emitted during pyrolysis. The effluent mass emission rates from pyrolysis are not well characterized, thus limiting proper evaluation of the environmental benefits or costs of pyrolysis products. We present the first comprehensive suite of C and N mass emission rate measurements of a biomass pyrolysis process that uses chicken manure as the feedstock to produce biochar and bio-oil. Two chicken manure fast pyrolysis experiments were conducted at controlled temperature ranges of 450-485 °C and 550-585 °C. Mass emission rates of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3) were measured using trace gas analyzers. Based on the system mass balance, 23-25% of the total mass of the manure feedstock was emitted as gas, while 52-55% and 23% were converted to bio-oil and biochar, respectively. CO2 and NH3 were the dominant gaseous species by mass, accounting for 58-65% of total C mass emitted and 99% of total reactive N mass emitted, respectively. Temperature variations within the two set of temperature ranges had a perfunctory effect on bio-oil production and gaseous emissions, but the higher temperature range process produced more bio-oil and slightly less emissions. However, a larger effect on the relative amounts of CO and CO2 produced were observed between the different temperature regimes. These results have important implications for greenhouse gas and reactive N life cycle assessments of biochar and bio-oil. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A high-pressure/high-temperature reactor was used in batch and continuous mode to obtain hydrotreated cracked vegetable oil (HCVO). The effect of six catalysts such as Pt and Pd on active carbon, CoMo, NiMo and Pt+Pd on Al2O3 and ZSM-5 were investigated in batch experiments for cracked vegetable oil (CVO) upgrading. CVO was produced in-house from rapeseed oil. Reaction conditions were 300–380 °C at 50–150 bar hydrogen. The stripped and condensed product was gathered continuously in intervals of 30–60 min. Both, batch and continuous products were separated into an oil phase and a water phase. Physical properties were determined, including higher heating value (HHV), acid/iodine number, viscosity, density and elemental composition. HCVO showed HHV up to 46.6 MJ/kg (CVO: 43.5 MJ/kg), acid number of 2.8 mgKOH/g (CVO: 80.5 mgKOH/g) and oxygen content of 0.32 wt% (CVO: 5.27 wt%). HHV of HCVO is in the range of fossil diesel fuel. Pt/C is the most suitable catalyst for the production of HCVO under the used experimental conditions. HCVO may be used as a fossil fuel substitute based on renewable raw material. GCMS-FID was used for the quantitative analysis of composition. Up to 73 wt% of the samples were quantifiable. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research article demonstrates biodiesel synthesis through the methanolysis of the oily contents (4.02 ± 0.27% w/w on dried basis) of Dictyota dichotoma collected from the coast of Hawksbay, Pakistan. The metal oxides (CaO, MgO, ZnO, and TiO2) used as nanocatalysts were refluxed (5% K2SO4), calcinated (850 °C) and characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) which produced 93.2% w/w FAME (biodiesel) at relatively mild condition (5% catalyst, 65 °C, 3 h, 18:1 molar ratio) using CaO. Whereas, MgO, ZnO, and TiO2 produced 92.4%, 72.5%, and 31.8% w/w FAME, respectively at elevated condition (225 °C). Thus, CaO was considered to be the best catalyst among the others. This tri-phase reaction require continuous fast mixing and the yield depends on the reaction parameters like catalyst amount, temperature, reaction time and molar ratio (methanol: oil). The reusability of these heterogeneous catalysts simplified the purification step, reduced the waste generation and make the final product technically and economically viable. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the paramount biofuels and alternates for geologically produced petroleum fuel. The lipid sources in dissipate material are very much valuable in two ways: one is for the remediation of dissipate and the other is to obtain a high percentage of biofuel. Hence, in the present study Solanum nigrum L. seed–a widespread weed found in agricultural fields–was selected as a source to produce biodiesel via the transesterification process with the help of an alkali catalyst. The highest conversion of Solanum nigrum L. seed oil (as triglyceride) to biodiesel was achieved as 99.6 wt% with 35 min reaction time at 65°C, 9:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, and 1 wt% of potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst. At the optimized condition, the conversion of triglyceride to biodiesel was confirmed by 1H NMR and the fuel properties of biodiesel were analyzed. The fuel properties were originated to be observed within the limit of ASTM D6751 standard. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In recent years, the number of fossil fuels is decreasing sharply, and the harmful gases produced by fossil fuel combustion endanger human health and pollute the environment, people are devoted to looking for the alternative fuels of fossil fuels. Biomass energy is a good choice, it is renewable and clean. But the biomass was always burned directly, it is a great waste of biomass sources. In order to reduce the waste of biomass resources and protect the environment, we studied the rapid pyrolysis and catalytic cracking technology to convert the biomass to liquid fuel, which we called the liquid bio-oil. Choosing rape straw as biomass raw materials, HZSM-5 and MCM-41 were used to catalyze the rape straw pyrolysis with different mixing ratios. The experimental instruments include electronic controller, catalytic reactor, pyrolysis reactor, vacuum pump, cold trap, cooling tower, bio-oil collector and connecting pipe. The rape straws were placed in the pyrolysis reactor, the catalysts were replaced in the catalytic reactor, the vacuum pump pressure was controlled at 5kPa and the temperature of the cooling tower was set to -20℃. According to the physical and chemical properties, FT-IR and GC-MS analysis results of organic oil and the BET analysis results of catalysts, we studied the effect of HZSM-5 and MCM-41 mixing ratios on the quality of bio-oil. The results showed that with the increase of MCM-41 content, the yield of bio-oil organic phase decreased first and then increased. The density, oxygen content and kinematic viscosity of refined organic oil decreased first and then increased,while carbon content and calorific value increased first and then decreased, when HZSM-5 and MCM-41 were mixed with 1:1, the higher calorific value was 34.31 MJ/kg. The organic phase of refined oil showed six obvious absorption peaks, respectively, they were the absorption peaks of alcohols or phenols, aromatic compounds, acids and aldehydes, ketones, carboxylates, esters and substituted aromatic compounds. The mass fraction of aromatic hydrocarbon increased first and then decreased, while the mass fraction of carbonyl compounds showed the opposite trend, the mass fraction of acids was continuously reduced. With the increase of MCM-41 content, the catalytic activity and absorption capacity of mixed catalysts improved and tended to be stable when the mass fraction of MCM-41 was 50%. From these analysis results, we can speculate the catalytic cracking reaction mechanism of rape straw on HZSM-5 and MCM-41. Because of the large specific surface area and pore size of mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41, most of the macromolecules in its pore channels can be decomposed into small molecules such as aldehydes, ketones and other small molecules by decarboxylation, dehydroxylation and ring-opening polymerization in the pore channels. These small molecules re-entered the pores of the microporous molecular sieve HZSM-5, and generated aromatic hydrocarbons, H2O, CO2 and CO through the decarbonylation, aromatization and deoxidation, and then the oxygen content in organic phase decreased, aromatic substances content increased, the acidity reduced, so that the quality of bio-oil was improved. This study could provide the experimental basis and the theoretical basis for the efficient utilization of biomass. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - A series of heterogeneous KF/CaO catalysts modified with transition metals (lanthanum, cerium, and zirconium) were prepared via wet impregnation method and applied to the trsansesterification process of waste cooking oil (WCO) as feedstock with methanol to biodiesel production. The structure, performance of the solid catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The effect of methanol/oil molar ratio, 1reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst amount, and stability was investigated. The results showed that 10 wt% of lanthanum, cerium, and zirconium improved the catalytic activity of KF/CaO catalyst. The maximum catalytic activity using the lanthanum doping of 10wt% on KF/CaO catalyst was reached 98.7% under the optimal reaction condition of methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, reaction for 1 h at reaction temperature of 65°C, and 4% (wt/wt oil) catalyst amount. In addition, the FAME yield of KF/CaO/La catalyst remained higher than 95% after 10 cycles. The promotional effect of lanthanum doping could be attributed to the enhancement of the basicity strength of KF/CaO catalyst and block the leach of Ca2+ in the transesterification reaction. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Alumina nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method and submitted to thermal treatment at 750°C and 1000 °C. X-ray diffraction was used to determine crystal formation with sizes up to 280 nm. To achieve stable suspensions, a nano-additive was mixed with the diesel/biodiesel blends along with oleic acid surfactant to obtain concentrations of nano-additives at 10 and 20 ppm. Colloidal stability was evaluated according to Deryaguin-Landau-Verwey-Oberbeek theory by analyzing the total interaction energy of the system. Effects on the kinematic viscosity and flash point of the B10 blend were determined according to ASTM D-445 and ASTM D-93 regulations. The application of nano-additives in biodiesel blends showed an increase of the kinematic viscosity from 2.75 cSt to 3.33 cSt at 40°C with 20 ppm of nanoparticles in the B10 blend, while flash point increased from 65 °C to 66 °C.

AB  - Among forest diseases, fungi are the most important agents that cause irreparable losses to the wood of standing trees and logs. In this study, pyrolysis of undecayed and decayed beech (Fagus orientalis) wood were carried out using a fixed-bed reactor at pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. The influence of Trametes versicolor fungal decay on the yield and chemical composition of products was investigated. The bio-oil yield was 62.5 wt% at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C for decayed wood, while the bio-oil yield was found to be about 58 wt% at the same temperature for undecayed wood. Bio-oils were characterized using some chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). It was found that Tetracosamethyl-cyclododecasiloxane (5.50 %), tetradecamethyl-hexasiloxane (4.85 %), 2,6-dime-thoxy-phenol (4.21 %), and benzene acetic acid (3.16 %) were the main oil components present in decayed beech wood, while syringol (14.86%), methoxyeugenol (6.59 %), naphthalene (4.41 %), o-guaiacol (3.60 %), isoeugenol (3.17 %), and 2-methoxy-4-methyl-phenol (3.08 %) were present in undecayed beech wood. These results show that decayed wood can be used for the production of bio-oil. © 2017, Journal Drvna Industrija. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biobased furanics like 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) are interesting platform chemicals for the synthesis of biofuel additives and polymer precursors. 5-HMF is typically prepared from C6 ketoses like fructose, psicose, sorbose and tagatose. A known byproduct is 2-hydroxyacetylfuran (2-HAF), particularly when using sorbose and psicose as the reactants. We here report an experimental and kinetic modeling study on the rate of decomposition of 2-HAF in a typical reaction medium for 5-HMF synthesis (water, Brönsted acid), with the incentive to gain insights in the stability of 2-HAF. A total of 12 experiments were performed (batch setup) in water with sulfuric acid as the catalyst (100-170 °C, CH2SO4 ranging between 0.033 and 1.37 M and an initial 2-HAF concentration between 0.04 and 0.26 M). Analysis of the reaction mixtures showed a multitude of products, of which levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid (FA) were the most prominent (Ymax,FA = 24 mol %, Ymax,LA = 10 mol %) when using HCl. In contrast, both LA and FA were formed in minor amounts when using H2SO4 as the catalyst. The decomposition reaction of 2-HAF using sulfuric acid was successfully modeled (R2 = 0.9957) using a first-order approach in 2-HAF and acid. The activation energy was found to be 98.7 (±2.2) kJ mol-1 © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The influence of CeO2 as an additive on the carbonaceous deposition behavior of Ni-Cu/H-ZSM-5 catalyst in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil was investigated. Various techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy were used to elucidate the content and microstructure of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface, the transformation of various forms of carbon (soft carbon, hard carbon and graphite) in HDO, and the kinetics of carbon deposition. The results indicate that the content of CeO2 added in the Ni-Cu based catalyst and the reaction temperature both have a significant influence on the carbon deposition behavior and the resistance against coking for HDO of bio-oil; for HDO over the Ni-Cu/HZSM-5 catalyst at 270℃, adding 15% CeO2 gives the Ni-Cu catalyst highest resistance against the carbon deposition. © 2017, Science Press.

AB  - Mesoporous nanocrystal HZSM-5 were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization during 24 h, at 130 °C with CTAB and TPABr as the templates. The template removing process of as-synthesized sample was studied by TG/DSC. Characterization by modern techniques as XRD, SEM, TEM and TPD-NH3 has showed that the obtained catalyst is highly crystalline with uniformly nanocrystal size. This product has mesoporous sieves which are neatly ordered with diameters around 30 Å high BET surface area of 495 m2/g and great acidity. These advantages give the mesoporous nanocrytal ZSM-5 catalyst the applicability in the process of cracking waste oil for green fuel due to the shape—selective advantage for large size molecules in waste vegetable oil. The results of waste vegetable oil catalytic cracking reaction has officially confirmed this identification. The production of green diesel has good quality, meets the technical and environmental standards. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Brazil is considered one of the world’s leading producers of biofuels given the predominance of ethanol fuel in its energy matrix. However, despite the prominence of Brazil in ethanol production, the vast majority of biodiesel production plants in Brazil use methanol instead of ethanol as the alcohol for transesterification reaction, as is generally the case in the rest of the world. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine the transesterification process in the Brazilian biodiesel production in terms of sustainability. In this regard, it was necessary to evaluate the way in which the industrial process is currently carried out, the role of government incentives or subsidies for the use of ethanol to produce biodiesel, and the investments of companies in technology development for the same purpose. This study presents indications that the development of the biodiesel market in Brazil is still oriented toward a production model which is inconsistent with the environmental and social aspects of sustainability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Direct catalysis of vapors from vacuum pyrolysis of biomass was performed on MCM-41 to investigate the effects of operating parameters including catalyzing temperature, catalyzing bed height and system pressure on the organic yields. Optimization of organic phase yield was further conducted by employing response surface methodology. The statistical analysis showed that operating parameters have significant effects on the organic phase yield. The organic phase yield first increases and then decreases as catalyzing temperature and catalyzing bed height increase, and decreases as system pressure increases. The optimal conditions for the maximum organic phase yield were obtained at catalyzing temperature of 502.7°C, catalyzing bed height of 2.74 cm and system pressure of 6.83 kPa, the organic phase yield amounts to 15.84% which is quite close to the predicted value 16.19%. The H/C, O/C molar ratios (dry basis), density, pH value, kinematic viscosity and high heat value of the organic phase obtained at optimal conditions were 1.287, 0.174, 0.98 g/cm3, 5.12, 5.87 mm2/s and 33.08 MJ/kg, respectively. Organic product compositions were examined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and the analysis showed that the content of oxygenated aromatics in organic phase had decreased and hydrocarbons had increased, and the hydrocarbons in organic phase were mainly aliphatic hydrocarbons. Besides, thermo-gravimetric analysis of the MCM-41 zeolite was conducted within air atmosphere and the results showed that when the catalyst continuously works over 100 min, the index of physicochemical properties of bio-oil decreases gradually from 1.15 to 0.45, suggesting that the refined bio-oil significantly deteriorates. Meanwhile, the coke deposition of catalyst increases from 4.97% to 14.81%, which suggests that the catalytic activity significantly decreases till the catalyst completely looses its activity. © 2017 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.

AB  - A 2-CSTRs anaerobic digestion system using molasses wastewater as a biochemical substrate for fermentative bioenergy production and substrate degradation under various ethanol recovery rates was developed. The effects of ethanol recovery rates (0%–80%) and organic loading rates (OLRs; 8, 16 and 24 kgCOD m−3 d−1) on bioenergy production rate (εT) and bioenergy production yield were examined, respectively. Since the system produced a significant amount of biofuels (i.e. hydrogen, methane and ethanol), the process performance in terms of energy conversion derived from the combination of three biofuels was calculated according to production rates and combustion heat values. Recycle and reflux are the two reuse approaches for effluents in the system. A maximum HPR of 1.34 (±0.7) mol d−1and a maximum EPR of 0.45 (±0.4) mol d−1 were observed at the OLR of 24 kgCOD m−3 d−1. Linear regression of the collection between HPR and EPR can be expressed as y = 0.3182x + 0.0114 (r2 = 0.9853). The highest MPR of 0.45 (±0.07) mol d−1 was obtained at the original OLR of 24 kgCOD m−3 d−1, with an ethanol recover rate of 0%. Recycle resulted to a higher εT and energy yield than reflux with the ethanol recover rate of 0% and 20%, respectively. This was equal to the ethanol recover rate of 50%, but lower than the ethanol recover rate of 80%; indicating that recycle would be more feasible for lower ethanol recover rates, and reflux may be more suitable with other kinds of ethanol recover rates. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The solubility of carbon monoxide is measured in four different bio-oil compounds (furan, diacetyl, 2-methylfuran, and trans-crotonaldehyde) at temperatures (273.15, 283.15, 298.15, and 323.15 K) and pressures up to 8 MPa using a static-analytical VLE measurement method. The equipment was validated by measuring the solubility of CO2 in methanol at 298.15 K and pressures (P = 2.9–5.7 MPa). The results were compared with the abundantly available literature values. PC-SAFT, Polar PC-SAFT (PPC-SAFT), and Cubic (SRK, PR) EoS, part of commercial process simulator Aspen Plus V. 8.6, are used here for modelling purpose. The pure component parameters needed for PC-SAFT and PPC-SAFT EoS models, are regressed using the experimental liquid density and vapour pressure data of the pure components. It was observed that furan, 2-methylfuran and diacetyl, having weak dipole moments (μ &lt; 1.0 D), could be modelled reasonably well without the addition of polar contribution using conventional PC-SAFT, while it is recommended to use PPC-SAFT for the description of a polar compound like trans-crotonaldehyde (μ ∼ 3.67 D). It was observed that SRK and PR EoS have similar predictive ability in comparison to PC-SAFT for a mixture of CO with weakly polar compounds in this study. A comparison between the performances of EoS models was made in two ways: first by setting the binary interaction parameter kij to zero, and second by adjusting a temperature-dependent binary interaction parameter (kij). All the models perform with comparable accuracy with adjusted binary interaction parameters. However, due to the large differences between the chemical and physical properties of the compounds in this study, it is challenging to make a general statement on which is the best model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the implementation of the Philippine Biofuels Act of 2006, the country continues to search for new biodiesel feedstock and in improving on existing processes related to biodiesel production. In this study, contributions to these two fields of research were done. Palm oil is currently being considered at by the Philippine government as a potential biodiesel feedstock to augment coconut. This study aimed to optimize parameters for biodiesel production using refined palm oil as feedstock by varying the methanol-to-palm oil molar ratio (MeOH:PO) and the palm oil-to-sodium hydroxide molar ratio (PO:NaOH) with the aid of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) at constant temperature (30°C) and reaction time (60 min). The obtained optimum ranges are: 6.5-6.9:1 for MeOH:PO and 1:0.27-0.32 for PO:NaOH. After the optimum ranges for both ratios were determined, the effect of adding various amounts of FAME to the reaction system at the start of transesterification was studied in an attempt to break the immiscibility of methanol and oil in order to increase FAME yield. The increasing the initial amount of FAME added resulted to an increase in the amount of %FAME yield. In the experimental run where 50% by weight (wt%) of FAME was added, %FAME yield was 64%, which is more than double compared to that of the control (29%). These proved that biodiesel could be produced at milder reaction conditions and would require less energy input. © 2017, University of the Philippines Los Banos. All rights reserved.

AB  - The biooil is thermally cracked under catalytic environment in a catalytic crack-ing process. This process is able to replace the transesterification process to match the biofuel properties with diesel. In this study the silicon dioxide and ce-rium oxide were chosen as catalyst for cracking the jatropha vegetable oil. The catalytically cracked jatropha biofuel gas is delivered at constant rate to the inlet manifold of the diesel engine. Before and after cracking, the characteristics of the catalysts were analyzed using scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffrac-tion. The condensed cracked jatropha biofuel properties were analyzed with the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analy-sis, and differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and it matches with the diesel fuel. From the experimental results, the increase in brake thermal efficiency of the engine with higher oxides of nitrogen emission was observed compared with diesel for both the catalytically cracked jatropha biofuels. Notably, SiO2 as cata-lyst showed the better mixing towards homogeneity with higher performance and emission results than the CeO2 as catalyst. © 2017 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - Herein, nanoplates of crystalline zinc aluminum phosphate exhibiting hexagonal and square planar morphology were successfully synthesized by adopting a novel and simple synthesis method; in this method, a single template, TPABr, was used in minute amounts and a shorter synthesis time of 24 h was required. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR, SEM, XPS, TEM, thermal analysis, ICP, and ammonia TPD. The synthesis temperature governed the morphology of the nanoplates; however, irrespective of the shape of the nanoplates, the materials exhibited promising catalytic activity towards the production of bio-fuel solketal (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol), a valuable bio-fuel, via acetalization of biodiesel waste glycerol under solvent-free reaction conditions. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Human population has dramatically increased in the past few decades, stretching finite fossil fuel resources. Renewable energy is an alternative and solution to growing energy demands. Among all renewable energy resources, bioethanol and biodiesel seem to be the future’s energy resources. Biofuels can be produced from various feedstocks comprising energy crops, non-food crops, and algae. In this review, we have described biofuel production using algae. Algae, a third generation fuel crop, can be used for both bioethanol and biodiesel production. Besides biofuel, algae can also be used for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceutical products. Algae can serve as a good source of biomass for biofuel production, however, to be economically viable, optimized methods for growth conditions, harvesting, and oil extraction should be employed. Furthermore, we have described the genomic strategies to improve algae strains for its photosynthetic ability and rate of photosynthesis. © Begell House Inc., 2017.

AB  - Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have proven useful for the surface immobilization of enzymes via the complementary cavities they present. Immobilization in this manner may prove useful in maintaining enzymatic efficacy. In biofuel cell applications, the thickness of an imprinted polymer layer coated on the electrode can be effectively controlled to yield the desired electron conductivity. In this work, glucose oxidase (GOx) and laccase (Lc) were imprinted on the surfaces of the anode and cathode of a biofuel cell at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.02 mg mL-1, respectively, using a poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) matrix. The effectiveness of imprinting was maximized by using 32 mole% ethylene and an enzyme concentration of 0.1 wt%. The surface morphology of the imprinted cavities and their interactions with the imprinted proteins were investigated by atomic force microscopy, revealing both the surface morphology of the imprinted cavities and the attractive force between the protein and the imprinted matrix. Finally, the output of the enzymatic biofuel cells was measured. Immobilization of the enzymes using the MIP electrodes gave substantially improved performance, compared to passive adsorption on either polymer-coated or bare electrodes. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Microwave technique was applied for the synthesis of Argemone biodiesel from Argemone oil under defined experimental conditions. The method presented has the potential to synthesize quality biofuel in timeefficient manner. It also results in higher yield of biodiesel while decreasing the reaction time by almost 75% when compared with conventional heating method. The biodiesel produced was tested for various physico-chemical properties and found to maintain the quality as recommended by various specifications. Reduction in the wear scar diameter of low-sulphur diesel from 432 to 256 μm at a very low concentration of biodiesel (1.0%) was an additional advantage to produce biofuel.

AB  - Both perennial grasses and corn biomass residues are non-edible for humans and have high carbohydrate contents that make them promising raw materials for biofuel production. This study evaluated perennial grasses (miscanthus and switchgrass) and corn-based biomass materials (corn stover, stalk, cob, husk, and bran) for high-yielding hydrogen gas production by aqueous-phase reforming (APR). The biomass materials were dissolved in subcritical water to obtain hydrolysates for use as feed solutions in APR. The dissolution experiments showed that hydrolysis percentages and total organic carbon releases were considerably higher in corn biomass fractions as compared to perennial grasses. The highest (66.7 mL H2) and lowest (27.0 mL H2) hydrogen yields were observed when miscanthus and corn bran biomass hydrolysates, respectively, were used as the feed solution. Hydrogen production yields were found to be in the following descending order: Miscanthus > corn cob > corn stover > switchgrass > corn husk corn stalk >> corn bran. In general, the biomass hydrolysates that had less organic carbon resulted in higher hydrogen production. Hydrolysis and gasification results for corn husks from various types of corn (field corn, sweet corn, seed corn, and popcorn) were different. The findings of this study will be beneficial for selection of the right biomass material for production of a specific value-added product from biomass. This study focused on biofuel hydrogen gas, which has the highest specific energy content of all conventional fuels. © 2017 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The application of biomass derived energy is gaining importance due to the decreasing supply of fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns. This study described the possibility of utilizing Castanea sativa's by-product as biofuels by producing char via pyrolysis. The process was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at different heating rates of 10 °C, 100 °C, and 200 °C per minute at temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 700 °C, and a nitrogen flow rate of 100 cm3 per minute. The produced chars were characterized by proximate and elemental analyses, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence analyses. The char yield was found to decrease as both pyrolysis temperature and heating rate increases. The carbon content of char ranged from 68 to 87 wt.%, which correspond to approximately 43% of carbon in the biomass. The char obtained at 700 °C had high fixed carbon content (79.90%) as well as high heating value, and hence, it could be used as a solid fuel or as a precursor in the activated carbon production with its 268 m2 per gram surface area.

AB  - Ludmilla Aristilde assistant professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell University describes one biological approach that is showing potential in manufacturing ethanol through syngas fermentation. Specifically Aristilde and her colleague Lars Angenent developed an overflow model showing how a thermodynamic shift can enable an anaerobic bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii to use syngas fermentation to produce ethanol. The Angenent laboratory separated acidogenesis and solventogenesis by running each process in a separate bioreactor using the bacterium. Acetate and ethanol were each produced under steady-state conditions. The gaseous stream employed in both cases contained 60% CO 35% H2 and 5% CO2. In the model two metabolic pathways are presented which display the bacterium uses to generate energy. The biomass pathway is favored until the cell can no longer grow and biomass cannot be produced. Then the ethanol-generating pathway is preferred.

AB  - With N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) as free radicals trapper, the effects of PBN dosage and reaction temperature on the product distribution and bio-oil component distribution of cellulose liquefaction in supercritical ethanol were investigated using an autoclave. The results showed that the yields of bio-oil and volatile compounds were 37.17% and 50.08% without PBN, respectively; meanwhile the highest yield of bio-oil increased to 48.35%, whereas the volatile compound yield decreased to 35.65% with the PBN dosage increased from 0 to 0.4 g. With the increase of reaction temperature from 250℃ to 340℃, the cellulose conversion rate increased sharply from 23.10% to 88.92% while the bio-oil yield increased from 19.18% to 48.35% (320℃) and the volatile compound yield increased from 6.03% to 50.28% quickly. The GC-MS results showed that the dominant compounds in bio-oil were esters, ketones, alkanes, alcohols, acids and benzenes with the highest relative contents of 27.91%, 15.77%, 13.44%, 12.42%, 16.07% and 19.81%, respectively. The present results proved that PBN has obvious effects on the product distribution and bio-oil component distribution of cellulose liquefaction in supercritical ethanol, especially PBN can enhance the transformation between bio-oil and volatile compounds via reacting with benzyl radicals, methyl radicals, ethyl radicals, etc. The transformation among dominant compounds in bio-oil can be regulated by varying PBN dosage and reaction temperature. © 2017, Science Press.

AB  - The nickel (Ni) and phosphotungstic acid (HPW) supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT) were prepared by impregnation method for hydroprocessing of Jatropha oil. The Ni-HPW/CNT catalyst was characterized by XRD, XPS, FT-IR, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM, NH3-TPD, and TGA. The effects of reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature (280-400°C), time-on-stream (0-100h), types of support, the amount of added HPW, and coking deposition were investigated. The cracking performance was evaluated by gas chromatography (GC). The yield of C15-C18 alkanes was 88.5wt.%, Iso/n ratio was 0.8 and conversion was 97.7% at 320°C, 3.0MPa and 1.0/h over the Ni-HPW/CNT catalyst, while the yield of &lt;C15 alkanes reached 51.9wt.% at 400°C. The distribution of products could be adjusted by reaction temperature. The cracking performance was elevated by the addition of HPW and the electrical conductivity. The C15-C18 alkanes were further cracked through two cracking circulations. Meanwhile, the catalyst was used without sulfurization and the cracking process was green. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - A principal challenge in using biomass as a replacement for petroleum has been to develop cost-competitive and sustainable processing technology. Cellulose in biomass can be converted into levulinic and formic acids through acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and dehydration, conventionally done using sulfuric acid. These products can be used as chemical feedstocks or converted to advanced biofuels. Product separation and sulfuric acid recovery are significant hurdles hindering the commercialization of the acid-catalyzed process. Hydrolysis of cellulose using α-hydroxysulfonic acids (αHSAs) presents a novel approach to simplifying acid recovery from biomass hydrolysates. We present the results of comparing six different αHSAs, including two derived from molecules produced by the hydrolysis itself, for conversion of glucose or cellulose to levulinic acid. After evaluating the six compounds for qualities of catalytic activity, thermal stability, and recyclability, we found that acetone-derived αHSA compares favorably in terms of these metrics. Highest yields of levulinic acid derived from cellulose were 40% of theoretical, achieved at conditions of 150 °C, 24 h reaction time, 3% cellulose feed, and 1.875 M acetone-derived αHSA. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable resource for production of biofuels and biochemicals. Furfural (FF) is an important platform chemical catalytically derived from the hemicellulose fraction of biomass. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) is a FF derivative and can be used as an eco-friendly solvent with thermal and chemical stability. Despite large numbers of experimental studies for catalytic conversion of FF to THFA, few research have conducted on the economic feasibility for large-scale THFA production from FF. At the stage of assessment of the potential for commercialization of conversion technology, a large-scale process study is required to identify technological bottleneck and to obtain information for solving scale-up problems. In this study, process simulation and technoeconomic evaluation for catalytic conversion of FF to THFA are performed, as the following three steps: integrated process design, heat integration, and economic evaluation. First, a large-scale process including conversion and separation processes is designed based on experimental results. When the FF processing rate is 255 tonnes per day, the FF-to-THFA yields are 63.2$67.9 mol%. After heat integration, the heating requirements are reduced by 14.4$16.4%. Finally, we analyze the cost drivers and calculate minimum selling price of THFA by economic evaluation. The minimum selling price of THFA for the developed process are $2,120$2,340 per tonne, which are close to the current THFA market price. © 2017 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - As fossil energy resources are depleting quick and energy security is playing a vital role in the world economy. Quest for alternative energy sources have turned researches investigation in waste foods for next generation fuel. Biodiesel is usually considered to be environmentally friendly as it reduces greenhouse gas emission. Fish wastes rich in fatty acids and can be used as the raw material to produce biodiesel through transesterification reaction. The results showed that the seven peaks are fatty acid methyl esters, indicating all the triglycerides were successfully methylated to methyl esters. Fish based biodiesel provided a significant reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions under engine loads of 15 (Nm) and required no engine modification. The viscosity of the produced biodiesel was within the range of international standards (ASTM). The biodiesel was found to contain a low base number and exhibited a lower specific fuel consumption compared to the conventional diesel. It can be concluded that biodiesel derived from waste fish oil can be considered as a potential source of commercial biodiesel.

AB  - The seaweeds are bio-resource rich in sulfated and neutral polysaccharides. The tropical seaweed species used in this study (Solieria filiformis), after dried, shows 65.8% (w/w) carbohydrate, 9.6% (w/w) protein, 1.7% (w/w) lipid, 7.0% (w/w) moisture and 15.9% (w/w) ash. The dried seaweed was easily hydrolyzed under mild conditions (0.5 M sulfuric acid, 20 min.), generating fermentable monosaccharides with a maximum hydrolysis efficiency of 63.21%. Galactose and glucose present in the hydrolyzed were simultaneously fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae when the yeast was acclimated to galactose and cultivated in broth containing only galactose. The kinetic parameters of the fermentation of the seaweed hydrolyzed were Y(P⁄S) = 0.48 ± 0.02 g.g−1, PP = 0.27 ± 0.04 g.L−1.h−1, η = 94.1%, representing a 41% increase in bioethanol productivity. Therefore, S. filiformis was a promising renewable resource of polysaccharides easily hydrolyzed, generating a broth rich in fermentable monosaccharides for ethanol production. © 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - A bioanode for ethanol oxidation was prepared by immobilizing the recombinant pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida KT 2440 (PpADH) with polyion complex (PIC) and redox polymer. The PIC based on poly-L-lysine (PLL) and poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA) was suitable for immobilizing PpADH on the electrode. PpADH was immobilized using only one redox polymer, aminoferrocene, which was attached to the PGA backbone (PGA-AmFc) on the electrode. The anodic current density at 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was 22.6 μA∙cm−2. However, when the number of the cycles was increased, the catalytic current drastically decreased. PpADH was immobilized using PGA-AmFc and PIC on the electrode. The anodic current density at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was 47.3 μA∙cm−2, and the performance maintained 74% of the initial value after five cycles. This result indicated that the combination of PIC and PGA-AmFc was suitable for the immobilization of PpADH on the electrode. In addition, the long-term stability and catalytic current density were improved by using the large surface area afforded by the gold nanoparticles. © 2017 by the authors; Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This work describes the development of electrochemical sensors based on graphite–polyurethane composite (GPU) modified with aluminophosphate zeolite type 5 (AlPO-5) and nickel (II) incorporated aluminophosphate type 5 (NiAlPO-5), in order to evaluate their performance for determination of Cu2+ in ethanol biofuel. These electrodes were initially characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The obtained results revealed that the NiAlPO-5 with Ni/Al ratio 0.5 presented the best response in terms of sensitivity, and peak width at half height of Cu2+ voltamogramm, which indicate that on these conditions the NiAlPO-5 electrode is viable for determination of this ion in biofuel samples by square wave stripping voltammetry. The obtained results revealed that the presence of Ni in the zeolite structure (NiAlPO-5) improves the electrical properties, and increases the peak current for Cu2+ in comparison with the electrode based in AlPO-5. The proposed method presented a linear response for Cu2+ with good results for limit of detection (9.4×10−9 mol L−1), accuracy (recovery of 115 %) and precision (RSD of 5.9 %). © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Utilization of biofuels in autoignition engines is important but it is an exciting challenge to invent technologies that will harness the unique chemico-physical characteristics of these novel fuels. This study aims to investigate combustion phases (e.g., start of combustion and autoignition duration) along with emission characteristics of a residue-based biodiesel in autoignition engines. The fuel has been successfully derived from residue of a cooking-oil production process and two blends (B10 and B20, referring to 10 and 20% in volume of the biodiesel in the biodiesel-diesel mixture, respectively) along with fossil diesel (B0) were tested in a common-rail single-cylinder engine operating under a range of speeds (1,400, 1,800, and 2,400 revolutions per minute), loads (25-100%), and injection timing conditions (16-24° before top dead center). Combustion phases were extensively analyzed employing different approaches including in-cylinder pressure derivatives, heat release rate, and engine vibration signals, while particle and NOx formation, two major issues of autoignition engines, are also investigated. Equivalent timing between local maximum and minimum values of in-cylinder pressure derivative observed for B0, B10, and B20 [1.5° of crank angle (DCA) approximately] may suggest a minimal effect of blending ratio on autoignition duration, albeit the start of combustion occurs earlier for B10 and B20 (1-2 DCA) with respect to B0. Particle concentration of B20 decreases up to 30% compared with that of its fossil counterpart, and this is one of the major benefits of utilizing biodiesel in autoignition engines. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - 4-Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) was employed in the esterification of oleic acid (OA) and the trans-esterification of oleic oil (OO) with 1-butanol as alcohol in the presence of various degrees of excess water. Under these conditions DBSA was found to be a highly active esterification catalyst regardless of excess water content, but was found to be a less effective for trans-esterification reactions. Lipophilic alcohols of differing straight and branched C3-6 chains were also tested on mixtures of OA/water (1:1) in DBSA-catalyzed esterifications; OO/water (1:1) in trans-esterifications; and OA/OO/water (1:1:1) in simultaneous esterifications and trans-esterifications. While longer straight chain alcohols generally gave a two-fold increase in yield of their corresponding alkyl oleates to 80%+, we observed a doubling from 30–50% to 60–95% of alkyl oleate yield for the OO/OA/water mixture. DBSA-catalyzed amidations of OO and methyl oleate emulsions in water were conducted with 1-butyl and 1-heptyl amine where it was found that the more lipophilic the ester moiety the higher the yield of alkyl amide. Practical applications: The practical advantages of DBSA as catalyst are high conversions to the desired product along with its tolerance to high quantities of water, emulsified within the lipid material. A capacity to transform a range of substrates with varying lipophilic character in a range of condensation reactions. In addition, we demonstrate that esterification and trans-esterification reactions could be performed simultaneous and in the presence of high quantities of water. This is of direct interest to the transformation of waste sources of lipids that often contain a mixture of triglycerides and free fatty acids in various concentrations, emulsified with waste water. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all of the value-added products/co-products can be separated by an effective and industrially relevant methodology, including recovery of the DBSA catalyst as well as the water and water soluble co-products, such as glycerol. A 4-Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) is demonstrated to be an effective polyvalent catalyst for the recovery of aqueous emulsified lipids by conversion into value-added products. DBSA proved to be a polyvalent catalyst showing high activity using a range of substrates, performing esterification, trans-esterification, and amidations reactions efficiently despite the potential detrimental presence of high water loadings. The commercial incentive of our system is the phase separation of the product mixture into the converted lipids for use as biofuels and glycerol for resale as a fine chemical. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The focus of research is shifting toward development of new engine fuels for optimized combustion systems. The altered chemical structure of these new fuels may impact their thermal decomposition chemistry during the ignition process and hence the in-cylinder conditions for particulate formation and post oxidation. This work fundamentally focuses on the influence of the fuel properties on particulate matter morphology and, thereby, the regeneration behavior of diesel particulate filters. The experiments for particulate analysis were conducted with a single-cylinder diesel research engine designed for future passenger car applications. A detailed analysis of soot characteristics and its consequences on diesel particulate filter behavior were studied at part-load engine operation at EU 6 engine-out nitrogen oxide level. Next to standard EN590 diesel, a paraffinic fuel was investigated as non-oxygenated biofuel candidate. A blend of the 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and di-n-butylether was studied as tailor-made oxygenated biomass-derived fuel candidate. With all fuels, samples of state-of-the-art diesel particulate filter were loaded at the research engine. In succession, the regeneration of the filters was investigated at a laboratory gas bench. Furthermore, the primary particle size, the total number concentration, and size-based number distribution were investigated in detail by means of a transmission electron microscope, condensation particle counter, and Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer™, respectively. Furthermore, the graphitic character of the soot structure was analyzed by optical measurements such as absorption coefficient. It was found that the soot oxidation temperature was decreased by -1/410 °C and -1/465 °C with the paraffinic fuel and the blend of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and di-n-butylether, respectively, compared to conventional diesel fuel. Overall, the results indicate that with specific tailored fuels not only the total particle mass and number could be reduced but, with altering the soot structure and composition, also the energy requirement for diesel particulate filter regeneration can be reduced. © 2016 IMechE.

AB  - The unstable components such as aldehydes, ketones and phenols in bio-oil were converted to the compounds mainly composed of ester, alcohol and ether under the oxidation of H2O2 at lower temperature. Bio-oil upgrading by mean of H2O2 oxidation and esterification, Amberlyst-36 ion exchange resin was chosen as catalyst, H2O2 was chosen as the oxidant. The physical and chemical properties of bio-oil improved significantly under conditions of 100℃, 12.5%(mass concentration)Amberlyst-36 ion exchange resin and alcohol-oil massratio of 1:1. When the acid value was reduced from 40.88 mg NaOH/g to 14.82 mg NaOH/g, the moisture content was reduced from 36.37% to 17.54%, the calorific value of the 14.46 MJ/kg was up to 25.13 MJ/kg, the viscosity from 18.49 mm2/s was reduced to 7.04 mm2/s, C element content was increased from 38.42% to 51.01%, while the oxygen element content was reduced from 52.75% to 39.86%. Compared to simple esterification upgrading, the unstable aldehydes and ketones were transformed into stable target products more efficiently under the presence of H2O2. Therefore, the target products of the ester, alcohol and ether of oxidation esterification upgraded bio-oil reached up to 84.2%, higher than esterification upgraded bio-oil which is 19.6%. The relative content of aldehydes and ketones fell to 5.12%, 4.23% less than the esterification upgraded bio-oil and the content of acids fell to 0.08%, 2.6% less than the esterification upgraded bio-oil. Water and methylene were used to the extraction and separation of oxidation esterification upgraded bio-oil to obtain high value-added sugars and their derivatives. © 2017, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared according to a modified Hummer's method, and graphene oxide aqueous solution, obtained by ultrasonic exfoliation, was then reduced by hydrothermal method to produce three-dimensional graphene (GN). The results showed that the as-prepared three-dimensional graphene material possessed a porous structure and some oxygen-containing groups disappeared after reduction. A glycerol enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) was prepared using three-dimensional GN as the carrier, and Meldola's blue as the mediator; Nafion (NF) was used to immobilize glycerol kinase (GK) and glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (GPO) to prepare the anode catalyst, and platinum on carbon was used as the cathode catalyst. The results showed that the glycerol EBFC based on the NF/GN/MB enzyme-modified carbon paper electrode had good discharge performance. The open circuit potential was 0.77 V and the maximum power density was 42.05 μW/cm2 at 0.42 V. The assembly of the glycerol EBFC and the working conditions were optimized. The performance was also evaluated using polarization curve and alternating current (AC) impedance methods. This EBFC will provide a clean and reliable energy reuse approach for the treatment of glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel in the future. © 2017, Editorial Board of Modern Food Science and Technology.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to study the anaerobic biodegradation of benzene in the presence of ethylic and methylic biodiesel. Biodiesel was produced by methanolysis and ethanolysis of virgin sunflower oil and ethanolysis of waste frying oil, and further characterized according to the European Biodiesel Standard EN 14214 for water content, fatty acid esters content, acid value, kinematic viscosity at 40°C, and oxidation stability at 110°C. Microcosms were set up in order to assess the biodegradation of the different biodiesel types and their impacts on benzene biodegradation. Methane production and benzene biodegradation were monitored for 85 days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to assess impacts on archaeal and bacterial community fingerprints. The results showed that the three types of biodiesel were readily biodegraded, even in the presence of benzene. In microcosms with only biodiesel, the highest biodegradation rate and extent was observed for sunflower methylic biodiesel followed by sunflower ethylic biodiesel and waste frying oil ethylic biodiesel. Similar results were observed in the presence of benzene. The presence of any biodiesel type negatively impacted benzene biodegradation with soybean ethylic biodiesel impacting rates the least. Microbial community fingerprint analyses showed that biodiesel composition selected distinct communities according to the alcohol employed in the transesterification reaction. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The environmental potential impacts of rice husk fast pyrolysis and upgrading in supercritical ethanol (PY-USE) system and catalytic hydrotreating system (PY-CH) were calculated and compared based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) models. The results of this work revealed that FDP, GWP, ODP, POCP and AP of the PY-CH system were lower than those of the PY-USE system, while the HTP and EP was higher than that of PY-USE system. The fossil ethanol consumed during fast pyrolysis and upgrading process and agriculture system were the main sources of the potential environmental impacts of the PY-USE and PY-CH system, respectively. It was founded that the impact of the pyrolysis fuels were lower than that of the fossil fuels for FDP, GWP and ODP, but higher for HTP, POCP, AP and EP. LCA results showed that greenhouse gas (GHG) saving of 38.83% and 45.93% for the produced fuel of PY-USE system compared to conventional gasoline and diesel, while the GHG saving of 73.50% and 76.58% for the fuel of PY-CH system. © 2017, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

AB  - Greasy agroindustrial waste from the process of cooking hog meat was used to produce biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid ethyl esters) under a specific storage condition. The operating conditions necessary to achieve the optimal relationship between quality and productivity were assessed. Next, batches of methyl and ethyl biodiesels were produced, generating 2 L of each product to evaluate their stability during 150 days of storage. The following study indicates that, for methyl route, the molar ratio (1:5) and catalyst (0.5%) yielded the best result of 90.77% (w/v) and quality parameters within the international standards. The ethyl route also showed the highest yield (77.09% w/v) and better quality parameters with a molar ratio (1:5) and catalyst (0.5%). No significant differences were observed in the methyl biodiesel obtained from the batch process for up to 45 days, while the ethyl biodiesel degraded in 30 days of storage. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Gasoline–ethanol–methanol fuel blends were formulated with the same stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio and volumetric energy concentration as any binary ethanol–gasoline blend. When the stoichiometric blends operated in a vehicle, the time period, injector voltage, and pressure for each fuel injection event in the engine corresponded to a given stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio, and the load was essentially constant. Three low oxygen content iso-stoichiometric ternary gasoline–ethanol–methanol fuel blends were prepared, and the properties were compared with regular-type fuel without added oxygen. One of the ternary fuels was tested using a fleet of in-use vehicles for15 weeks and compared to neat gasoline without oxygenated compounds as a reference. Only a small number of publications have compared these ternary fuels in the same engine, and little data exist on the performance and emissions of in-use spark-ignition engines. The total hydrocarbon emissions observed was similar in both fuels, in addition to the calculated ozone forming potential of the tailpipe and evaporative emissions. In ozone non-attainment areas, the original purpose for oxygenate gasolines was to decrease carbon monoxide emissions. The results suggest that the strategy is less effective than expected because there still exist a great number of vehicles that have suffered the progressive deterioration of emissions and do not react to oxygenation, while new vehicles are equipped with sophisticated air/fuel control systems, and oxygenation does not improve combustion because the systems adjust the stoichiometric point, making it insensitive to the origin of the added excess oxygen (fuel or excess air).

AB  - In this study, we synthesized biocatalyst consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx), polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotube (CNT) with addition of p-benzoquinone (BQ) that was considered anodic catalysts of enzymatic bio-fuel cell (EBC). For doing this, PEI/CNT supporter was bonded with BQ by physical entrapping method stemmed from electrostatic attractive force ([BQ/PEI]/CNT). In turn, GOx moiety was further immobilized on the [BQ/PEI]/CNT to form GOx/[BQ/PEI]/CNT catalyst. This catalyst has a special advantage in that the BQ that has been usually dissolved into electrolyte was immobilized on supporter. According to the electrochemical analysis, maximum current density of the GOx/[BQ/PEI]/CNT catalyst was 1.9 fold better than that of the catalyst that did not entrap BQ with the value of 34.16 μA/cm2, verifying that catalytic activity of the catalyst was enhanced by adoption of BQ. Also, when it was used as anodic catalyst of the EBC, its maximum power density was 1.2 fold better than that of EBC using the catalyst that did not entrap BQ with the value of 0.91 mW/cm. Based on such results, it turned out that the GOx/[BQ/PEI]/CNT catalyst was promising and viable as anodic catalyst of EBC.

AB  - Esterification is an industrially important reaction in the field of food and fuel industries. In biofuel and allied industries, long-chain alkyl esters are generally produced from different fat rich feedstocks including non-edible oils, acid oils, and tallow, using a variety of catalysts. Amongst these, whole cell systems have prominently been explored in recent past. The present study focused on the use of Aspergillus sp. RBD01 as a whole cell catalyst, in dry and whole cell suspension, to esterify oleic acid with different alcohols as acyl acceptors. Esterification with dried biomass resulted in better conversion of oleic acid to its respective ester as compared to cell suspension. Further, increase in chain length of alcohol resulted in decrease in the yield from ethyl oleate (98% EO) to decyl oleate (77% DO) with alcohols having an even number of carbon atoms giving better yield of esters over alcohols with odd numbers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The influence of reaction pressure, reaction time, reaction temperature, and biomass-to-water mass ratio R on the conversion of miscanthus biomass to biofuels under sub- and supercritical water (SCW) conditions was investigated. The highest total conversion was obtained under SCW conditions and the heating value increased under subcritical and SCW conditions. The findings herein show that near-supercritical and supercritical water at 400 °C and high pressure can be an effective reaction medium for converting biomass to oils with relatively low oxygen contents in high yields. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of the purification process on the stability of Jatropha curcas biodiesel. The biodiesel was obtained using a variety of purification processes: three wet methods with different drying processes (vacuum oven, conventional oven and anhydrous sodium sulfate) and one dry method (purification with adsorbent magnesium silicate). Biodiesel was characterized through the analysis of carbon residue, acidity index, infrared and gas chromatography. The composition J. curcas oil indicated 56.3 % of unsaturated fatty acids and 43.7 % of saturated fatty acids. Jatropha oil presented high quantity of saturated acids, which are less susceptible at oxidation. The biodiesel sample that was chemically purified (PUsq) presented better purity, indicating be the process more efficient in remove the residues of synthesis. Thermogravimetric curves of purified biodiesel by wet method, PUsq, with chemical drying using anhydrous sodium sulfate, and PUsv, with vacuum drying, showed the highest initial decomposition temperatures, indicating higher thermal stability. The carbon residue and infrared analyses suggested that contamination by catalyst residue is a determining factor in reduction of the oxidative stability of biodiesel. The oxidative stability was evaluated using Rancimat and pressure differential scanning calorimetry. Biodiesel samples showing better oxidative stability were purified using PUsq and PUsv, which obtained stability of 6 h using the Rancimat technique, the minimum limit set by Brazilian legislation, without the addition of antioxidant, suggesting that these methods least influenced the stability of biodiesel. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - A hybrid CeO2-based biocatalytic nanostructure carrying catalytically active oxygen-rich nanoparticles is described as a general platform for laccase (Lac)-based biocathodes and biofuel cells. To design the bioelectrodes, the particles and the enzyme were deposited on reduced graphene or carbon nanotube-based buckypaper using conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene-sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS). The use of CeO2 into the biocatalytic layer enhanced the bioelectrocatalytic reduction current and enabled functionality of the bioelectrode and biofuel cell in oxygen-limited conditions. These results open up new avenues for designing biointerfaces for protecting activity of immobilized enzymes and providing functionality in oxygen-limited environments. The hybrid nanostructure described in this work may be used as a general platform for the immobilization of other enzymes for a variety of biosensing, biofuel cells and bioelectronics applications. © 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel is being promoted worldwide as a sustainable and alternative to diesel fuel. However, there is still a lack of a biodiesel market in Mexico. Hence, a new initiative to reform the Mexican biofuels framework by decree includes the production and use of biodiesel. This regulation can ensure and contribute to the development of the biodiesel market in Mexico. The initiative proposes to start from the B5.8 blend by the end of 2017 and reach the B10 by 2020. Therefore, the objective of the present work was the quality assessment of biodiesel blends proposed by the new Mexican policy framework. The techniques applied were Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence analysis, scanning electron microscopy analysis, viscosity, higher heating value, thermogravimetric analysis, refractive index, acid number, specific gravity, flash point, and copper strip corrosion based on ASTM standards. The results indicate that the biodiesel and its blends B5.8 and B10 fulfilled relevant quality specifications established in the ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards for fuels. However, the fuel blends presented a higher heating value (HHV) diminution. The experimental HHV percentages decrease for the mandatory mixtures compared to diesel were 2.29% (B10), and 0.29% (B5.8). © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - To produce high yield and quality hydrocarbon biofuel, HZSM-5 zeolite loaded with different Zn concentrations (5, 10, 15 and 20wt.%) was used to palm oil cracking in batch reactor. Reaction temperature and reaction time were optimized. The products contained liquid hydrocarbon biofuel, distillation residual and coke. The physical properties of biofuel products were determined. The results presented that 15% Zn/HZSM-5 exhibited higher hydrocarbon biofuel yield (20.27%) and their excellent product properties with higher heating value (HHV), low viscosity and moisture content. A highest hydrocarbon biofuel yield and good alkane range hydrocarbons distribution from palm oil were obtained under reaction temperature of 420°C for 5 hours. © 2017, Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - In this research, biodiesel from karanja (Pongamia pinnata) oil was produced by transesterification process. Fuel properties of KBD, KBD with 4% DEE and KBD with 8% DEE were tested and compared with mineral diesel fuel. Additive DEE 4% and 8% was added in karanja biodiesel to improve the fuel properties. Electric generator set was fuelled with KBD, KBD with 4% DEE and KBD with 8% DEE operated at 1.5 kW, 3 kW and 5 kW load and performance was compared with mineral diesel fuel. Research revealed that in electric generator set increasing trend of overall efficiency and decreasing in BSFC were observed when 4% and 8% DEE was added in karanja biodiesel under different load conditions. A decreasing trend in CO and CO2 emission of electric generator set was recorded when 4% and 8% DEE added in KBD as compared to pure KBD under different load conditions. NOx emission of electric generator set increases by adding 4% and 8% DEE in KBD at different load conditions. It is concluded that the overall efficiency of electric generator set improves, and exhaust emission reduces by adding additives in karanja biodiesel. Karanja biodiesel with additive 8% DEE is recommended as a substitute of mineral diesel for electric generator set.

AB  - The kinetic of catalytic upgrading of anisole as a lignin-derived bio-oil component is investigated experimentally over Pt/γAl2O3 at 573-673 K and 14 bar. According to experimental results, benzene, phenol, 2-methylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol, and hexamethylbenzene are identified as the main products. The results indicated that the kinetically significant reaction classes are hydrogenolysis, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), alkylation, and hydrogenation. The response surface methodology (RSM) is applied to optimize the experimental data which obtained at suggested conditions by design of experiment (DOE). Due to the complex nature of the system, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed as an efficient tool to model the behavior of the system. RSM and ANN methods were constructed based upon the DOE's points and then utilized for generating extra-simulated data. Data simulated by the RSM/ANN method were used to fit power law kinetic rate expressions for the reactions. The coefficient of determination (R2) was obtained 0.998 and 0.973 for anisole conversion model and benzene selectivity model which represented the high accuracy of model predictions. The correlation coefficient (R) and mean square error (MSE) of ANN model equaled to 0.97 and 8.3 × 10-12 respectively means high accuracy of the developed model. The results of kinetic modeling with simulated data from the ANN and RSM models revealed that the highest reaction order during the upgrading process of anisole belongs to hydrogenolysis of anisole to phenol. Also the activation energy of hydrogenolysis reaction was lower than HDO. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.

AB  - The operating conditions for the catalytic conversion of residual crude palm oil from empty fruit bunch to diesel-like biofuels were optimized to determine and characterize the liquid product to define its properties as a diesel-like fuel for further use a renewable fuel and value-added chemical in industry. A 2-level factorial experimental design and statistical methods were applied together with a statistical mathematical model to predict the optimal conditions that maximize the yield and diesel-like product distribution. The response surface methodology, which is a statistical model used to conduct multiple regression analysis, was used to identify the appropriate multivariable equations in the experimental design. The optimal temperature contributed to the breakdown of triglyceride fatty acids due to secondary cracking reactions similar to those that produce diesel fuel due to the high efficiency and selectivity of the MgO catalyst.

AB  - Jatropha curcas cake, a by-product of biodiesel production, is rich in protein and has potential to be used in livestock feed; however, the presence of antinutritional factors and phorbol esters limits its use. Thus, this study investigated toxicological and reproductive effects in male Wistar rats after subchronic exposure to J. curcas cake subjected to detoxification procedures. Rats were divided into seven groups (n=10) and treated for 60 days. The control group received commercial feed, while experimental groups received a diet containing 5% J. curcas cake nonhydrolyzed or hydrolyzed with 5 M NaOH. The cakes were unwashed or washed with ethanol or water and were autoclaved at 121°C for 30 minutes. Alkaline hydrolysis combined with ethanol washing decreased the phorbol ester concentration in the cake by 98%. Histopathological findings included diffuse degeneration of the liver and edema around the pulmonary vessels in the nonhydrolyzed groups. In addition, nontreated females mated with males of nonhydrolyzed unwashed group showed a decreased number of live fetuses and an increased placental weight. There were no signs of toxicity in rats given hydrolyzed cakes washed and unwashed, indicating that alkaline hydrolysis associated with heat treatment is an efficient method for detoxification of the J. curcas cake.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine changes in the porosity and internal structure of wood as it goes through the process of saccharification (extraction of fermentable sugars). This study also examined the use of different drying methods to prepare samples for characterization of internal pores, with particular emphasis on the partially disrupted cell wall. Aspen wood flour samples after dilute acid pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis were examined for nitrogen adsorption. The resulting isotherms were analyzed for surface area, pore size distribution, and total pore volume. Results showed that freeze drying (with sample pre-freezing) maintains the cell wall structure, allowing for examination of saccharification effects. Acid pretreatment (hemicellulose removal) doubled the surface area and tripled the total volume of pores, which were mostly 10-20 nm wide. Subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis (cellulose removal) caused a 5-fold increase in the surface area and a ∼ 11-fold increase in the total volume of pores, which ranged from 5 to 100 nm in width. These results indicate that nitrogen adsorption analysis is a feasible technique to examine the internal pore structure of lignocellulosic residues after saccharification. The information on the pore structure will be useful when considering value-adding options for utilizing the solid waste for biofuel production.

AB  - Domestic sewage sludge is a potential raw material to produce energy in the form of renewable biofuels (biodiesel) due to the high amount of lipid content in the sludge. Soxhlet extraction is commonly used in extracting lipid from primary sewage sludge. Different solvents and extraction parameters in Soxhlet extraction may affect the lipid yield. Hexane, methanol and toluene were evaluated in extracting lipids from primary sewage sludge. Methanol was identified as the most suitable solvent to be used in lipid extraction due to its high polarity. Extraction parameters such as temperature, extraction time, and sludge-To-solvent ratio were investigated in order to optimise the lipid extraction process from primary sewage sludge. The extracted lipid yield was observed to be optimum at 40.21 wt% when the temperature and extraction time were at 86 °C and 7.45 h. A sludge-To-solvent ratio of 2:1 was determined to be the optimum value in extracting lipid yield. The optimisation process was conducted using response surface methodology (RSM) and was analysed using ANOVA with R2 of 0.8146 for lipid concentration. The analysis of free fatty acid content in the lipid extracted from primary sewage sludge revealed that the composition of free fatty acid was dominated by monounsaturated oleic acid.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of pyrolysis bio-oil produced from cork oak was carried out in supercritical ethanol. Three typical HDO catalysts Pt/Al2O3, Ni/HY, and Pd/Carbon were used. In order to compare the characteristics of raw bio-oil and catalytically reformed HDO oil, the measurement of pH, water content, and viscosity as well as elemental and composition analyses were conducted. The aging assessment based on acids content and higher heating value was performed to evaluate the stability of oils as fuel. The order of stability of the HDO oils was Pt/Al2O3 &gt; Pd/Carbon &gt; Ni/HY. In particular, the HDO oil obtained using Al2O3 catalyst was affected little by aging.

AB  - In this work, correlations between the physicochemical parameters (density and kinematic viscosity) and the composition of various samples, obtained during the biodiesel production process of methylic and ethylic soybean biodiesel, were investigated. The results point out that the composition of the medium in terms of remaining catalyst and its residues, alcohol and water content, among others variables, has no significant influence on the physicochemical properties studied. These findings are mainly influenced by the composition of the medium in terms of FAAE, TAG, DAG and MAG. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: A new treatment has been demonstrated for urea to synthesis solid-state form of urea sulfate onto silica extracted from rice husk ash via 3-(chloropropyl)triethoxysiline. The 3-(chloropropyl)triethoxysilane was immobilized onto silica at room temperature to functionalize the silica with chloride end groups. The chloride groups were reacted with urea by a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The resulting silica with urea (which had amine end groups) was sulfated with diluted sulfuric acid to produce a novel solid state form catalyst designated RHAUR-SO4H (RHA = rice husk ash). The XPS, EDX and CHNS analysis show that the expected elements were presents in RHAUR-SO4H. The FT-IR spectrum showed the presence of absorption bands attributed to the +NH3 and O=S=O ions groups which confirmed the results were coming from elemental analysis. The TGA\DSC analysis shows that the catalyst is stable at temperatures below 185 °C. Cellulose was hydrolyzed to glucose over RHAUR-SO4H in 2 h, and the glucose was hydrolyzed afterwards to other products within 7 h using a mixture of cyclohexanol\LiCl as a novel solvent system. The catalyst is reusable without a significant loss of catalytic activity. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Influence of catalyst calcination temperature on the catalyst characteristics and catalytic transesterification of Jatropha curcas oil for biodiesel production was studied by using sodium zirconate (Na2ZrO3) solid base catalyst. Na2ZrO3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method followed by calcination at temperatures of 700, 800, and 900°C. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Important parameters influencing the catalytic activity and fatty acid methyl ester yield were investigated. It was found that the increase in calcination temperature showed marked increase in activity due to the increased porosity and presence of tetragonal zirconia. Investigation of the reusability of the catalysts showed that the catalytic activity was retained even after five cycles of reaction. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Bioethanol is the most important biofuel produced by fermentation of sugars from various biomass types. The main disadvantages associated to this process consist in the negative effect of high ethanol concentration on the cell growth and in the separation cost of ethanol-Water system resulted in the fermentation process. Sugar fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast coupled with bioethanol recovery by pervaporation has been modeled and simulated in this paper. In order to avoid the clogging of pervaporation membrane, the yeast cells were previously retained into an ultrafiltration unit. Three operating modes were analyzed and compared, i.e., classical batch fermentation (BF), batch fermentation coupled with external ultrafiltration and pervaporation (BFPV), and fed batch fermentation coupled with external ultrafiltration and pervaporation (FBFPV). Surface areas of ultrafiltration and pervaporation units were selected as process control variables.

AB  - The unprecedented use of fossil fuels necessitates the research community to find clean, safe, renewable and sustainable energy source. One such promising source is microalgal biofuel, which can mitigate the environmental concerns and energy crisis due to its closed carbon cycle. Selection of proper strain and optimization of the culture conditions to maximize the lipid productivity is very important for successful economical biodiesel conversion process. One such robust halophilic species identified was Aphanothece halophytica with rich lipid productivity. They were cultivated in different media and optimized on lab scale as well as in large scale using raceway ponds to produce sufficient biomass for algal oil extraction. The biodiesel conversion process parameters were then optimized by multi-variant response surface methodology (RSM). The free fatty acid (FFA) content of the raw algal oil was only 0.51% which enables direct conversion by transesterification. Eco-friendly, natural white clam shell was calcinated to obtain CaO, which was recovered and reused for three times effectively. The maximum biodiesel yield of around 99 vol% was obtained for the oil/methanol ratio of 0.32(v/v) using calcinated CaO for 6 wt% of raw feed while stirring at 400 rpm at a temperature of 70 °C for 85 min. The GC–MS analysis of the algal biodiesel confirmed the presence of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in balanced proportion to provide better oxidation stability and good combustion characteristics. Other biodiesel properties were analyzed and found to be within the standards specified by EN and ASTM for automotive application without any engine modification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Interest in high-energy substituted furans has been increasing due to their occurrence in biofuel production and their versatility in conversion to other useful products. Methylfurans are the simplest substituted furans and understanding their reaction pathways, thermochemical properties, including intermediate species stability, and chemical kinetics would aid in the study of larger furans. Furan ring C-H bonds have been shown to be extremely strong, approximately 120 kcal mol-1, due in part to the placement of the oxygen atom and aromatic-like resonance, both within the ring. The thermochemistry and kinetics of the oxidation of 2-methyfuran radical at position 5 of the furan ring, 2-methyl-5-furanyl radical (2MF5j), is analyzed. The resulting chemically activated species, 2MF5OOj radical, has a well depth of 51 kcal mol-1 below the 2MF5j + O2 reactants; this is 4-5 kcal mol-1 deeper than that of phenyl and vinyl radical plus O2, with both of these reactions known to undergo chain branching. Important, low-energy reaction pathways include chain branching dissociations, intramolecular abstractions, group transfers, and radical oxygen additions. Enthalpies of formation, entropies, and heat capacities for the stable molecules, radicals, and transition-state species are analyzed using computational methods. Calculated ΔH°f 298 values were determined using an isodesmic work reaction from the CBS-QB3 composite method. Elementary rate parameters are from saddle point transition-state structures and compared to variational transition-state analysis for the barrierless reactions. Temperature- and pressure-dependent rate constants which are calculated using QRRK and master equation analysis is used for falloff and stabilization. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Rapid catalytic thermal conversion of Physic nut (Jatropha curcas) residues for upgrading the released vapors was performed using analytical pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry at 873 K. Conditioning of the evolved vapor product is required since the main vapor products formed without catalysts typically contained around 60% fatty acids, while the total hydrocarbon yields were only 12%. Catalysts tested were alumina (Al2O3) alone and modified by 5 wt% impregnation with various transition metal salts and then calcined to metal oxides. A significant decrease in the proportion of oxygenated compounds (including acids) from 73% without a catalyst to less than 10% with, and an increased conversion to hydrocarbons of more than 70% was obtained with the metal/Al2O3 catalysts at a Jatropha:catalyst (J:C) ratio of 1:10. The product selectivity was greatly increased as the J:C ratio was increased from 1:1 to 1:10. The total hydrocarbon selectivity of the metal/Al2O3 catalysts was increased in the order of Pd &gt; Ni &gt; Ce &gt; Ru &gt; La &gt; none &gt; Co &gt; Mo, with the highest proportion of total hydrocarbons obtained being 75%. In addition, only a low yield (&lt;2%) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was obtained from the conversion of Jatropha curcas residues. However, these catalysts adversely promoted N-containing compounds, suggesting that a further denitrogenation process is necessary. Nevertheless, the overall performance of these transition metal/Al2O3 catalysts is acceptable and they can be considered as good candidates for bio-oil upgrading. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Bio fuels such as biogas and biodiesel attract increasing attention all over the world as a substitute or mixture for fossil fuels in automobiles. Transesterification is the process that is used for producing biodiesel which is accepted worldwide because of its efficiency. Transesterification is the process done for decreasing the viscosity of the vegetable oil. In this paper, we have used Transesterification of cottonseed oil to produce biodiesel. The cost of production of one liter of biodiesel from cottonseed oil is thrice the cost of the diesel per liter. The byproducts of Transesterification process are glycerol and methyl ester water-wash. Both of the byproducts are good source of Methanol content which can easily be converted into methane gas or Biogas (CH4). Also, the cottonseed from which the oil is extracted can be used for producing biogas. In this paper, the laboratory experiments for Integrating Biodiesel and Biogas Plants are studied quantitatively in detail. By integrating both biodiesel and biogas plant, it is a way of reducing the cost of biodiesel which can boost the use of biodiesel in future. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Switchgrass harvested from saline soil was slowly pyrolyzed at 300, 500, and 700 °C in a fixed-bed reactor. The objective was to understand the characteristics and evaluate the potential values of the bio-oil, syngas, and biochar. The biochar yield (27.0% to 41.3%) decreased with increasing temperature, whereas the syngas yield (26.3% to 40.9%) increased. The bio-oil yield (30.8% to 34.1%) was highest when the switchgrass was pyrolyzed at 500 °C. Both the bio-oil and syngas had low value as direct fuels because of their low heating values. Compared with the biochars from the switchgrass grown in "sweet" soil, the biochars derived from the switchgrass grown in saline soil had higher values of ash (10.5% to 17.2%), mineral nutrients, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (200.3 to 241.1 cmol/kg). These results suggested that the biochar generated in this study might have a better liming effect and improvement of soil fertility and crop growth as a soil conditioner, and lead to double wins in saline soil improvement and a new approach for switchgrass utilization.

AB  - This work focused on the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of oil palm pressed fiber for the production of valuable products, over the reaction temperature (140 to 200 °C), time (1 to 4 h), and biomass to water content (BTW) (1:5 to 1:15). Reaction temperature was a vital key parameter on fuel properties of hydrochar. The combustibility of hydrochar reflected by fuel ratio increased from 0.42 at 140 °C to 0.54 at 200 °C. O/C and H/C atomic ratio decreased from 0.56 and 1.54 to 0.37 and 1.28, respectively, which corresponded to an increase in the estimated HHV from 21.0 to 24.6 MJ/kg. Hydrochar yield decreased from 78.4 to 61.7%. These phenomena were associated with hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation, aromatization, and recondensation reactions. The reaction time and BTW affected slightly the yield and fuel properties of hydrochar. The valuable dissolved organic chemical species in the obtained liquid fraction were furfuryl alcohol, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, and formic acid with the maximum yields of 6.95, 2.05, 0.64, 6.91, 4.75, 4.11 and 2.64 wt.% dry raw material, respectively.

AB  - Injection parameters are known to impact most on diesel engine emissions and performance but there is little work in literature regarding the effect of injection parameters on biodiesel engine performance. Studies of the effect of injection timing and pressure on emissions and brake specific consumption has been carried out on a 48 kW, VW Polo, MK3, four-cylinder, four-stroke, indirect injection engine which is naturally aspirated and air cooled. Engine modifications were carried out for each fuel used except petroleum diesel. The input factors for the modification include injection timing only, injection pressure only and their effects on brake specific energy consumption and exhaust emissions particularly carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. Injection timing was varied at six levels including advance of 7°, 5°, 3°, 0° settings and retardation settings of 3° and 5°. Nozzle injection pressures were varied at 150, 175, 200, 225 and 250 bars. Generally, injection advance led to significantly lower hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions because there was ample time for combustion to reach completion. Though not significant, higher nozzle pressures accounted for lower emissions except NOx. Injection timing was found to have the most profound effect on engine emissions and brake specific energy consumption. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A response surface methodology was used to study the reaction mechanism of strontium oxide (SrO) as a catalyst for a biodiesel production process using a model oil (composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides). The influence of several factors (initial FAME content (0–30 wt%), initial FFAs content (oleic acid 0.20–2.7 wt%), temperature (40–60 °C), methanol to model oil ratio (11–43 wt%), catalyst to model oil ratio (0.5–2.5 wt%) and reaction time (5–30 min)) on the FAME yield, the FAME content, the pH of polar phase and the biodiesel alkalinity was studied. SrO was also compared with potassium hydroxide (KOH) for the conversion of Scenedesmus Obliquus microalgae esterified lipids after a first step of FFAs esterification with sulfuric acid into biodiesel with the following conditions: temperature: 60 °C; reaction time: 22.2 min; catalyst to microalgae ratio: 2.48 wt%; methanol to microalgae lipid ratio: 31.4 wt%. RESULTS: With those operating conditions, KOH was able to reach a slightly higher FAME yield (32.6% g FAME g−1 lipid) than SrO (29.0% g FAME g−1 lipid). Moreover, the results showed a strong relationship between the pH of the polar phase (glycerol–methanol–water) and the FAME yield, which indicates that the reaction using alkaline metal earths is mostly catalyzed by a homogeneous reaction. CONCLUSION: The fact that alkaline metal earths act as homogeneous catalysts make them less suitable for biodiesel production, because they are not inducing neutral pH, and they increase the risk of corrosion. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - A feasibility study on utilization of non edible oil of Scleropyrum pentandrum was carried out to see its potential as a new source for biodiesel production. Nonedible oil seeds of Scleropyrum pentandrum have oil content of 55–60%. Transesterification of freshly extracted oil in the presence of anhydrous sodium hydroxide at a concentration 1% (w/v oil) and methanol-oil ratio of 40% (v/v oil) yields 90.8% methyl esters under conventional heating. Month old oil requires sulfuric acid pretreatment (esterification) before transesterification. The transesterified oil has a density 889–893 kg/m3; kinematic viscosity of 4.21–5.7 mm2/s; cetane index 46.03; pour point of −15°C and gross calorific value of 40.135 MJ/kg and oxidative stability of 2.35 hours. The properties are well within the Indian, European and American standard limits recommended for biodiesel except the oxidation stability, which can be improved by adding antioxidant additives. The engine performance studies of B10 and B20 blends of Scleropyrum pentandrum biodiesel (SP biodiesel) with statistical inference confirmed that it can be used as a fuel in CI engines without any engine modifications. The engine exhaust emission analysis showed that the emission of hydrocarbons can be minimized by at least 15–20%, CO emission by 15%, smoke opacity by 10–12% and moderately lesser CO2 and NOx emissions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The lipid content of tannery fleshing waste is remarkable and it is essential to develop an efficient process for extraction of lipids as a source for biofuel application. A protease assisted method was developed for the extraction of lipids from tannery fleshing waste using Bacillus subtilis MTCC 6537 protease. The lipid yield was 14.96%, when extraction was carried out with 100 g of fleshings and 300 U of protease at 40 °C for 60 min. This yield was 23.12, 36.5 and 43.18% higher than the lipids extracted by thermal hydrolysis, Soxhlet extraction and Bligh & Dyer method, respectively. There was no significant difference in the yield of lipids with 1 kg of fleshings under above conditions. Moreover, the solvent consumption was reduced in the enzymatic method by 1.9–7 times towards production of 1 kg of lipids and reusage of solvents for subsequent batches of extraction makes the process green. The enzymatic method is also industrially viable due to increased lipid yield and mild reaction conditions, although the energy requirement was comparatively higher than Bligh & Dyer method. Physicochemical characteristics of lipids reveal that it could be a feasible and potential feedstock for biodiesel production. The extracted lipids were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The results on gas chromatographic analysis showed that fleshings lipids contained palmitic acid (26.46%), stearic acid (17.25%), oleic and linoleic acid (47.10%), which are mainly involved in the production of alkyl esters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A β-glucosidase (BG), PaBG1b, from the xylophagous cockroach Panesthia angustipennis spadica was heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, purified, and biochemically characterized. Post-translational modification and N-terminal sequencing analysis demonstrated that the expression product was comprised of two polypeptides with different N-terminal sequences, presumably due to the presence of lysine-arginine (KR) sequence in the putative mature region. Substrate specificity analysis showed that PaBG1b hydrolyzed a broad range of substrates including cellohexaose, with the preference for aryl β-D-fucosyl linkage and laminaribiose. Although the glucose tolerance of PaBG1b was moderate (Ki = 200.3 ± 1.1 mM), PaBG1b demonstrated high specific activity and catalytic efficiency towards cellobiose with Vmax and kcat/Km values of 436.7 ± 6.3 U/mg and 109.8 mM−1 s−1, respectively. In addition, PaBG1b was not inhibited by cellobiose up to the highest concentration tested (100 mM). Collectively, our work demonstrates that PaBG1b is a potentially valuable BG for commercial bioethanol production from cellulose. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Given the increasing number of cases of water eutrophication and large quantities of naturally grown algae, this study collected algae for bioethanol production from a; eutrophic water body. The compositions of alga biomass collected from the eutrophic; water body are more complicated than pure culture. The saccharification technique is; also different from conventional. This study applied an electrocoagulation/flotation (ECF) system to recycle eutrophic algae. After pretreatment processes, this study investigated three types of algal biomass to determine the optimal conditions for acid saccharification: Al-containing algal biomass (S1), Fe-containing algal biomass (S2), and raw algal biomass (S3). The results revealed that S1 and S3 attained the highest reducing sugar yields after a 30-min reaction under the following conditions: sulfuric acid concentration = 6% (V/V), liquid–solid ratio (LSR) = 26, and temperature = 120 °C. The maximum reducing sugar yield from S2 occurred at an LSR of 22, yielding up to 156 mg glucose/g and achieving a xylose yield that is twice higher than the glucose yield. Therefore, adopting an ECF system with an Fe electrode for recycling algae advances current research on the saccharification of algae. Recently, the proposed technique has been approved as a new patent by Taiwan Government. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three depressants were added (1-15% by mass) to 18 biofu-els made by transesterification of frying and animal fats studied then for cold filter plugging points. The temps, decreased with increasing contents of the depressants in the range from -14°C to 18°C depending on the biofuel but the use of depressants did not have any significant effect on the biodiesels.

AB  - This paper aims at investigating the effect of parameters like load and blend on the performance and emission characteristics of a CI engine fueled with Mahua oil. By varying the two input parameters, the performance responses such as Brake thermal efficiency, Brake specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature and emission responses such as NOx emissions were investigated. Though biodiesel helps in better fuel consumption due to enhanced CO2, negative impact like increased NOx emissions occurs. Hence optimization of biofuel content is important. Optimization of these input variables were performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), a statistical tool in Design of Experiments(DoE). The desirability approach was used for this optimization. Experimental validation of the optimized results was done. The performance parameters for different Mahua oil blends were found near to diesel with a slight rise in NOx emissions. The RSM study revealed that at the optimum input parameters, the values of BTE, BSFC, EGT and NOx are 31%, 0.26kg/kW-hr, 348°C and 749 ppm respectively. The optimum input parameters for the blend with diesel are B20 and 4.32 kW. The interaction between the input parameters are best understood by this statistical tool.

AB  - The main drivers to develop biorefineries are the energetic and environmental crisis. Consequently, bioenergies have become a scientific and industrial trend. In North Africa, especially in Tunisia, Luffa cylindrica (LC) is a promising energy crop providing lignocellulosic biomass for biofuels production. Three principal fractions compose LC biomass, viz.: α-cellulose (45.8 ± 1.3)%, hemicellulose (20.76 ± 0.3)% and lignins (13.15 ± 0.6)%. The hydrothermal pretreatment of LC fibers was carried out at 96 °C for 54 min. After pretreatment, the reducing sugars amount reached 33.55 g/kg. The subsequent enzymatic saccharification was performed during 1 h at a temperature of 60 °C, by means of two commercial enzymes AP2 and SPC. The enzyme AP2 seemed to be more suitable for the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated LC fibers by allowing the release of 59.4 g/kg of reducing sugars, which correspond to a reducing sugars recovery about 93.29%. After that, the liquid state fermentation (LSF) was achieved with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain during 24 h, in sterile and non-sterile conditions at 30 °C, pH 4.8 ± 0.2 and stirring 250 rpm, in order to conclude about the influence of contamination microflora on fermentation efficiency. After the LSF step, 88.66% of reducing sugars were transformed into alcohol with a conversion rate of 1.58% and a volumetric yield about 70% in sterile conditions. Thus, this work confirms that the potential conversion yield of cellulosic bioethanol is 1 Ton (dry matter) of LC fibers to 13.8545 kg (= 3.6599 Gallon) of biofuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - C9-C25 oxygen-containing compounds formed via the condensation reaction of furfuryl alcohol(FA) can be used as fuel intermediates for the production of bio-fuel. In this paper, the condensation reaction of FA was carried on over sulfuric acid catalyst in a batch aqueous phase reactor, in which the produced oligomers were separated from aqueous reaction system automatically before they went on further to form polymers. Reaction kinetics experiments showed that the values of reaction order of FA and sulfuric acid all were 1. The molecular structure and content of short chain-length oligomers B (C9-C25) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography (GC) respectively. The molecular weight of FA condensate was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). According to the information provided by GC/MS and GPC, we revealed that two polymerization mechanisms, step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization, coexist in FA condensation reaction process in aqueous system. A simplified kinetics model based on the present mechanisms was established, and condensation products were divided into short chain-length oligomers B (C9-C25) and long chain-length oligomers C (&gt;C25). © 2017

AB  - A mixture of vegetable oil and animal fat as raw materials was optimized by simplexcentroid mixture design to produce a type of biodiesel with good oxidative stability, flow properties and reaction yield. Further, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of oxidation reaction were determined by the accelerated method at different temperatures. Biodiesel produced with sodium methoxide as catalyst presented 6.5°C of cloud point, 2.0°C of pour point, and oxidative stability at 110°C equal to 8.98h, with a reaction yield of 96.04%. Activation energy of the oxidation reaction was 81.03 kJ mol-1 for biodiesel produced with sodium hydroxide and 90.51 kJ mol-1 for sodium methoxide. The positive values for ΔH‡ and ΔG‡ indicate that the oxidation process is endothermic and endergonic. The less negative ΔS‡ for biodiesel produced with sodium methoxide (-28.87 JK-1 mol-1) showed that the process of degradation of this biofuel was slower than that produced with NaOH. The mixture of raw materials proposed, transesterified with the methoxide catalyst, resulted in a biofuel that resisted oxidation for longer periods, making unnecessary the addition of antioxidant © 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Non-forage crop residues like rice straw are among the most important and pertinent renewable biomass available for utilization for producing biofuels, specialty chemicals, aromatics etc. Recovery of cellulose from them and its processing for products are two key steps of value addition to these materials that are available in abundance. Of these, rice straw is perhaps the most recalcitrant of all. In this study, production of cellulose triacetate (CTA) from cellulose by three different (alternate) practical methods are reported. It has been demonstrated that cellulose in the form of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), other celluloses commercially available from chemical suppliers, cotton linters, and rice straw as such (directly after powdering) are suitable as substrates for the reaction. The methods make use of either acetic acid, acetyl chloride or isopropenyl acetate (IPA) as the acetyl donor in the presence of methane sulfonic acid (a cheap and green reagent) as the acid catalyst. The conventional acetyl donor agent, acetic anhydride is also a suitable alternative reagent for the purpose. The post-reaction work-up procedure involves neutralization and filtration as the only two simple successive steps. The processes reported thus eliminate the need for using restricted/toxic chemicals (acetic anhydride and pyridine, respectively) and provide cellulose tri-O-acetate of high purity in excellent yields. Preparation of CTA directly from rice straw has been achieved in >70% yield, representing acetylation of the straw cellulose into its triacetate to an extent of 90%. With IPA as the acyl donor, acetone was a valuable and recoverable co-product. Although not demonstrated in this study, the residue from the acetylation reaction can be utilized for the recovery of value-added materials such as fine silica. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - To sustainably meet the global energy demand, unconventional methods to produce renewable energy must emerge. Biofuels from cellulose (via fermentable sugar production) mediated via photocatalysis provides an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. In order to effectively drive photocatalytic processes an effective reactor design is required, the design of which is influenced by a number of key factors such as the catalyst to reactant ratio and residence time, catalyst illumination time, light penetration and distribution for the system, mass transfer limitations (mixing) and product recovery. In this study we use COMSOL Multiphysics® to simulate and assess one of the mentioned parameters – mixing regime of cellulose particles in a Stacked Frame Photocatalysis Reactor (SFPR). In the reactor design, we compare two mixers: a ‘plus’ shaped magnetic stirrer bar and an 8 blade Rushton impeller. The simulations reveal that the Rushton impeller offers a radial mixing pattern with a higher fluid velocity of 1.2 m/s when compared to the stirrer bar that offers a fluid velocity of 0.9 m/s. Cellulose particle tracing simulations confirm that the particle dispersion is superior in the case of the Rushton impeller as the vorticity generated during the mixing push the particles to the reactor's walls. Since the particles are forced towards the walls, there is a probability of more particles being illuminated than in the case of no or improper mixing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The life style and biology of dung beetles offer a significant opportunity for innovation in biofuel production. The larvae of the African dung beetle, Euoniticellus intermedius, feed solely on cow dung, eating and digesting the fibre while adults live on juices found in fresh dung. The larval gut system consists of a small, almost unrecognizable foregut and two distinct chambers; the midgut and hindgut. It is clear that these two chambers are the centres in which the dung material whose composition includes cellulose is processed. The goal of this study was to assess the cellulolytic activities of cultured gut micro-flora derived from E. intermedius, (Coleoptera: Scarabaeida). Method: Late second to third instar stage E. intermedius larvae were dissected and the isolated gut micro-flora consortia aerobically cultured in media containing cellulose (filter paper) as the sole carbon source. Genomic DNA isolation was done on the gut consortia cultures after 10 days of culturing, using the ZR Fungal/Bacterial DNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, USA). A complete and unbiased primary cosmid library was then constructed from the isolated genomic DNA using a cloning ready, pWEB-TNC™ Cosmid Cloning kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, USA). The primary cosmid library clones were screened for endo-glucanase and cellobiohydrolase activities using Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) and 4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-D-Cellobioside (MUC) plate assays respectively. Results: Results indicate that a total of 7 colonies out of 160 screened colonies showed positive CMC and MUC activities. Conclusion: This proves that E. intermedius is a potential source of cellulolytic micro-organisms and enzymes that can be used for cellulose derived biofuel production. © 2017 Munamato Mabhegedhe.

AB  - Volatile organic compound (VOC) production from an endophytic fungus was quantified at four oxygen concentrations (0, 1, 13 and 21 %) throughout culture growth phases. The filamentous fungus, a Nodulisporium sp. (designated TI-13), was grown in a solid-state reactor with an agricultural byproduct, beet pulp, as the solid substrate. The VOCs, with potential applications as biofuels, natural flavour compounds and bioactive mixtures, were measured with a recently introduced platinum catalyst and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry quantification system. The highest-specific production rates of carbon number four and higher VOCs were observed under microaerophilic conditions, which is the expected environment within the plant host. Specific production rates of two ester compounds increased by at least 19 times under microaerophilic conditions compared with those under any other oxygen concentration studied. Total VOC production, including small molecules such as ethanol and acetaldehyde, increased by 23 times when compared between aerobic and anoxic conditions, predominately due to increased production of ethanol. Additionally, total specific production for all 21 compounds quantified was highest under reduced oxygen conditions. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The consumption of fossil and especially alternative fuels from renewable sources is supposed to rise in the future. Biofuels as well as fossil fuels often contain alkali and alkaline earth metal impurities that are potential poisons for automotive exhaust catalysts. The impact of these contaminations on the long-time performance of the exhaust aftertreatment system is a major concern. However, engine test bench studies consume considerable amounts of fuel, manpower and time. The purpose of this research project was to examine whether accelerated engine tests can be achieved by a modified diesel aftertreatment system in a test bench and contamination of biodiesel with known amounts of elements potentially poisoning automotive catalysts. A variety of potentially harmful elements (sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S) and phosphorous (P)) were added all at once to enhance the contamination level in biodiesel. A diesel oxidation catalyst and a catalyst for selective catalytic reduction reaction were placed in a stream of exhaust gas generated with a single cylinder engine. For reference purposes, a second test series was performed with a commercially available biodiesel. Catalysts were analyzed post-mortem using a bench flow reactor and X-ray fluorescence regarding their activity and deposition of the harmful elements. For both diesel oxidation catalyst and selective catalytic reduction catalysts, significant deactivation and decrease in conversion rates could be proven. For diesel oxidation catalyst, linear correlations between mass fractions of added elements and aging time were observed. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - This work compares the experimental results of the effects of drilled shale on the formulated oil-in-water emulsion drilling mud using biodiesel produced from waste vegetable oil (WVO) with white oil 5# at 140 °C. The concentration of drilled shale with particle sizes distribution between 80 and 100 mesh was varied from 0 to 16 wt./vol.%. The plastic viscosity, yield point, thixotropy, high-temperature–high-pressure (HTHP) filtration loss, coefficient of friction, and rate of drilled cuttings recovery were assessed. The biodiesel-in-water emulsion drilling mud (BEDM) exhibited better rheological behavior and stability compared to white oil-in-water emulsion drilling mud (WEDM) under the different conditions examined. BEDM demonstrated the lowest HTHP filtration volume with values ranging from 6 to13 cm3 compared to WEDM with 9–18 cm3 and water-based mud (WBM) of 12–25 cm3. Moreover, coefficients of friction of BEDM, WEDM, and WBM were 0.26, 0.35, and 0.75, respectively. BEDM had the highest drilled cuttings recovery rate of 79.60%, followed by WEDM with a rate of 72.80%, while WBM recorded the least (46.25%). Hence, the use of WVO biodiesel as additive in water-based mud can enhance the drilled shale tolerance of water-based drilling mud in an environmentally friendly manner. © 2017 The Korean Society of Mineral and Energy Resources Engineers (KSMER).

AB  - The development of novel methods to obtain biofuels and chemicals from biomass has been an immediate issue in both academic and industrial communities. In this work, a series of novel catalysts were prepared and characterized by FT-IR, TGA, XRD, SEM, TEM, ICP-AES, NH3-TPD and BET, which were applied for the conversion of hexose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The Cr(Salten)-MCM-41-[(CH2)3SO3HVIm]HSO4 catalyst was the most active catalyst, and a glucose conversion of 99.8% with 50.2% HMF yield was obtained at 140 °C for 4 h in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, solvents and catalyst dosages were investigated in detail. MCM-41 immobilized acidic functional ionic liquid and chromium(III) Schiff base complexes as heterogeneous catalysts can be easily recovered by simple filter treatment, exhibiting excellent stability and activity towards hexose conversion. Thus the heterogeneous catalysts were environment-friendly for transforming biomass carbohydrates into fine chemicals. © 2017 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai, & WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Crude glycerol from biodiesel production is a biobased material capable of co-producing biofuels and chemicals. This study aimed to develop a line of Ni catalysts supported on cerium-magnesium (Ce-Mg) to improve the process efficiency of glycerol hydrogenolysis for ethanol and 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO). Results showed that catalytic activity was greatly improved by changing the preparation method from impregnation to deposition precipitation (DP), and by adjusting calcination temperatures. Prepared via DP, the catalysts of 25 wt % Ni supported on Ce-Mg (9:1 mol/mol) greatly improved the effectiveness in glycerol conversion while maintaining the selectivities to ethanol and 1,2-PDO. Calcination at 350 °C provided the catalysts better selectivities of 15.61% to ethanol and 67.93% to 1,2-PDO. Increases in reaction temperature and time improved the conversion of glycerol and the selectivity to ethanol, but reduced the selectivity to 1,2-PDO. A lower initial water content led to a higher conversion of glycerol, but lower selectivities to ethanol and 1,2-PDO. Higher hydrogen application affected the glycerol conversion rate positively, but the selectivities to ethanol and 1,2-PDO negatively. A comparison to the commercial Raney® Ni catalyst showed that the Ni/Ce-Mg catalyst developed in this study showed a better potential for the selective co-production of ethanol and 1,2-PDO from glycerol hydrogenolysis. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The process of biofuel production uses organic waste which does two important step, hydrolysis and fermentation. Hydrolysis process will result in reduction sugar and then it will be fermented to biofuel such as biobutanol. Chemical hydrolysis process is using ultrasonic that can save time and descend temperature of the process.So it can keep energy using on hydrolysis process. Organic waste like fruit peels and vegetables residual as many as 100 grams and HCl solution with blending ratio of 1: 6 w/v mixed at hydrolysis reactor with a batch system where it fixed with ultrasonic of 28kHz and temperature measurement. Hydrolysis did with a variation of operation temperature, time of the process, and HCl concentration. it will result in hydrolysate and then glucose level analyzed with schrool luff method. Hydrolysate at a temperature of the process of 90oC, time of the process of 30 minutes and HCl concentration of 1% results in glucose yield of 36.82%. © RASĀYAN. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previously isolated and characterized Pseudomonas lipases were immobilized in a low-cost MP-1000 support by a re-loading procedure that allowed a high activity per weight of support. Immobilized LipA, LipC, and LipCmut lipases, and commercial Novozym® 435 were tested for fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs) synthesis using conventional and alternative feedstocks. Triolein and degummed soybean oils were used as model substrates, whereas waste cooking oil and M. circinelloides oil were assayed as alternative, low cost feedstocks, whose free fatty acid (FFA), and acylglyceride profile was characterized. The reaction conditions for FAMEs synthesis were initially established using degummed soybean oil, setting up the best water and methanol concentrations for optimum conversion. These conditions were further applied to the alternative feedstocks and the four lipases. The results revealed that Pseudomonas lipases were unable to use the FFAs, displaying a moderate FAMEs synthesis, whereas a 44% FAMEs production was obtained when M. circinelloides oil was used as a substrate in the reaction catalysed by Novozym® 435, used under the conditions established for degummed soybean oil. However, when Novozym® 435 was tested under previously described optimal conditions for this lipase, promising values of 85 and 76% FAMEs synthesis were obtained for waste cooking oil and M. circinelloides oil, respectively, which might result in promising, nonfood, alternative feedstocks for enzymatic biodiesel production. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - This work aims to investigate the de-acidification of organic liquid products, obtained by catalytic cracking of palm oil (Elaeis guineensis Jacq) using Na2CO3 as catalyst, by fractional distillation. The distillation of OLP carried out in laboratory, using columns of different heights with and without reflux, and in pilot scale. OLP and distillation fractions physicochemical characterized for density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, saponification value, refractive index, ester index, free fatty acids, flash point, and copper strip corrosion. The OLP analyzed by GC–MS and FT-IR, and light diesel-like fractions by FT-IR, NMR, and GC–MS. The experiments carried out in laboratory scale with and without reflux showed biofuels (distillates) yields between 62.15 and 76.41% and 71.65 and 89.44% (wt.), respectively, while that in pilot scale was 32.68% (wt.). For the experiments in laboratory scale, the yields of distillates decrease exponentially with column height, with and without reflux, while those of bottoms products increase exponentially. In addition, the yields of distillates and gas increase with increasing Na2CO3 content, while that of bottom products decrease. The yield of light diesel-like fractions, with and without reflux ranged between 48.82 and 63.18, and 20.23 and 21.43% (wt.), respectively. The column height had no significant effect on the density of distillation fractions, with and without reflux. The densities of gasoline, kerosene, and light diesel with reflux, superpose exactly those of kerosene, light diesel, and heavy diesel without reflux. The kinematic viscosity of distillation fractions decreases with increasing column height for the experiments with and without reflux, while the acid values decrease. For the distillation experiments in pilot scale, the acid values of gasoline, kerosene, and light diesel-like fractions were 0.33, 0.42, and 0.34 mg KOH/g. FT-IR of distillation fractions in pilot scale and NMR of light diesel-like fraction in laboratory scale, column height of 50 cm, under reflux identified the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons and the absence of carbonyl groups. The GC–MS analysis identified in OLP composition 92.84% (area.) hydrocarbons and 7.16% (area.) oxygenates. The light diesel-like fraction contains 100% hydrocarbons with an acid value of 0.34 mg KOH/g, density of 0.7862 g/cm3, and kinematic viscosity of 1.52 mm2 s−1, proving the feasibility of OLP de-acidification by fractional distillation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents an integrated strategy for the co-production of bioenergy (biofuels: butene oligomers) and bio-based products (biomaterials: cyclopentanone (CPON) and alkylphenols) from hemicellulose (C5), cellulose (C6), and lignin fractions of lignocellulosic biomass based on experimental catalysis studies. To evaluate techno-economic feasibility of the strategy, we performed a system-level design study with three steps: process synthesis, energy analysis, and economic analysis. The results of process synthesis show that all biomass fractions are effectively converted with high numerical carbon yields (C6-to-butene oligomers: 52.5%, C5-to-CPON: 68.2%, and lignin-to-alkylphenols: 13.3%) but an efficient separation system for high recovery of bioenergy and bio-based products is crucial. Moreover, an efficient design of a heat exchanger network leads that the total energy requirements of the process are satisfied by the combustion of biomass degradation products (humins). Finally, an economic analysis is performed to estimate the minimum selling price of CPON as the highest energy material (201 Mt/day of CPON production using 2000 Mt/day of corn stover feedstock processing). This result shows that the process ($1.79/kg CPON) can be cost competitive with current petro-based production approaches. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the effect of spatial distribution of the porous matrix surface heterogeneity on nanoparticle deposition is numerically explored using lattice Boltzmann simulation methods and tracking of individual particles with Lagrangian algorithms. Packed beds with four different patterns of surface charge heterogeneity, on which favorable surfaces for particle attachment are located at different locations, are generated. The heterogeneity is binary, so that the porous surface can either accommodate nanoparticle attachment or not. It is found that the heterogeneity pattern has a stronger effect when the rate constant for particle attachment is high, when the particle size is small, and/or when the fraction of the surface area that is favorable to attachment is about 0.5. At fixed conditions, the heterogeneity pattern with randomly and uniformly distributed active surface area is the most favorite for particle attachment, compared to those where the active surface areas are banded perpendicularly to the flow direction. There exists a critical ratio of the Damkohler number to the Peclet number, beyond which the heterogeneity pattern effect becomes more visible.

AB  - The catalytic hydroconversion of vegetable oil (CHVO) process associate vegetable oil triglyceride transformation to linearchain alkanes, via hydrodeoxygenation reactions (HDO) to generate multiple hydrocarbon compounds similar to heavy vacuum oil. The CHVO process was applied to Jatropha curcas seed oil, on commercial hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Ni- Mo/Al2O3 catalyst under HDS operation conditions. Jatropha curcas seed oil triglycerides conversion were observe by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and validated by Gas Chromatography (CG/MSD). The process occurs through three reaction pathways including: decarbonylation, decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation where the carboxyl group is removed from the fatty acids to produce alkanes similar to fossil fuels. Infrared spectroscopy in CHVO process showed to be a useful method to evaluate the catalytic activity by monitoring specific frequencies intensities of C=O and C-O bonds in carboxylic group. The intensity reduction of these bonds to linear hydrocarbons it associated as a way to quantify for CHVO process. © 2017, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa. All rights reserved.

AB  - Xylanases are important polysaccharide-cleaving catalysts for the pulp and paper, animal feeds and biofuels industries. They have also proved to be valuable model systems for understanding enzymatic catalysis, with one of the best studied being the GH11 xylanase from Bacillus circulans (Bcx). However, proteins from this class are very recalcitrant to refolding in vitro. This both limits their high level expression in heterologous hosts, and prevents experimental approaches, such as peptide ligation or chemical modifications, to probe and engineer their stability and function. To solve this problem, a systematic screening approach was employed to identify suitable buffer conditions for renaturing Bcx in vitro. The fractional factorial screen employed identified starting conditions for refolding, which were then refined and developed into a generic protocol for renaturing preparative amounts of active Bcx in a 50–60% yield from inclusion bodies. The method is robust and proved equally proficient at refolding circularly permuted versions that carry cysteine mutations. This general approach should be applicable to related GH11 xylanases, as well as proteins adopting a similar β-jellyroll fold, that are otherwise recalcitrant to refolding in vitro. © 2017 The Protein Society

AB  - In this study, a non-edible seed oil of Alexandrian Laurel (Calophyllum inophyllum L.) with higher free fatty acid content has been harnessed to produce biodiesel by transesterification process. The 20.2% free fatty acid (FFA) content was first reduced to 12.9% by using TOP degumming process. Ortho-phosphoric acid was used to esterify the refined kernel oil. Transesterification reaction was performed with NaOH as an alkaline catalyst and methanol as an analytical solvent. The effects of methanol to oil molar ratio (MR), catalyst concentration (CC), reaction temperature (TP), reaction time (TM), and stirrer speed (SS) on biodiesel conversion were studied to optimize the transesterification conditions using DOE- approach. The experimental study revealed that 9:1 MR, 0.8 wt.% CC, 60°C TP, 75 min TM and 1000 rpm SS were the optimal process control variables. The study indicated that CC was the most important control parameter in optimal methyl ester production. The optimal treatment combination yielded 97.14% of biodiesel. The profile of biodiesel was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 1H NMR spectrum of Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester (CIME) has been reported. The properties of the biodiesel have been found within specifications of the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards and hence could be considered as a suitable alternative to diesel fuel for sustainable circulation of carbon. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Increase in global development of renewable energy sources as sustainable alternatives to the conventional fossil fuels witnessed in recent time is linked to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; high dependency on imported fossil oil especially in the developed world; non-renewable nature of fossil fuels; price volatility of petroleum products and instability in the oil producing areas. Therefore, bioenergy appears to offer hope for addressing these concerns while also providing new opportunities for farmers in developing and developed countries alike. Among the many possible resources, biodiesel has received the most attention as a promising substitute for conventional petrol-diesel fuel. The production of biodiesel (methyl esters) from Jatropha plant is currently generating interest in every economy of the world as an alternative means of producing liquid fuels from biomass and have gather relevance due to the environmental advantage the process offers. Biodiesel is a renewable source of energy that can facilitate clean air, readily usable in existing engines and transport facilities, capable of generating employment and income for citizens but has not been fully tapped. Hence, efforts are being made to explore this economically competitive, environmentally acceptable and readily available alternative source of energy. Therefore, the paper provides a review of Jatropha as a feedstock for biodiesel production in Nigeria. Focusing on biodiesel development from Jatropha feedstock, the objectives of reviewing its current trends in the production of this biofuel will hold an immense benefit. The biodiesel fuel properties and potential of Jatropha towards environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation, and more importantly improve economic development for rural communities were highlighted. © 2017 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU - All rights reserved.

AB  - A screening study of the chromatographic separation of Glyceric Acid (GCA) and Tartronic Acid (TTA) was performed using three different polystyrene-divinylbenzene ion-exchange resins in hydrogen form (Dowex® 50WX-8, Dowex® 50WX-4, Dowex® 50WX-2). The experiments were described by the axial dispersion flow model with the LDF approximation incorporated into the software gPROMS. From the three investigated adsorbents differing by the crosslinking, Dowex® 50WX-2 has presented the higher adsorption capacity, as well as the highest bed efficiency expressed by the number of theoretical plates. The adsorption equilibrium constants were determined from single breakthrough experiments, and a very good agreement between experimental and simulated data was achieved for both single components and binary mixtures. Therefore, the fundamental data determined within this work represents a key contribution to the design of continuous chromatographic processes for the purification of GCA and TTA. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The preparation of sodium methoxide-treated algae catalysts and their activity in the transesterification of Pongamia pinnata seed oil by dimethyl carbonate were investigated. We also investigated the effect of the sodium methoxide-treated algae catalyst on the biodiesel yield. The development of sodium methoxide-treated algae catalysts can overcome most problems associated with dissolution in dimethyl carbonate. The products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy to identify the fatty acid methyl esters in the biodiesel produced. The molar ratio of Pongamia pinnata seed oil to dimethyl carbonate in transesterification in the presence of the sodium methoxide-treated algae catalyst was observed to play a substantial role in this study, wherein the Pongamia pinnata seed oil conversion increased with increasing catalyst concentration. The highest percent conversion rate was 97%. With intense research focus and development, an ideal catalyst can indeed be developed for optimal biodiesel production that is both economically feasible and environmentally benign. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Splitting of hydrogen sulfide is achieved to produce value-added chemicals. Upon irradiation at 254 nm in the gas phase and in the absence of catalysts or photocatalysts at near room temperature, H2S splits into stoichiometric amounts of H2 and S with a quantum efficiency close to 50 %. No influence of the presence of CH4 and CO2 (typical components in natural gas and biogas in which H2S is an unwanted component) on the efficiency of overall H2S splitting was observed. A mechanism for the H2 and S formation is proposed. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Biodiesel is now-a-days recognized as a real potential alternative to petroleum-derived diesel fuel due to its number of desirable characteristics. However, its higher production cost resulting mainly due to use of costly food-grade vegetable oils as raw materials is the major barrier to its economic viability. Present work is an attempt to explore the potential of Eriobotrya japonica seed oil for the synthesis of biodiesel using alkali-catalyzed transesterification. Optimization of production parameters, namely molar ratio of alcohol to oil, amount of catalyst, reaction time and temperature, was carried out using Taguchi method. Fatty acid composition of both oil and biodiesel was determined using GC and H1 NMR. Alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, catalyst amount of 1% wt/wt, 2 h reaction time and 50 °C reaction temperature were found to be the optimum conditions for obtaining 94.52% biodiesel. Highest % contribution was shown by the ‘amount of catalyst’ (67.32%) followed by molar ratio of alcohol to oil (25.51%). Major fuel properties of E. japonica methyl esters produced under optimum conditions were found within the specified limits of ASTM D6751 for biodiesel, hence it may be considered a prospective substitute of petro-diesel. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuels are an important tool for the reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse emissions. NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase has been previously shown to be capable of the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into formate, which can be ultimately converted to methanol. We established that a functional enzyme, tagged for immobilization, could be continuously secreted by Pichia pastoris. The protein can be easily separated from the growth media and its activity remains constant over an extended period of time. This is an important first step in creating a self-sustaining system capable of producing biofuels with minimal resources and space required. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) originating from plant oils are most interesting renewable feedstocks for biofuels and bio-based materials. FAMEs can also be produced and/or functionalized by engineered microbes to give access to, e.g., polymer building blocks. Yet, they are often subject to hydrolysis yielding free fatty acids, which typically are degraded by microbes. We identified BioH as the key enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of medium-chain length FAME derivatives in different E. coli K-12 strains. E. coli ΔbioH strains showed up to 22-fold reduced FAME hydrolysis rates in comparison with respective wild-type strains. Knockout strains showed, beside the expected biotin auxotrophy, unchanged growth behavior and biocatalytic activity. Thus, high specific rates (~80 U gCDW−1) for terminal FAME oxyfunctionalization catalyzed by a recombinant alkane monooxygenase could be combined with reduced hydrolysis. Biotransformations in process-relevant two-liquid phase systems profited from reduced fatty acid accumulation and/or reduced substrate loss via free fatty acid metabolization. The BioH knockout strategy was beneficial in all tested strains, although its effect was found to differ according to specific strain properties, such as FAME hydrolysis and FFA degradation activities. BioH or functional analogs can be found in virtually all microorganisms, making bioH deletion a broadly applicable strategy for efficient microbial bioprocessing involving FAMEs. © 2016, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Moving bed reactors have a wide range of applications in the chemical, petrochemical, and alternative energy industries in a special situation where there is a need to either continuously recirculate or replace solid particles catalysts. They are also under consideration as one of the 4th generation nuclear reactors known as pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR). In this work a continuous cold flow pebble recirculation experimental set-up, mimicking the flow of pebbles in a PBMR, is designed, developed, and tested at Missouri S&T. A unique experimental work has been performed on assessment of the possibility of using pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) as static packed bed approximation for the needed experimental investigation. For this purpose, a radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique is implemented around the continuous pebble recirculation experimental set-up, to compare the packing characteristics of static and moving pebble beds. The photopeak counts during RPT calibration were collected by placing radioactive particle (tracer) at different positions in the test reactor under different operating conditions of moving and static conditions. The photopeak counts between moving and static conditions show that attenuation characteristics of the medium in between tracer and detectors are not changing significantly due to movement of pebbles. This confirms that PBMR could be well approximated by static packed beds for experimental investigation which simplify the needed experimentation to advance PBMR technology and commercialization. Obtained results are serving as a unique benchmark data for an evaluation of the contact force model that used in the discrete element method (DEM) based simulations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although the independent effects of the predictors of the yield in transesterification are well documented, there are still gaps in our current understanding of how specific process variables cumulatively influence the yield of biodiesel. In this study, a two-level Plackett–Burman experimental design was used to assess the set of active process variables that most decisively influence the yield of biodiesel in transesterification. The results of the model in which the parameters were entered at once show in decreasing order, the magnitude of the effect of the process variables on the yield was as follows: amount of FFA > weight of catatlyst > rate of stirring > duration of reaction > temperature > methanol for the ranges of values that were studied. In the sequential/nested ordinary least squares regression model, the order of importance of the predictors was almost maintained however the coefficients varied somewhat. This indicates that the level and the order of entry of variables within each level makes a fundamental difference to the results. The methanol-oil ratio had no influence on biofuel yield within the range of values studied. Overall, the adjusted model in which most of the variables had been taken into consideration explained approximately 94 % of the total variance in the data. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The novel method for biogenic component determination in liquid fuels by direct measurement of the 14C activity concentration via liquid scintillation counting (LSC) technique has been used in few laboratories worldwide. This paper presents results of the development of method for bio-component quantification in fuel mixtures in the Nuclear Physics Laboratory Novi Sad, Serbia, as well as their comparison to established methodology in literature with intent to define optimal parameters and measurement conditions for 14C determination in biofuels. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to give comprehensive overview of optimal parameters such as scintillation cocktail and vial selection, fuel/cocktail ratio and best calibration procedure of liquid scintillation counter Quantulus 1220™, with practical information for laboratories that intend to develop this technique. Biodiesel produced from two different feedstock materials was mixed with two commercial fossil matrices to produce fuel blends containing 1–100% FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters), which were analyzed for calibration purposes. Analytical study of relation between the detected released energy and quench level led to establishment of calibration curves specific to the fuel types produced in this moment on the market in Serbia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new class of porous membranes is introduced to provide unique separation mechanisms by surface interactions and capillary condensation. High-performance architectural surface selective (HiPAS) membranes were designed for high perm-selective flux and high-temperature tolerance for hot vapor processing and liquid processing. Due to surface-enhanced selectivity, larger-fluxes were achieved by utilizing larger pore sizes (~8 nm for vapor phase and micron-sized pores for liquid phase separations). This article describes a membrane-based separation concept for biomass conversion pathways and demonstrates the initial data for selective permeation of toluene–water and toluene–phenol–water relevant to biofuel processing. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Methyl esters of castor oil derived carboxylic acids such as 10-undecenoic acid and ricinoleic acid are useful as biofuels, biolubricants and plasticizers. Esterification of these fatty acids was studied for the first time with near-critical and supercritical methanol without adding any external catalysts. Reaction kinetics were studied for esterification in a wide range of temperatures (523-673 K) and molar ratios (from 1 : 1 to 40 : 1) at a constant pressure of 20 MPa. Conversions of >90% were obtained for both the carboxylic acids within an hour of reaction time. Different kinetic models were developed and used to correlate the conversions at various temperatures and molar ratios. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This research aims to study the effect of nickel impregnation into hydrotalcite catalyst that use to convert Calophyllum inophyllum oil into biofuel through hydrocracking process. Hydrocracking process was carried out under mild condition (350°C and 20 bar) for two hours in a slurry batch reactor. The adding nickel affected the reaction conversion, yield, and selectivity of gasoil. The process of oxygen removal from the compounds in the oil was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and the compositions of the products were determined by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of the study successfully proved that nickel impregnated into hydrotalcite catalyst increased the conversion, yield, and selectivity of gasoil up to 98.57 %, 54.15 %, and 81.31 %, respectively.

AB  - One approach to improve the oxidative stability of biodiesel is the partial hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds. In the current work, an efficient catalytic system using Pd(OAc)2 dissolved in polyethylene glycol (PEG) which in situ generates palladium nanoparticles was developed in order to promote a selective partial hydrogenation reaction of sunflower oil FAMEs into mono-hydrogenated products avoiding the formation of saturated compounds or trans-isomers. High content of methyl oleate (85.0±1.4%) was obtained by hydrogenation of sunflower oil biodiesel with only 7.0±0.2% stearic acid. Through evaluating the palladium nanoparticles by TEM analysis, it is observed that 4 nm palladium nanoparticles generated in situ in PEG4000 are highly selective for the partial hydrogenation of sunflower oil biodiesel. And the Pd-PEG4000 catalyst can be resued for five times without obvious loss of activity or methyl oleate selectivity. ©2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Dwindling of petroleum-based fuels together with their frightening environmental effects has enforced the emergence of lignocellulose-based biorefineries. Being most abundant and bio-renewable, lignocellulosic biomass holds enormous potential for production of biofuels, bio-based chemicals and materials for a sustainable energy future. Utilization of lignocellulosic materials in a biorefinery requires a well-designed pre-treatment technology with reasonable processing cost for deconstruction of the lignocellulose complex. Current technologies rely on chemical, physico-chemical and biochemical conversion routes for effective hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. Identification of novel enzymes and microbes to counteract the pre-treatment-induced inhibitory products is a prime area of research as chemical detoxification method carries financial constrains. Valorization of biomass is greatly influenced by generation of co-products in biorefining processes and their selective recovery, which may considerably reduce the cost involved in biofuel production. The lab-to-industry transition of a bioprocess technology necessitates a sound techno-economical evaluation for optimum product yield to hit the market place. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - The ambitious targets of the aviation industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions require the use of biofuels in this transport sector in the short and medium term. While five biogenic aviation turbine fuels have already been certified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D7566), the search for suitable alternatives continues, seeking higher possible blending ratios or better fuel qualities. Fluidized-bed catalytic cracking (FCC) of algae oil, followed by hydrotreatment of intermediates, could be such a potential option. This conversion concept has several potential advantages, such as aromatic compounds in the biokerosene and the use of a non-food biogenic oil as feedstock. Material and energy balances are obtained from flowsheet simulation using ASPEN Plus®, with the aim to assess the efficiency of the process. The simulation model contains all relevant conversion and separation steps, and auxiliary components such as a steam reformer and a furnace. Simulation parameters for all unit operations were based on current literature to represent the state-of-the-art of the involved technologies. Additionally, the process was optimized by heat integration and waste heat utilization. The established simulation model is proposed to serve as a concept study and basis for the implementation of future experimental results and perceptions. With an energy efficiency of 95% and a biokerosene yield of 41%, the results emphasize the potential of this conversion process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The thermodynamic equilibrium of gas-phase deoxygenation of propionic acid was studied over a wide range of reaction conditions (T = 200–600 °C, P = 1–10 bar and H2/acid = 0–10 mol/mol) using non-stoichiometric equilibrium models. The effect of catalyst type on equilibrium composition was incorporated by applying different combinations of the reactions involved, including decarboxylation, decarbonylation, hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis and water-gas shift reactions. It was implemented by using appropriate constraining component balance equations in minimization of Gibbs free energy of the system. Accordingly, four reaction models were used, the results of which were compared with each other and with the relevant experimental data. The results illustrate that high equilibrium conversions of propionic acid (&gt;85%) are possible for all models. It was found that reactions leading to saturated hydrocarbons (that is, ethane and propane) are highly favorable while those including oxygenates interconversions are equilibrium limited. The results fit favorably with experimental data obtained by employing selective catalysts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to prepare activated carbon (AC) from sugarcane bagasse by the physical activation process (CO2) and subsequently evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of the AC and of the bio oil produced. In a physical activation process, the biomass is pyrolysed, under an inert atmosphere (N2), and the resulting char with small adsorption capacity is subjected to a partial and controlled gasification at high temperature with carbon dioxide to afford adsorbents with high specific areas. Furthermore, in the pyrolysis step there is the production of bio oil, which is a liquid with a high energy density and it is able to substitute conventional fuels in different applications. During the pyrolysis were evaluated the effect of different temperatures (400, 500, 700 and 800 °C) on the physicochemical characteristics of the AC. The activation step was realized under flow of 150 ml min-1 of carbon dioxide (CO2), at 800 °C for 2 hours, using a heating ramp of 10 °C min-1. The activated carbons were characterized by nitrogen adsorption isotherms (77 K), FTIR and point of zero charge (PZC). It was possible to obtain microporous adsorbents with specific area ranging between 300 and 410 m2.g-1. The materials proved hydrophobic and basic superficial character (PZC∼9). It was observed that pyrolysis temperature does not significantly affect the characteristics of activated carbons obtained. The total yield for the activated carbon production ranged between 24 and 54%, decreasing with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature. In this way, the process can be conducted at 400 °C, achieving, thus, energy saving and higher total yields (54%). It was noted that an increase of the temperatures increases the liquid and gaseous yields and decreases the solid residue yield. The pyrolysis liquid showed an acidic character (pH = 1.0). The chemical composition of the bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer and were identified a great variety of compounds. Such composition suggests that the bio-oil from sugarcane bagasse pyrolysis is a promising source of components for chemical, nutritional and pharmaceutical use. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Single-cell oils (SCOs) raise a growing interest due to their potential for the production of biofuels, bioplastics and more recently of food additives. The production of SCOs by exploitation of residual lignocellulosic biomass has become a realistic target, due to the recent advances in enzyme hydrolysis technology. The fermentation of yeasts offers a useful alternative to microalgae, due to their ability to use several agroforestry wastes as feedstock and their simple cultural requirements. In addition, the microbial oils obtained from yeasts have a composition quite similar to that of vegetable oils. This study is focused on the exploitation of Giant reed (Arundo donax), a widely diffused perennial crop, well known for its capability to grow in marginal lands ensuring high biomass productivity. Different types of biomass, from crops cultivated under different agronomic management were tested. The effect of two types of treated sewage sludges as organic matter sources and inorganic nitrogen fertigation was evaluated to increase soil fertility. These practices were tested in order to improve crop composition and productivity. The hydrolysates from A. donax biomass have been evaluated as a growth medium for oleaginous yeasts, for the production of microbial oils. The production kinetics and the yields in microbial oils have been analyzed taking into account the composition of the different biomasses used, in order to contribute to a complete optimization of the productive cycle. In general, the treatment acid hydrolysis with HCl followed by enzymatic hydrolysis led to the best results in order to obtain glucose production for the development of biofuels. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Brown grease breaks down into a mixture of alkanes and alkenes at temperatures above 300 °C without addition of hydrogen or an external catalyst. To better understand the reactions in this process, pyrolysis experiments were performed on palmitic and oleic acids as model systems for the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in brown grease, respectively. Iron (III) sulfate was used in half of the experiments, as Fe(III) is normally found in brown grease; and the other experiments were performed without iron as controls. In the presence of Fe(III), palmitic acid forms a series of aliphatic hydrocarbons and some palmitone byproduct, while the iron-free control experiment yielded larger quantities of palmitone, up to more than 50%. However, regardless of Fe(III), oleic acid broke down into shorter saturated fatty acids, hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and ketones, according to known thermal reactions of unsaturated fatty acids. The product fatty acids then reacted in a manner similar to palmitic acid. The major ketone and alcohol byproducts were also examined for reactions ultimately leading to the desired products. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algae cultivation in animal wastewater could recover nutrient resources, and harvest considerable amount of algae biomass for biofuel conversion. In this study, Chlorella sp. cultivated in ultrafiltration (UF) membrane treated anaerobic digestion effluent of chicken manure was converted into biocrude oil through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The potential of biocrude production from grown Chlorella sp. was studied through changing the operational conditions of HTL, i.e., holding temperature (HT, 250°C-330°C), retention time (RT, 0.5-1.5 h), and total solid (TS) (15 wt%-25 wt%) of the feedstock. The highest biocrude oil yield was 32.9% at 330°C, 1.5 h and 20 wt% TS. The single factor experiments of HT also suggested that the biocrude oil yield decreased when the temperature was higher than 330°C. There were no significant differences of elemental contents in biocrude samples. The maximum higher heating values (HHV) of Chlorella sp. biocrude was 40.04 MJ/kg at HT of 330°C, RT of 1 h and TS of 15 wt%.

AB  - This paper focused on the removal of free fatty acids from the ester phase. Transesterification was stopped by neutralization of the catalyst (KOH) by phosphoric acid addition to the reaction mixture. The advantages of this method are a very fast separation, an ester phase that does not contain potassium ions and free glycerol, and a relatively high purity of the glycerol phase. The disadvantage is the formation of free fatty acids, which were removed by the addition of calcium hydroxide, a reaction that formed solid calcium soaps that were removed by centrifugation. The conditions of removal (independent variables), such as the acid number of the input ester phase, molar ratio of calcium to FFAs and addition of water, were studied. The relations between independent and dependent variables (acid number, amount of calcium ions and water in the ester phase) are described. The model allowed for the calculation of conditions, so that the biodiesel fulfilled EN14214: a molar ratio of calcium to FFAs of 3.33:1, the addition of 1.45 μl water to 1 g of the ester phase and a reaction time of 3 h. This preparation of methyl ester is nearly without waste and does not use water for purification. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential for the stabilization of biomass-derived pyrolysis oils by using acid-catalyzed (Amberlyst 70) reactions with alcohol (T=140–170 °C, P≈20 bar (1 bar=105 Pa)). The alcohol-stabilized oils were further upgraded by catalytic hydrotreatment (T=400 °C, non-sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst) to give a biofuel. The concept was evaluated experimentally in terms of overall mass and energy balances and biofuel properties. The pyrolysis oil used in this study was obtained by fractional condensation of pyrolysis vapors and had a very low water content that favored the equilibrium conversion of the stabilization reactions. The energy efficiency was between 44 and 48 %. Preliminary results with acid-leached biomass showed that 43 % of levoglucosan in the pyrolysis oil was converted into methyl levulinate after the pyrolysis oil was purified. The proposed integrated concept of alcoholysis can be applied locally at the pyrolysis oil production site. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Bio-oils obtained from biomass pyrolysis are being recognized as the next generation energy source. However, this technology has not yet been fully employed in real practice because of highly viscous and complex chemical nature of pyrolytic products and also due to lack of adequate understanding of such non-isothermal reactions. Catalysts can be used to upgrade the quality of bio-oils by enhancing the pyrolysis reaction efficiency and breaking down higher molecular weight compounds into simpler products. The study of the kinetics of this pyrolysis process explicates in depth knowledge about the reaction mechanism to have a better control over the efficiency of pyrolysis conversion of the biomass constituent. In this study, we focus on the kinetic analysis of ceria nanoparticles catalysed pyrolysis of cellulose, the major constituent of lignocellulosic biomass, for production of high-quality bio-oil. A non-isothermal kinetic analysis method identifies the reaction to be following a ‘one and a half order’ pathway and establishes significant lowering of activation energy after addition of the nanocatalyst. The merit of the nanocatalyst was again ascertained by performing qualitative analysis of pyrolytic liquids from cellulose in the presence of both bulk and nanosized ceria catalysts. It was observed that CeO2 nanoparticles improved the pyrolysis process enhancing the C–C bond scission reactions. As a result, percentage amount of lower molecular weight (96–144) compounds in the pyrolytic liquids increased with the addition of nanocatalyst (highest being 100% for 7% ceria nanocatalyst). © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The one-step hydrotreatment of rubber seed oil to produce hydrocarbon fuels has been carried out via supported Pd-catalyst, and analyzed emphatically some elements affected catalytic cracking process, for example, temperature, hydrogen partial pressure and dosage of catalyst, etc. Through experimental research, the author found out the appropriate catalytic cracking conditions as follows: 310°C of reaction temperature, 2 MPa of hydrogen partial pressure, 15 of the ratio of oil to catalyst (m(oil)/m(catalyst)), 100 r/min of stirring speed. Under these conditions, effective component of hydrocarbon fuels in the converted oil accounts for 99.49%, and the proportion of C8-C16 can reach as high as 79.61%. The converted oil was similar to petroleum-based oil in chemical composition, and can be used for future the aviation biofuels development as the source of raw material because it contains a large amount of hydrocarbon in the range of C8-C16. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Pseudostem of the Musa cavendishii banana plant was submitted to chemical pretreatments with acid (H2SO4 2%, 120 °C, 15 min) and with alkali (NaOH 3%, 120 °C, 15 min), saccharified by commercial enzymes Novozymes® (Cellic CTec2 and HTec2). The influences of the pretreatments on the degradation of the lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, porosity of the surface, particle crystallinity, and yield in reducing sugars after saccharification (YRS), were established. Different concentrations of biomass (70 and 100 g/L in dry matter (dm)), with different physical differences (dry granulated, crushed wet bagasse, and whole pseudostem), were used. The broth with the highest YRS among the different strategies tested was evaporated until the concentration of reducing sugars (RS) was to the order of 100 g/L and fermented, with and without prior detoxification with active carbon. Fermentation was carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks, at 30 °C, initial pH 5.0, and 120 rpm. In comparison to the biomass without chemical pretreatment and to the biomass pretreated with NaOH, the acid pretreatment of 70 g/L of dry granulated biomass enabled greater digestion of hemicellulose, lower index of cellulose crystallinity, and higher YRS (45.8 ± 0.7%). The RS increase in fermentation broth to 100 g/L, with posterior detoxification, presented higher productivity ethanol (QP = 1.44 ± 0.02 g/L/h) with ethanol yield (YP/RS) of 0.41 ± 0.02 g/g. The value of QP was to the order of 75% higher than QP obtained with the same broth without prior detoxification. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This work deals with the sustainable biodiesel production from low-cost renewable feedstock (waste and non-edible oils) using a heterogeneous catalyst constituted by potassium loaded on an amorphous aluminum silicate naturally occurring as volcanic material (pumice). The main challenge to biodiesel production from low-quality oils (used oils and greases) is the high percentage of free fatty acids (FFAs) and water in the feedstock that causes undesirable side reactions. The catalytic materials studied were tested in the transesterification reaction when using low-quality oils containing a high proportion of free fatty acids (FFAs) and water. Results indicated that the amount of acid and basic sites on the catalytic surface increases upon increasing potassium loading in the catalyst, displaying better performance for biodiesel production. Indeed, the modification of the aluminum silicate substrate upon potassium incorporation results in a catalytic material containing both acidic and basic sites, which are responsible for both triglycerides transesterification and FFA esterification reactions. The studied catalyst not only showed good performance in the biodiesel production reaction but also good tolerance to FFA and water contained in the feedstock for biodiesel production. The catalytic material was microstructured by 3D printing in order to design a catalytic stirring system with high mechanical strength, efficient and reusable. The use of 3D printing in biofuel production is a novelty that brings good solutions for catalyst production. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Abstract: Brown bin waste can be used for the production of butanol and butyric acid by employing fermentation techniques. This study focuses on heterogeneous solid acid catalyst obtained from solid residues derived from a fermentation process and applied for the efficient conversion of butyric acid to butyl butyrate. The solid acid catalysts were produced by sulfonation of char obtained from the slow pyrolysis of brown bin waste digestate at various temperatures (400, 500 and 600 °C). The catalysts possessing the highest surface area and acid density were shown to have the highest catalytic activity and thus performed better giving competitive results to Amberlyst 15 and H2SO4 (96 % yield), after 24 h reaction. Increasing the catalyst loading was found to positively affect the yields of butyl butyrate, especially at early reaction time. Realistic kinetic parameters were formulated for the optimum char based solid acid catalyst using two power law models. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Human activity has been altering many ecological cycles for decades, disturbing the natural mechanisms which are responsible for re-establishing the normal environmental balances. Probably, the most disrupted of these cycles is the cycle of carbon. In this context, many technologies have been developed for an efficient CO2 removal from the atmosphere. Once captured, it could be stored in large geological formations and other reservoirs like oceans. This strategy could present some environmental and economic problems. Alternately, CO2 can be transformed into carbonates or different added-value products, such as biofuels and bioplastics, recycling CO2 from fossil fuel. Currently different methods are being studied in this field. We classified them into biological, inorganic and hybrid systems for CO2 transformation. To be environmentally compatible, they should be powered by renewable energy sources. Although hybrid systems are still incipient technologies, they have made great advances in the recent years. In this scenario, biotechnology is the spearhead of ambitious strategies to capture CO2 and reduce global warming. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW), disposed of at open dumping sites, poses health risks, contaminates surface water, and releases greenhouse gasses such as methane. However, pyrolysis offers the opportunity to convert MSW into Bio-Oil (BO) for clean energy resource. In this paper, an MSW sample consisting of plastic, paper and cardboard, rubber and textiles, and vegetable waste is pyrolysed on a laboratory scale in a fixed-bed vacuum reactor. In the non-isothermal process, the sample was fed into the reactor and then heated. In the isothermal process, the reactor is first heated and then the sample is added. The non-isothermal process created greater BO in both quality and quantity. The BO had a larger amount of gasoline species than diesel-48 fuel, with at 33.44%the BO produced by isothermal pyrolysis and 36.42% in non-isothermal pyrolysis. However the product of isothermal pyrolysis had a higher acid content that reduced its heating value. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The thermochemical liquefaction of Cyanobacteria in subcritical and supercritical ethanol–water mixture was studied with different reaction temperature, reaction time, solvent composition, and solid–liquid ratio. Highest bio-oil yield of 42.5% containing mainly fatty acid ethyl esters, phenols, pyrrolidinones, and pyridinols was obtained in ethanol–water mixture (4/6, v/v) at temperature of 320°C for 30 min, with solid–liquid ratio of 1 g/15 mL. Both solvent composition and supercritical state had great influence on the liquefaction of Cyanobacteria, while the synergetic effects of water and ethanol in co-solvents were again verified.

AB  - The wall effect in randomly packed bed with low tube to particle ratio is numerically investigated by coupling discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The porosity, characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer in randomly packed beds are carefully studied, including smooth tube wall model and corrugated tube wall model. Simulation results show that, the wall effect in smooth wall packing with low tube to particle diameter ratio is remarkable. The average velocity of the near tube wall region is higher than inner region, while the average temperature of this region is lower. Besides, the mass flow rate in the range of 0.5dp near the tube wall is about 46% of the total flow. With corrugated structure, the leakage near the tube wall is suppressed and the mass flow rate decreases to 36%. The heat transfer characteristics and drag coefficient have a slight increase, while the overall heat transfer coefficient is lower than smooth tube wall model. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - HZSM-5 zeolite was treated by sodium hydroxide solution, and then characterized by XRD, SEM, BET and Py-FTIR, respectively. Physical and chemical properties and composition analysis was applied to the organic phase of bio-oils. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on three deactivated catalysts after using for 120 min and the peak area of char was calculated. The results show that the alkali-treated HZSM-5 catalyst retains typical MFI topology structure and forms a certain number of mesoporous. At the same time, the bio-oil organic phase made with modified HZSM-5 (after 1 h treatment) achieves a higher yield rate and better physical properties. The content of hydrocarbons increases significantly to 37.67% mainly with the increase of mononuclear aromatics. In addition, modified HZSM-5 catalyst (after 1 h treatment) has a better effect on the removal of acid, aldehyde and ketone contained in the bio-oil organic phase, which improves stability of the bio-oil with calorific value of 35.32 MJ/kg. The amount of coke in the HZSM-5 zeolite after 1 h alkali treatment obviously decreases. © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Two ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) possessing three-dimensionally (3-D) well-ordered mesoporosity with different framework configurations were prepared via a hard template route. The OMCs were treated with different surface-oxidation methods for the preparation of OMC supported highly dispersed Pd catalysts (Pd/OMC). Among the different surface oxidation conditions, the 3-D ordered mesoporous structure of CMK-9 is preserved under a mild surface-oxidation condition by an ammonium persulfate solution at 30 °C for 2 h. The Pd/OMCs were introduced as catalysts for the catalytic deoxygenation of a fatty acid without hydrogen or different amounts of hydrogen. The catalytic performance of the deoxygenation of a fatty acid (stearic acid) was investigated in a batch reactor without hydrogen and a continuous fixed-bed reactor with different amounts of hydrogen (H2/stearic acid = 0–3 molar ratios). The Pd/OMC catalysts were found to be less prone to deactivation than a commercially available activated carbon supported Pd catalyst (Pd/AC). This was attributed to the well-ordered 3-D mesoporosity in the OMC supports, which facilitated the facile diffusion of the liquid reactant and product with a long carbon chain length in the catalyst during the deoxygenation reaction, leading to less Pd metal sintering during the deoxygenation reaction as compared to that with Pd/AC catalyst. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Bio-oil is a potential product from the fast pyrolysis of biomass. However, it should be upgraded before being used in subsequent applications and corrosion prevention. In this work, crude bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of Jatropha curcas residues, which has many long-chain compounds, and a high content of carboxylic acid, was catalytically upgraded over mechanically mixed catalysts (normal ZSM-5 and Y-Re-16) in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of the key parameters on the yields of light oil products were analyzed, including cracking temperature (350–500°C), reaction time (15–60 min), catalyst loading (10–25%), and mixture ratio between Y-Re-16 and ZSM-5 (10–70%). Experimental test cases were based on a simplex lattice design. The gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis showed that the catalytic cracking of crude bio-oil using mixed catalysts resulted in the successful formation of short-chain acid methyls. The employed analytical fit of the experimental data gave R2 and the adjusted R2 of 0.902 and 0.843, respectively. The optimized operation conditions to produce aliphatic hydrocarbons from mechanically mixed catalysts were found to be at 400°C, 15 min of reaction time, 15% of catalyst loading, and a mixture ratio of about 1:5. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, the hydrodynamics of the conical spouted bed reactor was examined to find out stable spouting regime and appropriate gas residence time. And the effects of pyrolysis reaction temperature for the production of the bio-oil in a conical spouted bed reactor were scrutinized by fast pyrolysis experiment. Stable hydrodynamic operating ranges were identified by evaluation of the pressure drop curve and RMS analysis. The yield of the bio-oil reached a maximum of 50.8 wt % at reaction temperature of 500°C, while the yield of the char decreased as the reaction temperature increased. Also, the yield of the non-condensable gas increased when the reaction temperature increased. The water content of the bio-oil was lowest, 26.1wt %, at 500°C, and the high heating value was highest, 18.4 MJ/kg, at 500°C. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 685–689, 2017. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - Ion-exchange membranes are composite separation materials increasingly used in a variety of electro-membranes and electrochemical processes. Although promising for solvent reclamation, to date, their main applications are limited to aqueous environments due to physicochemical and microstructural changes of the materials upon exposure to nonaqueous and mixed solvents solutions, affecting long-term stability and separation performance. In the present work, the structural changes of commercial and novel hybrid ion-exchange membranes in mixed methanol/water and ethanol/water solutions are assessed for the first time using ultra- and small-angle neutron scattering techniques. The interface between the ion-exchange functional layer and the mechanical support of the membranes is evaluated in the ultralow-q region, while a broad solvent-dependent peak at the mid-q region was correlated to the microstructural properties which are related to the free volume across the ion-exchange domains and to the materials electrical and nanoscale mechanical properties. The results of this study may offer new opportunities toward the development of an efficient separation process using ion-exchange membranes for the purification of fermentation broths toward biofuel generation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The high crystallinity of cellulosic biomass myofibrils as well as the complexity of their intermolecular structure is a significant impediment for biofuel production. Cloning of celB-, celC-encoded cellulases (cel12B and cel8C) and peh-encoded polygalacturonase (peh28) from Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc) was carried out in our previous study using Escherichia coli as a host vector. The current study partially characterizes the enzymes' molecular structures as well as their catalytic performance on different substrates which can be used to improve their potential for lignocellulosic biomass conversion. Results: β-Jelly roll topology, (α/α)6 antiparallel helices and right-handed β-helices were the folds identified for cel12B, cel8C, and peh28, respectively, in their corresponding protein model structures. Purifications of 17.4-, 6.2-, and 6.0-fold, compared to crude extract, were achieved for cel12B and cel8C, and peh28, respectively, using specific membrane ultrafiltrations and size-exclusion chromatography. Avicel and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were substrates for cel12B, whereas for cel8C catalytic activity was only shown on CMC. The enzymes displayed significant synergy on CMC but not on Avicel when tested for 3 h at 45°C. No observed β-glucosidase activities were identified for cel8C and cel12B when tested on p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside. Activity stimulation of 130% was observed when a recombinant β-glucosidase from Pcc was added to cel8C and cel12B as tested for 3 h at 45°C. Optimum temperature and pH of 45°C and 5.4, respectively, were identified for all three enzymes using various substrates. Catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) were calculated for cel12B and cel8C on CMC as 0.141 and 2.45 ml/mg/s respectively, at 45°C and pH 5.0 and for peh28 on polygalacturonic acid as 4.87 ml/mg/s, at 40°C and pH 5.0. Glucose and cellobiose were the end-products identified for cel8C, cel12B, and β-glucosidase acting together on Avicel or CMC, while galacturonic acid and other minor co-products were identified for peh28 action on pectin. Conclusions: This study provides some insight into which parameters should be optimized when application of cel8C, cel12B, and peh28 to biomass conversion is the goal. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Experiments on birch wood chips of a size < 20 mm have been conducted in a laboratory scale batch pyrolysis reactor to study the effect of temperature on the pyrolysis product yields and the balance of elements in the products. The investigated variable was the pyrolysis temperature, which was equal to 300, 400 and 500°C in consecutive pyrolysis runs. Products were separated into five fractions: gases, tar, water, char, and a low-boiling liquid fraction. The paper presents the mass share of each fraction as a function of temperature. The content of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen was analysed in each fraction. The paper summarizes the weights of different fractions and the distribution of elements in each fraction. The gas fraction was analysed with the use of a gas chromatograph with thermal conductivity detector, while the liquid fraction was analysed in a gas chromatograph with mass detector. To analyse the content of C, H and N in tar and charcoal, an elemental analyser was used. The preformed study has revealed that the increase of the pyrolysis temperature leads to the increase of the amount of char and to the decrease of the amount of tars (heavy tars and low boiling tars). The amount of water in the pyrolysis products does not change as significantly as the amount of tars, which is the result of constant amount of water obtained in the pyrolysis process. The amount of pyrogenic water increases with the increasing temperature of the process. © 2017, Journal Drvna Industrija. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work aimed to establish a suitable O2 feeding strategy for the hydrogen production by oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of raw bio-oil in a reaction system with two-steps: thermal treatment (at 500 °C, for the controlled deposition of pyrolytic lignin) followed by the reforming of the volatile stream in a fluidized bed reactor. Specifically, the effect of co-feeding O2 before or after the thermal step was analyzed for oxygen-tocarbon molar ratio (O/C) in the 0.34-0.67 range. The catalytic step was kept at 700 °C, steam-to-carbon molar ratio (S/C) = 6.0, and space-time = 0.6 gcatalyst h(gbio-oil)-1. When O2 is co-fed before the thermal step, there is a partial combustion of both, pyrolytic lignin and oxygenates, thus resulting a lower amount of oxygenated compounds entering the reforming reactor, although the composition of these oxygenates is not affected by the presence of O2 in the thermal step. As a result, a noticeable lower H2 yield was obtained when O2 is fed before the thermal treatment, although catalyst deactivation rate was similar to that obtained when co-feeding O2 after thermal treatment. Consequently, in the OSR of bio-oil in a two-step system, O2 must be co-fed after the thermal treatment step; in order to avoid bio-oil oxygenates oxidation prior to the reforming reaction. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The renewable energy sources are being considered as an alternative to solve energy needs and reduce environmental problems. Compared with other renewable energy, biomass from different production processes are an interesting alternative. In particular, the Aloe Vera waste, because has increased their use in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industry. Biorefining has now been introduced as a new concept that integrates conversion processes that allow sustainable treatment of biomass to be converted into products such as synthesis gas, bio-oils, charcoal and energy. Different thermochemical conversion processes have been used with biomass, in order to guarantee energy recovery and reuse. The four main processes used are pyrolysis, combustion, gasification and liquefaction. When these processes are carried out in the presence of water in sub-critical state, it is called hydropyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). When are executed at temperatures above 280°C is called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). In this research was studied the effect of HTC and HTL in neutral and basic medium. As well as the pyrolysis process, in performance and characteristics of products such as biochar and condensable on Aloe Vera leafs. The highest yield in biochar was observed for pyrolysis with 31±3 %w/w followed by the HTL in neutral medium with 28±3 %w/w. The biochars were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), absorption indexes and scanning electron microscopy. The characterization by FTIR showed the presence of functional groups characteristic of aromatic compounds products of condensation processes after applying the thermal treatments. The higher carbon densification was observed for pyrolysis and HTL, while the presence of carbonyl groups is evidenced only for hydroconversion processes. The methylene blue index in the biochars of different thermochemical treatments was 80-100 mg/g, comparable with some commercial activated carbons. For iodine number, the highest value was 224 ± 13 mg/g that was obtained by HTL in a neutral medium. The yield of biofuels in hydrothermal conversion processes was 18 to 26 %w/w; while in the pyrolysis were over 50 %w/w. These were characterized by FTIR and could not identify significant differences in the functional groups existent. The results in the Aloe Vera leaf indicate that the pyrolysis treatment is a low-cost, environmentally friendly management of this biomass, and economic feasibility; with which the highest performance in biochar and condensable fuel is obtained with lower gas production. In addition, biochar obtained can be used for energy purposes due to its densification as well as for amendment in contaminated soil or production of activated carbon, nanostructured materials, and catalysts. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an electrochemical device for power generation with high efficiency and low environmental impact. Due to a high-temperature operation of SOFC, useful heat can be recovered to enhance its system efficiency. Regarding the environmental concern, bio-oil, the renewable liquid fuel, can be applied to SOFC system. In this study, the SOFC integrated with a steam reforming of bio-oil is considered. A sorption enhanced reforming process is studied for the production of high purity hydrogen for SOFC, and the anode gas recirculation in the SOFC system is proposed for the system improvement. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed using Aspen Plus simulator. As heat and power are generated from the SOFC system, the effect of key design parameters; fuel utilization and recirculation ratio of the anode gas, on a heatto-power ratio is analyzed. The system performance regarding to the electrical and thermal efficiencies is also evaluated. The results show that increasing the anode recirculation ratio increases the combined heat and power (CHP) performance, but increasing the fuel utilization decreases the thermal efficiency. It is also found that the appropriate range of heat-to-power ratio of the system varies from 0.24 to 0.89. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - In this paper, corn stalk was alkalized by gradient concentrations of sodium hydroxide and briquetted with anthracite coal. The bonding mechanism was explored by a combined analysis of physicochemical, microstructure and mechanical properties. Alkaline treatment had a large effect on decomposing most of lignin and dissolving the carbohydrates in corn stalk even at a low concentration of 1%. With the increase in alkaline concentration (for 1%–2%), the degree of decomposition of hemicellulose and amorphous cellulose increased gradually. When the concentration of alkaline reagent was higher than 3%, more than 40% of hemicellulose was degraded. A complete surface structure of a spatial network was achieved when corn stalk was treated by 2% alkaline, which mainly contributed to the bonding performance of compound briquette. Under this condition, the ratio of cellulose to hemicellulose to lignin was approximately 7.0:2.5:0.5, and it also exhibited a good pyrolysis performance for energy conversion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Petroleum-based fuels are now widely known as environmentally unfriendly because of non-renewable supplies and its contribution to environmental pollution. The challenge, therefore is to ensure appropriate energy supplies at minimum cost. There is an increasing energy demand in the world and nowadays it can be fulfilled only on the basis of fossil fuels. Therefore, it is necessary to evolve a renewable energy source with lower environmental impact. One alternative solution can be oils of plant origin, like vegetable oils and non-edible oils. With waste vegetable oil methyl ester, biofuel dependency can be decreased. Therefore, the aim of this research paper is to analyze the economic and environmental effect of waste vegetable oil methyl ester compared to fossil fuels. In some cases only the age of vehicles could raise burdens to biofuel utilization in road vehicles. Transport and energy policy - on a large scale - can play an important role in fuel consumption.

AB  - The conversion of Undaria pinnatifida residue to glycolic acid was carried out using methylamine as catalyst by hydrothermal method at relatively low temperature. GC–MS and HPLC were used to identify the composition of bio-oil and liquid products which provide the knowledge of the chemical reaction pathways of the hydrothermal liquefaction. The main liquid product was organic acid which contained glycolic acid, lactic acid, formic acid and acetic acid. And the major organic acid was glycolic acid with the highest yield of 46.52% or 33.98% of dry biomass. Methylamine promoted the dissolution of cellulose from Undaria pinnatifida residue, and significantly improved the yield of glycolic acid. The mechanism of HTL was investigated and the results show that the carbocation C3was attacked by methylamine molecule which led to the high yield of glycolic acid. In addition, the recovery of methylamine was studied and the highest recovery rate reached 99.28%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: Cellulosic biomass represents a huge reservoir of renewable carbon, but converting it into useful products is challenging. Attempts to transfer cellulose degradation capability to industrially useful micro-organisms have met with limited success, possibly due to poorly understood synergy between multiple cellulases. This is best studied by co-expression of many combinations of cellulases and associated proteins. Here, we describe the development of a test platform based on Citrobacter freundii, a cellobiose-assimilating organism closely related to Escherichia coli. Standard E. coli cloning vectors worked well in Cit. freundii. Expression of cellulases CenA and Cex of Cellulomonas fimi in Cit. freundii gave recombinant strains which were able to grow at the expense of cellulosic filter paper or microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) in a mineral medium supplemented with a small amount of yeast extract. Periodic physical agitation of the cultures was highly beneficial for growth at the expense of filter paper. This provides a test platform for the expression of combinations of genes encoding biomass-degrading enzymes to develop effective genetic cassettes for degradation of different biomass streams. Significance and Impact of the Study: Biofuels have been shown to be the best sustainable and alternative source of fuel to replace fossil fuels. Of the different types of feedstocks used for producing biofuels, lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant. Converting this biomass to useful products has met with little success. Different approaches are being used and microbial platforms are the most promising and sustainable method. This study shows that Citrobacter freundii is a better test platform than Escherichia coli for testing various combinations of cellulases for the development of microbial systems for biomass conversion. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Experimental research on the thermochemical catalytic liquefaction of bloom-forming cyanobacteria (BC) was carried out to determine the effects of solvent, catalyst, reaction time, temperature, the ratio of raw material to solvent, and catalyst dosage on liquefaction performance. The liquefaction conditions were optimized by central composite design (CCD) experiments as follows: concentrated H2SO4 content, 6.6%; reaction temperature, 175 °C; reaction time, 30 min; and ratio of material to solvent, 1:4. The liquefaction yield and oil yield (chloroform phase) reached 93.85% and 37.96% under the above-mentioned conditions. The ultimate analysis and calorific value of the oil were determined, and the chemical composition of the oil was investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The analysis of bio-oil composition showed that bio-oil from BC mainly contains ethyl palmitate, which is the main component of palm oil biodiesel, with a heating value of 32.7 MJ/kg. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the recent decades, the energy demand for transport and industrial sector has increased considerably. Fossil fuels which were the major fuel source for decades are no more sustainable. Biodiesel is an efficient alternative compared to depleting fossil fuels. The prospect of biodiesel as the best alternative fuel is a reliable source compared to depleting fossil fuels. Hydrogen is also considered as an attractive alternative fuel producing low emission with improved engine performance. This paper investigates the performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder compression ignition engine using hydrogen as an inducted fuel and biodiesel, aka Pongamia pinnata as injected fuel. The experiments are conducted for different quantities of hydrogen induction through the intake manifold in order to improve the performance of the engine. The performance parameters such as brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, exhaust temperature and emission quantities like HC, NOX, CO, CO2 of biodiesel fueled CI engine with variable mass flow rate of hydrogen are investigated. The performances of biodiesel combined with hydrogen at varying mass flow rates are also compared. The 10 LPM hydrogen induction with biodiesel provided 0.33% increase of brake thermal efficiency compared with diesel and increase of 3.24% to biodiesel at 80% loading conditions. The emission of HC decreased by 13 ppm, CO decreased by 0.02% by volume and CO2 decreased by 3.8% by volume for biodiesel with induction of hydrogen at 10 LPM to that of neat biodiesel for 80% load conditions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Increasing economic growth and population can improve the energy demand in all sectors, and give impact on the depletion of oil reserves. The effort to overcome this problem is increasing the production of biofuels. Biofuel is a fuel derived from vegetable oil, one of them is palm oil. Biofuel can be produced by a catalytic cracking method. In this research, we use Zn/HZSM-5 as bio-fuels catalyst. The purposes of this study are to determine the process of making Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst, determine the effect of temperature on bio-fuel producing and determine the influence of catalyst regeneration on bio- fuels yield. The method of this research was created HZSM-5 catalyst synthesis using Plank method and then impregnated with ZnSO4.7H2O to obtain Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst. Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst was made with various concentrations of Zn 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and 6%. Then it was used to produce bio-fuel with a variation of Zn concentration and variation of temperature. The best result was obtained at 4% Zn concentration which has 23.97% yield of biodiesel, 2.54% yield of bio-gasoline and 1.67% yield of bio-kerosene. By increasing the operating temperature, can increase the yield of biofuels. But by regenerating the catalyst, yield of biofuel became decreased due to the active site reduction of the catalyst. © 2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - As potential substitutes for precious metals, cobalt spinel has been considered as a promising alternative catalyst for the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of biofuels. This work reports the one-step synthesis of cobalt spinel by a more elaborated approach named pulsed-spray evaporation chemical vapor deposition with a new feedstock of Co(acac)3 and toluene. The obtained samples were comprehensively characterized in terms of structure and morphology (XRD, FTIR, Raman and SEM), chemical composition (XPS and EDS) and the redox properties (TPR/TPO). The structural and morphological analysis indicates that the synthesized thin films are pure cubic Co3O4 with homogeneous matrix with well-defined facets and straight edges. Compared to the commonly used feedstock of Co(acac)2/ethanol, Co(acac)3/toluene could result in a much higher growth rate, more lattice oxygen on the surface and better re-oxidation property. The Co3O4 film exhibits attractive performance towards the deep oxidation of n-butanol by preventing the formation of CO and acetaldehyde. The relationship between the peculiar structure and properties of Co3O4 is highlighted. The surface basic sites, specific morphology and the redox properties are proposed to play synergistic roles in the reaction sequence. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, experimental investigations on the liquefaction of Karanja Press Seed Cake (PSC) were carried out in the presence of Pyrolytic Bio-oil (PBO) produced from the slow pyrolysis of the same feedstock. The effects of PBO amount and temperature were studied with an aim to achieve the highest conversion in liquefaction experiments. Also, comparison has been established between the use of PBO and conventional solvent and acid catalyst such as phenol and sulphuric acid, respectively for achieving the highest liquefaction conversion. A detailed chemical analysis and a comparison of PBO and liquefied product (bio-crude) have been carried out using FT-IR, and GC-MS techniques. The results showed that the Karanja PSC could be directly liquefied in the presence of PBO at moderate reaction conditions. A maximum liquefaction conversion of 99% was obtained at a reaction temperature of 240 °C, a residence time of 120 min and a Karanja PSC to PBO ratio of 1:6. In contrast, ∼94% conversion was obtained for the same residence time but at significantly lower temperature of 160 °C when phenol and sulphuric acid were used in the ratio of Karanja PSC, phenol and H2SO4 as 1:2:0.6. It was observed that aromatic structure with less oxygen was evident in bio-crude compared to PBO.

AB  - In this research, a series of catalysts based on MoSe2 were synthesized by the hydrothermal method and used for the catalytic hydrogenation of alkali lignin for the first time. For 4wt.% NiSe2/MoSe2 catalyst, at 290°C, under 2MPa H2 pressure for 1.5h, the conversion of alkali lignin and the yield of bio-oil reached 96.47% and 93.68%, respectively. In addition, the composition of the product (bio-oil) was analyzed via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) spectra, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) spectra. Finally, our study demonstrated that those MoSe2-based composite catalysts can effectively degrade the biomass into bio-oil containing valuable chemical products. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis is a technology that has been widely explored in the past decade for direct conversion of solid biomass to partially upgraded bio-oil containing hydrocarbons. Zeolites, both unpromoted and promoted with metal ions, have been the most widely studied catalysts. As the yield and composition of the bio-oils from catalytic pyrolysis are a function of the catalyst employed, exploring catalyst compositions other than zeolites is necessary. Our study explored metal oxide catalysts, including sulfated zirconia, tungstated zirconia, zirconia-titania and titania (anatase and rutile), for catalyzing pinewood pyrolysis vapors; pyrolysis was carried out at 450 °C, while the catalysis was performed at 425 °C, at a weight hourly space velocity of 14 h−1. The liquid, solid (char) and gas yields varied from 36.3 to 45.2%, 15.6 to 17% and 44.3 to 37.7%, respectively. The characterization of the catalyzed bio-oils showed that the most effective, among the tested catalysts, for catalyzing the pinewood pyrolysis vapors to produce partially deoxygenated bio-oils was sulfated zirconia catalyst with bio-oil yields of 39.5%. Sulfated zirconia catalyzed bio-oil possessed 33% lower oxygen content, 56% higher heating value (HHV), and 51% lower acid value compared to uncatalyzed bio-oil. Titania catalysts favored higher bio-oil yields, with titania-rutile and titania-anatase resulting in 43% and 45% bio-oil yield, respectively. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The synthesis of new biomass-derived ethers is of great interest for the development of biofuels and biofuel additives. In this study, we report the facile synthesis of a novel bioether ethyl-4-ethoxy pentanoate (EEP) from γ-valerolactone (GVL), a well-known biomass platform compound. The formation of EEP involves the etherification of ethyl-4-hydroxyl pentanoate (EHP) formed by GVL ring opening catalyzed by H-β-zeolite in ethanol. When operated at 140 °C for 2 h under autogenous pressure, the highest EEP yield of 55% was achieved at 62% GVL conversion and 89% EEP selectivity. The EEP yield was significantly improved to 86% by increasing the reaction temperature to 160 °C, where the EEP selectivity reached ∼97%. The extraordinarily high selectivity to EEP over H-β is likely correlated to its unique structure, which has strong Lewis acid sites as well as an optimal pore size. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To explain how ethanol additive improves storage stability of pyrolysis bio-oil, comprehensive two-dimensional gas-chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC–TOFMS) was applied on crude and ethanol-stabilized bio-oils before and after accelerated aging treatment for qualitative and quantitative analysis. About 2728, 2212, 2674, and 2781 peaks were identified in crude bio-oil before aging (CBA), crude bio-oil after aging (CAA), ethanol-stabilized bio-oil before aging (ESBA), and ethanol-stabilized bio-oil after aging (ESAA), respectively, which indicated that the addition of ethanol and accelerated aging treatment could both slightly change chemical composition of bio-oils. Many kinds of chemical compounds including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ethers, furans, furanones, ketones, phenols, aromatics, sugars, etc. were detected by GC × GC–TOFMS. For ethanol-stabilized bio-oil, total relative content and number of compounds were 50.78% ± 0.33% and 313 ± 8, respectively, after aging treatment while those values were 54.21% ± 0.39% and 363 ± 3, respectively, before aging treatment. On one hand, the reduced number of compounds after aging treatment may attribute to substantial organic chemical reactions, especially polymerization reactions, which could consume small molecular substances and generate macromolecular substances. Another reason for reduced number of compounds may be that some chemicals could undergo cracking and become gases. Analysis of two-dimensional plots for each classification group of compounds in bio-oils indicated that ethanol addition and accelerated aging treatment could both change chemical components of bio-oils to some extent. Specifically, adding ethanol into bio-oil could lead to slight decrease of aldehydes, which because of aldol reactions. Also, during accelerated aging period, many significant substances were changed such as decrease of acids, ketones, aldehydes, phenols, etc., and increase of some esters and aromatics, etc. This study may provide some technical guidance for further study on stable storage and industrial application of bio-oil. © 2016 Energy Institute

AB  - In this work, we describe a simple, heterogeneous catalytic system for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 5-nonanone and 2,5-hexanedione, which we use as model compounds for more complex biomass-derived molecules. We present the stepwise reduction of ketones by using supported metal and solid acid catalysts to identify the intermediates en route to hydrocarbons. Although monoketone HDO can be achieved rapidly using moderate conditions (Ni/SiO2.Al2O3, HZSM-5, 200 °C, 1.38 MPa H2, 1 h), quantitative γ-polyketone HDO requires higher pressures and longer reaction times (Pd/Al2O3, HZSM-5, 2.76 MPa H2, 5 h), although these are more facile conditions than have been reported previously for γ-polyketone HDO. Stepwise HDO of the γ-polyketone shows the reaction pathway occurs through ring-closure to a saturated tetrahydrofuran species intermediate, which requires increased H2 pressure to ring-open and subsequently to fully HDO. This work allows for further understanding of bio-derived molecule defunctionalization mechanisms, and ultimately aids in the promotion of biomass as a feedstock for fuels and chemicals. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biomass of Flourensia oolepis, a native shrub of the semi-arid central region of Argentina, was treated by vacuum pyrolysis to investigate the potential of this species to be used as a source of energy and chemicals. In this study we determined the influence of temperature on the product yields in different plant organs (leaves and stems), characterized the bio-oil, and assessed the bioactivity of biochar aqueous extracts through germination and growth bioassays with Lactuca sativa. The pyrolysis oils showed a predominance of long chain, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the leaves pyrolysate. The sesquiterpene spathulenol was the major compound in these reactions. Pyrolysis of stems produced mainly phenolic compounds. The effect of phosphoric acid pretreatment on leaves and stems was also evaluated in order to improve bio-oil yield and selectivity to any interesting compound. The results showed that acid treatment enhanced the liquid formation in pyrolysis of leaves giving a high amount of long chain hydrocarbons compared with the untreated organ. The biochar water extracts from leaves exhibited a hormetic type of response, with a promoting growth effect on roots and shoots up to 225%, and only a transient inhibition of germination at higher doses (≥7.5% w/v). Biochar water extracts from stems did not affect seed germination and showed a remarkable promoting effect, stimulating growth at all concentrations tested up to 330%. Although additional testing is required, overall results show F. oolepis as a promissory species for the production of bio-oil and biochar with a wide range of applications, including the potential use as growth regulator. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a potential process for bioethanol production from Hydrodictyon reticulatum (HR), a filamentous freshwater alga, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (KCTC7017). From the sugar solutions prepared by the four different hydrolysis methods, bioethanol production ranged from 11.0 g/100 g dried material (acid hydrolysis) to 22.3 g/ 100 g dried material (enzymatic hydrolysis, EH). Bioethanol was fermented from a highly concentrated sugar solution obtained by a decompression-mediated (vacuum) enrichment method (VE). As the results, ethanol was more efficiently produced from HR when sugar solutions were concentrated by VE following EH (EH/VE). Using multiple feeding of the sugar solution prepared by EH/VE from HR, ethanol reached up to a concentration of 54.3 g/l, corresponding to 24.9 g/100 g dried material, which attained the economic level of product concentration (approximately 5%). The results indicate that by using HR, it is feasible to establish a bioethanol production process, which is effective for using microalgae as the raw material for ethanol production. © 2017 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - We assess the impact of a potential TTIP bilateral free trade agreement on the EU and US bio-economies (feedstock, biofuels, by-products, and related competing crops) and major trade partners in these markets. The analysis develops a multi-market model that incorporates bilateral trade flows (US to EU, EU to US, and similarly with third countries) and is calibrated to the OECD-FAO baseline for 2013–2022 to account for recent policy decisions. The major policy reforms from a TTIP involve tariff and TRQ liberalisation and their direct contractionary impact on US sugar supply, EU biofuel production, and indirect negative effect on US high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) production. EU sugar and isoglucose production expand along with US ethanol and biodiesel and oilseed crushing. EU sugar would flow to the US, US biofuels and vegetable oil to the EU. We further quantify non-tariff measures (NTM) affecting these trade flows between the EU and the US. EU oilseed production contracts, and EU crushing expands with improving crushing margins following reduced NTM frictions. Our analysis reveals limited net welfare gains with most net benefits reaped by Brazil and not the two trading partners of the TTIP. © 2016 The Agricultural Economics Society

AB  - This study focuses on the ultrasonic pretreatment of bio-oil produced from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae. Ultrasonic pretreatment would increase the viscosity of the bio-oil. Time was the most influential factor affecting the viscosity of the bio-oil and increasing the time significantly increased the viscosity of the bio-oil. Ultrasonic pretreatment could increase the H/C molar ratio of the bio-oil. Ultrasonic frequency has little effect on the properties of the bio-oil. Basically, the pretreated bio-oil produced at a higher temperature, longer reaction time, higher frequency, and higher power contained lower N. However, contrary results were observed for the O content. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study investigated the production of crude bio-oils from three laboratory cultivated and two commercial grade algal biomass sources via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process. Results demonstrated the crude bio-oils generated from laboratory cultivated algae fed 5% anaerobic digestion effluent as sole nutrient source have similar thermochemical characteristics as comparison with that of derived from commercial algae. The HTL conditions were optimized (300°C for 20 min) and the generated bio-oils were characterized by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analyses and simulated distillation by thermogravimetric analysis. The bio-oil yields were between 28 and 41%. The bio-oils were mainly comprised of fatty acids and alkanes. These bio-oils can be further upgraded and refined into value added transportation fuels and chemicals. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 781–787, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - Current biomass deoxygenation technologies require large quantities H2. Gaseous hydrogen is not a naturally-occurring raw material and is largely produced industrially via natural gas/methane steam reforming. Due to its high thermodynamic stability, direct use of methane as a hydrogen-donor for deoxygenation of complex oxygenates has not yet been demonstrated. Using catalytic pyrolysis studies performed at 700 °C with isotope labeled methane and glucose over Ni, Pt, Mo, and Ga impregnated HZSM-5 (Si/Al ratio 30), here we show that methane, in fact, could be used as a direct hydrogen donor for deoxygenation reactions. The amount of aromatic hydrocarbons produced increased primarily in the presence of Mo (125 % increase), and to a lesser degree, Pt (50 % increase), and Ni (22 % increase) impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts in a methane environment. Based on the metal present, results indicate the occurrence of distinct and concurrent reactions to various degrees: methane (steam) reforming and oxygenate dehydration reaction; independent aromatization of methane and oxygenates; and an intriguing methane oxygenate cross-coupling reaction where both hydrogen and carbon from methane ending up in resultant deoxygenated aromatic products. This technique paves way for the direct use of methane/natural gas for deoxygenation reactions critical to biorefining. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Abstract: Scum from grease traps and sludge from wastewater are an oil-rich waste from the wastewater treatment plants. To mitigate possible negative impacts on the environment, the production of biodiesel from grease traps and sludge from sumps and septic tanks was investigated. These wastes are characterized by a high content of free fatty acids (FFA) and processed towards biodiesel by acidic esterification. The reaction of FFAs by an acid catalyst was optimized through a response surface methodology. The best conversion (95.3%) was obtained with acid catalyser (1.5% w/w oil/4 h) and raw material from the grease trap at the university restaurant at 70 °C and a molar ratio of 1:9 (oil/alcohol). In conclusion, there is viability of biofuels production through the use of sanitation waste as raw material. Graphical Abstract: Scum and sludge are an oil-rich waste from the sewage treatment plants. To mitigate possible negative impacts on the environment, these raw materials were used as feedstock for biodiesel production.

AB  - This paper presents a review of the literature available on biofuels production through different chemical catalytic routes. Biofuels are promising alternative to the fast-depleting fossil fuel and oil reserves. In consideration of the existing environmental issues, such as greenhouse effect and global warming, researchers are now interested in biofuels production from biomass. Biofuels are produced from renewable and sustainable bioresources, which are available globally in the form of residual agricultural biomass and wastes. However, the biofuels production process through chemical transformation could be very expensive and uneconomical for large-scale commercial supply. Hence, there is a continuous need for improvisation on the research on this topic. This review broadly describes the different types of biofuels and the processes for their production through catalytic routes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and characterize industrial solid wastes generated by a biodiesel production plant in Brazil, as well as to present strategies for the management of these materials. This plant produces every year around 100,000 tons of biodiesel from vegetable oils and animal fats. The methodology of the study included technical visits, interviews with the operational and environmental management staff as well as analysis of documents, reports and computerized data systems. An approach to reduce the generation of hazardous waste was investigated. It was take into account the amount of raw material that was processed, reduction of landfill disposal, and the maximization of the their recycling and reuse. The study also identified the sources of waste generation and accordingly prepared an evaluation matrix to determine the types of waste with the higher potential for minimization. The most important residue of the process was the filter material impregnated with oil and biodiesel, requiring, therefore, measures for its minimization. The use of these residues in the production of ceramic artefacts (light bricks) was considered to be very promising, since no significant effect on the physico-chemical and mechanical properties of the artefacts produced was observed. Phytotoxicity test using seeds of Lactuva sativa (lettuce), Brassica juncea (mustard), Abelmoschus esculentus (okra), Chrysanthemum leucanthemum (daisy), Dendranthema grandiflorum (chrysanthemum) and Allium porrum (leek) were carried out. The results clearly show incorporation of the waste material into bricks did not influence relative germination and relative root elongation in comparison to control tests. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report on the elaboration of nanoparticulate SO42--ZrO2 solid acid catalyst for conversion of free fatty acids into biofuel. Three different morphological modifications of zirconia were prepared with the sol-gel method and compared as acid supports: polydispersed nanopowder (PNP), monodispersed nanopowder (MNP), and monodispersed nanoparticles coating (MNC). The size-selected zirconia-oxo-alkoxy (ZOA) nanoparticles of 3.6 nm diameter were prepared in a rapid micromixing reactor and either precipitated (MNP) or deposited on glass beads (MNC). The polydispersed 4/100/500 nm ZOA particles were prepared in nonparent alcohol for realization of PNP powders. The grafting of SO42- groups was realized on the three ZOA supports by wet impregnation method, and three catalysts were prepared after the subsequent drying and thermal treatment stages. The temperature of thermal treatment strongly affects the stability of the solid acid complex and serves to be an important factor of the preparation process. A strong retention of carbon on the surface of smallest zirconia nanoparticles induces their sintering, thus reducing the active area; therefore, the supported size-selected nanoparticles appear to be the best solution for realization of an efficient catalyst. The best acid complex stability in terms of reuse number was obtained with the thermal treatment temperature of ∼580 °C, and the specific activity (normalized on catalyst mass) of MNC catalyst toward palmitic acid conversion to methyl palmitate was found to be almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of PNP and MNP catalysts. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The use of biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels in compression ignition engines and aftertreatment technologies may affect vehicle exhaust emissions. In this study two 2012 light-duty vehicles equipped with direct injection diesel engines, diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), diesel particulate filter (DPF), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) were tested on a chassis dynamometer. One vehicle was tested over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) cycle on seven biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel blends. Both vehicles were exercised over double Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Highway fuel economy test (HWFET) cycles on ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) and a soy-based biodiesel blend to investigate the aerosol hygroscopicity during the regeneration of the DPF. Overall, the apparent hygroscopicity of emissions during nonregeneration events is consistently low (κ < 0.1) for all fuels over the FTP cycle. Aerosol emitted during filter regeneration is significantly more CCN active and hygroscopic; average κ values range from 0.242 to 0.439 and are as high as 0.843. Regardless of fuel, the current classification of "fresh" tailpipe emissions as nonhygroscopic remains true during nonregeneration operation. However, aftertreatment technologies such as DPF, will produce significantly more hygroscopic particles during regeneration. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a significant enhancement of hygroscopic materials emitted during DPF regeneration of on-road diesel vehicles. As such, the contribution of regeneration emissions from a growing fleet of diesel vehicles will be important. (Graph Presented). © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Two types of Animal Fatty Wastewater Sludges (AFWS 1 and 2) were analyzed and fully characterized to determine their suitability for conversion into biofuel. AFWS 1 was determined to be unsuitable as it contains 68.8 wt.% water and only 32.3 wt.% dry material, of which only around 80% is lipids to be converted. AFWS 2 has only 15.7 wt.% water and 84.3 wt.% dry material of which is assumed to 100% lipids as the protein and ash contents were determined to be negligible. The 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) catalyzed esterification of AFWS with 1-butanol was performed in a novel batch reactor fitted with a drying chimney for the “in situ” removal of water and optimized using a non-conventional Doehlert surface response methodology. The optimized condition was found to be 1.66 mol equivalent of 1-butanol (with respect to total fatty acid chains), 10 wt.% of DBSA catalyst (with respect to AFWS) at 105 °C for 3 h. Fatty Acid Butyl Esters (FABEs) were isolated in good yields (95%+) as well as a blend of FABEs with 1-butanol (16%). The two potential biofuels were analyzed in comparison with current and analogous biofuels (FAME based biodiesel, and FABE products made from vegetable oils) and were found to exhibit high cetane numbers and flash point values. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents a comprehensive near infrared study for in-line monitoring of the esterification reaction of high acid oils, such as Jatropha curcas oil, using ethanol. Parallel reactions involved in the process were carried out to select a spectral region that characterizes the evolution of the esterification reaction. Using absorbance intensities at 5176 cm− 1, the conversion and kinetic behaviors of the esterification reaction were estimated. This method was applied to evaluate the influence of temperature and catalyst concentration on the estimates of initial reaction rate and ester conversion as responses to a 22 factorial experimental design. Employment of an alcohol/oil ratio of 16:1, catalyst concentration of 1.5% w/w, and temperatures at 65 °C or 75 °C, made it possible to reduce the initial acidity from 18% to 1.3% w/w, which is suitable for transesterification of high free fatty acid oils for biodiesel production. Using the proposed analytical method in the esterification reaction of raw materials with high free fatty acid content for biodiesel makes the monitoring process inexpensive, fast, simple, and practical. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of macroalgae residue was accomplished with seven kinds of amine catalysts for chemical and bio-oil production. The effect of HTL conditions on product distribution was investigated, and results showed that both temperature and amines concentration have significant effects on conversion of macroalgae residue to liquid products and bio-oil. The effect of different amines on composition of liquid products and bio-oil was also studied. The main ingredient of liquid products were organic acids, and the yield of organic acids declined with the increase of alkyl chain in amines. The yield of bio-oil increased with the addition of alkyl chain for primary amines and tertiary amines, while decreased for secondary amines. Methylamine had the highest yield of liquid products of 79.09 wt%, and the highest bio-oil yield of 24.37 wt% was obtained in the presence of triethylamine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work reports the successful harvesting of energy from waste produced in a microfluidic device using a fuel cell. A miniaturized glucose air-breathing microfluidic fuel cell (ABμFFC) was designed, fabricated and tested with three different configurations according to their electrode nature: inorganic, hybrid and biofuel cell. Each ABμFFC was characterized using an ideal medium, with sterile cell culture medium, and with waste produced on a microfluidic device. The inorganic-ABμFFC exhibited the highest performance compared to the rest of the configurations. As a proof-of-concept, cancer cells were cultured on a microfluidic device and the consumed cell culture media (glucose concentration <11 mM) was used as an energy source without further treatment, into the inorganic-ABμFFC. The fuel cell generated a maximum total power of 5.2 μW, which is enough energy to power low-consumption microelectronic chips. This application demonstrates that the waste produced by microfluidic applications could be potentially scavenged to produce electrical energy. It also opens the possibility to develop truly energy self-sufficient portable devices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Seven algae strains isolated from the Great Salt Plains of Oklahoma (UTEX SP20, SP22, SP38, SP46, SP47, SP48, and SP50) were examined in this study. Biomass thermal degradation behavior of each strain was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis. Kinetic parameters were determined using an iso-conversional approach. Algal biomass was used for bio-oil production via microwave-Assisted pyrolysis, and the effects of final temperature on product yields and biooil composition were evaluated. Thermogravimetric analyses revealed that pyrolysis of algal biomass took place in three stages, with major weight loss occurring at the second stage from around 150°C to 400°C. Biomass of SP38 had the lowest average apparent activation energy (102.8 kJ mol-1), indicating that biomass of SP38 requires the least energy for pyrolysis among the seven strains. SP46 was selected out of the seven strains for microwave-Assisted pyrolysis because of its high final biomass concentration and biomass productivity. As the final temperature increased from 450°C to 750°C, the bio-oil yield increased from 4.6% to 22.5% during microwave-Assisted pyrolysis of biomass generated by SP46. The major compounds in the bio-oil were acids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, and organic nitrogen compounds. Microwave-Assisted pyrolysis of algal biomass did not produce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures higher than 450°C.

AB  - High purity hydrogen has been obtained by “steam-iron” process from lighter fractions of synthetic bio-oils of different compositions in a single fixed bed reactor operating cyclically. This process in closely related to chemical looping producing and purifying hydrogen in a single reactor. The feedstock consisted of a blend of four model compounds representing the lighter fractions of a bio-oil. Acetic acid has been chosen as representative of the acidic fraction, hydroxyacetone of the ketonic/aldehydic, methanol of the alcoholic and finally water of the aqueous one. Content of each model compound in the mixture has been fixed by design of experiments techniques according to composition of real bio-oils found in literature. First step involves the reduction of an iron oxide at several temperatures (650–850 °C) by the action of a synthetic bio-oil, which catalytically decomposes into gaseous reductive species (mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide). Solid carbon was also produced and deposited on the surface of the solid. Once the iron oxide is completely reduced, a second step consists in the oxidation of the metallic iron with steam releasing pure hydrogen. Along this reaction, and due to the low oxidation temperature (550 °C), carbon deposited in the previous step was not appreciably gasified, letting the released hydrogen be virtually free of carbon monoxide ([CO] < 20 ppm). Low proportions of water in the reductive gases have proved to exert a positive effect in the process, diminishing the residual carbon deposited on the solid bed, although decreasing reduction rates. The solid tested along this study, based on an iron oxide with small amounts of alumina and ceria, can produce pure hydrogen following a cyclic process, but exhibits a progressive loss of redox capacity of ca. 3 wt% after each cycle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-Methane Potential (BMP) tests are used to evaluate the suitability of a biomass for anaerobic digestion. BMP data are usually presented as the amount of methane produced from a kilogram of volatile solids (VS) or chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the substrate. However, the most used methods for determination of VS and COD are not always accurate. Oven drying may underestimate VS content due to loss of volatile organic compounds, and incomplete chemical oxidation may lead to underestimation of COD content. Bomb calorimetry is an attractive alternative to COD measurements, because the physical state of the biomass sample does not influence the measurement, and because sample preparation is limited. In this study, 11 biomass samples, wet and dry, were analyzed with different methods for organic content determination. COD (determined by bomb calorimetry and by wet chemistry) and VS (by Karl Fischer titration and loss on drying; LOD) were compared, and used for determination of BMP. In general, the BMP estimated on a VS basis were higher than those estimated on COD basis. For certain biomass samples the method for VS determination also greatly influenced the results; for fishery waste the BMP was estimated as 928 L kg−1 based on LOD-VS compared to 394 L kg−1 based on KF-LOD. Thus, this study shows that determination of organic content is not trivial and the method of choice strongly influences the estimation of bio-methane potentials. Bomb calorimetry offers a possibility to measure energy content directly, independent of biomass composition and physical state. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The etherification of glycerol with isoamylenes has been studied employing twelve catalytic ion-exchange resins in order to establish the basis for a novel green process coming from this renewable source. Two compositionally different experimental approaches to transform glycerol in biodiesel additives were considered i.e. using glycerol (G), tert-amyl alcohol (TAA) and/or isoamylenes (IA) in variable molar ratios. Reactions were carried out in a stainless steel batch minireactor at temperatures between 313 and 348 K, autogenous pressure to 1.5 MPa and 1–24 h reaction time. The influence of initial molar ratio of reactants, temperature, pressure, reaction time and the catalyst employed were evaluated to optimise the process and attain the maximum conversion of glycerol. Optimization of mixtures of glycerol with TAA resulted in maximum glycerol conversion attaining 51% whilst greater glycerol conversions close to 70% were achieved using mixtures of glycerol/isoamylenes/tert-amyl alcohol. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The low temperature dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis of two potential European energy crops − giant reed and cardoon have been studied for separation and valorization of total hemicellulosic carbohydrates prior to fractionation of cellulose and lignin, viewing as entry point to integrated biorefining scheme. The combined severity factor (CSF) was used to assess, on comparative basis, the selectivity and efficiency of xylan-to-xylose conversion and its effect on enzymatic digestibility of residual cellulose. The reliable quantitative correlations have been established for the first time between the CSF and the main outputs of acid and enzymatic hydrolysis. Xylose recovery of ca. 94% and 86% (as max.) was achieved at CSF 1.90 and 1.97, respectively for giant reed and cardoon, with formation of ca. 2.4% glucose, 1.1% furfural, 0.5% HMF and 3.2% acetic acid. Under these CSF levels, the enzymatic digestibility of residual cellulose was improved only up to 0.75 and 0.80 (75% and 80% total Glc recovery, respectively for giant reed and cardoon), vs. 0.09 and 0.19 for untreated biomass. The digestibility was further improved to 0.93 and 0.98 with increase in hydrolysis severity up to CSF 2.44, while substantial loss of xylose (ca. 40%) and furans formation (ca. 5% furfural) was found. The essential effect of cardoon stalk morphology on uniformity and modeling of biorefining separation processes was noted. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Three-dimensional nanoarchitectures of Co3O4@multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Co3O4@MWNTs) were synthesized via a one-step process with hydrothermal growth of Co3O4 nanoparticles onto MWNTs. The structure and morphology of the Co3O4@MWNTs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrocatalytic mechanism of the Co3O4@MWNTs was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Co3O4@MWNTs exhibited high electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation in alkaline medium and could be used in nonenzymatic electrochemical devices for glucose oxidation. The open circuit voltage of the nonenzymatic glucose/O2 fuel cell was 0.68 V, with a maximum power density of 0.22 mW cm-2 at 0.30 V. The excellent electrochemical properties, low cost, and facile preparation of Co3O4@MWNTs demonstrate the potential of strongly coupled oxide/nanocarbon hybrid as effective electrocatalyst in glucose fuel cells and biosensors. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - In this study, the aim was to characterize to bio-oil, obtained hazelnut cupula via catalytic fast pyrolysis in a fixed bed tubular reactor. The hazelnut cupula sample investigated in this study has been taken from Trabzon, located in Black Sea Region of Turkey. The liquid phase, obtained bio-oils without and with ZnO catalyst consisted aqueous and oil phases, which were separated and weighed. The pentane soluble phase yields of 56.00% and 68.60% were obtained without and with catalyst at 600°C, respectively.The oil phase and the subfractions of pentane-soluble fraction, obtained without and with ZnO catalyst were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, and the pentane subfraction was analyzed by gas chromatography. It was determined that the ratio of oxygen in bio-oil reduced from 18.15 wt% to 11.75 wt% with the use of ZnO catalyst (6 wt% of feed). The action of the ZnO catalyst in removing the oxygen from the bio-oil is evident from the much reduced oxygen content of the oils. According to the experimental results the liquid products can be used as liquid fuels and chemical feedstock. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper mainly describes the application of silylated SBA-15 with high hydrothermal stability in catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Dunaliella (D.) tertiolecta to produce bio-oil. The results indicated that selection of silylation reagent species contributes to improve hydrothermal stability of SBA-15 at 613 K through substituting hydroxyl group on SBA-15 surface. The grafting of silane on SBA-15 had an impact on pore size, wall thickness, specific surface area, pore volume, and other structure characteristics, while not influencing the ordered mesoporous pore structure. When silylated SBA-15 was used as catalyst, D. tertiolecta conversion and bio-oil yield decreased slightly due to adsorption of furan and other compounds on mesoporous structure of SBA-15. Silylated SBA-15 inhibited ammonolysis, Maillard, and other reactions, resulting in decreased acid, ester, amide, and N-containing heterocyclic content in bio-oil. Meanwhile, the content of aldehydes and ketones increases, among which furfural derivatives were the main substances (>70%). Highly selective HTL is realized over silylated SBA-15 with high hydrothermal stability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The application of biocatalysts in the transesterification process of triglycerides (TG) allows integrating the glycerol in the form of monoglyceride (MG), sharply increasing the yield and the environmental sustainability of the conventional biodiesel production process. This is known as Ecodiesel. To overcome the inconvenient of the high cost of the currently employed highly purified commercial enzymes, the use of scarcely purified extracts obtained from standard strains of the same species of commercial lipases currently applied in this process is being investigated. Thus, Candida antarctica type B (CALB) was chosen to determine the optimal conditions of culture of this yeast. The standard strain was obtained from the Spanish Type Microbial Cultures Collection (CECT) and has been used to carry out several studies to elucidate its optimum growth conditions. Through a process of lyophilization with prior dialysis of the liquid cultures, the enzymatic extracts were obtained. The different obtained cultures have been applied as biocatalysts in the 1,3-selective transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol to obtain Ecodiesel (FAEE + MG). Selectivity and reaction yields were obtained by gas chromatography. Acceptable yields are obtained during the reaction time as well as in successive reactions, demonstrating the feasibility of using these CALB enzymatic extracts as biocatalysts. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Guanine-ionic liquid derived ordered mesoporous carbon (GIOMC) decorated with gold nanoparticles was used as electrocatalyste for NADH oxidation and electrochemical platform for immobilization of glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme. The resulting GIOMC/AuNPs on the glassy carbon electrode can be used as novel redox-mediator free for NADH sensing and this integrated system (GIOMC/AuNPs/GDH) shows excellent electrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation. Furthermore, the ionic liquid derived ordered mesoporous carbon derivate with Ph-SO3H (IOMC-PhSO3H) decorated with AuNPs has been developed to bilirubin oxidase enzyme (BOD) immobilization and the GC/IOMC-PhSO3H/BOD integrated system shows excellent bioelectrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction. The proposed mesostructured platforms decorated by AuNPs have been developed to enhance mass transfer and charge transfer from biocatalyst to electrode, leading these bioanode and biocathode used for biofuel cell assembly. Integration designed bioanode and biocathode yielding a membrane-less glucose/O2 biofuel cell with power density of 33 (mW.cm−2) at 257 mV. The open circuit voltage of this biofuel cell and maximum produced current density were 508 mV and 0.252 (mA.cm−2) respectively. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This study argues that CO2 can be used to modify the composition of bio-oil generated from hydrothermal liquefaction of two different microalgae such as Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and Nannochloropsis oceanica (N. oceanica). Prior to hydrothermal liquefaction, the lipid content of microalgae was quantified as ∼2 wt% of M. aeruginosa and ∼14.5 wt% of N. oceanica. In addition, the thermal degradation of M. aeruginosa and N. oceanica was characterized to evaluate the influence of CO2 via quantifying major pyrolytic gases (i.e., H2, CH4, and CO). Hydrothermal liquefaction of these two microalgae was performed using a high-pressure batch reactor in N2 and CO2 atmospheres. The composition of chemical species containing N and O in bio-oil was significantly decreased under hydrothermal liquefaction in CO2, which meant that the quality of microalgae-derived bio-oil was improved. In addition, the use of CO2 allowed the production of more petro-diesel like bio-oil. This study suggests a practical means for utilizing CO2 for the production of high-quality bio-oil from toxic and economic microalgal biomass. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, castor oil (CO) has been investigated as a potential source for biodiesel production in Bangladesh. Castor oil has been extracted from the seeds by mechanical press and the Soxhlet extraction method. Maximum oil content of 55.7% has been found by the Soxhlet extraction method. The physicochemical properties such as free fatty acid (FFA) content, kinematic viscosity, saponification value, and density of the oil have been measured by different standard methods. The FFA content and viscosity have been found considerably higher such as 33.5% and 253 mm2/s, respectively. Biodiesel has been prepared using a three-step method comprising of saponification of oil followed by acidification of the soap and esterification of FFA. The overall yield of FFA from CO is found to be around 89.2%. The final step is esterification that produces fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and a maximum 97.4% conversion of FFA to biodiesel has been observed. The effect of the oil to methanol molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and time has been investigated for esterification reaction and optimized using the response surface methodology. 1H NMR of crude castor oil and castor oil methyl ester (COME) was studied and analyzed that confirms the complete conversion of castor oil to biodiesel. Finally, the biodiesel, produced under optimum conditions, was characterized using the various standard method and found comparable with petro-diesel and biodiesel standard. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This contribution describes the development of a chromatographic method capable of simultaneously identifying and quantifying the constituents found in oleaginous biomass - including algae oil - and in biofuel samples through a single cost-effective analysis. Major constituents of the aforementioned analytes include oxygen- and/or nitrogen-containing compounds along with fuel-like hydrocarbons. A novel simulated distillation gas chromatographic (SimDist) technique including dual detection capabilities - specifically flame ionization (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS) - produced identical chromatograms with perfectly aligned signals. FID chromatograms afforded excellent quantitative data while the corresponding MS spectra enabled accurate and thorough compound identification. Simulated distillation data displayed a remarkably linear relationship between retention time and the boiling point of heteroatom-containing compounds in addition to n-alkanes. Indeed, although standard SimDist data were calibrated using the boiling points of n-alkanes, analyses involving other compounds yielded insights into the effect of additional functionalities on both retention time and response factor. Notably, the method developed proved superior relative to commonly employed techniques in the identification and quantification of polyunsaturated fatty acids in algae oil. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Oil derived from fast pyrolysis of biomass (or bio-oil) is a candidate renewable feedstock for producing hydrogen (H2). In this work, the steam reforming of model oxygenates present in the bio-oil aqueous fraction was studied in a fixed-bed reactor. Using Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, the reactions with 2-butanone, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, ethyl acetate and butyraldehyde were studied. To study the efficacy of the chosen catalyst for H2 production, experiments were performed in the 623–773 K range using varying steam/carbon ratios in feed (15–25 mol/mol). The conversion of the various feeds was of the order: butyraldehyde &gt; ethyl acetate &gt; 1-methoxy-2-propanol &gt; 2-butanone. The catalyst was characterized using SEM, XRD, TPR/TPD and TGA methods. It showed high stability for 7 h of time-on-stream. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The improvement of the hydrogen-poor composition of bio-oil is important for its cracking to produce aromatic hydrocarbons. In this work, a mild hydrogenation pre-treatment and methanol cocracking were combined to implement proper hydrogen supplementation for cracking. Acetic acid (HAc), hydroxypropanone (HPO), and cyclopentanone (CPO) were selected as model compounds and mixed to prepare a simulated distilled fraction (SDF) of bio-oil. The hydrogen supply and transfer behaviours in hydrogenation-cracking were investigated. For the conversion of individual components: HAc was difficult to be hydrogenated, and therefore in the cracking stage, the conversion and oil phase yield were low; ketones were successfully hydrogenated to alcohols, and thus high aromatic hydrocarbon yields were achieved. Hydrogenation-cracking of SDF showed that the inferior performance of HAc was improved by an internal hydrogen transfer, namely the alcohols produced from ketones supplied hydrogen for HAc conversion. However, because of the high HAc content in SDF, this hydrogen supplement was not sufficient. Therefore, methanol (MeOH) was used as the coreactant for secondary hydrogen supply. The integral efficient conversion of SDF and MeOH to aromatic hydrocarbons was achieved when the MeOH blending ratio was 30%. Finally, a reaction mechanism of hydrogenation-cocracking was proposed.

AB  - Valeric acid is an important renewable platform chemical that can be produced efficiently from lignocellulosic biomass. Upgrading of valeric acid by catalytic pyrolysis has the potential to produce value added biofuels and chemicals on an industrial scale. Understanding the different mechanisms involved in the thermal transformations of valeric acid on the surface of nanometer-sized oxides is important for the development of efficient heterogeneously catalyzed pyrolytic conversion techniques. In this work, the thermal decomposition of valeric acid on the surface of nanoscale SiO2, γ-Al2O3, CeO2/SiO2, Al2O3/SiO2 and TiO2/SiO2 has been investigated by temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry (TPD MS). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has also been used to investigate the structure of valeric acid complexes on the oxide surfaces. Two main products of pyrolytic conversion were observed to be formed depending on the nano-catalyst used—dibutylketone and propylketene. Mechanisms of ketene and ketone formation from chemisorbed fragments of valeric acid are proposed and the kinetic parameters of the corresponding reactions were calculated. It was found that the activation energy of ketenization decreases in the order SiO2&gt;γ-Al2O3&gt;TiO2/SiO2&gt;Al2O3/SiO2, and the activation energy of ketonization decreases in the order γ-Al2O3&gt;CeO2/SiO2. Nano-oxide CeO2/SiO2 was found to selectively catalyze the ketonization reaction. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Fly ash-derived HZSM-5 catalyst was first applied in the catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha residues in a semi-continuous fixed-bed reactor. The catalytic performance of HZSM-5 catalysts prepared from chemicals including conventional hydrothermal HZSM-5, Ni/HZSM-5 by ion exchange, and commercial HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 30) was evaluated for comparison. Catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha residues with HZSM-5 catalysts was investigated in terms of product yields and qualities of bio-oil and bio-char. The liquid yield produced from fly ash-derived HZSM-5 was 29.4%, which was comparable to those obtained from chemicals and commercial (30.2–32.2%). Fly ash-derived HZSM-5 had high efficiency in increasing desirable compounds such as aliphatics and phenols as well as decreasing oxygenates and particularly N-containing compounds in bio-oils. The higher heating values and pH value of catalytic bio-oil achieved from fly ash-derived HZSM-5 were comparable to those achieved from HZSM-5 prepared from chemicals and commercial. The bio-char had 48–50 wt% carbon and was classified as mesoporous material. Overall, HZSM-5 derived from fly ash showed potentials to use as a catalyst for catalytic pyrolysis application. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Triacylglycerols (TAGs) and wax esters (WEs) are important neutral lipids which serve as energy reservoir in some plants and microorganisms. In recent years, these biologically produced neutral lipids have been regarded as potential alternative energy sources for biofuel production because of the increased interest on developing renewable and environmentally benign alternatives for fossil fuels. In bacteria, the final step in TAG and WE biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by wax ester synthase/acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA):diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT). This bifunctional WS/DGAT enzyme is also a key enzyme in biotechnological production of liquid WE via engineering of plants and microorganisms. To date, knowledge about this class of biologically and biotechnologically important enzymes is mainly from biochemical characterization of WS/DGATs from Arabidopsis, jojoba and some bacteria that can synthesize both TAGs and WEs intracellularly, whereas little is known about WS/DGATs from eukaryotic microorganisms. Results: Here, we report the identification and characterization of two bifunctional WS/DGAT enzymes (designated TrWSD4 and TrWSD5) from the marine protist Thraustochytrium roseum. Both TrWSD4 and TrWSD5 comprise a WS-like acyl-CoA acyltransferase domain and the recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) have substantial WS and lower DGAT activity. They exhibit WS activity towards various-chain-length saturated and polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs and fatty alcohols ranging from C10 to C18. TrWSD4 displays WS activity with the lowest Km value of 0.14 μM and the highest kcat/Km value of 1.46 × 105 M-1 s-1 for lauroyl-CoA (C12:0) in the presence of 100 μM hexadecanol, while TrWSD5 exhibits WS activity with the lowest Km value of 0.96 μM and the highest kcat/Km value of 9.83 × 104 M-1 s-1 for decanoyl-CoA (C10:0) under the same reaction condition. Both WS/DGAT enzymes have the highest WS activity at 37 and 47°C, and WS activity was greatly decreased when temperature exceeds 47°C. TrWSD4 and TrWSD5 are insensitive to ionic strength and reduced WS activity was observed when salt concentration exceeded 800 mM. The potential of T. roseum WS/DGATs to establish novel process for biotechnological production of WEs was demonstrated by heterologous expression in recombinant yeast. Expression of either TrWSD4 or TrWSD5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant H1246, which is devoid of storage lipids, resulted in the accumulation of WEs, but not any detectable TAGs, indicating a predominant WS activity in yeast. Conclusions: This study demonstrates both in vitro WS and DGAT activity of two T. roseum WS/DGATs, which were characterized as unspecific acyltransferases accepting a broad range of acyl-CoAs and fatty alcohols as substrates for WS activity but displaying substrate preference for medium-chain acyl-CoAs. In vivo characterization shows that these two WS/DGATs predominantly function as wax synthase and presents the feasibility for production of WEs by heterologous hosts. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The influence of temperature on bio-oil, biochar, and non-condensable gas yields obtained from bagasse pyrolysis in a fixed bed reactor was shown. A model based on market prices of non-condensable gas, biochar, pyrolysis liquid, and sugarcane bagasse was developed to estimate the temperature that maximizes the marginal gain of pyrolysis. The mathematical model also considered the products mass yields and the amount of biomass needed to supply the pyrolysis processing power. Based on fixed bed reactor experimental data, it was possible to describe functions of the mass yields and calorific values of products and the energy needed by reactor for different levels of process temperature. Considering instabilities linked to the process’s problems and scale-up, it was possible to predict that the best working temperature option is 549 °C for the fixed bed reactor and that the fast pyrolysis reactor was the best option among the analyzed reactors with a marginal gain of .1274/kg of bagasse transformed into products.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Macroalgae has high potential as a bio-fuel feedstock due to its high carbohydrate content. Conventional aqueous systems require a huge amount of energy to catalyze depolymerization and hydrolysis of macroalgae. Recently various task-specific ionic liquids (ILs) successfully depolymerized different biomasses, but were thermally unstable. A variety of dicationic acidic ILs (DAILs) connected by oligo-ethylene glycol (EG) chains bearing hydrogen sulfate (HSO4 −) anions were synthesized with better thermal stability and utilized in hydrolysis of macroalgal biomass, Gelidium amansii. RESULTS: The structures of DAILs were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR as well as FT-IR. EG-linker chain lengths and dicationic structure increased the thermal stability of DAILs and influenced their catalytic performance for G. amansii hydrolysis. DAILs linked with short oligo-EG chains afforded higher sugar yields and exhibited faster hydrolysis rates compared with those linked by long oligo-EG chains (i.e. PEG400 and PEG600). A maximum sugar yield of 67.45 wt% was recovered from G. amansii using [Tri-EG-(MIm)2] 2HSO4 DAIL, after 3 min at 120 °C. CONCLUSION: The synthesized DAILs showed dual properties as catalyst and reaction medium for hydrolysis of macroalgae in solvent-less conditions. Shorter oligo-EG chain linked DAILs exhibited faster reaction rates with higher sugar yields. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Background Depletion of petroleum resources has enforced the search for alternative sources of renewable energy. Introduction of biofuels into the market was expected to become a solution to this disadvantageous situation. Attempts to cover fuel demand have, however, caused another severe problem—the waste glycerol generated during biodiesel production at a concentration of approximately 10% w/w. This, in turn, prompted a global search for effective methods of valorization of the waste fraction of glycerol. Results Utilization of the waste fraction at 48 h with an initial glycerol concentration of 30 g·L-1 and proceeding with 62% efficiency enabled the production of 9 g·L-1 dihydroxyacetone at 50% substrate consumption. The re-use of the immobilized biocatalyst resulted in a similar concentration of dihydroxyacetone (8.7 g·L-1) in two-fold shorter time, with an efficiency of 85% and lower substrate consumption (35%). Conclusions The method proposed in this work is based on the conversion of waste glycerol to dihydroxyacetone in a reaction catalyzed by immobilized Gluconobacter oxydans cell extract with glycerol dehydrogenase activity, and it could be an effective way to convert waste glycerol into a valuable product. © 2017

AB  - In situ transesterification of wet microalgae is a promising, simplified alternative biodiesel production process that replaces multiple operations of cell drying, extraction, and transesterification reaction. This study addresses enhanced biodiesel production from Nannochloropsis gaditana at elevated temperatures. Compared with the previously reported in situ transesterification process of conducting the reaction at a temperature ranging from 95 to 125 °C, the present work employs higher temperatures of at least 150 °C. This relatively harsh condition allows much less acid catalyst with or without co-solvent to be used during this single extraction-conversion process. Without any co-solvent, 0.58% (v/v) of H2SO4 in the reaction medium can achieve 90 wt% of the total lipid conversion to biodiesel at 170 °C when the moisture content of wet algal paste is 80 wt%. Here, the effects of temperature, acid catalyst, and co-solvent on the FAEE yield and specification were scrutinized, and the reaction kinetic was investigated to understand the solvothermal in situ transesterification reaction at the high temperature. Having a biphasic system (water/chloroform) during the reaction also helped to meet biodiesel quality standard EN 14214, as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ cations and phosphorus were detected only below 5 ppm. With highlights on the economic feasibility, wet in situ transesterification at the high temperature can contribute to sustainable production of biodiesel from microalgae by reducing the chemical input and relieve the burden of extensive post purification process, therefore a step towards green process. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The present paper outlines the catalytic thermolysis of Jatropha oil carried out in laboratory model fixed bed reactor varying temperature between 340 and 420°C and at liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) 1.12, 1.87, and 2.25 h−1. Three heterogeneous catalysts, comprising of Amorphous Alumino-Silicate (AAS) loaded separately with titania (TiO2), zirconia (ZrO2) and ceria (CeO2), were successfully synthesized and used in the reaction. The study reveals that the maximum distilled liquid biofuel yield of 71% by volume could be achieved through zirconia impregnated catalyst at 380°C and 1.87 h−1 LHSV. Reaction products mainly consist of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons along with the carbon dioxide, coke, and water. The liquid product is a crude mixture of various components and hence distilled out into four fractions over the temperature range of 60-200°C. The physical properties like boiling point, specific gravity, viscosity, and calorific value of distilled biofuel fraction 1 resembles the properties of petrol whereas fractions 2 and 3 resemble diesel. Suitable blends of these fractions lead to cleaner biofuel. Life of catalyst could be enhanced by nitrogen purging practice at moderate temperature. Yield and quality of distilled biofuel product were improved by using hydroquinone as a polymerization inhibitor. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 749–757, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - Sugar-rich food waste is a sustainable feedstock that can be converted into ethanol without an expensive thermochemical pretreatment that is commonly used in first and second generation processes. In this manuscript we have outlined the pie waste conversion to ethanol through a two-step process, namely, enzyme hydrolysis using commercial enzyme products mixtures and microbial fermentation using yeast. Optimized enzyme cocktail was found to be 45% alpha amylase, 45% gamma amylase, and 10% pectinase at 2.5 mg enzyme protein/g glucan produced a hydrolysate with high glucose concentration. All three solid loadings (20%, 30%, and 40%) produced sugar-rich hydrolysates and ethanol with little to no enzyme or yeast inhibition. Enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation process mass balance was carried out using pie waste on a 1000 g dry weight basis that produced 329 g ethanol at 20% solids loading. This process clearly demonstrate how food waste could be efficiently converted to ethanol that could be used for making biodiesel by reacting with waste cooking oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel liquefaction method was developed for transforming different types of biomass, such as fir, bamboo, pine, and corncob, into bio-oil efficiently with Raney nickel (R-Ni) and NaOH as combined catalysts in a 2-propanol/H2O system, which was carried out in a 50 mL stainless-steel autoclave at 245°C, corresponding to the working pressure maintained at 8 MPa. The conversion of biomass could reach 97-99%. Besides, a high bio-oil yield of 63.98% and higher heating value of 30.09 MJ/kg were achieved when fir was used as the feedstock. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the major compounds in bio-oils were phenols, followed by acids, alcohols, ketones, and hydrocarbons, which were mainly light-weighted molecules with low boiling points measured by thermogravimetric analysis. Additionally, the R-Ni catalyst could be repeatedly used at least 5 times without the loss of activity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Renewables-based biotechnology depends on enzymes to degrade plant lignocellulose to simple sugars that are converted to fuels or high-value products. Identification and characterization of such lignocellulose degradative enzymes could be fast-tracked by availability of an enzyme activity measurement method that is fast, label-free, uses minimal resources and allows direct identification of generated products. We developed such a method by applying carbohydrate arrays coupled with MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry to identify reaction products of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. We describe the production and characterization of plant polysaccharide-derived oligosaccharides and their attachment to hydrophobic self-assembling monolayers on a gold target. We verify effectiveness of this array for detecting exo- and endo-acting glycoside hydrolase activity using commercial enzymes, and demonstrate how this platform is suitable for detection of enzyme activity in relevant biological samples, the culture filtrate of A. niger grown on wheat straw. In conclusion, this versatile method is broadly applicable in screening and characterisation of activity of CAZymes, such as fungal enzymes for plant lignocellulose degradation with relevance to biotechnological applications as biofuel production, the food and animal feed industry. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - This study explored the direct conversion of black liquor acid sediment (BLAS) into phenolics by hydrothermolysis. Experiments were successfully performed in a batch-type reactor at temperature of 260 to ∼340°C over 0-120 min. Depending on the reaction conditions, four products (bio-oil phase containing most of the phenolics, aqueous phase, char, and a small amount of gas) were formed and analyzed by element analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography (GC), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The total bio-oil yield was 16-26 wt % based on dry BLAS (D-BLAS), in which the main monomeric compounds were 2-methoxyphenol, 2, 6-dimethoxyphenol, and catechol, with yields of 0.74-1.66, 0.28-4.03, and 0-7.08 wt % based on lignin in the BLAS (BLAS-L), respectively. Analysis of char suggested BLAS-L occurred by hydrothermolytic depolymerization to give aryl-ether linkages (β-O-4 and α-O-4 bonds), hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, and aromatic rings. Finally, the reactions were almost complete because the char had no functional groups of lignin at the optimal reaction condition (300°C and 30 min). © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sulfidation of zinc oxide is a viable option for the removal of hydrogen sulfide from raw syngas and biogas. Recent experiments showed that sulfidation of nanoscopic zinc oxide particles leads to an outward growth and the formation of voids inside the particles. In this work, we derive a micro-scale model to describe this phenomenon. The model accounts for nucleation and growth of voids inside the particles, diffusion of Zn and O through the product layer, and deposition of the solid product at the particle surface as a result of the reaction between ZnO and H2S. The model is thus opposite to the well known shrinking core model where an inward growth of the product layer is assumed. To explore the effect of the outward growth on the dynamics of a packed bed adsorber the micro-scale model is combined with a macro-scale model that accounts for intra-pellet diffusion and convection along the packed bed. In the limit of fast nucleation and growth of voids inside the zinc oxide particles, the micro-scale model shows a qualitatively similar conversion profile to the shrinking core model, while when nucleation controls an inflection point in conversion profile is found. On the macro-scale, the outward growth can cause the clogging of pores inside the pellets which prevents the pellets from reaching full conversion. This leads to shorter breakthrough times of the packed bed due to the sealing of unreacted zinc oxide. Our results thus provide a possible explanation of the incomplete conversion of zinc oxide in packed beds. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Process designs for prospective first-of-a-kind (FOAK) catalytic hydropyrolysis facilities converting woody biomass residues into "drop-in" transportation fuels were developed, including some designs incorporating CO2 capture and storage (CCS). The energetic, carbon, and economic performances of these designs were simulated and analyzed. Estimated greenhouse gas emissions for the resulting fuels are far below those of conventional petroleum-derived fuels. For plant designs with CCS, the biofuels are characterized by strongly negative emissions. The additional capital costs and energy penalties for CO2 capture range from modest to high, depending on the extent of capture employed. The fuel production cost at a commercial-scale FOAK plant without CCS corresponds to a break-even crude oil price of 95 $ per bbl. At a 120 $ per t CO2,eq. greenhouse gas (GHG) emission price, the plant design that would capture about half of the CO2 available for capture would have identical production cost as the design without any CO2 capture; in both cases the break-even oil price would be 28 $ per bbl. A design maximizing CO2 capture would produce fuels with a break-even oil price of 44 $ per bbl at this GHG emission price. The prospective economics of drop-in fuels from biomass produced via catalytic hydropyrolysis appear quite favorable relative to other biofuel production systems, but can only be confirmed via demonstrations at scale. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biofuel has been considered as one of the environmentally friendly energy sources to substitute fossil fuel derived from non-edible vegetable oil. This research aims to investigate the effect of the non-edible vegetable oil composition on a specific hydrocarbons distribution contained in biofuel and the aromatics formation through hydrocracking reaction with the Co-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst. The formation of aromatics from non-edible vegetable oils, such as: Cerbera manghas, rubber seed, and sunan candlenut oils, containing saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids is presented. The hydrocracking reaction was carried out in a pressure batch reactor, a reaction temperature of 350 °C for 2 h, reactor pressure of 15 bar after flowing H2 for 1 hour, and a catalyst/oil ratio of 1 g/200 mL. Liquid hydrocarbon product was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on the GC-MS analysis, hydrocracking on three different oils indicated that polyunsaturated fatty acids were required to produce relatively high aromatics content. The sunan candlenut oil can be converted to gasoil range hydrocarbons containing a small amount of aromatic through hydrocracking reaction. Meanwhile, the aromatics in liquid product from hydrocracking of Cerbera manghas and rubber seed oils were not found. Copyright © 2017 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effects of various configurations of a chitosan film-templated biocathode on a direct electron transfer (DET)-type reaction were investigated. Self-standing electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECFs) obtained from the carbonization of polymer fibers were used as supporting material. The biocathode was built from a layered disposition of bilirubin oxidase (BOD) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) entrapped in chitosan matrix onto the surface of the ECFs. When the enzyme layer was sandwiched between two layers of MWCNTs, significant improvement of DET oxygen reduction occurred at pH 7.0, which was ascribed to the presence of local negative charges and to π-π interactions favoring enzyme orientation. The electrode preparation is simple and results in an efficient biocathode with BOD non-specifically attached to the porous material. The limiting current density of the optimized biocathode was 1.2 mA cm−2. Combined to an abiotic Au60Pt40-modified anode, the resulting hybrid glucose biofuel cell delivered an open circuit voltage and a power density value of 0.9 V and 63 μW cm−2, respectively. © 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - In this paper, a biofuel production supply chain optimization framework is developed that can supply the fuel demand for 10% of Ontario. Different biomass conversion technologies are considered, such as pyrolysis and gasification and subsequent hydro processing and the Fischer-Tropsch process. A supply chain network approach is used for the modeling, which enables the optimization of both the biorefinery locations and the associated transportation networks. Gasification of corn stover is examined to convert waste biomass into valuable fuel. Biomass-derived fuel has several advantages over traditional fuels including substantial greenhouse gas reduction, generating higher quality synthetic fuels, providing a use for biomass waste, and potential for use without much change to existing infrastructure. The objective of this work is to show the feasibility of the use of corn stover as a biomass feedstock to a hydrocarbon biofuel supply chain in Ontario using a mixed-integer linear programming model while accounting for the uncertainty in the availability of corn stover. In the case study, the exact number of biorefineries is left as a policy decision and the optimization is carried out over a range of the possible numbers of facilities. The results obta ined from the case study suggests implementing gasification technology followed by Fischer-Tropsch at two different sites in Ontario. The optimal solution satisfied 10% of the yearly fuel demand of Ontario with two production plants (14.8 billion L of fuel) a nd requires an investment of $42.9 billion, with a payback period of about 3 years. © 2017 BRTeam.

AB  - A practical strategy is developed to fabricate stable glucose/O2 biofuel cells with high power density assembled by enzymatic bio-electrodes based on three-dimensional nickel foam. The porous three-dimensional nickel foam is used as a substrate to enhance the enzyme loading, while the reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles decorating on the nickel foam are employed as the direct electron transfer system for bio-anodes and bio-cathodes. The ferrocenecarboxylic acid serves for the mediated electron transfer to further increase electron transfer rate for glucose oxidase electrodes. Covalent bond is employed to immobilize the mediator and enzymes for improving the stability of bio-electrodes and biofuel cells. As the results, the surface glucose oxidase loading reaches to 4.03 × 10−7 mol cm−2 with good enzymatic activity. Additionally, the obtained glucose/O2 biofuel cells exhibit an outstanding maximum power density of 2.84 ± 0.09 mW cm−2, with a remarkable long-term operational stability for retaining 85.5% of its performance after 70 days. In human blood, the biofuel cell shows a favorable output performance of 0.39 ± 0.04 mW cm−2, implying the appropriateness for practical applications. © 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - Fossil fuel reserves which supplying a major portion of energy needs, are depleting rapidly, and its environmental damages increases day by day. Therefore, like all developed and developing countries, our country have focused on the use of renewable energy sources. Within this scope in the our country, it was aimed gain of renewable energy sources to economy, promotion of sustainable energy production, and protection of environmental. Recently, one of the growing importance of renewable energy sources is the biomass energy. As an biomass energy source, all vegetable and animal organic substances which the main components are comprising carbohydrate compounds can be used. In these energy sources, microalgae seem promising for biofuel production due to their many advantages such as they have high photosynthetic efficiency, high biomass production, and they grow quickly. From microalgae, by using biochemical methods electricity, ethanol, hydrogen, methane and biodiesel and thermochemical methods syngas, biochar, biodiesel and electricity can be produced. In this review article, isolation of microalgae, microalgal biomass production, the methods used to biomass harvesting, and the availability of microalgae as a source of raw materials for renewable biofuels were viewed.

AB  - The separation of pyrolytic lignin in a previous thermal treatment step is essential for the viability and efficiency of the continuous hydrogen production by steam reforming (SR) of raw bio-oil. This work aimed to establish the conditions of this thermal step that maximize the bio-oil fraction liable to valorization in the subsequent SR reactor, and that lead to a better behavior of the catalyst. The influence that temperature (400-800 °C) and steam-to-carbon ratio S/C (1.5-6.0) have on the composition of resulting volatile stream and on the solid fraction (pyrolytic lignin) deposition was analyzed by feeding raw bio-oil, and a mixture of raw bio-oil and with 20 wt% of ethanol. The thermal treatment temperature affects both the yield of pyrolytic lignin (which decreases with temperature, especially in the range 400-500 °C) and its composition (so that the H/C ratio decreases as the temperature is higher). The yield of liquid fraction and its total content of oxygenates decrease notably above 500 °C. Levoglucosan content decreases, while that of phenols (especially above 650 °C), carboxylic acids (mainly acetic acid) and acetaldehyde increase markedly as temperature is raised. Temperature rise enhances formation of gaseous products (mainly CO and CO2), with H2, CH4 and hydrocarbons being promoted above 600 °C. The effect of thermal step temperature on the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst behavior was studied by analyzing the evolution with time-on-stream of bio-oil conversion and product yields. Consequently, 500 °C is the thermal treatment temperature that leads to a better compromise between H2 yield and catalyst stability, since the resulting oxygenated composition causes less deactivation of the reforming Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst, thereby attaining complete and stable bio-oil conversion and H2 yield close to 90 %. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Biomass is a potential renewable feedstock that can be used as a replacement for fossil resources. A variety of high end chemicals have been produced from biomass including ethyl levulinate, which is a viable biofuel for diesel engines. In this study, the capability of three types of imidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs) catalysts, i.e., 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM][Cl]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([BMIM][HSO4]) and 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([HMIM][HSO4]) to convert oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) and oil palm mesocarp fiber (OPMF) biomass to ethyl levulinate were compared. The procedure entailed a sequential reaction of depolymerisation of biomass at 160 °C for 3 hours, followed by an esterification at 90 °C for 12 h in excess ethanol, with ILs-To-biomass ratio of 5 : 1 by weight and 20 wt% water. It was demonstrated that only the last two acidic [HSO4]- counteranion based ILs are able to convert the biomass to ethyl levulinate. Mono-Alkylated ILs, [HMIM][HSO4], consistently gave a higher efficiency than multi-Alkylated ILs, [BMIM][HSO4], for both OPEFB and OPMF biomass conversions, with ethyl levulinate yields of 11.61 % and 13.54 %, and the process efficiencies of 39.26 % and 50.79 %. OPMF appears to be a slightly more efficient feedstock in ethyl levulinate production than OPEFB. This indicates the performance of ILs was dependent upon the character of their cation side chain, seeing that both ILs used have the same acidic [HSO4]- counteranion. The experimental results suggested that [HMIM][HSO4] has the potential to be used in ethyl levulinate production from sustainable biomass feedstocks under mild operating conditions.

AB  - A facile and low-cost method was developed to synthesize a series of novel heterogeneous catalysts from cyclodextrins and Mg or Zn of salts. These catalysts were demonstrated to be efficient for converting sustainable plant oils to biodiesel under mild conditions (ambient pressure, 65 °C). Mechanistic studies indicated that the excellent performance of the catalysts could be attributed to their unique structural characteristics, wherein both the metal ions and the cyclodextrin units worked cooperatively for synergistic activations of substrates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many studies have focused on biofuel development from non-food biomass. Second generation biofuels (2G) manufactured from waste/recycled greases and animal fats are one of the alternatives to the first generation (1G) plant oil-based biofuels. In this study, the 2G biofuel parameter dependence on waste fats’ fatty acids profile was examined. The methyl esters parameters included density, viscosity and cold filter plugging point (CFPP); and the biofuels used included waste cooking oil (WCO) and waste animal fat (WAF) obtained through low temperature one step trans-esterification process. Purified and dehydrated samples came from various batches around Poland. Each sample's animal fat content profile was obtained through gas chromatography and acid value method. The fats were transesterifcated at 60 °C with methanol 1:9 (mole/mole) and KOH 1% (m/m) catalyzer. The coefficients of reaction efficiency, viscosity as a function of temperature, density at 15 °C and cold filter plugging point were obtained. Their cause and effect dependence on fat acid's content was evaluated based on correlation coefficient (CC) values. The relative standard deviation (RSD) at 38% pointed to nonhomogeneous content of waste fats. The source of fats had no significant influence on the reaction efficiency, with 0.98 ± 0.015 kg biofuel per 1 kg of waste fat yield. The kinetic viscosity of the biofuels’ samples conformed to the EN14214 norm only with two in thirty cases. The dependence of viscosity, density and CFPP on fat acids’ profile were confirmed only for a few of studied biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper opens up a new issue dealing with Luffa cylindrica (LC) lignocellulosic biomass recovery in order to produce 2G bioethanol. LC fibers are composed of three principal fractions, namely, α-cellulose (45.80% ± 1.3), hemicelluloses (20.76% ± 0.3), and lignins (13.15% ± 0.6). The optimization of LC fibers hydrothermal and diluted acid pretreatments duration and temperature were achieved through the cubic central composite experimental design CCD. The pretreatments optimization was monitored via the determination of reducing sugars. Then, the 2G bioethanol process feasibility was tested by means of three successive steps, namely, LC fibers hydrothermal pretreatment performed at 96°C during 54 minutes, enzymatic saccharification carried out by means of a commercial enzyme AP2, and the alcoholic fermentation fulfilled with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. LC fibers hydrothermal pretreatment liberated 33.55 g/kg of reducing sugars. Enzymatic hydrolysis allowed achieving 59.4 g/kg of reducing sugars. The conversion yield of reducing sugar to ethanol was 88.66%. After the distillation step, concentration of ethanol was 1.58% with a volumetric yield about 70%. © 2017 Kaouther Zaafouri et al.

AB  - Recent studies have found that biomass has great potential as a substitute for natural fossil fuels. Although pyrolysis has always been the option for biomass-to-biofuel conversion, liquefaction technology on the other hand appears to be another alternative to obtain valuable high energy products such as biofuel, gas and char due to some disadvantages of converting biomass to biofuel via pyrolysis. In this study, the optimization of liquefaction of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) into bio-oil was studied over a series of supported Zn catalysts. 15 wt% of Zn supported on ZSM-5 showed the highest bio-oil yield conversion after the introduction of catalyst. GC-MS analysis of the bio-oil showed it to mainly consist of furfurals, followed by phenols and other minor compounds. Several parameters that were studied include the effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst composition, and catalyst loading on the product yield. The optimum conditions for the conversion of EFB (43.6%) to liquid products were 180 °C for 90 min with 0.5 wt% of 15% Zn supported on ZSM-5. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Radiofrequency-driven hydrodeoxygenation of sawdust pyrolysis vapor and the coking performance of the catalysts were investigated using Pt/Al2O3 commercial pellets mixed with steel balls inside an alumina tube. The radio-frequency induction heating of the catalyst bed was compared with a conventional method of heating using electric tape engulfing the catalyst bed reactor. Partial deoxygenation of the oil was successfully achieved in the catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil at 234 °C, with the use of the induction heater. The molar O/C ratio of the oil decreased from 1.36 to 0.51. No deoxygenation of the oil was observed using the electric tape control under identical conditions as both carbon and oxygen appeared to be removed at approximately equal rates, with the carbon being deposited in the form of coke onto the catalyst instead of being recovered in the liquid. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the catalytic performance of bimetallic NiW modified ZSM-5 catalysts for hydrocracking conversion of crude palm oil is presented. Crystalline ZSM-5 zeolites with precisely controlled SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (SARs) of 30, 50, 70 and 100 were successfully synthesized from kaolin via the hydrothermal method. To enhance their catalytic activity, as-prepared zeolites were modified with Ni, W and NiW by the impregnation technique. The catalysts were characterized by various techniques. The total amount of Ni and W in the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy technique and found to be in the range of 3.08–3.16 and 5.88–6.39 wt%, respectively. These NiW-ZSM-5 catalysts showed good activity for the production of biofuels, and their catalytic activity decreased in the order NiW-ZSM-5 &gt; Ni-ZSM-5 &gt; W-ZSM-5 &gt; ZSM-5. The incorporation of NiW improved the production of both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation hydrocarbon compounds. Moreover, the different SARs in ZSM-5 zeolite also affected the catalytic activity and NiW-ZSM-5 with SAR of 50 gave an excellent conversion (96.20%). Additionally, the types of the obtained hydrocarbon products were identified as gasoline (C5–C10), kerosene (C9–C11) and diesel (C10–C20) by simulated distillation gas chromatography-flame ionization detector and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A systematic theoretical study on the pericyclic reactions in acyclic and cyclic ether biofuels was performed. Identified reactions include the classical alcohol formation and a H2 eliminations that was recently shown to play a non negligible role in the thermal decomposition of tetrahydrofuran. Theoretical calculations performed showed negligible H2 elimination in acyclic ethers. In the case of cyclic ethers (tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran) the branching ratio of the unimolecular pericyclic reactions considerably depended on the presence of a lateral alkyl group bonded to the carbon atom in position 2. If an alkyl group is present the alcohol formation was favored through an exo 4-center rearrangement. Meanwhile if no lateral alkyl group is available in position 2 endo alcohol formation and H2 eliminations were equally important. Reaction rate rules were established to include pericyclic decomposition reactions in detailed chemical kinetic models of ether combustion.

AB  - Electrochemical biosensors based on enzymatic reaction have been applied to a wide range of fields. As the trend continues to grow, these biosensors are approaching the limit imposed by physics and chemistry. To further improve the performance of biosensors, the interplay of mass transport and enzymatic reaction kinetics, especially in enzyme cascade systems, should be considered in the design of biosensors. Herein, we propose a simple approach to studying the influence of mass transport and enzyme molecule motion on the kinetics of enzyme cascade reactions. β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) and glucose oxidase (GOx) of the enzyme cascade reaction are precisely immobilized onto the disk and ring electrodes, respectively, of a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) via covalent attachment. At a low rotating speed (<600 rpm), convective transport promotes the enzyme cascade reaction. When the rotating speed is higher than 600 rpm, the cascade reaction becomes kinetically controlled. Further increase of the rotating speed results in a slow decline in reaction rate, possibly due to the production inhibition effect. In addition, the effect of conformation change of the enzyme at higher centrifugal forces on enzyme activity should be considered. This study would shine light on the effect of convective force on regulation of kinetics of enzyme cascade reaction, offering an ideal platform for studying other enzyme cascade reactions and providing fundamentals to design high-performance biosensors, biofuel cells, and bioelectronics. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The use of supercritical methanol (scMeOH) for the liquefaction of the carbohydrate-rich macroalgae Saccharina japonica was investigated at low temperature (250–300 °C). At 300 °C, almost complete conversion (98.1 wt%) and a high bio-oil yield (66.0 wt%) were achieved. These values are higher than those achieved with supercritical ethanol (scEtOH, 87.8 wt% conversion, 60.5 wt% bio-oil yield) and subcritical water (subH2O, 91.9 wt% conversion, 40.3 wt% bio-oil yield) under identical reaction conditions. The superior liquefaction in scMeOH is attributed to the beneficial physical properties of scMeOH, including its higher polarity, superior reactivity, and higher acidity. The superior reactivity of scMeOH was evident from the larger amount of esters (54.6 area%) produced in scMeOH as compared to that in scEtOH (47.2 area%), and the larger amount of methyl/methoxy-containing compounds (78.6 area%) produced in scMeOH than that of ethyl/ethoxy-containing compounds (58.2 area%) produced in scEtOH. The higher bio-oil yield combined with its higher calorific value (29.2 MJ kg−1) resulted in a higher energy recovery of 135% for scMeOH as compared to those of scEtOH (118%) and subH2O (96%). When considering the amount of alcohol consumed during the liquefactions and the production of light bio-oil fractions that evaporate during bio-oil recovery, the higher methanol consumption (5.3 wt%) than that of ethanol (2.3 wt%) leads to similar bio-oil yields (∼51 wt%). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biofuel production from used palm oil (UPO) using supercritical ethanol (SCE) at low molar ratio was investigated in order to produce an entirely renewable fuel. The effects of the reaction time and ethanol to oil molar ratio were considered from 0.5 to 10 min and 6:1 to 18:1, respectively. The optimal parameters were 10 min and a 12:1 molar ratio, representing a remarkable reduction from 42:1 for the conventional SCE process. Because of the high operating temperature, the triglycerides conversion rate reached 99%, and the glycerides content met the international specification for biodiesel. However, an ester content of 70% was obtained at optimal conditions. The side reaction between glycerol and ethanol demonstrated a positive effect in increasing fuel yield by 8.15%. The product can be considered an alternative biofuel instead of biodiesel. © 2017 Assoc. Brasiliera de Eng. Quimica / Braz. Soc. Chem. Eng. All rights reserved.

AB  - A two-stage catalytic process for converting model bio-oil oxygenates (acetic acid, formic acid, acetol, and levoglucosan) to higher value compounds was conducted. Ketonization using iron oxide catalysts prepared from red mud was implemented in a packed bed reactor system using fast pyrolysis oil model compounds (stage one). High levels of acetone (15-25 g/L), 2-butanone (5 g/L), and cyclic ketones (9-13 g/L) were observed. Time-on-stream studies (7 h) indicated no measurable decline in conversion of acetol, formic acid, and levoglucosan and only a 4% decline in acetic acid conversion. Subsequently, a second stage continuous hydrogenation of the ketonization products was conducted using Pd on activated carbon monolith (ACM) catalysts generated from wood and Pd-C granules. The best results were achieved using the Pd-ACM catalyst at 180 °C and 300 psi (H2), which converted ketones to alcohols at 60-80%. The Pd-ACM catalyst achieved higher space time yields, selectivity, and conversions compared to Pd-C granules. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Energetic tobacco (EnT) is a type of genetically modified tobacco with a focus on energy. Its seeds are larger and appear in greater quantity than those of conventional tobacco. This plant easily adapts to unproductive soils and is practically free of nicotine. The oil seed from EnT can be used for producing biodiesel without competition with edible oils. Additionally, the resulting residual cake can be thermally degraded to bio-oil and biochar through pyrolysis processes. In this study, the fast pyrolysis (700 °C at 100 °C min-1) of the residual cake of EnT seeds was performed in a fixed bed reactor (quartz), yielding approximately 40% (in mass) liquid products (bio-oil and an aqueous phase). After removal of the aqueous phase, the organic phase was submitted to an acid-alkaline extraction of the N-compounds in a simple and efficient way. The bio-oil and alkaline extract were analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to fast-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Compounds were tentatively identified by similarity with a commercial library of mass spectra and using retention indexes. The main classes of compounds identified were phenols, hydrocarbons, and N-compounds (imidazole, pyridine, and their derivatives), with the potential to be applied in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries as well as biofuel production. The alkaline extraction resulted in the isolation of the main N-components, a finding fundamental for the utilization of these compounds for the production of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and polymers. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The world has become dependent on petroleum as a feedstock for most products that we use in our daily lives. As an alternative, bio-refineries that transform biomass into biofuels and primary chemicals are emerging. Actually, many wastes are not fully recycled. For instance, potato peel is a cheap residue available from the potato industry. Up to now, potato peel has been used mostly for livestock feeding. Here, potato peel waste was subjected to direct acid liquefaction at 160 °C in 2-ethylhexanol and diethylene glycol using p-toluene sulfonic acid as catalyst. The product was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, chemical analysis, hydroxyl number and acid value. Results show that liquefaction was achieved in yields higher than 80%. The reactional profile shows two time zones, one comprising the process of liquefaction and one corresponding to the process of decomposition. Kinetics indicate that the liquefaction process occurs 1.9 times faster than the decomposition process. Overall, our findings show for the first time that, despite the water content, potato peel waste can be used to produce bio-oil. The products can be further used as fuels or refined chemicals such as levulinic acid, furfural, 5-hydroxyfurfural, dimethyl furfural and sugars in fermentation processes. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The climate change concerns have necessitated the need for the advancement of biofuels and many countries including India have set targets for the reduction in green house gas emissions. The objective of this paper is to find the suitability of hydrotreated Jatropha curcas oil as fuel in diesel engines. The different blends of jatropha fuels were tested in a Kirloskar 4S diesel engine of 17.5:1 compression ratio, 4.4 kW, at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at various loads. The performance (brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency) and emission (CO, HC, CO2, and NOx) data of hydrotreated and transesterified jatropha oils were compared with those of petro diesel. The experimental results for HTJATB25 and HTJATB100 in DI diesel engine showed a decrease in emission with respect to petro diesel viz., (1) CO by 18.75 and 33.33 %, (2) HC by 25.6 and 47.38 %, (3) CO2 by 18.75 and 26.25 %, (4) NOx by 9.09 and 18.18 % respectively and the improved performance in brake thermal efficiency by 10.71 and 19.35, (5) brake specific fuel consumption 9.14 and 17.14 %. Also it is noted that, no engine modifications is required while using hydrotreated vegetable oil as fuel. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Abstract: Ethanol and biogas are promising alternative fuels that can be produced from inedible agricultural wastes. However, a pretreatment step is needed to make these substrates amenable to the microbial digestion. The residue of vegetable oil extraction process, called seed cake, offers potential as a feedstock for ethanol and biogas production. However, the oil extraction process may affect the performance of further processes. In this study, the effect of mechanical and solvent extraction methods of Eruca sativa grains was studied on the further ethanol and biogas production from its seed cake. The mechanically extracted seed cake (MESC) and solvent extracted seed cake (SESC) were subjected to NaOH pretreatment prior to ethanolic fermentation and anaerobic digestion. The pretreatment offered positive effects on glucose and ethanol production yield from both type of seed cake; however, the results were more promising on MESC, in which the yield improved by 301.7 %. In case of biogas production, the pretreatment substantially increased the methane production from the MESC by 105.6 %, while it showed negative effects on the SESC. The current study suggested that the oil extraction method can affect the performance of further processes on seed cake for biofuel production, especially biogas. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Background: Single cell oil (SCO) production from lignocelluloses by oleaginous microorganisms is still high in production cost, making the subsequent production of biofuels inviable economically in such an era of low oil prices. Therefore, how to upgrade the final products of lignocellulose-based bioprocess to more valuable ones is becoming a more and more important issue. Results: Differently sourced cellulases were compared in the enzymatic hydrolysis of the steam-exploded corn stover (SECS) and the cellulase from the mixed culture of Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus niger was found to have the highest enzymatic hydrolysis yield 86.67 ± 4.06%. Three-stage enzymatic hydrolysis could greatly improve the efficiency of the enzymatic hydrolysis of SECS, achieving a yield of 74.24 ± 2.69% within 30 h. Different bioprocesses from SECS to SCO were compared and the bioprocess C with the three-stage enzymatic hydrolysis was the most efficient, producing 57.15 g dry cell biomass containing 31.80 g SCO from 327.63 g SECS. An efficient and comprehensive process from corn stover to long-chain α,ω-dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) was established by employing self-metathesis, capable of producing 6.02 g long-chain DCAs from 409.54 g corn stover and 6.02 g alkenes as byproducts. Conclusions: On-site cellulase production by the mixed culture of T. reesei and A. niger is proven the most efficient in providing cellulase to the lignocellulose-based bioprocess. Three-stage enzymatic hydrolysis was found to have very good application value in SCO production by Trichosporon cutaneum from SECS. A whole process from corn stover to long-chain DCAs via a combination of biological and chemical approaches was successfully established and it is an enlightening example of the comprehensive utilization of agricultural wastes. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Global energy sectors are facing the crucial challenge of sustainability and diversification of energy resources. Seeking renewable resources with a sustainable supply is therefore a matter of the utmost concern. In this respect, bamboo, a renewable lignocellulosic material and non-food biomass, has great potential to be utilized to produce energy. Several studies have been conducted on a wide range of bamboo species and the results have shown that bamboo could potentially be used as a suitable fuel because it shares desirable fuel characteristics present in other woody biomass. Bamboo can be used as an energy source by converting it into solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels. However, to utilize bamboo as a high promise energy crop resource for biofuels, a secure and stable supply is required. Therefore, additional information on the availability, cultivation, and harvesting operations of bamboo is vital to ensure the practicability of the idea. The objective of this review is to highlight the potential of bamboo as an alternative source of bioenergy production, particularly in a Malaysian context, with emphasis on the concepts, pretreatment, and conversion technologies.

AB  - The replacement of fossil hydrocarbons with the renewable biomass alternatives is an inevitable requirement in our transition toward a sustainable economy. However, traditional petrochemical technologies are not designed to operate using biomass raw materials. Thus, the development of new hydrocarbon processing methods is essential. This paper deals with the study of the hybrid plasma-catalytic reforming of liquid hydrocarbons. The system for the reforming of liquid hydrocarbons, which used low-power rotating gliding discharge as a plasma generator, was studied. Sunflower oil (C17H33COOH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) have been used as model oxygen-containing hydrocarbons and diesel fuel (C16H34) has been used as a model hydrocarbon without oxygen. Reforming products have been analyzed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography, and the combustion of produced syngas was studied. The values of the reforming efficiency, the ratio between the chemical energy of the produced syngas and the electric energy spent on the plasma generation, and the efficiency of the produced syngas combustion in the standard water heaters were obtained. © 1973-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Biofuels are environment friendly and economical. First-generation biofuels are made from sugar, starch and vegetable oils, and have an impact on food security, while second generation biofuels are generated from plant or algal material and are greener and sustainable. The present work focused on lab-scale application of hydrothermal carbonization to convert aquatic weed Ceratophyllum demersum into a second-generation biofuel—hydrochar. Hydrothermal carbonization has been carried out with and without catalysts in a high-pressure reactor under subcritical temperatures 240–320 °C, residence times 10–40 min and biomass to water dilution ratios varying from 1:4 to 1:12. Under noncatalytic conditions higher heating value and energy density were highest, 24.11 MJ/kg and 1.64 respectively at temperature of 300 °C and residence time of 30 min. The calorific value of noncatalytic hydrochar was enhanced further, respectively, to 29.0, 27.5 and 26.48 MJ/kg by catalysts KOH, Na2CO3 and acetic acid. Catalytic hydrochar had H/C and O/C atomic ratios of same order as that of high-rank bituminous coal. Van Krevelen diagram indicated KOH to be better catalyst followed by Na2CO3 and acetic acid. Hydrochar yield of 38% obtained in noncatalytic hydrothermal carbonization decreased with catalysts in following order; acetic acid &gt; Na2CO3 &gt; KOH, however, energy density was enhanced in order KOH &gt; Na2CO3 &gt; acetic acid. The research can prove a way forward in the direction of meeting part of global energy demand. At the same time, the problem of secondary pollution caused by piling up and decay of aquatic weeds will also be addressed to. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Wood chips were hydrothermally treated in near critical point water in the presence of a catalyst to yield a raw biocrude, containing a wide range of organic components. This product was subsequently distilled to remove its heaviest fraction, which tends to yield chary products if heated above 350 °C. The biocrude obtained has an oxygen content of 12 wt % and was subsequently hydrotreated to obtain a hydrocarbon stream. Varying the hydrotreatment operating conditions and catalyst yielded a deoxygenated syncrude which quality improved with operation severity. The hydroprocessed stream produced under very mild conditions can be further upgraded in conventional refinery operations while the stream produced after more severe hydrotreatment can be mixed with conventional diesel. This proof of concept was demonstrated with commercial hydrotreating catalysts, operating between 350 and 380 °C, 40 to 120 bar pressure and 0.5 to 1 h−1 contact time. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Hetero- and homogeneous acid catalysts are effective catalysts for the production of biodiesel from oils containing high free fatty acids. The protic salts synthesized from natural amino acids were examined for catalytic activity and efficiency for the esterification of oleic acid after structural identification and characterization. In the esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol, [Asp][NO3] was the best catalyst, and its high activity correlated to its high Hammett acidity. The optimal reaction conditions for the esterification of oleic acid to achieve 97 % biodiesel yield were: 70 °C, 10 % catalyst loading (w/w, on oleic acid basis), methanol/oleic acid ratio 7.5:1, and 5 h. Generally, [Asp][NO3] could be a good catalyst for the esterification of oleic acid with alcohols with chain lengths of up to six. The biodiesel yield of 93.86 % obtained from palm fatty acid distillate implies that the catalyst has potential for industrial application. A study of the kinetics indicated that the reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with an activation energy and pre-exponential of 57.36 kJ mol−1 and 44.24×105 min−1, respectively. The aspartic acid-derived protic salt is a promising, operationally simply, sustainable, renewable, and possibly biodegradable catalyst for the conversion of free fatty acids into biodiesel. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Use water as solvent for the organic synthesis a great choice because it is economical, reduces waste and avoids potentially hazardous reagents versus the conventional solvents. This account presents the Cu(II)-β-CD as water soluble green catalyst for the one-pot conversion benzyl halide to benzyl azide and 1,2,3-trizoles at room temperature and very short reaction time (15-70 min). Products are separated without any workup, simple by filtration, with >99 % selectivity and purity. As-synthesized material was characterized by, HR-TEM, XPS, FESEM, FT-IR, TGA and XRD to understand its structural properties as well as attachment of copper by host-guest interaction. This catalyst can also show effectiveness for the condensed ketone and aldehydes moiety, which produce biofuels intermediate. The recyclability of this catalytic system was tested up to five cycles and only a very slight loss of catalytic activity was detected. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The need for renewable environmentally friendly energy resources is growing every day. Biodiesel is one of the most promising alternatives to the conventional non-renewable energy resources. Heterogeneous catalysts proved a high efficiency in the transesterification of oils to produce biodiesel. In this research, activated carbon was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst in the transesterification of two non-edible oils (waste cooking oil and Jatropha oil) with methanol to produce biodiesel. Activated carbon was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and Fourier transformed infrared. The effect of different operating parameters, namely operation time (30, 60, 120 and 180 min), alcohol-to-oil molar ratio (4:1, 6:1, 8:1 and 10:1), catalyst loading [0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5% (w/w)] and rotational speed (100, 200, 300 and 400 rpm), was investigated. Results showed that increasing the operational time, the alcohol-to-oil molar ratio and the catalyst loading increases the conversion to biodiesel but only to some extent; increasing the stirring rate was found to be beneficial to the process. The optimum conditions were found to be 2 h of heating, 6:1 alcohol-to-oil ratio, 1 wt% catalyst loading and 400 rpm stirring. Under optimum conditions, the conversion to biodiesel reached 93.95 and 93.27% for the waste cooking oil and the Jatropha oil, respectively. The properties of the obtained biodiesel (density, viscosity, flash point, pour point and cloud point) were measured giving promising results. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - A generalized correlation for mass transfer in packed beds is developed. It is derived from considerations on single sphere mass transfer. The correlation is validated over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, Schmidt numbers, and bed porosities with literature data. Particular attention is paid to gas-solid mass transfer at low Reynolds numbers where own experimental results are presented. With the help of the developed correlation, the influence of different bed properties and axial dispersion on mass transfer is discussed. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Present study reports a non-acetone producing Clostridium sporogenes strain as a potential producer of liquid biofuels. Alcohol production was positively regulated by sorbitol and instant dry yeast as carbon and nitrogen sources respectively. Media optimization resulted in maximum butanol and ethanol titer (g L−1) of 12.1 and 7.9 respectively. Depending on the combination of carbon sources, the organism was found to manipulate its metabolism towards synthesis of either ethanol or butanol, thereby affecting the total alcohol titer. Among various dual substrate combinations, glucose-glycerol mixture in the ratio of 60:40 resulted in maximum butanol and ethanol titer (g L−1) of 11.9 and 12.1 respectively with total alcohol productivity of 0.59g L−1 h−1. In the mixture, when pure glycerol was replaced with crude glycerol, butanol and ethanol titer (g L−1) of 11.2 and 11.7 was achieved. Hence, the strain shows immense potential for biofuels production using crude glycerol as cheap substrate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 (Pjdr2) has been studied as a model for development of bacterial biocatalysts for efficient processing of xylans, methylglucuronoxylan, and methylglucuronoarabinoxylan, the predominant hemicellulosic polysaccharides found in dicots and monocots, respectively. Pjdr2 produces a cell-associated GH10 endoxylanase (Xyn10A1) that catalyzes depolymerization of xylans to xylobiose, xylotriose, and methylglucuronoxylotriose with methylglucuronate-linked α-1,2 to the nonreducing terminal xylose. A GH10/GH67 xylan utilization regulon includes genes encoding an extracellular cell-associated Xyn10A1 endoxylanase and an intracellular GH67 α-glucuronidase active on methylglucuronoxylotriose generated by Xyn10A1 but without activity on methylglucuronoxylotetraose generated by a GH11 endoxylanase. The sequenced genome of Pjdr2 contains three paralogous genes potentially encoding GH115 α-glucuronidases found in certain bacteria and fungi. One of these, Pjdr2_5977, shows enhanced expression during growth on xylans along with Pjdr2_4664 encoding a GH11 endoxylanase. Here, we show that Pjdr2_5977 encodes a GH115 α-glucuronidase, Agu115A, with maximal activity on the aldouronate methylglucuronoxylotetraose selectively generated by a GH11 endoxylanase Xyn11 encoded by Pjdr2_4664. Growth of Pjdr2 on this methylglucuronoxylotetraose supports a process for Xyn11-mediated extracellular depolymerization of methylglucuronoxylan and Agu115A-mediated intracellular deglycosylation as an alternative to the GH10/GH67 system previously defined in this bacterium. A recombinantly expressed enzyme encoded by the Pjdr2 agu115A gene catalyzes removal of 4-O-methylglucuronate residues α-1,2 linked to internal xylose residues in oligoxylosides generated by GH11 and GH30 xylanases and releases methylglucuronate from polymeric methylglucuronoxylan. The GH115 α-glucuronidase from Pjdr2 extends the discovery of this activity to members of the phylum Firmicutes and contributes to a novel system for bioprocessing hemicelluloses. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background: C1 substrates (such as formate and methanol) are promising feedstock for biochemical/biofuel production. Numerous studies have been focusing on engineering heterologous pathways to incorporate C1 substrates into biomass, while the engineered microbial hosts often demonstrate inferior fermentation performance due to substrate toxicity, metabolic burdens from engineered pathways, and poor enzyme activities. Alternatively, exploring native C1 pathways in non-model microbes could be a better solution to address these challenges. Results: An oleaginous fungus, Umbelopsis isabellina, demonstrates an excellent capability of metabolizing formate to promote growth and lipid accumulation. By co-feeding formate with glucose at a mole ratio of 3.9:1, biomass and lipid productivities of the culture in 7.5 L bioreactors were improved by 20 and 70%, respectively. 13C-metabolite analysis, genome annotations, and enzyme assay further discovered that formate not only provides an auxiliary energy source [promoting NAD(P)H and ATP] for cell anabolism, but also contributes carbon backbones via folate-mediated C1 pathways. More interestingly, formate addition can tune fatty acid profile and increase the portion of medium-chain fatty acids, which would benefit conversion of fungal lipids for high-quality biofuel production. Flux balance analysis further indicates that formate co-utilization can power microbial metabolism to improve biosynthesis, particularly on glucose-limited cultures. Conclusion: This study demonstrates Umbelopsis isabellina's strong capability for co-utilizing formate to produce biomass and enhance fatty acid production. It is a promising non-model platform that can be potentially integrated with photochemical/electrochemical processes to efficiently convert carbon dioxide into biofuels and value-added chemicals. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Research on methods to produce biobutanol production from kitchen garbage (KG) as a potential substrate is thus far lacking. Here, the effect of various enzymatic hydrolysis procedures (EHP) was first tested using different enzyme cocktails, on the decomposition of KG. The efficiency of Clostridium acetobutylicum-mediated biobutanol production was then measured using two modes: separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification fermentation (SSF) in the condition of adjusting pH. The optimal results were obtained using (1) an enzymatic hydrolysis cocktail procedure (EHC5), (2) use of the SSF approach and (3) pH control. This approach results in a biobutanol production of 16.37 g/L and total solvent concentration of 32.96 g/L. Compared to experiments that use pure glucose as a substrate, our results show that KG is a promising feedstock for biobutanol production. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this waste source for an industrial application via the EHP. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (ZSO) cannot be widely consumed because it contains high free fatty acids with an acid value of 73.75 mg KOH per g. Herein, a solid acid catalyst was prepared from ZSO via a carbonization-sulfonation method using concentrated sulfuric acid. The prepared catalyst was characterized by FT-IR, SEM, XPS, XRD, N2 physisorption, and Boehm titration methods. The prepared solid acid was employed as a catalyst to investigate its performance during the simultaneous esterification and transesterification of ZSO in a one-pot process to produce biodiesel. The optimum reaction parameters for obtaining biodiesel in &gt;95% yield using the abovementioned reaction were as follows: 30:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, a catalyst loading of 8.0 wt%, a reaction temperature of 140 °C, and reaction time of 4.0 h. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Hydroesterification is innovation biodiesel production using low cost feedstock by two-step: hydrolysis of waste cooking oil to FFAs in subcritical water and chemical esterification of FFAs into FAME (biodiesel) with methanol. The purpose was to apply the experimental factorial design to evaluate the influence of reaction variables on the effectiveness of hydrolysis and determine the relationship of FFAs and FAMEs yields. Experiments were conducted in a batch reactor under diverse reaction conditions to determine the optimal parameters for hydrolysis. This analyses indicated that high FFAs yields (95 wt%) are achieved using 250 °C; 120 min; 100:1 water-to-oil molar ratio and 700 rpm. Research results revealed a conversion the FFAs in 98.5 wt% of FAMEs with high quality by esterification in biodiesel production. This study shows that the biodiesel produced by subcritical/chemical hydroesterification process has similar qualities to the biodiesel obtained by traditional alkaline transesterification, which suggests a promising alternative for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents the techno-economic performance analysis of Jatropha biodiesel-fired power plants in comparison with natural gas- and diesel-fired plants. Jatropha biodiesel can be substituted for natural gas in industrial gas turbines at a slight loss in power output of ∼2% and plant efficiency of ∼1%. The exclusive use of the fuel in heavy duty industrial gas turbines is not economically viable at existing electricity generation prices in Nigeria, except fuels are restricted to combined cycle engines and considered as biomass power plants. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of the Jatropha biodiesel-fired plants varied from $0.203–0.252/kWh, values that are below the cost of self-generated electricity (SGE) in Nigeria —$0.45–0.70/kWh. To integrate Jatropha biodiesel into existing power plants, a minimum production-based incentive (PBI) of $0.052–0.082/kWh can be provided for up to nine years or maximum partial fuel substitution (PFS) of 33–40% can be mandated, depending on the mode of operation. A guaranteed fuel price of $0.18–5/gallon can be ensured, depending on electricity contract price. A carbon tax up to $100/tCO2 can also be imposed on natural gas-fired plants, but this does not ensure economic viability. The high cost of SGE in Nigeria uncovers an opportunity for embedded power generation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of liquid fuels from crude oil requires water. There has been limited focus on the assessment of life cycle water demand footprints for crude oil production and refining. The overall aim of this paper is address this gap. The objective of this research is to develop water demand coefficients over the life cycle of fuels produced from crude oil pathways. Five crude oil fields were selected in the three North American countries to reflect the impact of different spatial locations and technologies on water demand. These include the Alaska North Slope, California's Kern County heavy oil, and Mars in the U.S.; Maya in Mexico; and Bow River heavy oil in Alberta, Canada. A boundary for an assessment of the life cycle water footprint was set to cover the unit operations related to exploration, drilling, extraction, and refining. The recovery technology used to extract crude oil is one of the key determining factors for water demand. The amount of produced water that is re-injected to recover the oil is essential in determining the amount of fresh water that will be required. During the complete life cycle of one barrel of conventional crude oil, 1.71–8.25 barrels of fresh water are consumed and 2.4–9.51 barrels of fresh water are withdrawn. The lowest coefficients are for Bow River heavy oil and the highest coefficients are for Maya crude oil. Of all the unit operations, exploration and drilling require the least fresh water (less than 0.015 barrel of water per barrel of oil produced). A sensitivity analysis was conducted and uncertainty in the estimates was determined. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - CASTOR oil as well as used cooking oil have been catalytically cracked using three types of catalysts being zinc chloride, sodium carbonate and calcium oxide and the products of cracking were tested for their chemical and physical properties relevant to their use as fuels. Products obtained by cracking castor oil were found to be more suitable as bio-kerosene while those obtained by catalytic cracking of used cooking oil were more suitable as biodiesel. Therefore, the product obtained by catalytic cracking of used cooking oil has been then tested for its effect on the performance of a diesel engine compared to regular diesel fuel. Blends of catalytically cracked used cooking oil with regular diesel fuel were used for running the engine at different engine loading and the specific fuel consumption as well as the exhaust temperature had been determined at each load. The results have shown that blending of regular diesel fuel with catalytically cracked oil resulted in a reduction in the thermal efficiency compared to that if the engine was run using regular diesel fuel only .Such blending resulted also an increase in the exhaust temperature. © 2017 The National Information & Documentation Center (NIDOC).

AB  - In the present study Trichoderma reesei, a wood isolate can yield high biomass quantities up to 30 g/L, yielding 32.4% of lipids of dry cell weight (DCW). Biodiesel production from Trichoderma reesei involved simple unit operations like filtration and ultrasonication, yet giving good lipid yield with desirable bio-diesel properties. Optimization of ultrasonication conditions was done to ensure maximum lipid extraction. SEM analysis of ultrasonicated samples showed distinct breakage of fungal hyphae. The lipids were found to contain 49.7% saturated fatty acids. Transesterification using chemical and biological catalysts were compared and 96.09% efficiency was observed for lipase-catalyzed transesterification. The bio-diesel properties satisfied ASTM and EN specifications with cetane number: 53.1, iodine value: 63.34 g, saponification value: 235.07 mg KOH/g, cold flow plugging point: 9.13 °C. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the synthesis of medium-chain length alkanes (MCLA), as bio-aviation product. To control the chain length of alkanes and increase the production of MCLA, Escherichia coli cells were engineered by incorporating (i) a chain length specific thioesterase from Umbellularia californica (UC), (ii) a plant origin acyl carrier protein (ACP) gene and (iii) the whole fatty acid synthesis system (FASs) from Jatropha curcas (JC). The genetic combination was designed to control the product spectrum towards optimum MCLA. Decanoic, lauric and myristic acid were produced at concentrations of 0.011, 0.093 and 1.657 mg/g, respectively. The concentration of final products nonane, undecane and tridecane were 0.00062 mg/g, 0.0052 mg/g, and 0.249 mg/g respectively. Thioesterase from UC controlled the fatty acid chain length in a range of 10–14 carbons and the ACP gene with whole FASs from JC significantly increased the production of MCLA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work reports phase equilibrium measurements for binary, ternary, quaternary and five components mixtures of CO2, ethanol, valeric acid, water and ethyl valerate at high pressures. Experiments were carried out using a high-pressure variable-volume view cell with operating temperatures ranging from 303.15 K to 353.15 K and pressures up to 15 MPa. The CO2 mole fraction ranged from 0.4780 to 0.9412 for the binary system {CO2(1) + valeric acid(2)}, from 0.3801 to 0.9811 for {CO2(1) + ethyl valerate(2)}, from 0.5649 to 0.9193 for the ternary system {CO2(1) + ethanol(2) + valeric acid(3)} at an ethanol to valeric acid mole ratio of (3:1) and from 0.5907 to 0.9373 for {CO2(1) + ethanol(2) + ethyl valerate(3)} at an ethanol to ethyl valerate mole ratio of (1:1). For the quaternary {CO2(1) + ethanol(2) + water(3) + ethyl valerate(4)} and the five components system {CO2(1) + ethanol(2) + valeric acid(3) + water(4) + ethyl valerate(5)} fixed compositions were investigated at CO2 mole fraction of 0.7336 and 0.7211, respectively, while the mole ratio of other compounds were fixed at typical esterification conditions. For the systems investigated, vapour-liquid (VL), liquid-liquid (LL) and vapour-liquid-liquid (VLL) phase transitions were observed. The experimental data sets were successfully modeled using the Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state with the Boston-Mathias alpha function and using the van der Walls quadratic mixing rule. The PR-BM showed good performance in the prediction of the phase transitions for the ternary, quaternary and five components systems based on the binary interaction parameters obtained from the binary CO2 + valeric acid, CO2 + ethyl valerate and CO2 + ethanol experimental data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oil palm fronds are abundant but recalcitrant to chemical pretreatment. Herein, an acid—base mixture was applied as a catalyst to efficiently pretreat oil palm fronds. Optimized conditions for the pretreatment were a 0.1 M acidic acid—base mixture and 3 min ramping to 190 °C and 12 min holding. The oil palm fronds pretreated and washed with the acid—base mixture exhibited an enzymatic digestibility of 85% by 15 FPU Accellerase 1000/g glucan after 72 h hydrolysis, which was significantly higher than the enzymatic digestibilities obtained by acid or alkali pretreatment alone. This could be attributed to the synergistic actions of the acid and base, producing an 87% glucose recovery with 100% and 40.3% removal of xylan and lignin, respectively, from the solids. Therefore, an acid—base mixture can be a feasible catalyst to deconstruct oil palm fronds for sugar production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Valeric biofuels stand for a promising energy source, since they are generated from the refining process of crop residues, which converts lignocellulose into the valeric biofuel (or valeric ester). In order to achieve a high grade valeric ester, several washing steps are required and eventually results in the formation of two liquid phases (water-rich and ester-rich phases). In this context, the objective of this study is the experimental determination of liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) concerning chemical species present during the ethyl esterification of valeric acid (valeric acid, ethanol, ethyl valerate and water). Results were obtained for the LLE of ternary systems comprised of binodal curves and tie-lines at atmospheric pressure (91.1 kPa) and 293.15 K and 318.15 K. The experimental values obtained were modelled using NRTL, UNIQUAC and UNIFAC-LL Gibbs energy models. Both NRTL and UNIQUAC models were able to correlate satisfactorily the experimental results, while UNIFAC-LL predictions provided greater deviations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Procedures and operating conditions optimized in laboratory scale for the production of ethyl biodiesels from non-edible vegetable oils (NEVOs) were successfully transferred at pilot scale, with implementation of separation and purification stages. The three NEVOs candidates are Balanites aegyptiaca (BA), Azadirachta indica (AI), and Jatropha curcas (JC), converted into BAEEs, AIEEs and JCEEs respectively via homogeneous catalysis. Quality specifications of the produced biofuels were used to explain pollutant emissions and engine performance observed via a power generator. Under the same conditions, blends of petrodiesel with crude BA or JC oil (50 wt.%) were also investigated. The selected overall methodology “feedstock-conversion-engine” led to the proposal of a sustainable alternative fuel. The candidate NEVO is BA oil to which the proposed alkali route should lead to a low cost biodiesel production process thanks to easy operating conditions, associated with a two-stage procedure (glycerol recycling) and a dry-purification method (rice husk ashes). Glycerol addition should be carried out at ambient temperature to play positively at phenomena occurring in the reacting medium (chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, phase equilibrium). Tests on power generator demonstrated that BAEEs led to cleaner combustion than petrodiesel, particularly for the most harmful emissions (light carbonyls and ultrafine particulate matter). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The synthesis of biodiesel using Terminalia cattapa L. (local language: Ketapang) kernel oil and ethanol has been conducted. The effect of variable parameters of synthesis includes reaction time (3-7 h), temperature (35-60°), amount of enzyme (0.1-0.3 g) and substrate molar ratio (ketapang kernel oil to ethanol, 1:1-1:3) were studied. Response surface methodology based on a five-level and four-variable central composite rotatable design were used to evaluate the interactive effects of the sinthesis parameters on the percentage yield of biodiedsel. The analysis of variance shows that the optimum conditions of the synthesis reaction were at 4.03 h of reaction time, 0.25 g of weight of enzyme, 45.04°C of temperature and 1.50 of substrate molar ratio. The actual experimental yield was 83.9% under optimum condition, which compared well to the maximum predicted value of 83.71%. © 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - In cellulosic biofuel production, chemical pretreatment performed at laboratory or pilot scale, followed by mechanical refining, has been demonstrated to be effective to increase feedstock enzyme digestibility. To take the combined pretreatment process one step closer to commercialization, disk milling was performed with commercially pretreated corn stover. Dilute acid pretreated samples with combined severity factors (cSF) of 0.09 (DA09) and 0.43 (DA43) were obtained from a commercial plant. Effects of pretreatment conditions (DA09 and DA43), milling cycles (0, 3, 9, and 15) and enzyme dosages (7.8, 15.6 and 31.2 mg cellulase/g dry biomass) were evaluated. Milling improved glucose yields by 0.7 to 1.2-fold. Higher enzyme dosages enhanced sugar yields. Milling was more effective to improve glucose yields, while enzyme dosage was more effective to improve xylose yields. However, dilute acid pretreatment condition was the most important factor to increase final sugar yields compared to milling cycles and enzyme dosages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the effects of thermal pretreatment and ex-situ grinding on the production of bio-oil and biochar from the pyrolysis of mallee wood cylinders in a fluidised-bed reactor. The wood cylinders were firstly pretreated at 150–380 °C and were then crushed into small particles before further pyrolysis at 500 °C. Thermal pretreatment alone for wood cylinders could not promote the bio-oil yield. Combined thermal pretreatment at low temperatures and subsequent grinding facilitated the formation of bio-oil and minimised the formation of biochar. This is because the thermal pretreatment and grinding partially destroyed the cell wall structure and improved the mass transfer of volatiles exiting from the particles during the subsequent pyrolysis. However, if the pretreatment temperature was above 260 °C, the biochar yields increased due to the cross-linking and charring reactions. These charring reactions compromised the beneficial effects of grinding, leading to decreases in the formation of bio-oil. The balance between thermal pretreatment and grinding needed to be delicately managed to maximise the formation of bio-oil. The pretreatment temperature would significantly affect the composition of bio-oil from the ex-situ grinding pyrolysis. The controlled pretreatment temperature could somewhat “activate” lignin or cause cross-linked bonds in biomass which was responsible for the formation of aromatics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many reactions required for the upgrading of biomass into fuels and chemicals—hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, hydrocracking—are ostensibly similar to those practiced in the upgrading of petroleum into fuels. But, repurposing hydroprocessing catalysts from refinery operations to treat bio-oil has proved to be unsatisfactory. New catalysts are needed because the composition of the biogenic reactants differs from that of petroleum-derived feedstocks (e.g. the low concentration of sulfur in cellulose-derived biomass precludes use of metal sulfide catalysts unless sulfur is added to the reaction stream). New processes are needed because bio-oils oligomerize rapidly, forming intractable coke and “gunk”, at temperatures so low that the desired upgrading reactions are impractically slow, and so low that the bio-oil upgrading must be handled as a condensed fluid. Ideally, the new catalysts and processes would exploit the properties of the multiple phases present in condensed bio-oil, notably the polarizability and structure of the fluid near a catalyst's surface in the cybotactic region. Molecular simulation results of the cybotactic region adjacent to different catalyst surfaces in the hydrogenation of phenol suggest that Pd catalysts supported on hydrophilic surfaces are more active than catalysts based on lipophilic supports because the former serve to enhance the concentration of the phenol in the vicinity of the Pd. The effect stems from thermodynamics, not the rate of mass transport. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Silage and dry are the two typical cornstalk forms. Either form could be used as substrate in biogas plants and might be replaced by another when shortage occurred. This study focused on the feeding sequence of these two kinds of feedstocks, aiming to discuss their specific methane potential (SMP). A 15-day hydraulic retention time was chosen for semi-continuous experiments based on the batch test results. In semi-continuous experiments, before and after feedstocks were exchanged, the significantly decreased and comparable SMPs of silage and dry cornstalks indicated that a basis of unstable digestion would result in incomplete methane release from the subsequent digestion. A higher similarity of bacterial community structure and greater quantity of bacteria were shown in acidified silage cornstalk digestion through band similarity analysis. Methanosaetaceae and methanomicrobiales were the predominant methanogens, and aceticlastic methanogenesis was the main route for methane production. The different feeding sequences affected the hydrolysis course and further influenced the methanogenic proliferation. Our work suggests that silage cornstalk digestion should be conducted before dry cornstalk digestion. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The objective of this article is to design and plan sustainable bio-ethanol supply chain. Modeling supply chains that achieve economic, social and environmental feasibility through production, process and energy efficiency is a challenge. Life cycle assessment that is coupled with techno-economic optimization of bio-ethanol supply chain is an alternative solution to achieve sustainability. A simulation of the biomass conversion is used to find process parameters of the conversion technology. The results show that the unified model is capable of minimizing both CO2 emissions and energy and utility consumptions. In addition, the supply chain is capable of contributing to local economy through jobs creation. While the model is quite comprehensive, the future research recommendation on energy integration and global sustainability is proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Commercial scale production of biofuels from lignocellulosic feed stocks has been hampered by the resistance of plant cell walls to enzymatic conversion, primarily owing to lignin. This study investigated whether DypB, the lignin-degrading peroxidase from Rodococcus jostii, depolymerizes lignin and reduces recalcitrance in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). The protein was targeted to the cytosol or the ER using ER-targeting and retention signal peptides. For each construct, five independent transgenic lines were characterized phenotypically and genotypically. Our findings reveal that expression of DypB in the cytosol and ER does not affect plant development. ER-targeting increased protein accumulation, and extracts from transgenic leaves showed higher activity on classic peroxidase substrates than the control. Intriguingly, in situ DypB activation and subsequent saccharification released nearly 200% more fermentable sugars from transgenic lines than controls, which were not explained by variation in initial structural and non-structural carbohydrates and lignin content. Pyrolysis-GC-MS analysis showed more reduction in the level of lignin associated pyrolysates in the transgenic lines than the control primarily when the enzyme is activated prior to pyrolysis, consistent with increased lignin degradation and improved saccharification. The findings reveal for the first time that accumulation and in situ activation of a peroxidase improves biomass digestibility. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Aqueous-phase catalytic conversion of biomass-derived xylose to value-added furfural typically involves cascade xylose-to-xylulose isomerization and dehydration. To simplify this catalytic process with improved efficiency, a Lewis and Brønsted acid bifunctional NbOPO3 catalyst was synthesized by an impregnation method. The effects of reaction time/temperature, catalyst dosage, and the substrate concentration, as well as reaction kinetics, were studied. A high furfural yield of 54.9 mol% was obtained at 180°C for 3 h. The synergistic effect of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in the highly recyclable NbOPO3 catalyst was demonstrated to be important for efficient conversion of xylose to furfural. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Yaupon holly is one of the most widespread woody underbrush species in the southeastern United States, and it can undermine forest health and safety due to its biofuel-like nature during catastrophic wildfires. Yaupon holly was subjected to microwave liquefaction to produce biobased polyurethane (PU) foam insulation. Liquefaction parameters were optimized and summarized as follows: 1) particle size was controlled in the range of 16- to 40- mesh; 2) both the ratios of glycerol to ethylene glycol and liquid to solid were set at 3:1; 3) the reaction process was conducted at 160 °C for 10 min and catalyzed by 1.5% sulfuric acid. The optimal liquefaction conversion yield was 94.9%. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) indicated the successful liquefaction and dissolution of wood essential components, i.e. hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. The optimal liquefaction product with solid residue was used directly to produce biofoams. With an increased isocyanate index, the thermal insulation properties, mechanical properties, and thermal stability of biofoams increased. Therefore, a promising biobased PU foam was obtained at an isocyanate index of 150. The density, thermal conductivity, Young's modulus, and compressive stress of the promising biofoam were 18.5 kg·m-3, 0.033 W·m-1·K-1, 176.7 kPa, and 15.4 kPa, respectively.

AB  - Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by chemical reduction of graphene oxide with hydrazine hydrate and used as supports to prepare a series of H3PW12O40 (HPW)-based porous solid acids for the first time. Esterification of levulinic acid with ethanol was used to investigate the catalytic properties of the resulting HPW/rGO catalysts. The results showed that the heterogeneous catalysts possessed a porous structure and that their textural characteristics and catalytic activities were influenced by the loading of HPW. Remarkably, they were efficient in the synthesis of ethyl levulinate, with the one with an HPW loading of 45 wt% exhibiting the best efficiency. The conversion of levulinic acid was as high as 96.9%. Meanwhile, the resulting HPW/rGO catalysts also have satisfactory durability. The conversion of levulinic acid still remains at about 53.1% after five cycles under the present conditions. Furthermore, the various catalytic reaction parameters, such as reaction time, ethanol-to-LA molar ratio, and the catalyst dosage, are optimized to maximize the conversion of levulinic acid over 45 wt% HPW/rGO catalysts. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - As the decreasing availability of the fossil fuel is rising day by day, the search of alternate fuel that can be used as a substitute to the conventional fuels is rising rapidly. A new type of biofuel, chicha oil biodiesel, is introduced in this work for the purpose of fuelling diesel engine. Chicha oil was transesterified with methanol using potassium hydroxide as catalyst to obtain chicha oil methyl ester (COME). The calorific value of this biodiesel is lower, when compared to that of diesel. The COME and their blends of 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% with diesel were tested in a single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection diesel engine and the performance, combustion and emission results were compared with diesel. The test result indicates that there is a slight increase in brake thermal efficiency and decrease in brake-specific fuel consumption for all blended fuels when compared to that of diesel fuel. The use of biodiesel resulted in lower emissions of CO and HC and increased emissions of CO2 and NOx. The experimental results proved that the use of biodiesel (produced from chicha oil) in compression ignition engine is a viable alternative to diesel. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The development of rapid and accurate techniques to predict the composition of crude bio-oils obtained via the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is a prerequisite for their industrial implementation. Here, we demonstrate the potential of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to replace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in determining the compositional groups of bio-oils. Using the mid-infrared spectroscopic technique as a predictor, chemometric tools based on partial least-squares regression models were contrasted with GC-MS results to foresee the various families of organic compounds. A broad data set consisting of more than 100 samples obtained from the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of woody biomass and from the upgrading of bio-oil vapors by catalytic cracking over zeolites and metal oxides was used. The applicability of the developed model was assessed by external validation using the Kennard-Stone algorithm, showing that more than 90 wt % of the bio-oil composition was accurately determined. These results pave the path for the online monitoring of the forthcoming manufacture system of second-generation biofuels through rapid and cost-effective characterization of the pyrolysis bio-oils, thus enabling industrial producers to make timely decisions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The production of lignocellulosic-derived biofuels is a highly promising source of alternative energy, but it has been constrained by the lack of a microbial platform capable to efficiently degrade this recalcitrant material and cope with by-products that can be toxic to cells. Species that naturally grow in environments where carbon is mainly available as lignin are promising for finding new ways of removing the lignin that protects cellulose for improved conversion of lignin to fuel precursors. Enterobacter lignolyticus SCF1 is a facultative anaerobic Gammaproteobacteria isolated from tropical rain forest soil collected in El Yunque forest, Puerto Rico under anoxic growth conditions with lignin as sole carbon source. Whole transcriptome analysis of SCF1 during E.lignolyticus SCF1 lignin degradation was conducted on cells grown in the presence (0.1%, w/w) and the absence of lignin, where samples were taken at three different times during growth, beginning of exponential phase, mid-exponential phase and beginning of stationary phase. Lignin-amended cultures achieved twice the cell biomass as unamended cultures over three days, and in this time degraded 60% of lignin. Transcripts in early exponential phase reflected this accelerated growth. A complement of laccases, aryl-alcohol dehydrogenases, and peroxidases were most up-regulated in lignin amended conditions in mid-exponential and early stationary phases compared to unamended growth. The association of hydrogen production by way of the formate hydrogenlyase complex with lignin degradation suggests a possible value added to lignin degradation in the future. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

AB  - This study reports the adsorption characteristics of bio-oil on biochar in biochar/bio-oil slurry (i.e., bioslurry) systems at three biochar loading levels (2.4, 4.8, and 16.7%, respectively). At low biochar loading levels (2.4 or 4.8%), heavy organic compounds (particularly those containing fused aromatic systems) in bio-oil was selectively adsorbed onto the biochar. Such selective adsorption also resulted in reduced concentrations of alkali and alkaline earth metallic (AAEM) species in the adsorbed bio-oil phase compared to that in the bio-oil blank. A comparison between the experimental and calculated distributions of AAEM species in bio-oil indicates that at least part of the AAEM species adsorbed on biochar is associated with heavy organic compounds. Consequently, such selective adsorption results in changes in the unadsorbed bio-oil phase that has decreased viscosity and aromaticity and increased polarity. It is interesting to note that the selective adsorption was weakened with an increasing biochar loading level in the bioslurry, and such a phenomenon was not observed in the bio-oil-water-soluble fraction (WSF)/biochar system because of the absence of fused aromatic compounds in the WSF. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The minimum selling price (MSP), specific energy consumption, and greenhouse (GHG) emissions resulting from biobased production of adipic acid, succinic acid, 1,3-propanediol, 3-hydroxy propionic acid, and isobutanol were estimated for various combinations of titer, yield, and volumetric productivity. The MSP, energy consumption, and GHG emissions of anaerobic biobased commodity chemical processes were found to be nearly the same for a given titer, yield, and productivity. The estimated MSP of biobased commodity chemicals produced via aerobic respiration was found to be nearly 30% higher than those of produced through anaerobic fermentation. It was determined that biocatalyst yields of ≥0.32 g/g and titers of ≥45 g/L result in lower production cost, energy consumption, and GHG emissions, when compared to conventional petrochemical production processes. The economic and environmental benefits of improving titer beyond 125 g/L and volumetric productivity beyond 2 g/L·h were found to be low when producing biobased commodity chemicals using a biocatalyst. Comparative economic analysis indicated that provision of feedstock is the dominant cost in commercially viable biobased commodity chemical production systems. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, nanostructured FeOx and MnOx were prepared by two synthetic routes, nanocasting and hydrothermal, and evaluated for bio-oil upgrading via vapor-phase ketonization. Catalytic performance measurements in the ketonization of representative model compounds, acetic and propionic acid, at 335 °C showed high activity for the hydrothermal MnOx and nanocast FeOx (conversion &gt;90%) with high selectivity to the respective ketones. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies followed by temperature-programmed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and MS showed that the reactive intermediates are bidentate acetate species that desorb as acetone over FeOx and unreacted acetic acid over MnOx (in contradiction to its associated catalysis). Powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of used samples revealed that MnO2 was reduced to MnO during reaction. The relative surface concentrations of adsorbed acetate for the used MnOx catalysts (from DRIFTS) correlated with their corresponding acetic acid conversion (from ketonization studies), indicating that MnO is the active phase for acetic acid ketonization, with MnO2 a precursor which is reduced in situ at temperatures &gt;300 °C. Vapor-phase ketonization of the aqueous phase of a real thermal bio-oil, produced from the fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, was demonstrated successfully over MnOx prepared by the hydrothermal route, highlighting this as an attractive approach for the upgrading of pyrolysis bio-oils. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this study, flash pyrolysis was performed using milled soybean as a model substrate to assess the production of liquid fuels from oleaginous biomass feedstocks. A laboratory-scale fluidized-bed flash pyrolysis reactor that allowed rapid heat transfer to the biomass along with short vapor residence time was designed and constructed. Pyrolysis was performed between 250 and 610°C with a vapor residence time between 0.2 and 0.3 s. At 550°C or higher, nearly 70% of the initial feed mass as well as feed carbon was recovered in bio-oil. In addition, 90% of the feedstock lipids were recovered in the bio-oil at these pyrolysis conditions. The high liquid products yields were attributed to (1) the low secondary degradation of bio-oils due to the short vapor residence time and (2) the high recovery of liquids in a novel dry ice packed-bed condenser that provided a high surface area for condensation/aggregation of dilute bio-oil vapors/aerosols that were entrained in the carrier gas. The bio-oil from this study had higher C and H content, higher calorific value, and lower oxygen and water content than bio-oil from wood. These results show that high-quality bio-oil at high yield can be obtained from flash pyrolysis of oleaginous feedstock. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To gain a better understanding of the effect of the interactions between two biomass components (cellulose-lignin and xylan-lignin) on lignin-derived phenolic products, two analysis methods are introduced. With 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1 ratios of cellulose and lignin, and xylan and lignin, the mixtures were subjected to fast pyrolysis, which was carried out in a fixed-bed tubular furnace at 450 to 600 °C. The phenolic content in the bio-oils was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The product distributions showed that cellulose, xylan, and lignin were the main contributors to the mass of biomass bio-oil, gas, and char, respectively. The char yields decreased and the bio-oil and gas yields increased in the presences of cellulose and xylan. Comparative analyses of both the phenol content and peak area of the two methods suggest that in the case of cellulose and lignin co-pyrolysis, the formation of three kinds of phenolic products is promoted. The strength of this positive effect increased with increasing lignin content. However, the production of hydroxyphenols is promoted, while the productions of guaiacols and syringols are inhibited by the effect of xylan, which creates a different interaction between xylan and lignin.

AB  - Hydrogen from water electrolysis is often suggested as a way of storing the excess energy from wind and solar power plants. However, unlike natural gas, hydrogen is difficult to store and distribute. One solution is to convert the hydrogen into other fuels or bulk chemicals. In this study we investigated fermentation in which homoacetogenic clostridia apply the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway to generate acetate from H2 and CO2. Acetate can be used as a bulk chemical or further transformed into biofuels. Autotrophic growth with CO2 as the sole carbon source is slow compared to heterotrophic growth, so the aim of this work was to improve continuous gas fermentation by immobilising the acetate-producing clostridia, thus preventing their wash out from the bioreactor. Two homoacetogenic bacterial strains (Acetobacterium woodii and Moorella thermoacetica) were tested for their acetate production potential, with A. woodii proving to be the better strain with maximum acetate concentration of 29.57 g l−1. Due to its stability during fermentation and good bacterial immobilisation, linen was chosen as immobilisation material for continuous fermentation. This study demonstrates the successful continuous fermentation of acetate from H2 and CO2 using A. woodii immobilised on a low-cost surface at high volumetric productivity of 1.21 ± 0.05 g acetate l−1 d−1. This has great industrial potential and future studies should focus on the scale-up of this process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents a synthesis of bimetallic NiMo and NiW modified ZSM-5/MCM-41 composites and their heterogeneous catalytic conversion of crude palm oil (CPO) to biofuels. The ZSM-5/MCM-41 composites were synthesized through a self-assembly of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant with silica-alumina from ZSM-5 zeolite, prepared from natural kaolin by the hydrothermal technique. Subsequently, the synthesized composites were deposited with bimetallic NiMo and NiW by impregnation method. The obtained catalysts presented a micro-mesoporous structure, confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, NH3-TPD, XRF and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. The results of CPO conversion demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts decreases in the series of NiMo-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;NiW-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;Ni-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;Mo-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;W-ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;NiMo-ZSM-5&gt;NiW-ZSM-5&gt;ZSM-5/MCM-41&gt;ZSM-5&gt;MCM-41.It was found that the bimetallic NiMo-and NiW-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalysts give higher yields of liquid hydrocarbons than other catalysts at a given conversion. Types of hydrocarbon in liquid products, identified by simulated distillation gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (SimDis GC-FID), are gasoline (150-200℃; C5-12), kerosene (250-300℃; C5-20) and diesel (350℃; C7-20). Moreover, the conversion of CPO to biofuel products using the NiMo-and NiW-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalysts offers no statistically significant difference (P&gt;0.05) at 95% confidence level, evaluated by SPSS analysis. © 2017, Science Press.

AB  - Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) was cultivated in a 70 L indoor vertical photobioreactor and harvested at concentrations of 1.0 g L−1 dry biomass. Lyophilised algal biomass was pyrolysed at 500 °C under nitrogen and vapours were passed over pelletised HZSM5- zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 38). An organic fraction (bio-oil) overlaying an aqueous phase was obtained by cold trapping, while non-condensed bio-oil components (XAD fraction) were adsorbed onto a poly(styrene—co-divinylbenzene) resin. About 20% of the original algal carbon was converted into inorganic carbon in the aqueous (HCO3 −/CO3 2−) and gas phase (composed of 70% CO2, 20% CO). Most of spirulina carbon ended up in char (30%) and coke (30%). Bio-oil and XAD fraction represented approximately 10% mass, 20% carbon and 20% energy of algal biomass. Bio-oil composition was dominated by alkylated monoaromatic hydrocarbons, with benzene concentrations below 10 g kg−1. Large part of original nitrogen was dissolved in the aqueous phase (40%) and incorporated into char/coke (37%). A minor fraction (6%) of nitrogen ended up in bio-oil in the form of indoles, pyrroles, carbazoles, anilines. While deoxygenation was effective, denitrogenation was incomplete and probably counteracted by zeolite ammonisation. Microcombustion experiments showed that the bio-oil burnt efficiently, but with a sooting flame, and a tendency to form small solid carbonaceous residues probably associated with the presence of heavy compounds. © 2017

AB  - Pt/γ-Al2O3 materials with different metal loading were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and tested as catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) at 320 and 340°C with 4 and 5 h of reaction time. Oleic acid was used as model molecule in HDO process for biodiesel production, since this acid is in high proportion in waste vegetable oils used in food and agro-industrial processes. Increasing the Pt-nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) content influences on obtaining higher yields of n-C17 at optimal conditions of 335°C for 4.86 h of reaction and 4 nm of nanoparticle size, statistically determined. Yields of alkanes were theoretically optimized and using regression models for obtaining response surfaces with size (S) and distribution (V) of Pt-NPs as additional factors to temperature and reaction time. Interestingly, The Pt-nanoparticles parameters had a higher interaction with the rest of the other parameters for the n-C17 yield, suggested by a statistical P value less than 0.05. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1224–1233, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - Biocatalytic processes often encounter problems due to toxic reactants and products, which reduce biocatalyst viability. Thus, robust organisms capable of tolerating or adapting towards such compounds are of high importance. This study systematically investigated the physiological response of Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120∆C biofilms when exposed to n-butanol, one of the potential next generation biofuels as well as a toxic substance using microscopic and biochemical methods. Initially P. taiwanensis VLB120∆C biofilms did not show any observable growth in the presence of 3% butanol. Prolonged cultivation of 10 days led to biofilm adaptation, glucose and oxygen uptake doubled and consequently it was possible to quantify biomass. Complementing the medium with yeast extract and presumably reducing the metabolic burden caused by butanol exposure further increased the biomass yield. In course of cultivation cells reduced their size in the presence of n-butanol which results in an enlarged surface-to-volume ratio and thus increased nutrient uptake. Finally, biofilm enhanced its extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production when exposed to n-butanol. The predominant response of these biofilms under n-butanol stress are higher energy demand, increased biomass yield upon medium complements, larger surface-to-volume ratio and enhanced EPS production. Although we observed a distinct increase in biomass in the presence of 3% butanol it was not possible to cultivate P. taiwanensis VLB120∆C biofilms at higher n-butanol concentrations. Thereby this study shows that biofilms are not per se tolerant against solvents, and need to adapt to toxic n-butanol concentrations. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The upgrading of algae biocrude (obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction) was studied under mild conditions. Here we adopted a guard catalyst to protect the core catalyst and obtained algae biofuel with low heteroatom content at 350°C. The nitrogen content of biofuel is 0.016 wt %, and the calculated oxygen content is less than 0.51 wt %. Furthermore, the effective yield from biocrude to a low-heteroatom-containing biofuel was close to the theoretical yield. Through a detailed study of the upgrading process, the content variation trend of biocrude and biofuel compositions and their potential reaction pathways were revealed. The results indicated that hydrogenation reactions almost finished after upgrading at 350°C for 15-30 min. (Figure Presented). © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A series of NiO/HZSM-5 catalysts were used to convert alkali lignin to hydrocarbon biofuels in a two-stage catalytic pyrolysis system. The results indicated that all NiO/HZSM-5 catalysts reduced the content of undesirable phenols, furans, and alcohols of the biofuel compared to non-catalytic treatment. The NiO/HZSM-5 catalyst with the lowest amount of NiO generated the highest biofuel yield in all catalytic treatments, and it also produced biofuel with the highest content of hydrocarbons. The emission of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) increased in the treatments with higher-NiO loading HZSM-5 due to the redox reaction between NiO and the oxygenated compounds in the bio-oil. Ni2SiO4 was generated in the used NiO/HZSM-5 catalysts during the high-temperature pyrolysis process. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Rice husks are pyrolyzed in a fluidized bed reactor and the vaporized bio-oils are continuously graded into lighter and heavier bio-oils by in-line fractional distillation. The selection of the operating fluidization velocity is systematically discussed and the influences of the gas fluidization velocity on the physical and chemical properties of the graded oils are initially investigated. At the gas fluidization velocity of 0.46 m/s (1.3 Umf) and pyrolysis temperature of 590 °C, aromatic compounds in the graded heavier oil, graded 20 °C trapped lighter oil and graded 0 °C trapped lighter oil are 68%, 38% and 15%, respectively. The best oil grading performance is obtained at 1.3 Umf. The properties of the bio-chars are closely related to the gas fluidization velocity. Cleaner chars are obtained at 1.0 Umf at the same pyrolysis temperature. The enhanced gas backmixing at higher gas fluidization velocity enhances secondary decomposition reactions. When the gas fluidization velocity increases from 1.0 Umf to 1.6 Umf at the pyrolysis temperature of 490 °C, the water content and the heating value of the 20 °C trapped lighter bio-oils increases from 10% to 23% and decreases from 25.7 MJ/kg to 21.3 MJ//kg, respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste cooking oil is discarded into sewage and waste bins in various developing countries. In China, the discarded oil is scooped illegally from drains by smugglers. After collection, the obtained waste oil is reprocessed; the resulting substance is popularly called gutter oil. Gutter oil and its mixture with fresh vegetable oils are sold in food markets at lower prices. This created panic among the general public because of food safety concerns. 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance), MALDI-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry) and HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) are used for the detection of gutter oil. Currently, sustainable utilization of gutter oil for biofuel production is being explored using chemical and enzymatic methods. Furthermore, trial runs by Boeing company shows that gutter oil can be blended with normal jet fuel for use in aviation industry. Annually, around 1.8 billion L (476 million gallons) of biofuels can be produced from gutter oil in China. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 OleTJE has attracted much attention for its ability to catalyze the decarboxylation of long chain fatty acids to generate alkenes, which are not only biofuel molecule, but also can be used broadly for making lubricants, polymers and detergents. In this study, the molecular basis of the binding mechanism of P450 OleTJE for arachidic acid, myristic acid, and caprylic acid was investigated by utilizing conventional molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculations. Moreover, random acceleration molecular dynamics (RAMD) simulations were performed to uncover the most probable access/egress channels for different fatty acids. The predicted binding free energy shows an order of arachidic acid &lt; myristic acid &lt; caprylic acid. Key residues interacting with three substrates and residues specifically binding to one of them were identified. The RAMD results suggest the most likely channel for arachidic acid, myristic acid, and caprylic acid are 2e/2b, 2a and 2f/2a, respectively. It is suggested that the reaction is easier to carry out in myristic acid bound system than those in arachidic acid and caprylic acid bound system based on the distance of Hβ atom of substrate relative to P450 OleTJE Compound I states. This study provided novel insight to understand the substrate preference mechanism of P450 OleTJE and valuable information for rational enzyme design for short chain fatty acid decarboxylation. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) can serve as a feedstock for producing biodiesel, which would not only address food security and waste disposal but also has the potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter of 2.5 μm or smaller (PM2.5). In this study, we assessed restaurant waste oil (RWO) availability in China and conducted life cycle analysis (LCA) of GHG and PM2.5 emissions of RWO-based biodiesel using the GREET model. The results showed that the amount of RWO in China varies between 0.56 and 1.67 million tons in 2013 and between 0.54 and 1.63 million tons in 2014. Life cycle analysis estimated reduction of GHG and PM2.5 emissions through the use of RWO-based rather than petroleum-based biodiesel of 82 kg CO2-Eq. (90 %) and 0.92 g PM2.5 (46 %) respectively per 100 km driven by busses in 2014 in Shanghai, China. Given the total amount of RWO available in 2014 in China, the potential mitigated annual GHG emission ranges, in China, are 1.51 ∼ 4.52 × 106 tons of CO2-eq and 16.94 ∼ 50.83 tons of PM2.5. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - WOx promoted Pt/AlPO4-5 catalysts with varying Pt and W contents were prepared by wet-impregnation method and characterized. Catalysts with Pt to W weight ratio of 1:2 exhibited higher catalytic performance than the other compositions in deoxygenation of oleic acid (OA). WOx enhanced significantly the catalytic activity of Pt and enabled quantitative conversion of OA to linear alkanes (predominantly C18/C17) at a temperature as low as 280 °C. It changed the reaction pathway from decarbonylation/decarboxylation (DCO for Pt/AlPO4-5) to hydrodeoxygenation (HDO for Pt-WOx/AlPO4-5). It affected the particle size and redox behaviour of Pt. The enhanced H-spill over (by 14.8 %) and presence of strong acid sites (300 - 500 °C) are the cause for the high activity of Pt-WOx/AlPO4-5 catalysts even at lower temperatures. Partially reduced WOx activates OA and leads to the HDO product (C18). In the absence of WOx, Lewis acid sites of the support activate OA through the C=O group and Pt facilitates C−C cleavage and formation of DCO product (C17). © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The litterfall is the major organic material deposited in soil of Brazilian Caatinga biome, thus providing the ideal conditions for plant biomass-degrading microorganisms to thrive. Herein, the phylogenetic composition and lignocellulose-degrading capacity have been explored for the first time from a fosmid library dataset of Caatinga soil by sequence-based screening. A complex bacterial community dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria was unraveled. SEED subsystems-based annotations revealed a broad range of genes assigned to carbohydrate and aromatic compounds metabolism, indicating microbial ability to utilize plant-derived material. CAZy-based annotation identified 7275 genes encoding 37 glycoside hydrolases (GHs) families related to hydrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose, oligosaccharides and other lignin-modifying enzymes. Taxonomic affiliation of genes showed high genetic potential of the phylum Acidobacteria for hemicellulose degradation, whereas Actinobacteria members appear to play an important role in celullose hydrolysis. Additionally, comparative analyses revealed greater GHs profile similarity among soils as compared to the digestive tract of animals capable of digesting plant biomass, particularly in the hemicellulases content. Combined results suggest a complex synergistic interaction of community members required for biomass degradation into fermentable sugars. This large repertoire of lignocellulolytic enzymes opens perspectives for mining potential candidates of biochemical catalysts for biofuels production from renewable resources and other environmental applications. © FEMS 2016.

AB  - Catalytic deoxydehydration (DODH) of vicinal diols is studied. We find that NH4ReO4 (ammonium perrhenate, APR) catalyzes the DODH of glycols to alkenes by sacrificial alcohol (2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanol) at 140–165 °C. The product yields range from good to excellent and no isomers detected. The catalytic DODH reaction of glycols to alkene is of potential value for the production of chemicals and fuels from the renewable biomass-derived polyols.[Figure presented] © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Within the Cluster of Excellence “Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass” (TMFB) at the RWTH Aachen University, two novel biogenic fuels, namely 1-octanol and its isomer dibutyl ether (DBE), were identified and extensively analyzed in respect of their suitability for combustion in a Diesel engine. Both biofuels feature very different properties, especially regarding their ignitability. In previous works of the research cluster, promising synthesis routes with excellent yields for both fuels were found, using lignocellulosic biomass as source material. Both fuels were investigated as pure components in optical and thermodynamic single cylinder engines (SCE). For 1-octanol at lower part load, almost no soot emission could be measured, while with DBE the soot emissions were only about a quarter of that with conventional Diesel fuel. At high part load (2400 min-1, 14.8 bar IMEP), the soot reduction of 1-octanol was more than 50% and for DBE more than 80 % respectively. Based on these promising initial results, this paper will report about additional experimental investigations that were initiated to exploit the complete potential of both advanced biofuels in terms of emissions and efficiency. A single cylinder research engine was utilized and the engine calibration was optimized using design of experiments at lower and higher part load. At high part load, it was possible to increase the efficiency by more than one percent point compared to the Diesel reference in the same load point. Furthermore, the already low soot emissions of both biofuels, compared to Diesel fuel, could also be further halved compared to the base calibration. In a last step, a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to validate the previously built models and to get further insight into the influence of the single calibration parameters on engine performance. © 2017 SAE International.

AB  - The environmental and culture conditions of a potential microalgae Euglena sanguinea were optimized for maximizing the biomass productivity. It was found that the organic macronutrient from poultry litter and organic micronutrient of seaweed extract are very effective to enhance the lipid production. Complementing, these organic nutrients with commercial NPK fertilizer, boost up the lipid productivity by 30.9% in comparison with the established standard Euglena medium. The fatty acid profile of the extracted oil by GC–MS reveals its conformity with commercial diesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulosic biorefinery stillage contains waste water with dissolved unutilized fermentable sugars and, mainly, lignin of the biomass. Currently, the best use of this lignin is through direct combustion to supply industrial process energy; however, fast pyrolysis has recently attracted researcher's interest as it has the potential to convert lignin into bio-oil and bio-char. It is essential that these alternative routes be thoroughly analyzed for their techno-economic feasibilities and bottlenecks, which was the main objective of this study. Stillage from a cellulosic biorefinery of a113.5 million liters per year (30 million gallons per year) butanol production facility was considered in this study. Experimental and modeling data for both fast pyrolysis and direct combustion systems were gathered from recent publications and used for analysis. Modeling software, SuperPro Designer, was used to develop process models and economic analyses of both systems. The estimated stillage processing cost ($/l butanol produced) of a direct combustion system and fast pyrolysis system were found to be 0.15 and 0.17, respectively, including byproducts credits. Plant size, anaerobic digester retention time, the moisture content of solid stillage, turbine and boiler efficiencies, and cost of waste treatment chemicals were the most sensitive input parameters. At the present state of these technologies, direct combustion is a more economically feasible option than fast pyrolysis; however, both could be of interest to commercial cellulosic biorefineries, interested in lignin utilization alternatives, due to the marginal difference in stillage utilization costs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Producing transportation fuels from bio sources was of prime importance due to the strict environmental legislations for producing clean fuels from conventional oil resources. However, the economical impacts of the biofuel production should be considered. In this study, the production of bio-naphtha and biodiesel from palm oil using homogeneous catalyst, i.e. an aqueous phase of ammonium molybdate, was studied. This catalyst was prepared by dissolving sodium molybdate in de-ionized water with hydrochloric acid, and then neutralizing the mixture with ammonium hydroxide. The solution was dried at 90 °C for 24 h to obtain ammonium molybdate. Then, characterization of the catalyst was done by informative techniques, such as XRD and FT-IR. The results showed that the main phase of the synthesized catalyst was molybdate ammonium hydrates (4MoO3.2NH3.H2O), and also bands of Mo-O, Mo-O-Mo, N-H and surface hydroxyl groups were observed in the sample. Moreover, activity test confirms that the bio-naphtha produced from the proposed method has a few aromatic components, and its sulfur content was negligible. Moreover, ash, nitrogen, sulfur and carbon residue were not detected in the produced biodiesel, and its Cetane index was 66.3. Therefore, it was a suitable fuel for diesel engines vehicles.

AB  - Biofuels represent an alternative solution to petroleum-based fuels. In particular, biodiesel is very interesting, especially if it is produced from waste vegetable oil. Biodiesel can be used in diesel engines. The aim of this work is to implement a 2D numerical analysis in Comsol Multiphysics in order to verify an uniform temperature field within a non-isothermal batch mixed micro-reactor. An immersion heater system has been studied as a suitable solution to increase the temperature of WVO (Waste Vegetable Oil) before the start of the transesterification reaction. Thus, the efficiency of the immersion heating system has been investigated. The results show that the temperature field is not uniform within the fluid domain, because of the convective flux with the external environment. These conditions could lead to a low overall conversion rate. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Background: n-Butyraldehyde is a high-production volume chemical produced exclusively from hydroformylation of propylene. It is a versatile chemical used in the synthesis of diverse C4-C8 alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters, and amines. Its high demand and broad applications make it an ideal chemical to be produced from biomass. Results: An Escherichia coli strain was engineered to produce n-butyraldehyde directly from glucose by expressing a modified Clostridium CoA-dependent n-butanol production pathway with mono-functional Coenzyme A-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh) instead of the natural bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. Aldh from Clostridium beijerinckii outperformed the other tested homologues. However, the presence of native alcohol dehydrogenase led to spontaneous conversion of n-butyraldehyde to n-butanol. This problem was addressed by knocking out native E. coli alcohol dehydrogenases, significantly improving the butyraldehyde-to-butanol ratio. This ratio was further increased reducing media complexity from Terrific broth to M9 media containing 2% yeast extract. To increase production titer, in situ liquid-liquid extraction using dodecane and oleyl alcohol was investigated. Results showed oleyl alcohol as a better extractant, increasing the titer of n-butyraldehyde produced to 630 mg/L. Conclusion: This study demonstrated n-butyraldehyde production from glucose. Through sequential strain and condition optimizations, butyraldehyde-to-butanol ratio was improved significantly compared to the parent strain. Results from this work may serve as a basis for further development of renewable n-butyraldehyde production. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Laccase is an enzyme that is used for fabricating cathodes of biofuel cells. Many studies have been aimed at searching the ways for enhancing specific electrochemical characteristics of cathode with the laccase- based catalyst. The electroreduction of oxygen on the electrode with immobilized laccase proceeds under the conditions of direct electron transfer between the electrode and active enzyme center. In this work, the effect of oxygen partial pressure on the electrocatalytic activity of laccase is studied. It is shown that, at the concentrations of oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte higher than 0.28 mM, the process is controlled by the kinetics of the formation of laccase–oxygen complex, whereas at lower concentrations and a polarization higher than 0.3 V, the process is limited by the oxygen diffusion. A wide range of carbon materials are studied as the carriers for laccase immobilization: carbon black and nanotubes with various BET specific surface areas. The conditions, which provide the highest surface coverage of carbon material with enzyme in the course of spontaneous adsorptive immobilization and the highest specific characteristics when using a “floating” electrode simulating a gas-diffusion electrode, are determined: 0.2 M phosphate-acetate buffer solution; oxygen atmosphere; the carrier material (nanotubes with a BET surface area of 210 m2/g and a mesopore volume of 3.8 cm3/g); and the composition of active mass on the electrode (50 wt % of carbon material + 50 wt % of hydrophobized carbon black). © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Achieving high degree of active metal dispersions at the highest possible metal loading andhigh reducibility of the metal remains a challenge in Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FTS) as well as in hydrogeoxygenation (HDO).This study therefore reports the influence of oxalic acid (OxA) functionalization on the metal dispersion, reducibility and activity of Co supported ZSM-5 catalyst in FTS and HDO of oleic acid into paraffin biofuel. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) results showed that cobalt oxalate supported ZSM-5 catalyst (CoOx/ZSM-5) synthesized from the incorporation of freshly prepared cobalt oxalate complex into ZSM-5 displayed increase in surface area, pore volume and average pore size while the nonfunctionalized cobalt supported on ZSM-5 (Co/ZSM-5) catalyst showed reduction in those properties. Furthermore, both XRD and XPS confirmed the presence of Coformed from the decomposition of CoOx during calcination of CoOx/ZSM-5 under inert atmosphere. The HRTEM showed that Co species average particle sizes were smaller in CoOx/ZSM-5 than in Co/ZSM- 5, and in addition, CoOx/ZSM-5 shows a clear higher degree of active metal dispersion. The FTS result showed that at CO conversion over Co/ZSM-5 and CoOx/ZSM-5 catalysts were 74.28% and 94.23% and their selectivity to C5+ HC production were 63.15% and 75.4%, respectively at 4 h TOS. The HDO result also showed that the CoOx/ZSM-5 has higher OA conversion of 92% compared to 59% over Co/ZSM-5. In addition CoOx/ZSM-5 showed higher HDO and isomerization activities compared to Co/ZSM-5. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The present work reports a case study for the industrialization of a biorefinery aimed at valorizing fish processing residues in order to obtain ω-3 concentrates for the nutraceutical sector. The biorefinery includes a series of processes: oil extraction from fish waste, fish oil transesterification with ethanol, ω-3 concentration based on supercritical CO2 fractionation. The biorefinery is at first designed and then modeled by Aspen Plus™: this allows for a comprehensive picture (mass and energy flows, processing costs and costs for investment) of the overall process. In accordance with the zero-waste concept, all the biorefinery by-products are valorized: fish proteins as fishmeal, and glycerol, saturated fatty acids and short chain unsaturated fatty acids as liquid biofuel. In addition, fish oil transesterification with ethanol is also experimentally tested in different operational conditions in order to maximize fish oil conversion to fatty acid ethyl esters. A trout processing company located in Trentino Province, Italy, represents the case study. The company produces 870 t/year of fish waste. Mass balances allow estimating a production of 26.6 t/year of ω-3 rich oil (income: 1.3 M€), 160 t/year of fish proteins (income: 0.27 M€), and 160 t/year of liquid biofuel. The biofuel, fed to a 100 kWel CHP unit, allows to produce 720 MWhe/year and 870 MWhth/year, covering the total electricity consumption of the plant and providing more than 45% of the thermal energy needs. This translates into a reduction in utility costs of about 0.12 M€ and avoids the emission of 416 t/year of CO2. Finally, the total investment costs for the whole biorefinery amount to about 3.34 M€. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the production of ω-3 rich fish oils in a bio-refinery concept could become a good opportunity for valorizing fish by-products and increasing the competitiveness of the fish processing industry. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The hot-wire method is applied in this paper to probe the thermal conductivity (TC) of Cu and Ni nanoparticle packed beds (NPBs). A different decrease tendency of TC versus porosity than that currently known is discovered. The relationship between the porosity and nanostructure is investigated to explain this unusual phenomenon. It is found that the porosity dominates the TC of the NPB in large porosities, while the TC depends on the contact area between nanoparticles in small porosities. Meanwhile, the Vickers hardness (HV) of NPBs is also measured. It turns out that the enlarged contact area between nanoparticles is responsible for the rapid increase of HV in large porosity, and the saturated nanoparticle deformation is responsible for the small increase of HV in low porosity. With both TC and HV considered, it can be pointed out that a structure of NPB with a porosity of 0.25 is preferable as a thermoelectric material because of the low TC and the higher hardness. Although Cu and Ni are not good thermoelectric materials, this study is supposed to provide an effective way to optimize thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) and HV of nanoporous materials prepared by the cold-pressing method. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Pyrolysis of corn stalk residue (CSR) and cassava rhizome residue (CRR) to produce bio-oil were investigated using a fluidized bed reactor. Both feedstocks possessed low volatile matters and high ash contents. The results showed that the bio-oil yield of CSR reached the highest value (25.1%) at 700 °C, while that of CRR peaked (30.6%) at 600 °C. The obtained bio-oils were separated into light fraction and heavy fraction automatically. The light fraction mainly consisted of furan compounds and carboxylic acids, while the heavy fraction mainly consisted of aromatic compounds. Due to the abundant lignin in the residues, high heating values (HHVs) of the heavy fractions reached 25.5–26.8 MJ/kg which were significantly higher than typical bio-oils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel has emerged as an alternative to partially replace diesel. However, the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid chains, such as when using soybean oil as starting materials, is associated with several issues due to its low oxidative stability. Other issues, such as the formation of biofilms in fuel storage tanks and unsatisfactory cold properties are also major concerns during the use of biodiesel. Hence, the aim of this work is the modification of the chemical structure of soybean biodiesel in two steps: (i) epoxidation of soybean biodiesel double bonds and (ii) acetylation of the soybean biodiesel epoxide with acetic anhydride, using a heterogeneous catalytic system. The catalyst used for acetylation step was tin oxide supported on alumina. The catalytic system activity was evaluated using different temperature, catalyst/substrate ratio and different anhydrides. Oxidative stability, thermal analysis and anti-microbial activity were evaluated. The products structures were confirmed by infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results show yields up to 98% of the desired product − di-acetylbiodiesel in 10 h and 15% catalyst (w/w). The catalyst could be recycled up to four times with minor activity loss. After acetylation, it was observed an increase in both oxidative stability and biostatic activity. However, the freezing point did not change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To reduce the oxygen content and increase the higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil, this paper proposed a new method for deoxy-liquefaction of corn stalk in subcritical water with hydrogen generated in situ via aluminum-water reaction. The effects of aluminum on the physicochemical properties of bio-oil were investigated. The bio-oil was analyzed by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that, when the aluminum content was 30 wt %, the yield of bio-oil reached 26.54 wt %, the deoxidation ratio was 47.92%, and the calorific value increased from 28.86 to 33.77 MJ/kg. The viscosity, acid value, and water content were also significantly improved. FT-IR analysis showed that the types of functional groups in bio-oil were almost unchanged. GC-MS analysis showed that the main components of bio-oil were phenols, ketones, hydrocarbons, and indoles. In addition, the content of aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons was as high as 36.18% when the aluminum content was 30 wt %. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A long-chain hydrocarbon biofuel of jet fuel range can be produced via aldol condensation of fermented products such as acetone and alcohols over the catalysts containing both metallic sites for the dehydrogenation of alcohols and basic sites for the condensation reaction. However, an efficient catalyst system has not been studied widely yet the route is promising for biofuel production. In this work, Cu catalysts supported on ceria-zirconia (Cu/xCeZr) were prepared using coprecipitated CexZr1-xO2 supports with different Ce/Zr ratios for the cross-aldol condensation of acetone and n-butanol into mono- and di-alkylated aliphatic ketones, 2-heptanone and 6-undecanone. The acetone conversion and 6-undecanone selectivity increased with specific Cu surface area due to formation of the dehydrogenation product butyraldehyde at a higher concentration. The total yield of cross-aldol condensation products was strongly dependent on a combination of Cu sites and basic sites. This was confirmed by the results in the reaction between acetone and butyraldehyde over supported Cu catalysts that additionally examined the adsorbed acyl species on Cu surface taking part in the aldol condensation reaction. The best catalytic performance was achieved with Cu/0.8CeZr showing the largest Cu surface and the highest base site density among Cu/xCeZr catalysts. While the activity of Cu/0.8CeZ was comparable to or a little higher than that of Cu/MgO, the former catalyst was more stable than the latter suffering from the transformation of MgO to Mg(OH)2 by the reaction. Consequently, it is suggested that Cu supported on ceria-zirconia of ceria rich contains such a dual function that it can efficiently catalyze the cross-aldol condensation of acetone and n-butanol. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The chemical characterization of shell and cuticle from Tonda Gentile Romana hazelnut was carried out using analytical pyrolysis in the presence of hexamethyldisilazane followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (Py(HMDS)-GC/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). The aim was to acquire a comprehensive picture of the chemical composition of shell and cuticle, which are produced as wastes by hazelnut confectionery industry, in view of a suitable exploitation strategy. Such waste biomass could be a promising substrate to produce value-added chemicals and biofuels. The pyrogram of the shell fraction showed the typical pyrolysis products of a lignocellulosic matrix. The cuticle pyrogram showed intense peaks that were attributed to fatty acids. Holocellulose-to-lignin (H/L) content ratios were determined both by Py-GC/MS and by a traditional wet-chemistry method. While the H/L values obtained by the two methods were similar for the shell fraction, those of the cuticle fraction were very different. To further investigate this behaviour, HPLC-DAD analyses were carried out on ethanol extracts of the two fractions. High concentrations of catechin, epicatechin and procyanidins were found in the cuticle fraction. The presence of phenolic compounds was hypothesised to determine the overestimation of the H/L ratio in the Py-GC/MS technique. 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene was found to be a plausible marker for the presence of polyphenolic extractives in lignocellulosic materials. Based on the results obtained from the different analysis methods, possible exploitation strategies are suggested for the two waste fractions. The high lignin and carbohydrate content of the shell fraction could be used to produce value-added chemicals, biofuels and biochars. The high extractives content of the cuticle fraction, on the other hand, makes it a possible starting material to produce pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products, as well as cosmetic emulsions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phenol-formaldehyde resins are major material classes that are used in a range of applications including composites, adhesives, foams, electronics, and insulation. While efforts have been made to produce renewable resins, there has yet to be an approach that offers potential for economic viability and meets all critical quality metrics. This failure can be attributed largely to the use of phenol and cresol homologues and to high separation costs. In this work, the use of phenol, cresol, and alkyl phenols derived from the aqueous phase generated from catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass to produce a high-quality biobased resin is demonstrated. Production, through catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP), separation, through distillation and adsorption unit operations, and synthesis, through typical resol chemistry, produced a resin with properties, such as curing kinetics and molecular weight, competitive with petroleum-derived resin. This work explores a pathway to value-added coproducts from a CFP waste stream, which has the potential to improve the economic viability of biofuels production. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Two micro algal species namely Chlorella vulgaris (C1) and Chlorella sp. (C2) were selected for the viability of bio-oil production by transesterification in the presence of Ni/H2 catalyst supported with Ni(II)-Schiff base chelate promotor. By this method about 92% of low viscous bio-oil is obtained. Systematic characterizations of the extracted lipids with proximate, elemental and spectral techniques (FT-IR, UV-vis, GC-Mass, 1H NMR and 13C NMR) have been carried out to measure their composition profile. Thermogravimetry (TG/DTA) of the wet micro algal biomass, micro algal feed stock and bio-oil has also been performed to analyze their thermal behavior. In addition, scanning electron microscopic pictographs (SEM) were taken for analyzing the micro algal structure before and after the lipid extraction. The fuel properties of the extracted bio-oil were assessed using standard methods and compared to the standards. The bio-oil samples were tested for their remarkable in vitro biological and nuclease activities. In addition, the engine performance (brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency) using five types of fuels namely diesel (B100), C1 micro algal bio-oil 20% blend (C1 B20), C2 micro algal bio-oil 20% blend (C2 B20), C1 micro algal bio-oil 50% blend (C1 B50) and C2 micro algal bio-oil 50% blend (C2 B50) and emission characteristics (CO2, NOx, exhaust and smoke) were studied for the bio-oil–diesel blends. © 2016 Energy Institute

AB  - The suitability of biodiesel produced from spent Vietnamese coffee was examined. Previous work shows that the geographical origin of coffee beans has little effect on the composition and physical properties of the biodiesel produced Jenkins et al. [1]. Vietnamese coffee, however, is roasted in a range of fats and oils for flavour enhancement and therefore has a unique fatty acid profile. The oil yield and biodiesel properties of three Vietnamese coffees were assessed and compared to a coffee of more typical composition—Colombian—and traditional biodiesel feedstocks (rapeseed, sunflower and palm). The oil yield from fresh Vietnamese coffee was higher (12.0–14.0 %) than Colombian coffee (9.3 %), while the oil yield from spent Vietnamese coffee (9.3–10.4 %) was comparable to the Colombian coffee (9.5 %). The unsaponifiable matter was only present in low levels in the Vietnamese coffee (1.9–4.9 %) compared to Colombian coffee (30.4 % fresh, 21.4 % spent). Vietnamese coffee biodiesel was more saturated than Columbian coffee biodiesel. It was therefore more viscous and had a higher pour point than the Colombian coffee, and possessed properties more akin to palm biodiesel. Vietnamese coffee biodiesel would therefore be a suitable feedstock for use locally due to the more suitable climate and compatibility with the palm feedstock that is currently used.

AB  - Soybean biodiesel (B100) has been playing an important role in Brazilian energy matrix towards the national bio-based economy. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the most widely used indicator for assessing the environmental sustainability of biodiesels and received particular attention among decision makers in business and politics, as well as consumers. Former studies have been mainly focused on the GHG emissions from the soybean cultivation, excluding other stages of the biodiesel production. Here, we present a holistic view of the total GHG emissions in four life cycle stages for soybean biodiesel. The aim of this study was to assess the GHG emissions of Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system with an integrated life cycle approach of four stages: agriculture, extraction, production and distribution. Allocation of mass and energy was applied and special attention was paid to the integrated and non-integrated industrial production chain. The results indicated that the largest source of GHG emissions, among four life cycle stages, is the agricultural stage (42-51%) for B100 produced in integrated systems and the production stage (46-52%) for B100 produced in non-integrated systems. Integration of industrial units resulted in significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions. Without the consideration of LUC and assuming biogenic CO2 emissions is carbon neutral in our study, the calculated life cycle GHG emissions for domestic soybean biodiesel varied from 23.1 to 25.8 gCO2eq. MJ-1 B100 and those for soybean biodiesel exported to EU ranged from 26.5 to 29.2 gCO2eq. MJ-1 B100, which represent reductions by 65% up to 72% (depending on the delivery route) of GHG emissions compared with the EU benchmark for diesel fuel. Our findings from a life cycle perspective contributed to identify the major GHG sources in Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system and they can be used to guide mitigation priority for policy and decisionmaking. Projected scenarios in this study would be taken as references for accounting the environmental sustainability of soybean biodiesel within a domestic and global level. © 2017 Cerri et al.

AB  - This study examined the pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, and fermentation of the red macroalgae Gracilaria verrucosa using adapted saccharomyces cerevisiae to galactose or NaCl for the increase of bioethanol yield. Pretreatment with thermal acid hydrolysis to obtain galactose was carried out with 11.7% (w/v) seaweed slurry and 373 mM H2SO4 at 121 °C for 59 min. Glucose was obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymatic saccharification was performed with a mixture of 16 U/mL Celluclast 1.5L and Viscozyme L at 45 °C for 48 h. Ethanol fermentation in 11.7% (w/v) seaweed hydrolysate was carried out using Saccharomyces cerevisiae KCTC 1126 adapted or non-adapted to high concentrations of galactose or NaCl. When non-adapted S. cerevisiae KCTC 1126 was used, the ethanol productivity was 0.09 g/(Lh) with an ethanol yield of 0.25. Ethanol productivity of 0.16 and 0.19 g/(Lh) with ethanol yields of 0.43 and 0.48 was obtained using S. cerevisiae KCTC 1126 adapted to high concentrations of galactose and NaCl, respectively. Adaptation of S. cerevisiae KCTC 1126 to galactose or NaCl increased the ethanol yield via adaptive evolution of the yeast. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Restaurant grease trap waste (GTW) is a potentially feasible energy source that can be used as an alternative to liquid fossil fuels and natural gas. However, GTW must be collected from many different resources for energy production because restaurants in Japan only produce an average of 486 kg GTW per year. This study investigated the variation in oil properties and methane generation potential of 44 GTW samples from 13 types of restaurants during different seasons. The GTW samples had high variation in oil content and oil properties. Biofuel oil was extracted from most GTW samples at a high efficiency (more than 80 wt%). In contrast, the methane yield varied little among de-oiled GTW samples. All types of GTWs are potential sources of biomethane generation. GTW samples are classified into five major oil property clusters according to solid chemical stability. Oil properties depend little on the season and heavily on the restaurant type. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Vapors generated from the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass are made up of a complex mixture of oxygenated compounds. Direct analysis of these vapors provides insight into the mechanisms of depolymerization of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as well as insight into reactions that may occur during condensation of pyrolysis vapors into bio-oil. Studies utilizing pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry have provided valuable information regarding the chemical composition of pyrolysis vapors. Mass spectrometers generally employed with these instruments have low mass resolution of approximately a mass unit. The presence of chemical species with identical unit mass but differing elemental formulas cannot be resolved with these instruments and are therefore detected as a single ion. In this study we analyzed the pyrolysis vapors of several biomass sources using a high-resolution double focusing mass spectrometer. High-resolution analysis of pyrolysis vapors allowed for speciation of several compounds that would be detected as a single ion with unit mass resolution. These data not only provide greater detail into the composition of pyrolysis vapors but also highlight differences between vapors generated from multiple biomass feedstocks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recycling cellulases by substrate adsorption is a promising strategy for reducing the enzyme cost of cellulosic ethanol production. However, β-glucosidase has no carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). Thus, additional enzymes are required in each cycle to achieve a high ethanol yield. In this study, we report a new method of recycling cellulases without β-glucosidase supplementation using lignocellulosic substrate, an engineered strain expressing β-glucosidase and Tween 80. The cellulases and Tween 80 were added to an aqueous suspension of diluted sulfuric acid/ammonia-treated corncobs in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process for ethanol production. Subsequently, the addition of fresh pretreated corncobs to the fermentation liquor and remaining solid residue provided substrates with absorbed cellulases for the next SSF cycle. This method provided excellent ethanol production in three successive SSF cycles without requiring the addition of new cellulases. For a 10% (w/v) solid loading, a cellulase dosage of 30 filter paper units (FPU)/g cellulose, 0.5% Tween 80, and 2 g/L of the engineered strain, approximately 90% of the initial ethanol concentration from the first SSF process was obtained in the next two SSF processes, with a total ethanol production of 306.27 g/kg corncobs and an enzyme productivity of 0.044 g/FPU. Tween 80 played an important role in enhancing cellulase recovery. This new enzyme recycling method is more efficient and practical than other reported methods. Biotechnol.

AB  - Fatty acid deoxygenation is a method for producing renewable hydrocarbon fuels such as green diesel, jet biofuel and biogasoline. In the present commercial method, deoxygenation is directly applied to vegetable oils through liquid phase hydrotreatment. This method is expensive because it consumes a large amount of hydrogen and requires severe operating conditions. The objective of this study was the production of a diesel-like hydrocarbon fuel that can be considered as drop-in replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuels, by catalytic thermal decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap. In particular, this study investigated the decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap at low temperature and pressure, without external supply of hydrogen. The Mg-Zn basic soap (9/1 mole ratio of Mg/Zn) was derived from palm stearin and decarboxylated at 350°C and atmospheric pressure for 5 hours. The basic soap effectively decarboxylated, yielding a diesel-like hydrocarbon fuel with a liquid product yield of 62%- weight. The resulting hydrocarbon product is a complex mixture consisting of normal paraffins in the range of carbon chain length C8-C19, iso-paraffins and various olefin products. © 2017 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Environmental contextThe search for alternative solvents to prevent environmental damage is one of the main interests in 'green' sciences. Five of these new substances from biodiesel production were evaluated to assess their negative environmental effects. The results obtained showed that three of these chemicals may be harmless for short exposure in aquatic biomodels. Although more tests are required, this family of compounds promises to be safe and useful for industrial purposes. AbstractGlycerol-biobased ethers have a high potential as solvents owing to their chemical inertness and diversity, which allows modulation of their properties, such as polarity, hydrophobicity or viscosity, depending on the specific needs in each case. Despite their renewable source, the environmental compatibility of these solvents needs to be checked. The acute ecotoxicity of five glycerol-derived solvents (3-ethoxy-1,2-propanediol, 1,3-diethoxy-2-propanol, 3-butoxy-1,2-propanediol , 1,3-dibutoxy-2-propanol and 1,2,3-tributoxypropane ) was evaluated in a systematic study using several bioindicators covering the trophic chain (the crustacean Daphnia magna, the fish Danio rerio and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii). These results were compared with the previously studied bioindicator Vibrio fischeri. According to the hypothesis of the present work, the toxicity of these solvents increased as a function of their lipophilicity, which is related to the increase in the number and length of the alkyl chains in the basic structure; accordingly, the least toxic compound for all the aquatic organisms was 3-ethoxy-1,2-propanediol and the most toxic solvent was 1,2,3-tributoxypropane, except in the case of D. rerio and V. fischeri, with 1,3-dibutoxy-2-propanol the most toxic chemical. Potential damage caused by eventual emissions, was evaluated using the Environmental Health and Safety Approach, a methodology used for detecting risks related to the environment and the human health. Using available physicochemical and toxicity data, each chemical compound receives a score for the categories health, safety and environment. The best candidates considered as least dangerous for a short exposure time according to the studied biomodels are 3-ethoxy-1,2-propanediol, 3-butoxy-1,2-propanediol and 1,3-diethoxy-2-propanol. © CSIRO 2017.

AB  - The catalyst-free transesterification of castor oil under supercritical conditions, using methanol, was studied in this research to determine the molar ratio (methanol:castor oil) and reaction time that produced the biodiesel with the highest conversion by using a 10 L stainless steel batch reactor. The experiments were carried out with 30:1, 40:1, 50:1 and 60:1 molar ratios and reaction times of 5 min, 15 min, 25 min and 35 min under the critical temperature and pressure values according to the molar ratio tested. The reaction conversion was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The biodiesel was characterized in order to evaluate its accordance to the ASTM D6751 specification and to plot the thermogravimetric and calorimetric profiles of the biodiesel with the highest conversion obtained by TGA and DSC analysis. A regression model was obtained as a reference to calculate the conversion under the studied range of molar ratios and reaction times in future experiments with a coefficient of determination of 95,22% and a standard error of ±1,37% from the observed conversion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel fuels are increasingly attracting interest in the scientific community and in the world motor industry. The morphological analysis of injected sprays is a key factor to increase engine performances using new biodiesel fuels and to compare them with those related to the use of conventional fuels. In this paper, an experimental setup is realised to carry out test campaigns, in order to analyse and compare the spray injections of different fuel typologies. A PC-interfaced electronic system was realised for driving BOSCH injectors and for varying the injection pressure and opening time. Hence, the morphological analysis was performed for each tested fuel by characterising the shaperatio and penetration depth inside the velocimetric chamber. The results show higher penetration values for biodiesel fuels due to their viscosity and drops in superficial tension, which facilitate a deeper penetration compared to those obtained with conventional diesel fuels. Although used biodiesels contain only 20% of renewable vegetable-origin diesel fuels, the viscosity and superficial tension are slightly higher than those of petroleum diesel, thus determining a weak vaporisation and formation of larger drops. By knowing the morphological behaviour of sprays using biofuels and conventional fuel, it is possible, by using programmable electronic systems, to adjust and improve the spray parameters in order to obtain better engine performances. The results reported in this instance could be utilised by future research works for choosing the most suitable biofuel based on the desired morphological behaviour of the injected sprays. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang Publishing.

AB  - Directional microwave-assisted liquefaction and stepwise extraction are introduced for producing platform chemicals: aromatics and monosaccharides. When sulfuric acid was used as a catalyst, a 45% monosaccharides yield and a 29% aromatics yield were obtained from bamboo with 0.3 g catalyst per 18 g methanol and 2 g bamboo at 160 °C with 10 min. Approximately 78–86 wt% of the six biomass materials were converted into liquid products. After the stepwise extraction and precipitation process, the yields of monosaccharide derivatives and three phenolic compound fractions were 39–45% and 28–32%, respectively. Monosaccharides from holocellulose collected with a high purity of methyl glycosides were higher than 90%. Aromatic derivatives with different weight-molecular distributions were separated into three fractions with more than 80% phenolics. As their similar chemical properties within each fraction, platform chemicals have great commercial potential for producing high-quality chemicals and biofuels using mild upgrading conditions. © 2017

AB  - Biomass is an interesting renewable energy resource as it is widespread in nature and low cost. The development of bio-oil derived from biomass as a fuel is still a scientific and industrial challenge. In this context, we demonstrate the synthetic method of bio-oil upgrading catalysts based on hierarchical zeolites and open up interesting perspectives for bio-oil upgrading processes. The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been successfully prepared via a direct hydrothermal synthesis with the aid of a commercial organosilane surfactant (TPOAC). The influences of TPOAC content and Si/Al ratio on hierarchical structures were also systematically studied. To illustrate their catalytic performances, an esterification reaction of various organic acids such as (acetic acid and levulinic acid) and alcohols was performed as the model reaction representing the bio-oil upgrading application. The synergic effect of acidity and the hierarchical structure of catalysts can greatly enhance the catalytic performance in terms of activity, product yield, coke formation, and reusability of the catalysts. For example, they can convert almost 100% of reactant in 8 h in the esterification of acetic acid and alcohols, whereas the conventional zeolite reveals significantly lower activity (<20%). Interestingly, the hierarchical zeolite can also greatly improve the catalytic activity of the esterification of levulinic acid and ethanol to produce ethyl levulinate that can be used as a diesel miscible biofuel (DMB). In addition, the efficiency of hierarchical catalysts obtained by different synthesis methods is also discussed. This first example demonstrates that the hierarchical zeolite obtained via a direct synthesis approach can benefit bio-oil upgrading applications via the esterification of various carboxylic acids. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This work presents the hydrogenation of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) in gaseous fluid phase into a catalytic reactor in order to obtain products with good properties to be used as biofuel. Bimetallic nanoparticles were obtained by impregnation on Al2O3 from the classic catalytic metals used in hydrogenation reactions such as platinum and palladium, combined with iron, to observe the catalytic activity and the selectivity to form interest biofuel compounds. Pt, Pd, Pt-Fe and Pd-Fe catalysts (with 0.5% wt. metal content) supported on alumina were reduced at 450 °C and tested. At 200 °C, Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts presented less than 19% conversion and the main formed product was pentene (90% selectivity). The Pd/Al2O3 catalyst conversion of 2-MF was of 5% at 200 °C, obtaining 1-pentanol and 1-butanol as products, together with a 28% of selectivity. The Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst presented the highest conversion of 2-MF at 200 °C of 31%, the production of alcohols such as 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol and 1-butanol summed a selectivity of 39%. Since the Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst presented the best performance, it was analyzed under high-resolution transmission electron microscopy technique. The HRTEM image revealed the presence of 5 nm size nanoparticles over the alumina, and Pd and Fe oxide nanoparticles were identified measuring the interplanar distances of exposed planes. A FePd3 nanoparticle alloy was also identified, which was the difference in having a greater hydrogenation efficiency for the 2-MF molecule. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The demand for petroleum based fuel has grown in an extensive way because of the increasing industrialization and the growth in transportation sector. This growth has a direct effect on the economy and remains a monopoly in the fuel trade. Bio-fuels are available in a larger volume across the world due to the advantage that they can be directly blended with the petroleum fuels and the results obtained are better when compared to the standard values of neat diesel fuel. Such kind of biofuels can be extracted from lemon fruit and its availability is abundance across globe. This work aims in introducing a new biofuel called as Lemon Essential Oil (LEO) which can be obtained through steam distillation process of lemon rinds. A 20% LEO is blended with diesel (LEO20+ Diesel80) and it is fed as fuel to the engine. The various properties of LEO are examined and they are compared to mineral diesel. The experimental investigation revealed that brake thermal efficiency of LEO20 is marginally higher than diesel at higher loads. Also significant reduction is observed for carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emissions. However, the oxides of nitrogen in LEO20 is comparatively higher than petroleum diesel at rated power output. Furthermore, the in-cylinder gas pressure of LEO20 is followed the similar trend with diesel fuel. In addition, higher heat release rate is also observed for LEO20 from the tested results. Hence, the present research work is showed that the 20% of Lemon Essential Oil could be partial substitute for conventional diesel engine in near future.

AB  - In this work, multifunctional mesoporous silica-based catalysts containing metal, acid and base were successfully synthesized by doping metal cobalt through the impregnation–precipitation method and grafting amino and sulfonic groups by the silicon alkylation method. The catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Dunaliella tertiolecta (D. tertiolecta) was performed at 533 K for 30 min. X-ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X-ray diffraction (SXRD), N2 absorption/desorption isotherm analysis, elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize SBA-15 and multifunctional SBA-15. The hydrothermal testing on the obtained multifunctional SBA-15 were conducted in a stainless steel autoclave at 533 K for 30 min. SXRD, TEM, and N2 absorption/desorption isotherm analysis results showed that Co doping and sulfonic group grafting, but not amino group grafting, could improve the hydrothermal stability of SBA-15. The results of TEM, XRD, and ICP-OES confirmed that Co existed as Co3O4 and entered into the SBA-15 skeleton. Meanwhile, the results of elemental analysis and ICP-OES showed that amino and sulfonic groups were successfully grafted on SBA-15. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and elemental analysis were adopted to identify the composition of the obtained bio-oil. The bio-oil produced by the catalytic HTL of Dunaliella tertiolecta at 533 K for 30 min gained high contents of furfural and its derivatives, as well as low contents of acids, N-containing compounds, and esters, when NH2-SO3H-Co-SBA-15 and SO3H-Co-SBA-15 were used as catalysts. However, fewer conversions and lower bio-oil yields were obtained under the use of such catalysts than under catalyst absence. © 2017

AB  - The carboxylic acids in fast pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) are one of the detrimental properties that impede its straightforward application in internal combustion engines. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to convert the carboxylic acids in bio-oil to ketones efficiently. That is, the acids in a bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of rice husk were firstly transformed to their calcium salts by neutralization with CaCO3 and then subjected to decarboxylation at high temperature to form ketones and regenerate CaCO3 simultaneously. Due to various carboxylic acids contained in the bio-oil, both symmetric and asymmetric ketones were formed. Although phenols, aldehydes and saccharides had almost unnoticeable effect on the decarboxylation of carboxylic acids, they, particularly saccharides, tended to undertake carbonization reaction, leading to the char formation associated with CaCO3 regenerated. After decarboxylation, the acidity of the upgraded bio-oil decreased dramatically from 167.62 to 1.98 mg of KOH/g, whereas its HHV increased from 18.38 to 27.59 MJ/kg. Although the upgraded bio-oil yield was only 46.10%, the energy efficiency could be reached to 69.20%. Decarboxylation of the water-soluble fraction, which was obtained by water extraction of the bio-oil, was also investigated. With the aid of water extraction, most of the acids and saccharides could be enriched in the water-soluble fraction, while the phenols were concentrated into the oil-soluble fraction. After decarboxylation of the water-soluble fraction, the HHV and acidity of the upgraded bio-oil were improved to be 30.05 MJ/kg and 1.03 mg of KOH/g, respectively. The energy efficiency could be enhanced to 77.59%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, transesterification of waste cooking oil has been studied. The cucurbit[7]uril-protected Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40(CsPW-CB[7]) is prepared as a highly efficient catalyst for the direct biodiesel production via the transesterification of waste cooking oil. The CsPW-CB[7] is characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR. Besides, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the operating parameters on the conversion rate of waste cooking oil. In addition, the maximum conversion rate could reach 95.1% under the optimum experimental conditions that are catalyst of 2 wt%, methanol/oil molar ratio of 11: 1, reaction time of 150 min and temperature of 70 °C. According to the assumption of pseudo-first order reaction, the activation energy of the reaction was calculated as 36.0 kJ mol−1, indicating the reaction is easy to react. The physicochemical properties of biodiesel product could reach the ASTM D6751 standard. The results indicated that the CsPW-CB[7] catalyst showed good catalytic performance and its excellent potential application in biodiesel production. Also, based on the coded parameters, the quadratic regression model with determined coefficients was presented. In addition, the model is significant according to the ANOVA analysis and residual plots. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In a neutral sulfite semichemical (NSSC) pulping process, wood chips are pretreated with sodium sulfite and sodium carbonate solution. This pretreatment dissolves a part of hemicellulose and lignin from wood chips. The spent liquor (SL) that is produced in the pretreatment process contains a considerable amount of lignosulfonate and hemicelluloses, but SL is generally treated in the wastewater effluent system of the mills (i.e. lignocelluloses are wasted). In this paper, these lignocelluloses were separated from SL with organic solvents, and their thermal properties were determined. The results showed that the precipitates isolated from SL/acetone, SL/ethanol or SL/isopropyl mixtures with the weight ratio of 67/33 had the highest heating values of 18.61, 17.59 and 17.05 MJ/kg, respectively. The precipitates made from mixing acidified SL and solvents had lower heating values than those made from mixing untreated SL and solvents, which is likely due to the relatively high ash content of the precipitates made from mixing acidified SL and solvent. The theoretical and experimental heating values of precipitates were compared in this work. The precipitates displayed lower ignition temperatures compared with other biomass-based solid fuels, implying that the combustion of precipitates would require lower activation energies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable and substitute fuel to diesel engines. The main limit for adoption of biodiesel on industrial scale as an alternative fuel is the high cost of its synthesis process using raw methanol during transesterification reaction. Using bio-refinery approach and inexpensive high-quality oil feedstock is an effective means to produce low-cost biodiesel. In this study Saussurea heteromalla a novel non-edible seed with high oil contents (30 wt%) was subjected first time to integrated synthesis of biodiesel and ethanol. Transesterification and simultaneous saccharification along with fermentation process was applied to produce biodiesel and ethanol respectively. Alkaline pretreatment with sodium hydroxide (8% w/v) at 100 °C was used to enhance ethanol yield from 30% to 80%. A highest biodiesel yield of 99% was achieved via optimized parameters of 6:1 alcohol to oil ratio with 0.26 wt% catalyst in 55 min time at 65 °C temperature using Response Surface Methodology. It was observed that 112.2 ± 1.6 g of biodiesel and 42.0 ± 0.5 g of ethanol were produced using 1 kg of Saussurea heteromalla seed oil. In addition, the fuel properties of prepared biodiesel were in accordance to ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Significant quantities of bamboo waste are generated in Zhejiang province, China. Many small businesses in this area convert this waste to biochar for use as a cooking fuel (in residential barbecues). This case study was conducted to evaluate the potential economic benefits of building and operating an industrial-sized plant in this province, yielding 500 tonnes per year. The researchers developed a conceptual design for a hypothetical biochar plant and then calculated net present value (NPV), investment payback period (PBP), internal rate of return (IRR), and sensitivity analysis. Results show that the static investment PBP would be 2.58 years, the IRR would be 38.8%, and the NPV would be US$ 486,700. The IRR would be higher than the forestry industry benchmark (11%), indicating that a production line of bamboo-biochar with the stated yield not only could generate higher profits, but also could achieve a better return on investment. Thus, this study indicates that there are good market prospects for the bamboo-biochar industry in this region. The influence of sales prices on the IRR was more than that of operational costs, indicating that a large-scale plant should be designed to produce a high-quality bamboo-biochar. Supply chain issues such as transportation distances between locations where bamboo wastes are generated and the biochar plant should be considered in advance when siting new bamboo-biochar plants. The results from this research provide guidance to those considering development of bamboo-biochar plants in other parts of China. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Life cycle assessments (LCAs) of algal biofuels have typically ignore direct land use change impacts (DLUC), although a few papers have recently shown that the carbon lost from removing the original biomass and disrupting soil organic carbon (SOC) during pond construction can significantly contribute to the climate change impacts. In this study, LCA methods were developed to integrate climate change impacts of DLUC associated with cultivation of microalgae in open ponds and the effects of temporal and geographic variables on algal growth. In addition to direct land use change impacts due to loss of original biomass and the disruption of SOC, this study presents DLUC impacts caused by changing the surface albedo of an area and changing the carbon flux on the land. The methodology is presented with two LCA cases for the production of renewable gasoline from microalgae in climatically similar regions: the Everglades ecoregion and the Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain ecoregion. These were chosen to isolate the differences in DLUC impacts that are created by different land cover types, equalizing the life cycle impacts caused by temperature and solar radiation on algal growth. The DLUC impacts arising from albedo change and carbon flux change contributed significantly to the life cycle climate change impacts and differed between the two climatically similar regions. The baseline life cycle climate change impacts with DLUC impacts in the Everglades are 46.7% higher than those of conventional gasoline, while production in the Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain leads to a 3.0% reduction. The inclusion of albedo change impacts into the DLUC impacts contributed 10.2% of the life cycle climate change impacts in the Everglades and 36.4% in the Tamaulipas. This methodology can help assess the geographically specific sustainability of algal biofuels on a life cycle basis and can guide siting decisions for algal biofuel feedstock production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soybean is a promising biomass resource for generation of second-generation biofuels. Despite the utility of soybean cellulosic biomass and post-processing residues in biofuel generation, there is no comprehensive information available on cell wall loosening and degradation related gene families. In order to achieve enhanced lignocellulosic biomass with softened cell walls and reduced recalcitrance, it is important to identify genes involved in cell wall polymer loosening and degrading. Comprehensive genome-wide analysis of gene families involved in cell wall modifications is an efficient stratagem to find new candidate genes for soybean breeding for expanding biofuel industry. We report the identification of 505 genes distributed among 12 gene families related to cell wall loosening and degradation. 1262 tandem duplication events contributed towards expansion and diversification of studied gene families. We identified 687 Simple Sequence Repeat markers and 5 miRNA families distributed on 316 and 10 genes, respectively. Publically available microarray datasets were used to explore expression potential of identified genes in soybean plant developmental stages, 68 anatomical parts, abiotic and biotic stresses. Co-expression networks revealed transcriptional coordination of different gene families involved in cell wall loosening and degradation process. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a novel platform molecule, 5-bromomethylfurfural (5-BMF) has great potential in the production of varieties of value added chemicals as well as biofuels. RESULT: To overcome the toxicity of the previous 5-BMF preparation process and environment issues, a brand new 5-BMF synthesis pathway is presented in this study. In a biphasic deep eutectic solvent (DES)/MIBK reaction system, reactants and catalysts are enriched in the DES phase and the 5-BMF produced is continuously in situ extracted to the organic solvent phase, giving a 5-BMF yield of up to 50%(mass yield)from fructose. This biphasic reaction system for 5-BMF synthesis has the advantages of green processing and solvent recyclability. CONCLUSION: This research may provide a new alternative for the production of platform chemicals and enriches the map of bio refinery concept. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase (commonly known as β-mannanase) catalyzes a random cleavage of the β-d-1,4-mannopyranosyl linkage in mannan polymers. The enzyme has been utilized in biofuel production from lignocellulose biomass, as well as in production of mannooligosaccharides (MOS) for applications in feed and food industries. We aimed to obtain a β-mannanase, for such mannan polymer utilization, from actinomycetes strains isolated in Indonesia. Strains exhibiting high mannanase activity were screened, and one strain belonging to the genus Kitasatospora was selected. We obtained a β-mannanase from this strain, and an amino acid sequence of this Kitasatospora β-mannanase showed a 58–71% similarity with the amino acid sequences of Streptomyces β-mannanases. The Kitasatospora β-mannanase showed a significant level of activity (944 U/mg) against locust bean gum (0.5% w/v) and a potential for oligosaccharide production from various mannan polymers. The β-mannanase might be beneficial particularly in the enzymatic production of MOS for applications of mannan utilization. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Using an air-liquid interface (ALI) device in dynamic conditions, we evaluated the efficiency of fuel after-treatment strategies (diesel oxidation catalysis, DOC, and diesel particulate filter, DPF, devices) and the impact of 7% and 30% rapeseed methyl esters (RME) blending on oxidative stress and genotoxicity induced in A549 lung cells after 3 h exposure to whole Diesel exhausts. Oxidative stress was studied using assays of ROS production, glutathione level, catalase and superoxide-dismutase (SOD) activities. No oxidative stress and no clear differences on cytotoxicity patterns between biodiesel and standard Diesel exhausts were found. A weak but significant genotoxicity (8-oxodGuo adducts) and, for standard Diesel only, a DNA damage response (DDR) as evidenced by ƔH2AX foci, remained after DOC + DPF flowing. All together, these data could contribute to the improvement of the after treatment strategies and to health risk assessment of current diesel exhausts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crude rubber seed oil is a potential source for biofuel production. However it contains undesirable impurities such as peroxides and high oxidative components that not only affect the oil stability, colour and shelf-life but promote insoluble gums formation with time that could cause deposition in the combustion engines. Therefore to overcome these problems the crude rubber seed oil is refined by undergoing degumming and bleaching process. The effect of bleaching earth dosage (15–40 wt %), phosphoric acid dosage (0.5–1.0 wt %) and reaction time (20–40 min) were studied over the reduction of the peroxide value in a refined crude rubber seed oil. The analysis of variance shows that bleaching earth dosage was the most influencing factor followed by reaction time and phosphoric acid dosage. A minimum peroxide value of 0.1 milliequivalents/gram was achieved under optimized conditions of 40 wt % of bleaching earth dosage, 1.0 wt % of phosphoric acid dosage and 20 min of reaction time using Response Surface Methodology design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Effects of different mass fractions of industrial alcohol additive (10% and 20%) and additive combination (ethanol: 6.58%, acetonitrile: 1.00%, methyl acetate: 2.42%) on the physicochemical characteristics of pine sawdust bio-oil aging for three months by fast pyrolysis of 1–5 kg/h bench-scale fluidized bed reactor with hot vapor filter were investigated. The results indicated that addition of industrial alcohol and additive combination had a significant effect on improving the physicochemical characterization of bio-oil. The additives could significantly lower the viscosity and instantly increase pH value of the bio-oil remarkably and also delay the aging rates of the bio-oil. Results showed that compared with the blank (bio-oil without additive), the pH values of the bio-oils with 10% industrial alcohol (10% IA bio-oil), 20% industrial alcohol (20% IA bio-oil), and additive combination (AC bio-oil) were immediately increased by 12%, 12%, and 21%, respectively when the additives were added. After stored for 90 days, viscosities of crude bio-oil, 10% IA bio-oil, 20% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil were increased by 200%, 54%, 69%, and 62%, respectively. Two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) analysis indicated that the aged bio-oil after 90 days storage had a lower levels of phenols than that of the crude bio-oil and the contents of ketones and esters were increased. FT-IR analysis demonstrated that the structures of non-volatile residue of bio-oils were changed and polymerization occurred with other compounds such as alcohols and aldehydes during storage. © 2016 Energy Institute

AB  - A facile and benign catalytic route has been developed to quantitatively yield γ-valerolactone (GVL; ca. 97%) from biomass-based levulinates at room temperature to 80 °C by using easily available polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) and KF as the liquid H-donor and recyclable catalyst, respectively. No extra step was required to liberate GVL from the in situ-formed siloxane, and this catalytic system exhibited a lower activation energy (40.9 kJ/mol) compared to previously reported ones. The deuterium-labeled study further demonstrated the reaction proceeding through cascade hydrosilylation and cyclization with fluoride successively acting as the nucleophile and base. In addition, the PMHS-derived resin was extremely favorable to restrain the leaching of fluoride and maintain its constant activity for at least six cycles. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Enzymatic fuel cells may become more accessible for applications powering portable electronic devices by broadening the range of potentially usable fuels and oxidizers. In this work we demonstrate the operation of an integrated, yet versatile multi-substrate biofuel cell utilizing either glucose, fructose, sucrose or combinations of thereof as biofuels, and molecular oxygen originating from solution phase and/or an internal chemical source, as the oxidizer. In order to achieve this goal we designed an enzymatic cascade-functionalized anode consisting of invertase (INV), mutarotase (MUT), glucose oxidase (GOX), and fructose dehydrogenase (FDH), deposited on top of a mesoporous carbon nanoparticle matrix, in which electron relay molecules had been entrapped. The anode was then conjugated to a compatible enzymatic cathode that employs a cascade of catalase (CAT) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD), allowing the cell to operate in an aerobic environment and/or to utilize, under anaerobic conditions for instance, hydrogen peroxide as a source for the oxygen oxidizer. While operated in the presence of the sugar mixture and hydrogen peroxide, the power output of the dually cascaded biofuel cell reaches a peak power density of 0.25 mW cm-2 and demonstrates an open circuit potential of 0.65 V. To our knowledge this is the first reported biofuel cell that discharges with both anodic and cathodic enzymatic cascade architectures and the first biofuel cell that is repeatedly switched between aerobic and anaerobic conditions without any significant decrease in the discharge performance. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - A series of bimetallic Nb–Ni oxide catalysts with different Nb/Ni molar ratio have been prepared by chemical precipitation method. XRD, Raman and XPS results indicate that amorphous Nb2O5 species exist in the samples with a Nb/Ni ratio about 0.087. The as-synthesized bimetallic Nb–Ni oxides effectively promote the dispersion of NiO active components, as a result effectively inhibit the agglomeration of NiO particles. Ni0.92Nb0.08O sample with the largest surface area of 173 m2/g mainly consists of fold-like nanosheets and the amorphous Nb2O5 species are well-dispersed all over the bulk NiO. After the reduction in hydrogen, the Nb-promoted bulk nickel catalysts display better catalytic performance for hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived anisole to biofuels than bulk Ni catalyst. The selectivity to deoxygenated products with using Ni0.92Nb0.08 catalyst increases 2.5 fold to that with bulk Ni catalyst at 160 °C and 3 MPa H2, as a result of the synergistic effect between amorphous Nb2O5 species and metal Ni active sites. In addition, with further increase in the reaction temperature to 200 °C, deoxygenation almost goes quantitatively. Graphical Abstract: High-specific-surface-area Nb–Ni oxides are prepared by using chemical precipitation, and display excellent HDO performance for lignin-derived compounds. Selectivity to deoxygenated products increases 2.5 folds over Ni0.92Nb0.08 than over bulk Ni catalyst. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: With increasing concerns over global warming and depletion of fossil-fuel reserves, it is attractive to develop innovative strategies to assimilate CO2, a greenhouse gas, into usable organic carbon. Cell-free systems can be designed to operate as catalytic platforms with enzymes that offer exceptional selectivity and efficiency, without the need to support ancillary reactions of metabolic pathways operating in intact cells. Such systems are yet to be exploited for applications involving CO2 utilization and subsequent conversion to valuable products, including biofuels. The Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) play a pivotal role in global CO2 fixation. Results: We hereby demonstrate the co-assembly of two RubisCO-associated multienzyme cascades with self-assembled synthetic amphiphilic peptide nanostructures. The immobilized enzyme cascades sequentially convert either ribose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) or glucose, a simpler substrate, to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), the acceptor for incoming CO2 in the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by RubisCO. Protection from proteolytic degradation was observed in nanostructures associated with the small dimeric form of RubisCO and ancillary enzymes. Furthermore, nanostructures associated with a larger variant of RubisCO resulted in a significant enhancement of the enzyme's selectivity towards CO2, without adversely affecting the catalytic activity. Conclusions: The ability to assemble a cascade of enzymes for CO2 capture using self-assembling nanostructure scaffolds with functional enhancements show promise for potentially engineering entire pathways (with RubisCO or other CO2-fixing enzymes) to redirect carbon from industrial effluents into useful bioproducts. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Sulfonic acid (-SO3H) functionalized anthracene derived conjugated porous organic polymer (AnPOP-SO3H) have been constructed through Friedel-Crafts alkylation of anthracene by using formaldehyde dimethyl acetal as a cross-linker and anhydrous FeCl3 as a promoter followed by sulfonation of aromatic rings using chlorosulfonic acid under controlled reaction conditions. Morphological evolution, porous structure, nature and strength of the acid sites and structural integrity with different chemical environments have been comprehensively examined by employing HR-TEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy), FE-SEM (Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy), Powder X-ray diffraction, N2 sorption, NH3-TPD (Temperature Programmed Desorption), solid state 13C CP MAS-NMR (Cross Polarization Magic Angle Spinning-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), HAADF-STEM (High Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy) with the corresponding elemental mapping and FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopic tools. This newly designed AnPOP-SO3H metal-free organocatalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic activity in the acetalization of Bio-Glycerol with acetone, furfural, and benzaldehyde under solvent free and ambient temperature conditions to furnish 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxalane-4-methanol (solketal) derivatives, with quantitative conversion and good selectivities. An enhancement in the catalytic performance of the nanohybrid metal-free solid acid catalyst is observed compared with the conventional reported catalysts which could be attributed to the presence of high acidic sites, huge surface area accompanied with the highly rigid cross linked framework thereby facilitating easy diffusion of organic substrates to interact with the catalytic active sites and prohibiting water diffusion inside the pore owing to the hydrophobic nature of the catalyst. The investigated AnPOP-SO3H represents a novel class of promising heterogeneous metal-free organocatalyst with ten recycles in succession and no sign of catalyst deactivation, useful for the transformation of Bio-Glycerol to value-added chemicals in an eco-friendly manner for future industry. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The production of renewable energy has become an important element in worldwide energy policy aimed to reduce greenhouse gases caused by fossil fuels. Biodiesel derived from transesterification of vegetable oil or animal fats, with alcohol in the presence of catalyst has been considered as one of the alternative resources to replace fossil fuels. However, the biodiesel produced from these materials may not be enough for total replacement; hence microalgae are used as another potential alternative due to their high photosynthetic efficiency and biomass productivity. In this study, a microalgae species i.e. Chlorella vulgaris UMACC 001 having high oil to biomass ratio was cultured, harvested and characterised. It showed very high growth rate, μ (0.29 per day) and biomass productivity (0.14 mg litre per day). In addition, the resulting algal oil showed almost equal amount of saturated fatty acid (48.9%) and unsaturated fatty acid (51.1%). When converted to biodiesel, the ester content was 68.9% and comparable with that produced in previous study (71.0%). Thus, Chlorella vulgaris can be considered as a potential feedstock for biofuel production in the future.

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOx) is an enzyme, which is used for the development of enzymatic biofuel cells. Therefore in this research redox competition mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (RC-SECM) was applied for the investigation of glucose oxidase (GOx) catalyzed reaction kinetics. The GOx was immobilized by glutaraldehyde on substrates of different electrical conductivity: (i) gold covered glass was used as conducting substrate and (ii) plastic poly(methyl methacrylate) was used as non-conducting substrate. Current vs distance dependencies were registered by SECM at different concentrations of glucose in the absence of redox mediator. The potential of −750 mV vs Ag/AgCl(3 M KCl) was applied to the microelectrode (ME), which was used as a probe in SECM, in order to register oxygen reduction current. Consumption of oxygen by the GOx based layer was evaluated according to principles determined by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Apparent Michaelis constants KM(app.) were calculated from the dependencies of current vs glucose concentration. In both these cases the KM(app.) value increased when the distance between ME and enzyme modified surface was increasing from 10 to 30 μm, while the KM(app.) value decreased by increasing the distance from 30 to 60 μm. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biofuels are proven for its environment friendliness, but they are not completely effective in reducing the emissions due to the problems in blending ratio, compression ratio (CR) and fuel consumption. Moreover, identifying new oil with appropriate blends of diesel is the prerequisite for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, without compromising the mechanical efficiency. Inspired from the special biofuel characteristics, this paper contributes to the literature through improving the diesel engine performance using tamanu oil (TO)-based biodiesel blend. Firstly, the TO-based biodiesel is blended with the conventional diesel to produce two blending ratios, namely 5:95 and 10:90. The blends are experimentally studied for its combustion characteristics, mechanical efficiency and the emission characteristics on a single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine. The results demonstrate the minimized emissions with no sort of compromise on the engine performance. Secondly, this paper proposes an interpolation and prediction model using artificial neural network through which the mechanical efficiency and the emission characteristics of the TO blends can be estimated. The deviation between the actual and the estimated characteristics is found to be less and so the proposed prediction model can act as an equivalent engine model for further works. © 2016, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.

AB  - Glycerol, considered as a waste feedstock resulting from biodiesel production, has received much attention in recent years due to its properties, which offer to recover energy. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of a thermal water vapor plasma for waste (crude) glycerol conversion to synthesis gas, or syngas (H2 + CO). In parallel of crude glycerol, a pure glycerol (99.5%) was used as a reference material in order to compare the concentrations of the formed product gas. A direct current (DC) arc plasma torch stabilized by a mixture of argon/water vapor was utilized for the effective glycerol conversion to hydrogen-rich synthesis gas. It was found that after waste glycerol treatment, the main reaction products were gases with corresponding concentrations of H2 50.7%, CO 23.53%, CO2 11.45%, and CH4 3.82%, and traces of C2H2 and C2H6, which concentrations were below 0.5%. The comparable concentrations of the formed gas products were obtained after pure glycerol conversion—H2 46.4%, CO 26.25%, CO2 11.3%, and CH4 4.7%. The use of thermal water vapor plasma producing synthesis gas is an effective method to recover energy from both crude and pure glycerol. The performance of the glycerol conversion system was defined in terms of the produced gas yield, the carbon conversion efficiency, the cold gas efficiency, and the specific energy requirements. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Eight genetically different hybrid poplar samples with varying lignin content were pyrolyzed at 500°C using a micropyrolysis unit, which was directly connected to a GC/MS. Four of these hybrid poplar samples with a range of lignin content were then pyrolyzed at temperatures of 550 and 600°C to determine the effects of pyrolysis temperature on product distribution among bio-oil, char, and gas. At a pyrolysis temperature of 500°C, an increase in poplar lignin content from 17% to 22% decreased the relative bio-oil yield from 73% to 65%, increased the char yield from 17.5% to 27.2%, and decreased the yield of lignin-derived phenolic species in the bio-oil by 3%. At the higher pyrolysis temperature of 600°C, there was neither a decrease in the yield of bio-oil nor an increase in the char yield, and there was an increase in the relative abundamnce of bio-oil phenolics compared to the results obtained at 500°C. According to these results, higher temperatures are needed to increase the yield of bio-oil and the content of phenolic species in bio-oil. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The polyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PANI/PVA/MWCNTs) composite nanofibers were synthesized using electrospinning technique. Nanofibres morphology was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrospun PANI/PVA/MWCNTs nanofibres with average diameter of about 60–100 nm exhibited smooth surface at higher magnifications of × 25000. The PANI/PVA/MWCNTs nanofibres modified electrode showed good electron transfer behavior because of the excellent properties of carbon nanotubes and the three dimensional and porous structures of electrospun nanofibres. The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) covalently immobilized with PANI/PVA/MWCNTs nanofibres exhibited good electrocatalytic activity towards oxidation of glucose through redox active as well as biocompatible mediator ferritin (FRT). The maximum current density using this nanostructured bioanode was 7.5 mA cm− 2 at 100 mVs− 1 vs Ag/AgCl in a 20 mM glucose solution. The heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (Ks) was found to be 3.09 s− 1. The results indicated that these electrospun PANI/PVA/MWCNTs nanofibres have potential to be used in BFC device as anode. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production and use of fossil fuels have caused a drastic increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which is associated directly with the global warming problem. Biofuels and carbon capture through forest plantations are interesting alternatives to address this problem. This paper presents an optimization model for the design of an integrated energy system for producing fuels and biofuels considering the interaction with eco-industries able to capture emissions from biorefineries and refineries and receive a monetary benefit. The proposed mathematical model takes into account the availability of biomass, the production of oil, and a set of existing biorefineries and refineries as well as the possibility to install new eco-industries. The mathematical approach was applied to a nationwide case study for Mexico, considering the creation of new jobs, overall emissions, and net profit as objectives. The results are shown in a Pareto curve, which is useful for making decisions about the interactions between these industries as well as determining the configuration of the supply chain to satisfy the fuel demands. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - With growing concerns about environmental pollution and depletion of fossil fuel resources, various biofuels have been assessed. In this paper, the performance and emission characteristics of sapote seed oil methyl ester blends were studied. Sapote seed oil methyl ester was blended with diesel in increments of 5%. Additionally, 5% diethyl ether was added to all blends with sapote seed oil methyl ester in order to reduce the overall viscosity of the blends. It was observed that with an increase in the proportion of sapote seed oil methyl ester in the blend, CO, HC emissions and smoke opacity decreased. Similarly, with an increase in sapote seed oil methyl ester content in the blend, brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature and NOx emissions also increased. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A series of tribological experiments have been conducted to characterise and study the formation of tribofilms derived from TiF3 and FeF3 catalysts impregnated in soot-contaminated lubricants. Results showed that inorganic fluorides reduced friction and wear in the specimen contaminated lubricants. With the best results observed when TiF3 was used. There were also indications that the frictional process, when coupled with the fluorides induced a structural change in the soot particles within the contact zones, contributing to the improved tribological performance. The key contributors to the formation of robust tribofilms were adsorption and tribo-chemical reactions. The better tribological response leads to a method for the design of engine lubricants to mitigate against the effects of soot contamination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Fe, Co and Cu modified HZSM-5 zeolites were prepared via impregnation method and the modified catalysts were characterized by XRD, Py-IR and BET methods. Then online catalytic upgrading of rape straw pyrolysis vapors was performed over the modified catalysts to investigate their catalytic upgrading performance and anti coking performance. The results showed that loadings of Fe, Co and Cu were well-distributed, the acid distributions on the HZSM-5 were influenced differently by Fe, Co and Cu, and the channels were modified with the decrease of pore volume. The bio-oil yields were decreased with the increase of physicochemical properties after upgrading by employing the modified HZSM-5. The yield, oxygen content, pH value, dynamic viscosity and high heating value (HHV) of bio-oil obtained by using Fe, Co and Cu/HZSM-5 were 18.37%~19.03%, 15.13%~17.23%, 5.05~5.12, 5.16~5.22 mm2/s and 34.56~36.01 MJ/kg, respectively. The refined bio-oil was composed of a variety of organic compounds which was indicated by many kinds of chemical functional groups, the content of hydrocarbons in refined bio-oil was increased significantly. Aromatization performances of Fe/HZSM-5, Co/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 were improved and contents of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were obviously increased. And after catalytic upgrading by Fe/HZSM-5 and Co/HZSM-5, the contents of the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) were relatively high. Resistance performances of Fe/HZSM-5 and Co/HZSM-5 for amorphous coke were relatively strong, while that of Co/HZSM-5 for graphite coke was enhanced obviously. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - Olive tree pruning, as one of the most abundant lignocellulosic residues in Mediterranean countries, has been evaluated as a source of sugars for fuel and chemicals production. A mild acid pretreatment has been combined with a fungal pretreatment using either two endophytes (Ulocladium sp. and Hormonema sp.) or a saprophyte (Trametes sp. I-62). The use of endophytes is based on the important role that some of them play during the initial stages of wood decomposition. Without acid treatment, fungal pretreatment with Ulocladium sp. provided a nonsignificant enhancement of 4.6% in glucose digestibility, compared to control. When a mild acid hydrolysis was carried out after fungal pretreatments, significant increases in glucose digestibility from 4.9% to 12.0% (compared to control without fungi) were observed for all fungal pretreatments, with maximum values yielded by Hormonema sp. However, despite the observed digestibility boost, the total sugar yields (taking into account solid yield) were not significantly increased by the pretreatments. Nevertheless, based on these preliminary improvements in digestibility, this work proves the potential of endophytic fungi to boost the production of sugar from olive tree pruning, which would add an extra value to the bioeconomy of olive crops. © 2017 Raquel Martín-Sampedro et al.

AB  - The analysis of biological resources for biofuels production in Ukraine has been carried out, and it has been shown that usage of alternative energy sources has great potential for substantially improving energy supply of the state and solving environmental problems. The directions of development and new technologies of obtaining motor fuels from biomass are systematized. It has been established that usage of different types of biofuels and their mixtures for feeding internal combustion engines involves application of modified engines in terms of structure and algorithms and usage of traditional designs of cars without significant structural changes. Moreover, the impact of biofuels on the efficient operation of the engine requires further integrated research.

AB  - Biodiesel is a very attractive, biodegradable, renewable, and virtually nontoxic form of fuel. It is derived through base-catalysed transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. Analysis of biodiesel has become relevant, since the higher quality of the fuel is a key factor in commercialisation and market acceptance. The analytical methods employed are being constantly improved to meet this requirement. The most popular techniques for analysis of biodiesel include mainly chromatography and molecular spectroscopy. FTIR infrared spectroscopy is one of the most important spectroscopic techniques. The article presents the results of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and FTIR infrared spectroscopy analysis employed for investigating methyl esters of higher fatty acids obtained with laboratory methods from selected sunflower and rapeseed oils and waste animal fats provided by a slaughterhouse. Commercial methyl esters were included in the analyses for comparison. In all samples, the contents of free glycerol, methanol, esters, and linolenic acid methyl ester in FAME were determined mainly to facilitate the spectroscopic analysis. The results of the investigations conducted with the aforementioned methods clearly indicate that the analysed WCO esters can be successfully used as potential industrial-scale biofuels. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company.

AB  - Furfural and levulinic acid (LA) are potential major renewable platform chemicals for producing biochemicals and biofuels. In this study, integrated conversion of corncob to furfural and LA was carried out in a one-pot system using p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) and step temperature profiling. A batch reaction incorporating distillation (BRD) resulted in a good furfural production yield of 61.6% based on the corncob xylan content for the hydrolysis conditions tested. Distillation not only reduced furfural loss due to side reactions to humins, but also resulted in a fairly pure and concentrated furfural solution. At the end of the first distillation step, the reaction temperature was increased to convert hexoses into LA with a maximal production yield of 61.3 ± 7.8% based on corncob glucan content. LA was extracted with good yield as LA-ester using low-cost alcohols and then phase separated to recycle alcohols and p-TsOH. Good recyclability and reusability of p-TsOH and alcohols were demonstrated. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The objective of this study was to delineate the effects of different coffee processing residues on the anaerobic microbes and corresponding digestion performance. The results elucidated that mucilage-rich feed enhanced the accumulation of methanogens, which consequently led to better digestion performance of biogas production. Fifty percent more methane and up to 3 times more net energy (heat and electricity) output were achieved by the digestion of the mucilage-rich feed (M3). The microbial community and statistical analyses further elucidated that different residues in the feed had significant impact on microbial distribution and correspondingly influenced the digestion performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous research has shown that syngas can successfully hydrotreat bio-oil, but the hydrotreated products still had high viscosity, total acid number, oxygen content, etc. The current study was based on the hypothesis that higher temperature syngas hydrotreating may reduce the viscosity, total acid number, oxygen content and increase the total hydrocarbon concentration. In the current study, hydrotreating of oxidized fractionated bio-oil was performed at 400 °C in the presence of syngas (molar ratio H2: CO was 4:6). The total yield of the organic liquid product was 34.2 wt%, and 40 wt% of the total organic phase was composed of hydrocarbons (olefins, aromatics and polyaromatics). The treated bio-oil had upgraded physiochemical properties with a water content of 1.6 vol%, a higher heating value of 38.3 MJ/kg, a density of 0.96 g/mL, a viscosity of 12.2 cSt and a total acid number of 22.0 mg KOH/g. Functional group distinctions were detected by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the chemical composition differences were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the fractionated bio-oil had been greatly improved by syngas hydrotreating at 400 °C. This success of syngas hydrotreating at a higher temperature has the potential to allow the replacement of hydrogen with syngas for the partial upgrading of oxidized bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental challenges have enhanced renewed focus on the need to drive the economy in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable manner; therefore resulting to the emergence of the concept of green economy (GE). In driving the economy towards a green growth path, the pattern of trade and security of energy will play a vital role. Energy (renewable) has been identified as one of the 6 sectors that would provide trade opportunities for export markets in the transition towards a GE, particularly for developing economies, Africa inclusive. This can be done through use of appropriate policies and trade remedies geared towards enhancing the infrastructural and technological capacities of these countries towards the exchange of environmentally friendly goods and services. Through the export of renewable energy such as solar, wind, biofuels, given their abundant supply in Africa; energy security would be achieved with transition to a greener growth path as against a “brown” or (“dirty”) growth. From the foregoing, this study explores the components of trade-offs and synergies in relation to trade and security of energy in Africa in the wake of the need for the continent to switch to GE using a sample of 43 selected African countries (2006-2013). The data engaged are sourced from the World Development Indicators. Some important findings and their policy implications are documented in the study. © 2017, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

AB  - In bioindustry, syngas fermentation is a promising technology for biofuel production without the use of plant biomass as sugar-based feedstock. The aim of this study was to identify optimal conditions for high efficient ethanol and volatile fatty acids (VFA) production from synthetic gas fermentation. Therefore, the effect of different gases (pure CO, H2, and a synthetic syngas mixture), media (acetate medium and acetate-free medium), and biocatalyst (pure and mixed culture) were studied. Acetate was the most dominant product independent on inoculum type. The maximum concentration of volatile fatty acids and ethanol was achieved by the pure culture (Clostridium ragsdalei). Depending on the headspace gas composition, VFA concentrations were up to 300% higher after fermentation with Clostridium ragsdalei compared to fermentation with mixed culture. The preferred gas composition with respect to highest VFA concentration was pure CO (100%) regardless of microbial composition of the inoculum and media composition. The addition of acetate had a negative impact on the VFA formation which was depending on the initial gas composition in head space. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For structured catalysts of biofuels transformation into syngas inexpensive and stable to sintering active components based upon Mg-doped γ-alumina with supported LaNi0.9Ru0.1O3 perovskite or MnCr2O4 spinel promoted by Ru + Ni were developed. Characterization of the surface features, reactivity, catalytic activity and routes of ethanol transformation on these catalysts demonstrated that suppression of support acidity, strong interaction of Ru-Ni alloy nanoparticles with manganese chromite layers on support and a high redox ability provide a high yield of syngas and stability to coking. The most promising active component (2 wt% Ni + 2 wt% Ru)/MnCr2O4/10 wt% MgO − γ-Al2O3 supported on microchannel heat-conducting CrAlO cermet plates demonstrated a high performance and stability to coking in the autothermal reforming of such reactive fuels as glycerol, anisol and turpentine oil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For the encapsulation of biomolecules in inorganic materials, we have developed a unique enzyme-silicate conjugate material that consists of a self-assembled molecularly thin silicate layer on the surface of each individual enzyme molecule. The enzyme-silicate conjugate materials, called single enzyme caged nanoparticles (SECNs), were synthesized via the silica polymerization on the surface of enzyme molecule after solubilizing each enzyme molecule in hexane by using a tiny amount of surfactant, called “ion-pairing”. SECNs possess near native enzyme activity in aqueous media with minimal substrate diffusional limitations, and are highly stable under the protection of silicate network cage. Due to their nearly molecular size, SECNs can also be adsorbed into mesoporous silica materials to yield robust and easily-recyclable enzymatic systems that can be used in a number of potential biocatalytic applications such as diagnostics, biosensors, biotransformations, biofuel production, bioremediation and CO2 capture. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the improved biomass (1.6 folds) and lipid (1.3 folds) productivities in Synechocystis sp. NN using agro-industrial wastes supplementation through hybrid response surface methodology-genetic algorithm (RSM-GA) for cost-effective methodologies for biodiesel production was achieved. Besides, efficient harvesting in Synechocystis sp. NN was achieved by electroflocculation (flocculation efficiency 97.8 ± 1.2%) in 10 min when compared to other methods. Furthermore, different pretreatment methods were employed for lipid extraction and maximum lipid content of 19.3 ± 0.2% by Synechocystis sp. NN was attained by ultrasonication than microwave and liquid nitrogen assisted pretreatment methods. The highest FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) conversion of 36.5 ± 8.3 mg FAME/g biomass was obtained using titanium oxide as heterogeneous nano-catalyst coupled whole-cell transesterification based method. Conclusively, Synechocystis sp. NN may be used as a biodiesel feedstock and its fuel production can be enriched by hybrid RSM-GA and nano-catalyst technologies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel, as a substitute for diesel has been getting the attention of researchers/scientists of all over the world. The R & D has indicated that up to B20, there is no need of modification and little work is available related to suitability and sustainability of biodiesel production from Jatropha and algae as non-edible oil sources. The objective of the present study was to optimize the process parameters for transesterification of low free fatty acid (FFA) Jatropha and algae oil blend. A low temperature transesterification process was selected to make the transesterification process more energy efficient. A model was developed to correlate the biodiesel yield with process parameters viz methanol/oil volumetric ratio, Catalyst concentration and reaction time. A biodiesel yield of 81.98% was achieved with methanol/oil volumetric ratio (3:5) using KOH as catalyst (0.9% w/w) in 180 min time at 50 °C temperature. It was observed that catalyst concentration, reaction time and methanol/oil volumetric ratio had a significant effect on blend yield. It is found out that this model can be used in the industry to improve the efficiency of biodiesel production from blend of Jatropha and algae oil thereby, saving time and cost of the process in optimizing the process parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Second generation biofuels offer the opportunity to mitigate emissions from the growing transportation sector while respecting the scarcity of arable land in agriculture. Biomass-to-liquid (BtL) concepts based on large-scale gasification are capable of using low-quality residual feedstock, such as wheat straw or forest residues, for the production of transportation fuels. However, large amounts of biomass feedstock are required to achieve the economic capacity of a synthesis plant. Depending on the steepness of the terrain and the role of feedstock owners, biomass potentials can only be utilized to a large extent at increasing costs per ton. Such diseconomies of scale are particularly problematic in the presence of already established value chains consuming the easily accessible and low-cost feedstock. As a result, second-generation biofuel supply chains face steep supply curves with sharply increasing unit costs. This article investigates the impact of established utilization paths on a large-scale biofuel production value chain. To do so, a mixed-integer linear model is presented which first determines the allocation of biomass resources to CHP plants and domestic consumers. Based on the resulting costs and supply curves, the model then determines the optimum configuration of the synfuel supply chain including locations and capacities of conversion plants, feedstock procurement and transportation. The model is applied to a case study covering six regions in south-central Chile. The total supply chain cost for the production of synthetic gasoline is estimated to amount to 0.8–0.9 € per liter. Feedstock costs of the synfuel supply chain are 20–50% higher in comparison to the price paid by CHP plants and households. The results indicate that both torrefaction and fast pyrolysis can be applied beneficially to utilize remote biomass resources which are less in demand by established consumers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Continuous in-situ transesterification of Chinese tallow tree seeds into methyl esters using a resonant focusing cavity microwave coupled with a CSTR system was investigated. High production yield of 90% with 97% conversion rate was obtained in 24 min CSTR residence time at a methanol/hexane/Chinese tallow tree seed mass ratio of 47.5:39.3:20, a continuous microwave heating power of 290 W and 14 s exposure time, reaction temperature of 60 °C in presence of sodium hydroxide catalyst (4 g NaOH per 100 g oil). The experimental data fits first order reaction kinetics. The values of rate constants at different temperatures and the corresponding activation energy were found out to be 0.08–0.084 min−1 and 2057.4 J mol−1, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters values such as Gibbs free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy of activation (ΔS) were also determined. The positive values of ΔG and small negative value of ΔH indicated that the reaction has an unspontaneous/endergonic nature and is slightly exothermic. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst, which was prepared by in situ temperature-programmed reduction and in the mixture with the inert (SiC, SiO2) or acidic (γ-Al2O3) material was studied in methyl palmitate hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Methyl palmitate HDO was carried out at temperatures of 270–330 °C, H2/feed volume ratio of 600 Nm3/m3, and H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa. Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst, diluted with γ-Al2O3 showed a higher activity than Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst diluted with SiC or SiO2. The conversion of methyl palmitate increased significantly in the presence of γ-Al2O3 most probably due to the acceleration of the acid-catalyzed reaction of ester hydrolysis. The synergism of Ni2P/SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 in methyl palmitate HDO can be explained by the cooperation of the metal sites of Ni2P/SiO2 and the acid sites of γ-Al2O3 in consecutive metal-catalyzed and acid-catalyzed reactions of HDO. The obtained results let us conclude that the balancing of metal and acid sites plays an important role in the development of the efficient catalyst for the HDO of fatty acid esters over supported phosphide catalysts. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The influence of floating vessel motions on the hydrodynamic behavior of multiphase flows in porous media was studied using a hexapod ship motion emulator with an embarked packed column. The response of gas-liquid distribution, pressure drop, liquid saturation, and flow regime transition to column inclinations and roll motions was compared to those of the corresponding static vertical and inclined configurations. Two-phase flow patterns in terms of local liquid saturation distribution were visualized online by means of a capacitance wire-mesh sensor positioned firmly on the floating packed bed. The hydrodynamic performance of packed beds under roll motion deviates strongly from that of the static beds, indicating that the known characteristics of the conventional land-based trickle-bed reactors cannot be transposed on a one-to-one basis for design and scale-up of the floating reactor configurations. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - To reduce industrial production cost, cheap and easily available rapeseed oil deodorizer distillates were used as feedstock to prepare biodiesel in this study. As a result, liquid forms of Candida rugosa lipase and Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) were functioned as new and effective catalysts with biodiesel yield of 92.63% for 30 h and 94.36% for 9 h, respectively. Furthermore, the synergetic effect between the two lipases was employed to enhance biodiesel yield with a result of 98.16% in 6 h under optimized conditions via response surface methodology. The obtained conversion rate surpassed both yields of the individual two lipases and markedly shortened the reaction time. The resultant optimal conditions were ROL ratio 0.84, water content 46 wt% (w/w), reaction temperature 34 °C, and reaction time 6 h. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Multiphase flow reactors such as trickle bed reactors are frequently used reactors in many industries. Understanding the fluid dynamics of these kinds of reactors is necessary to design and optimize them. The pressure drop and liquid saturation are the most important hydrodynamic parameters in these reactors, which depend highly on the porosity distribution inside the bed. The eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) was applied as a numerical approach to model multiphase flow through packed beds of solid particles. This method has the ability to be coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) through interphase momentum transfer which makes it suitable for many Eulerian-Lagrangian systems. The XDEM also calculates the porosity distribution along the bed, which not only eliminates the empirical correlations but also makes it possible to investigate the maldistribution of liquid saturation inside the bed. The results for the hydrodynamics parameters were compared with experimental data, and satisfactory agreement was achieved. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Immobilization on Glyoxyl–agarose support (Gx) is one of the best strategies to stabilize enzymes. However, the strategy is difficult to apply at neutral pH when most enzymes are stable and, even when possible, produces labile derivatives. This work contributes to overcoming this hurdle through a strategy that combines solid-phase amination, presence of key additives, and derivative basification. To this end, aminated industrial lipases from Candida artarctica (CAL), Thermomyces lunuginosus (TLL), and the recombinant Geobacillus thermocatenulatus (BTL2) were immobilized on Gx for the first time at neutral pH using anthranilic acid (AA) or DTT as additives (immobilization yields &gt;70%; recovered activities 37.5–76.7%). The spectroscopic evidence suggests nucleophilic catalysis and/or adsorption as the initial lipase immobilization events. Subsequent basification drastically increases the stability of BTL2–glyoxyl derivatives under harsh conditions (t1/2, from 2.1–54.5 h at 70 °C; from 10.2 h–140 h in 80% dioxane). The novel BTL2-derivatives were active and selective in fish oil hydrolysis (1.0–1.8 μmol of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) min-1·g-1) whereas the selected TLL-derivative was as active and stable in biodiesel production (fatty ethyl esters, EE) as the commercial Novozyme®-435 after ten reaction cycles (~70% EE). Therefore, the potential of the proposed strategy in producing suitable biocatalysts for industrial processes was demonstrated. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - There recently has been progress on the fundamental understanding of fast pyrolysis as a promising strategy for biorenewable energy. An example of this progress is the dissection of bulk-sum models into individual molecular reactions as an effort to explain and predict the product yields in biomass pyrolysis. However, rigorous efforts have been scarce to experimentally validate each molecular reaction in pyrolysis. In this work, we evaluate molecular reaction mechanisms in the pyrolysis of glucose labeled with 13C on the C-1, C-3, or C-6 position. We adopt a novel experimental system that we have recently developed to study isothermal reaction kinetics with a very short reactor residence time (∼0.2 s) in virtual real time, which is ideally suited to correlate the results with primary reactions in theoretical modeling. We were able to support the previously proposed primary reaction mechanism for C4H8O4 (erythrose) but reject those for C3H6O3 (dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde) and C3H6O2 (acetol). Alternative reaction pathways proposed to explain our data suggest that retro aldol reaction is much more efficient than Grob fragmentation in general. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The biomass-derived platform molecule levulinic acid is converted into the angelica lactone dimer (ALD) in high overall yield using simple inorganic catalysts. Hydrodecarboxylation of ALD using a Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst under moderate hydrogen gas pressure at high temperatures generates branched C8–C9 hydrocarbons in nearly quantitative yield consuming as little as a single equivalent of external hydrogen. These molecules are high-octane “drop-in” equivalents of isoalkanes used in commercial gasoline. Catalytic hydrodecarboxylation is presented as a highly effective means to reduce hydrogen demand in biomass-to-biofuel conversion technologies. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Upgrading of the bio-oil aqueous fraction (BAF) for liquid hydrocarbon production was studied in this work. Hydrotreating pretreatment and methanol cocracking were combined as a dual-stage hydrotreating-cocracking process to overcome the severe coking problem caused by the hydrogen-lacking property of BAF. The influences of hydrotreating temperature, reaction pressure, and BAF/methanol ratio in feedstock were investigated. It was found that the hydrogenation efficiencies of phenols in BAF were elevated with increases in hydrotreating temperature and reaction pressure, which were important for maintaining cracking catalyst activity. However, a too high hydrotreating temperature significantly enhanced the gasification reaction and led to reduction in the final liquid hydrocarbon yield. Meanwhile, an excessively high BAF/methanol ratio obviously accelerated the deactivation of the cracking catalyst. The comparison of different cracking processes showed that dual-stage hydrotreating-cocracking was the most superior in stable liquid hydrocarbon generation. Finally, the reaction mechanism was proposed based on experimental results. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - 5-Ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) and ethyl levulinate (EL) have been considered as the new promising biofuels. A comparative study was conducted for the direct conversion of carbohydrates into EMF and EL in different medium containing ethanol. The distribution and formation kinetics of EL, EMF, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and levulinic acid (LA) in pure ethanol and ethanol/organic solvent medium were compared, and the results showed that the addition of n-hexane can improve the accumulation of EMF. When the volume ratio of ethanol to n-hexane was 6:4, 66.29% of EMF yield can be obtained from fructose at 120°C and 180 min. The total yield of the EMF and EL can reach to 83.71%, increased by 5.73% compared with that in pure ethanol medium. Moreover, water addition can suppress the etherification of HMF to EMF and promote the rehydration of HMF to LA in the process. On the basis, a putative reaction pathway for the conversion of carbohydrates in ethanol/n-hexane medium was proposed. © 2017 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Lipase (Candida sp. 99–125) was immobilized by a two-step process, adsorption and subsequent entrapment. The formation mechanism of immobilized lipase was investigated by SEM and EDS. With the support of diatomite, the internal network of immobilized lipase showed more porosity and was fully developed. The dimension of the network was more uniform in the present of gelatine. The maximum biodiesel yield was 92% at 40 °C in a 24 h reaction. The biodiesel yield was maintained at about 70% after 11 repeated batch reactions. This enzyme immobilization method has potential applications in biodiesel and other lipase catalyzed synthesis process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - De-oiled Millettia (Pongamia) pinnata seed waste (PPW) is produced in large amounts after the oil extraction process, but still contains 20% (w/w) oil residues. These raw wastes are of no value and consist of toxic compounds, such as karanjin and di-ketone pongamol, with an overall composition of 45–51% carbon and 5–7% hydrogen and 91% combustible compounds, including fixed carbon and volatile matter. The conversion of PPW to biofuel via pyrolysis is one potential use. Fast pyrolysis of PPW was performed at 400, 500 and 600 °C in a micro-batch pyrolyzer interfaced with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). However, the pyrolytic products contained a high level of oxygenated- (34.1–66.5%) and nitrogenated-compounds, giving poor fuel properties, such as a high acidity and viscosity. Oxygenated compounds were mainly carboxylic acids, ketones, alcohols and esters. The introduction of the zeolite (USY) catalyst into the pyrolysis of PPW improve the pyrolytic liquid properties. The oxygenated compounds underwent undergoing decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydration reactions and further conversion to aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis at 500 °C of small sized PPW particles (125–425 μm) at a PPW: USY ratio of 1:5 gave the highest hydrocarbon yield (99.0%). The selectivity for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 500 °C was increased from 4.7–17.4% to 52.5–56.5% when the biomass: catalyst ratio was increased from 1:1 to 1:5. Moreover, the USY catalyst promoted carbon chain scission producing shorter hydrocarbons (C5–12), which was enhanced by the decarboxylation and dealkylation of the alkylated oxygenated compounds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling were used to study the decomposition mechanisms of the bio-oil model compound formic acid over a cobalt-stepped surface. Zero-point-energy-corrected activation barriers and reaction energies and the rate and equilibrium constants of various elementary reactions were obtained. Formic acid dissociation likely starts from dehydrogenation and dehydroxylation, with activation barriers of less than 0.5 eV. The generation of an HCOO intermediate is thermodynamically favored, but such a compound is energetically difficult to convert. COOH formation is fast and dominant at low temperatures, and it is converted rapidly after 450 K. The most favorable formic acid decomposition pathway is HCOOH → COOH → CO. Its rate-determining step is CO-OH scission, with an activation barrier of 0.66 eV and strong exothermicity of -1.19 eV. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The effect of various reaction temperature on the hydrocracking of Cerbera manghas oil to produce a paraffin-rich mixture of hydrocarbons with Co-Ni/HZSM-5 as doubled promoted catalyst were studied. The Co-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst with various metal loading and metal ratio was prepared by incipient wet-ness impregnation. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, AAS, and N2 adsorption-desorption. Sur-face area, pore diameter, and pore volume of catalysts decreased with the increasing of metals loading. The hydrocracking process was conducted under initial hydrogen pressure in a batch reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 300-375°C for 2 h. De-pending on the experimental condition, the reaction pressure changed between 10 bar and 15 bar. Several parameters were used to evaluate biofuel produced, including oxygen removal, hydrocarbon composition and gasoline/kerosene/diesel yields. Biofuel was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopic (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The composition of hydro-carbon compounds in liquid products was similar to the compounds in the gasoil sold in unit of Per-tamina Gas Stations, namely pentadecane, hexadecane, heptadecane, octadecane, and nonadecane with different amounts for each biofuel produced at different reaction temperatures. However, isopa-raffin compounds were not formed at all operating conditions. Pentadecane (n-C15) and heptadecane (n-C17) were the most abundant composition in gasoil when Co-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst was used. Cerbera Manghas oil can be recommended as the source of non-edible vegetable oil to produce gasoil as an envi-ronmentally friendly transportation fuel. Copyright © 2017 BCREC Group.

AB  - The demand for the energy has increased drastically as a result of the rapid growth in industrialization, urbanisation and higher standard of living. One such potential substitute to fossil fuels is biodiesel that ensures sustainable energy source. The selection of appropriate source of biodiesel and proper blending of biodiesel plays a major role in alternate energy production. In the present work, a novel hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique was proposed to evaluate and select the optimum fuel biodiesel blend for the IC engine with conflicting criteria to enhance the energy efficiency. Exploratory analysis were carried out on a single cylinder four stroke, air cooled, constant speed, direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW at 1500 rpm at different loads. Two hybrid MCDM models, namely Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy VIKOR were proposed. Fuzzy was applied to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria whereas TOPSIS and VIKOR were applied to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. Diesel, B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 fuel blend alternatives are prepared by varying the proportion of biodiesel for MCDM model. Similarly BTE, MRPR, NOx CO2, CO, HC, SMOKE, ID, CD and Exhaust gas temperature were considered as the evaluation criteria. The ranking order by Fuzzy TOPSIS is based on closeness coefficient and Fuzzy VIKOR is based on VIKOR index. In Fuzzy TOPSIS, B40 stands first at 50% and 75% load conditions and second at 25% and full load conditions respectively. In Fuzzy VIKOR, B40 stands first at 25% and 50% conditions and second at no load, 75% and full load conditions respectively. The ranking of alternatives as obtained by both Fuzzy-TOPSIS and Fuzzy-VIKOR is B40 &gt; B20 &gt; Diesel &gt; B80 &gt; B60 &gt; B100 and B40 &gt; B20 &gt; Diesel &gt; B60 &gt; B80 &gt; B100. From the results, it was observed that both the methods indicated that B40 is the best blend to operate the engine. Hence, it is concluded that mixing 40% biodiesel with diesel is suggested as a good partial replacement for diesel. This paper highlights a new insight into MCDM techniques to evaluate the best fuel blend for the decision makers such as engine manufactures and R&amp; D engineers to meet the fuel economy and emission norms to empower the green revolution and energy management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquid-phase hydrogenation of a solution of furfural, phenol and acetic acid has been studied in the 50–235 °C range over magnetic Ru/Fe3O4-SiO2 catalyst targeting the renewable production of second generation biofuels with minimum hydrogen consumption. Phenol was fully hydrogenated to cyclohexanol in the entire temperature range. Below 150 °C, furfural was mainly hydrogenated to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol while hydrogenolysis to cyclopentanol was the main reaction pathway above 200 °C. The hydrogenation rate was doubled in an acidic solution (pH = 3) as compared to that at a pH 6. The spent catalyst was regenerated and reused in subsequent catalytic runs. © 2017

AB  - A solvent-free α-alkylation of acetone with butanol and ethanol was conducted using a mixture of Pd/C and CaO as heterogeneous catalysts. After reaction at 180 °C for 20 h, alkylated products, including C5-C11ketones and alcohols, were obtained with a total yield of 78.1%. After this α-alkylation, consecutive hydrodeoxygenation at 270 °C for 20 h under H2at 500 psig yielded 74.7% C5–C11alkanes based on the amount of acetone. The product could be used as a bio-gasoline. After alkylation, the catalyst was isolated and characterized using XRD, TGA, XPS, and TEM to elucidate the deactivation of the catalyst. The main reason was found to be decreased basicity of Ca species by conversion of CaO to CaCO3during the reaction. The Pd/C particles were slightly agglomerated after alkylation, but still retained their catalytic activity during successive reuses for the alkylation reaction. In subsequent runs, the activity of the used catalyst could be recovered by adding a sufficient amount of CaO, or by decarboxylation of CaCO3to CaO at 500 °C, under H2. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sulfur-free Ni-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared and characterized by XRD. The catalysts were used for hydrodeoxygenation of pre-treated poor quality lipids to produce hydrocarbon biofuels, and tested for two samples in a fixed bed reactor. The loading amounts of active metals Mo and Ni were optimized through the hydrodeoxygenation reaction yields of pre-treated waste cooking oil (transformed to methyl ester). Considering hydrodeoxygenation yields and compositions of the obtained products, the optimal loading amounts of Mo and Ni were 10% and 5% by weight, respectively. Using this catalyst, the hydrodeoxygenation yield of enzymatically pre-treated waste cooking oil could reach 97%. © 2017

AB  - Rice husk was completely used for synthesis gas production. The pyrolysis volatiles (gas and bio-oil) of rice husk were used as raw materials to produce synthesis gas and the bio-char from the rice husk pyrolysis was used as the catalyst for catalytic reforming of pyrolysis volatiles of rice husk. We investigated the role of catalysts in gas and bio-oil catalytic reformation under different reaction conditions and the interaction between gas and bio-oil. The results indicated that 0.1Ni-0.1Co/RHPC (rice husk pyrolysis carbon) exhibited favorable selectivity and high conversion for rice husk pyrolysis volatiles. In particular, H2 and CO contents from bio-oil were 56% and 18%, respectively, 37% and 36% from gas, respectively. Moreover, the content of H2 is 32%, while that of CO is 22% after catalytic reforming from the mixture of gas and bio-oil. The Co-Ni/RHPC catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR and N2 adsorption and desorption. BET results showed that adding Co and Ni can effectively enhance the BET surface from 4 m2 g-1 to 96 m2 g-1. XRD results showed the active parts of the Ni and Co diffraction peaks remained evident after reaction. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Our objective was to synthesize hydrothermally stable metal catalysts with controlled particle size and distribution, with the goal of determining which catalyst(s) can selectively produce aromatics. Both precious and transition metal catalysts (Ru, Pt, Ni, Cu, 2Pt1Ru, NiCu) were deposited on mesoporous alumina (mA) and carbon, respectively, using the strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) method. Due to the alloying that occurs under SEA, our hypothesis was that controlled bimetallic combinations (precious and/or base metal) could enhance the HDO behavior. As verified by XRD, STEM, and TPR, the SEA method successfully deposited noble metal particles less than 2 nm in size onto alumina. Alloying of bimetallic particles was also confirmed. Hydrodeoxygenation of pyrolysis bio-oil was run for 3 h at 300 °C in an aqueous environment. While partial conversion of mesoporous alumina into boehmite phase occurred, the catalyst particles remained between 2 and 3 nm post-reaction, indicating a high degree of anchoring. Over carbon, base metal particles were initially larger in size (about 3.3 nm) and tended to sinter more. Bimetallic SEA catalysts produced aromatic hydrocarbons at a greater extent than those of Ni/C, or Cu/C, or commercial Ru/Al2O3, as evidenced by GC–MS and/or NMR. Bimetallic 2Pt1Ru/mA did not exhibit significantly greater activity than Pt or Ru or control catalysts made by dry impregnation (DI), whereas NiCu demonstrated improved oil quality and yields over single-metal Ni and Cu and DI-method control catalysts. With respect to product compounds, the effect of mA support is stronger than that of carbon support. © 2017

AB  - To establish a green platform for biodiesel production, this study mainly investigates pseudo-catalytic (non-catalytic) transesterification of olive oil. To this end, biochar from agricultural waste (maize residue) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as an acyl acceptor were used for pseudo-catalytic transesterification reaction. Reaction parameters (temperature and molar ratio of DMC to olive oil) were also optimized. The biodiesel yield reached up to 95.4% under the optimal operational conditions (380 °C and molar ratio of DMC to olive oil (36:1)). The new sustainable environmentally benign biodiesel production introduced in this study is greener and faster than conventional transesterification reactions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing energy from biomass and other organic waste residues is essential for sustainable development. Like biodiesel, green diesel is a next generation biofuels emerging due to the need for a renewable replacement of petrodiesel. Green diesel is a mixture of carbon chains which are derived from lignocellulosic biomass and the fuel properties are naturally similar to the petrodiesel. This paper discussed an integrated green diesel production route from non-food biomass resources. A systematic literature for lignocellulosic biomass resources has been developed. The systematic literature focuses on hydrodeoxygenation or catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l..

AB  - This study investigated the effects of different pre-treatments on structural changes in Phyllostachys edulis. Samples were pretreated with water, 15% ammonia water, 2% sulfuric acid, hydrothermal carbonization, and ball milling. Moreover, ultrasound was introduced. The influence of pre-treatment on the physiochemical property and composition of P. edulis were studied. Moreover, torrefaction characterization was performed and the distribution of torrefaction products of pretreated samples was determined. Results showed that pre-treatment effectively modified physiochemical structure and the torrefaction property of P. edulis. The pretreatment reduced the ash content and increased the bio-oil content of the torrefaction products. Compared with that of the raw material, the residual bio-char content of the pretreated samples decreased by 2–8%, and degradation temperature of bio-char fluctuated between 365 °C and 321 °C. The distribution of bio-oil contents, bio-char, and bio-gas in the torrefaction products significantly varied with pretreatments methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The composition, cellulose degradability and biochemical methane potential (BMP) of M. sinensis, M. floridulus, Miscanthus × giganteus and M. lutarioriparius were investigated concomitantly at different growth/harvest times during their growing season. For all the four species, there was only a slight change in the compositional content. Meanwhile there was a huge change in the BMP values. At the growth time of 60 days the BMPs ranged from 247.1 to 266.5 ml g−1 VS. As growth time was prolonged, the BMPs decreased by 11–35%. For each species, the BMP was positively correlated to the cellulose degradability with the correlation coefficients (R2) ranging from 0.8055 to 0.9925. This suggests that besides the biomass yield, it is justifiable to consider cellulose degradability when selecting the suitable harvest time for biofuels production from Miscanthus, especially in tropical and subtropical regions where Miscanthus can be harvested twice or more within a year. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipid extraction is a key step in microalgal biofuel production. However, economical microalgal biofuel production is limited by the high energy consumption of the extraction process. Therefore, in this study, we employed N-methylcyclohexylamine (MCHA) as a switchable solvent to directly extract a wet microalgal slurry, and an ionic liquid, [C4-mim][PF6] (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate), was used to recover the extracted algal oil through a simple phase separation method. CO2 was used to trigger the separation of MCHA from [C4-mim][PF6], and MCHA was regenerated by heating and purging with N2. Our extraction procedure differs from conventional solvent extraction, which requires drying algal slurries before extraction. The new extraction procedure adopted in this study can be used to extract wet algal slurries directly and recycle the solvent by using a low-energy consumption method. In addition, water-soluble MCHA was investigated for DHA(docosahexaenoic acid) wet algal slurries with 85% water content, and the extraction yield could reach 85% at low stirring speeds (200 rpm). Using [C4-mim][PF6] to separate algal oil from the crude extraction liquid, algal lipid recovery was approximately 77%. In summary, the results showed the feasibility of utilizing MCHA and [C4-mim][PF6] as extracting and separating agents, respectively, for algal oil exaction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gas-liquid-solid packed bed reactors or trickle-bed reactors (TBRs) have been widely employed in various industrial applications such as hydrocracking, selective hydrogenation process of gas oil, wastewater treatment and so on. Since the multiphase flow in TBRs is complex, uniform liquid distribution can hardly be obtained. The liquid coverage on particles at various locations in the bed affects the overall reactor performance. In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with a volume of fluid (VOF) model were employed to investigate liquid mal-distribution at the micro-level in a packed bed reactor. In this study, two different parameters (the local liquid coverage (HL) and local liquid holdup (hL)) were employed to describe liquid distribution on individual particles. The liquid distribution at different particle layers was investigated. The results revealed that the distributions for local liquid coverage and local liquid holdup were similar. The wetting efficiency and the liquid residence time decreased with increasing the voidage. In a packed bed with cylindrical particles, the capillary effect cannot be ignored in smaller channels formed between the particles, leading to higher flow resistance. It was also found that the wetting efficiency and liquid film thickness increased with an increase in the liquid velocity. Both wetting efficiency and the time required to reach steady state decreased when increasing the contact angle. The flow on particle surface could change from rivulet to film as the liquid density decreased. The newly unveiled information of local liquid holdup distribution could significantly advance the understanding of gas-liquid flow hysteresis inside packed beds, based on which the reactor performance can be further improved. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High-temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells have a flexible fuel supply and high energy performance. When fed with biofuels, such as biogas, they provide an attractive, ecofriendly and efficient energy system. The Internal Reforming that uses the high temperature of the same fuel cell makes them suitable to biogas, whose carbon dioxide content can be exploited. The fuel cell is characterized by an Internal CO2Dry Reforming that converts the CH4in the biogas into an H2rich stream, owing to the role of CO2, acting as reforming promoter. The paper presents the formalization and the implementation in Matlab of a steady state-zero dimensional numerical model which describes the various processes of a global self-sustained Indirect Internal CO2Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System fed by biogas. In addition to the energy core of the system with reforming and electrochemical section, the plant scheme considers the preheating of fresh gases, partial recirculation of the fuel cell exhausted gases and combustion of the expelled ones. The model aims at assessing energy performance and at monitoring carbon deposition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High-efficiency hydrolysis of lignocellulose is critical for the production of second-generation bioethanol. In the present work, the acid hydrolysis of cellulose in ionic liquids (ILs) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl), 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Amim]Cl), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Emim]Cl), respectively, was investigated and aqueous two-phase systems were constructed by adding salt solutions to ILs to recover glucose from cellulose hydrolyzates in the ILs. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time and acid consumption on the cellulose hydrolysis efficiencies in the ILs were determined. The optimal cellulose hydrolysis conditions in ILs were found to be [Bmim]Cl, a reaction time of 0.5 h, an acid consumption of 0.25 mL/g (cellulose) and a reaction temperature of 100 °C. The yield of glucose under the optimal hydrolysis conditions reached 92.88%. IL-based aqueous two-phase systems were formed by adding NaOH, K3PO4, or K2HPO4into the ILs containing glucose or cellulose hydrolyzates, which were able to partition the glucose into the bottom salt-rich phase. Under the optimum condition, 4 vol 50% NaOH or K3PO4solution was able to partition 90% glucose, resulting in 16 g/L glucose in the salt-rich phase that could be further used for ethanol fermentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel from non-edible vegetable oil is considered as a monetarily doable source among the conceivable sources. It can be used as a replacement of the fossil diesel without any modification of engine design. In this study, “Millettia pinnata" (MP) which is known as Karanja and “Croton megalocarpus” (CM), non-edible biodiesel feedstock sources used for biodiesel production. 20% (v/v) of each M. pinnata (MP20) and C. megalocarpus (CM20) and their combined blends were evaluated in a single-cylinder diesel engine with variable load and speed condition in the context of performance, combustion and emission characteristics. For speed test condition, MP20 and CM20 reduced the brake power by 3.70% and 0.53%, brake thermal efficiency by 3.36% and 1.41%, carbon dioxide emission by 18.46% and 6.20%, hydrocarbon emission by 9.00% and 2.89% respectively compared to neat diesel but increased the brake specific fuel consumption by 7.63% and 4.64%, NOX emission by 17.15% and 8.16%, respectively. Beyond diesel, a mixture of 5% MP and 15% CM biodiesel with 80% diesel (MP5CM15) provides higher in-cylinder peak pressure (77.44 bar), better heat release rate (39.26 J/°CA), shorter ignition delay and combustion duration. Thus MP5CM15 found to be a substitutable alternative to neat diesel except for NOX emission. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-crude oil derived from sub- and supercritical liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass has received considerable interests, but it cannot be directly used as a fuel because of its high oxygen content. In this work, a novel hydro-liquefaction process with the hydrogen generated in situ during the oxidation of aluminum by supercritical ethanol was investigated. X-ray diffraction analyses showed that η-, κ-, θ-, and α-Al2O3 mixtures were formed as a result of aluminum oxidation. Proposed reaction pathways revealed that ethanol reforming reactions occurred with additional hydrogen produced. A maximum energy recovery around 75% from feedstock to bio-crude oil was achieved with the addition of aluminum. Investigation on the chemical composition showed that liquefaction of rice stalk in the presence of aluminum decreased the yield of aldehyde, acid, and nitrogenous groups, and increased the yield of bicyclic phenolics, ketones, and hydrocarbons in the oil. In addition, the volatile fraction of the oil was increased. Overall, aluminum assisted liquefaction significant increase in the degree of deoxygenation, and may be a promising way to convert lignocellulosic into biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An efficient approach for immobilizing alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) while enhancing its electron transfer ability has been developed using poly(2-(trimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (MADQUAT) cationic polymer and carbon nanoscaffolds. The carbon nanoscaffolds were comprised of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) wrapped with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The ADH entrapped within the MADQUAT that was present on the carbon nanoscaffolds exhibited a high electron exchange capability with the electrode through its cofactor β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate and β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced disodium salt hydrate (NAD+/NADH) redox reaction. The advantages of the carbon nanoscaffolds used as the support matrix and the MADQUAT employed for the entrapment of ADH versus physisorption were demonstrated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Our experimental results showed a higher electron transfer, electrocatalytic activity, and rate constant for MADQUAT entrapped ADH on the carbon nanoscaffolds. The immobilization of ADH using both MADQUAT and carbon nanoscaffolds exhibited strong potential for the development of an efficient bio-anode for ethanol powered biofuel cells. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Electrochemical reduction of furfural (ECRFF) emerges as an efficient and sustainable means to obtain high-value chemicals and biofuels with the activity and product selectivity being sensitive to cathode materials. In this work, elementary steps describing furfuryl alcohol (FA) and 2-methylfuran (MF) production routes in ECRFF are studied by using periodic density functional theory on Ag, Pb, and Ni, as alternative cathode materials. The established Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship has been proven to be reliable to estimate energy barriers of C-O bond cleavage. The intrinsic characters of Ag, Pb, and Ni are then summarized in free energy diagrams to reflect the FA and MF production trends as future guidelines to evaluate ECRFF activity and selectivity on these metals. On all metal surfaces, at both terrace and stepped sites, the first C-H or O-H hydrogenation step, producing respective mh6 or mh7 intermediates, influences overall FA production. On Ag and Pb, pathways involving the mh6 intermediate are thermodynamically and kinetically favored, whereas on Ni, both mh6 and mh7 routes are competitive due to strong interactions between the furan ring and the substrate. In addition, these partially hydrogenated intermediates can also undergo C-O bond cleavage with reduced energy barriers (compared to direct C-O bond cleavage in furfural), which opens potential paths for parallel MF production. Conversion of FA into MF catalyzed by these metallic cathodes was considered as well, although the high C-O bond cleavage energy barrier is likely to hinder this process. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Surfactants were used for the hydrolysis of bamboo biomass to enhance lignocellulose hydrolysis. Tween 80, polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were tested as surfactants for improving the bamboo hydrolysis with a novel sulfonated cross-linked chitosan solid acid catalyst (SCCAC) in ionic liquid (IL). Compared to the use of only SCCAC in 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl), the surfactants facilitated hydrolysis and improved the yield of total reducing sugar (TRS) under the same conditions. Tween 80 was the most effective surfactant, with a TRS yield of 68.01% achieved at 120 °C after 24 h. Surfactants broke the lignocellulose structure, promoted lignin removal, and increased positive interactions between cellulose and the catalyst, which were favorable for hydrolysis. This novel surfactant-assisted hydrolysis strategy with SCCAC and IL as the solvent demonstrated a promise for the large-scale transformation of biomass into biofuels and bioproducts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For algal biofuels to be economically sustainable and avoid exacerbating nutrient pollution, algal cultivation and processing must maximize rates of biofuel production while simultaneously minimizing the consumption of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers. We experimentally tested whether algal polycultures could be engineered to improve N and P nutrient-use efficiency compared to monocultures by balancing trade-offs in nutrient-use efficiency and biocrude production. We analyzed the flows of N and P through the processes of cultivation, biocrude production through hydrothermal liquefaction, and nutrient recycling in a laboratory-scale system. None of the six species we examined exhibited high N efficiency, P efficiency, and biocrude production simultaneously; each had poor performance in at least one function (i.e., <25th percentile). Polycultures of two to six species did not outperform the best species in any single function, but some polycultures exhibited more balanced performance and maintained all three functions at higher levels simultaneously than any of the monocultures (i.e., >67th percentile). Moreover, certain polycultures came closer to optimizing all three functions than any of the monocultures. By balancing trade-offs between N and P efficiency and biocrude production, polycultures could be used to simultaneously reduce the demand for both N and P fertilizers by up to 85%. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We report on the markedly improved stability of a novel 2-bed catalytic system, as compared to that of a conventional 1-bed steam reforming catalyst, for the production of H2 from acetic acid. The 2-bed catalytic system consists of (i) a basic oxide ketonization catalyst for the conversion of acetic acid to acetone, and (ii) a Co-based steam reforming catalyst, both catalytic beds placed in sequence within the same unit operation. Steam reforming catalysts are particularly prone to catalytic deactivation when steam reforming acetic acid, used here as a model compound for the aqueous fraction of bio-oil. Catalysts consisting of MgAl2O4, ZnO, CeO2, and activated carbon (AC) both with and without Co-addition were evaluated for conversion of acetic acid, and its ketonization product, acetone, in the presence of steam. It was found that over the bare oxide support only ketonization activity was observed, and coke deposition was minimal. With addition of Co to the oxide support steam reforming activity was facilitated, and coke deposition was significantly increased. Acetone steam reforming over the same Co-supported catalysts demonstrated more stable performance and with less coke deposition than with acetic acid feedstock. DFT analysis suggests that, over Co, surface CHxCOO species are more favorably formed from acetic acid versus acetone. These CHxCOO species are strongly bound to the Co catalyst surface and could explain the higher propensity for coke formation from acetic acid. On the basis of these findings, in order to enhance stability of the steam reforming catalyst, a dual-bed (2-bed) catalyst system was implemented. Upon comparison of the 2-bed and 1-bed (Co-supported catalyst only) systems under otherwise identical reaction conditions, the 2-bed demonstrated significantly improved stability, and coke deposition was decreased by a factor of 4. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Propylsulfonic acid functionalized SiO2 core/alkyl- or phenyl-bridged organosilica shell structured PrSO3H-SiO2@Si(R)Si (R = –C2H4–, –C6H4– or –C6H4–C6H4–) nanospheres are facilely prepared by a CTAB-directed one-pot two-step condensation strategy. The morphological characteristics, textural properties, Brønsted acid nature and structure of the PrSO3H-SiO2@Si(R)Si nanospheres are well characterized. The materials are successfully applied in the catalytic transformation of D-fructose into the important organic chemical, ethyl levulinate, in the presence of ethanol as both reactant and solvent. The catalytic activity of the PrSO3H-SiO2@Si(R)Si nanospheres outperform commercially available Amberlyst-15, HY zeolite and HCl, mainly attributing to their strong Brønsted acid nature; additionally, unique core-shell structure with excellent porosity properties and well-adjusted hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity also give the positive influence on the ethanolysis activity, which can improve the accessibility of the reactants to the PrSO3H sites and facilitate the multi-step ethanolysis reaction proceeding to the formation of the final product. The PrSO3H-SiO2@Si(R)Si nanospheres can be reused three times without obvious activity loss, contributed from covalent bonding of the PrSO3H groups with the silica and organosilica framework as well as hydrophobic PrSO3H-functionalized organosilica shell. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Low-temperature hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds can greatly improve the thermal stability of fast pyrolysis bio-oil, thereby enabling long-term operation of upgrading reactors which generally require high temperatures to achieve deep deoxygenation. The state-of-the-art hydrogenation catalysts, precious metals such as ruthenium, although effective in carbonyl hydrogenation, deactivate due to high sulfur sensitivity. In the present work, we showed that molybdenum carbides were active and sulfur-tolerant in low-temperature conversion of carbonyl compounds. Furthermore, due to surface bifunctionality (i.e., both metallic and acid sites present), carbides catalyzed both Cî»O bond hydrogenation and C-C coupling reactions. Combined, these reactions transformed carbonyl compounds to more stable and higher molecular weight oligomeric compounds while consuming less hydrogen than pure hydrogenation. The carbides proved to be resistant to other deactivation mechanisms including hydrothermal aging, oxidation, coking, and leaching. These properties enabled carbides to achieve and maintain good catalytic performance in both aqueous-phase furfural conversion and real bio-oil stabilization in the presence of sulfur. This finding strongly suggests that molybdenum carbides can provide a catalyst solution necessary for the development of practical bio-oil stabilization technology. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An Li-O2 battery requires the oxygen-breathing cathode to be highly electronically conductive, rapidly oxygen diffusive, structurally stable, and often times electrocatalytically active. Catalyst-decorated porous carbonaceous materials are the chosen air cathode in this regard. Alternatively, biomass-derived carbonaceous materials possess great ability to remove heavy and toxic metal ions from waste, forming a metal-adsorbed porous carbonaceous material. The similar structure between the air cathode and the metal-adsorbed biomass-derived carbon nicely bridges these two irrelevant areas. In this study, we investigated the electrochemical activity of a biochar material Ag-ESB directly synthesized from ethanol sludge residue in a rechargeable aprotic Li-O2 battery. Ag ions were adsorbed from sewage and became Ag nanoparticles with uniform coverage on the biochar surface. The as-prepared material exhibits good electrochemical behavior in battery testing, especially toward the battery efficiency and cyclability. This study provides the possibility of synthetically efficient cathode material by reusing "waste" such as biofuel sludge residue. It is an economically and environmentally friendly approach both for an energy-storage system and for waste recycling. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the promising technologies for the production of energy carriers (bioalcohols, biosyngas) and valuable chemicals. Lignocellulosic biofuels may be thought of as a material capable of substantially replacing oil to provide an efficient consumption of natural energy resources and an improvement of the environment. In the “bioreactor–membrane separator–catalytic reactor (converter)" circuit, all stages are considered to be key: (1) the pretreatment of lignocellulose and the development of fermentation, particularly the cultivation of novel strains of bacteria; (2) the design of energyefficient vapor/gas-phase membrane systems for (a) concentrating bioalcohols and (b) controlling the biosyngas composition; and (3) the development of catalyst systems for the conversion of bioalcohols to motor fuel components. The following sequential tasks are discussed in this brief review: (i) basic approaches to the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass aimed at preparing it for fermentation and enzymatic processing of lignocellulose, particularly the cultivation of novel strains of bacteria and their communities, to produce bioalcohols— ethanol and butanol—and thermochemical methods of lignocellulose conversion to products in the form of complex mixtures; (ii) the development of energy-efficient membrane concentrating of bioalcohols using hydrophilic and/or organophilic polymer membranes and the control of the composition of synthesis gas in the form of a multicomponent gas mixture using commercial gas-separation membranes; and (iii) the development of catalyst systems exhibiting high selectivity in the ethanol conversion to alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons (high-quality additives to motor fuels) and valuable olefins, particularly ethylene, propylene, and linear alpha-olefins up to C10. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Fecal waste is an environmental burden that requires proper disposal, which ultimately becomes also an economic burden. Because fecal waste is nutrient-rich and contains a diverse methanogenic community, it has been utilized to produce biomethane via anaerobic digestion. Carbohydrates and lipids in fecal waste could reach up to 50% of the dry weight, which also suggests a potential as a feedstock for bioethanol and biodiesel production. We measured biomethane production from fecal waste of cows, chickens, goats and humans and compared the microbial community composition before and after anaerobic digestion. We also compared the fecal waste for cellulase production, saccharification and fermentation to produce bioethanol and for lipid content and fatty acid profiles to produce biodiesel. All fecal waste produced biomethane, with the highest yield of 433.4 ± 77.1 ml CH4/g VS from cow fecal waste. Production of bioethanol was achieved from all samples, with chicken fecal waste yielding as high as 1.6 ± 0.25 g/l. Sludge samples exhibited the highest extractable portion of lipids (20.9 ± 0.08 wt%) and conversion to fatty acid methyl esters (11.94 wt%). Utilization of fecal waste for the production of biofuels is environmentally and economically beneficial. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production from soybean oil deodorizer distillate intensified by dual-frequency counter-current pulsed ultrasound and the kinetics were studied. Results indicated that the biodiesel conversions enhanced by single-frequency were lower than those enhanced by dual-frequency. For dual-frequency, the biodiesel conversion of SMM was higher than those of SQM. The biodiesel conversion of the combination of 20/28 kHz is the highest. The effects of 20/28 kHz SMM on biodiesel production were studied and optimal conditions were: methanol to triglyceride molar ratio 8:1, catalyst content 1.8%, the water content in feedstock should be less than 0.4%, the acid value of feedstock should be less than 2 mgKOH·g−1, the biodiesel conversion could reach 96.3%. The kinetics of SMM and SSPU were studied and results showed that the transesterification reaction was pseudo-second order and the energy activation obtained by SMM and SSPU were 18.122 kJ·mol−1 and 26.034 kJ·mol−1, respectively. These results showed that transesterification reaction intensified by SMM is easier to take place than SSPU. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioconversion of CO/syngas to produce ethanol is a novel route in bioethanol production, which can be accomplished by some acetogens. Specific culture vessels and techniques are needed to cultivate these microorganisms since they are anaerobic and substrates are gaseous. In this work, gas-sampling bag was applied as a gas-cultivation system to study CO/syngas bioconversion by Clostridium autoethanogenum and was demonstrated to be efficient because of its flexibility and excellent ability to maintain the headspace atmosphere. C. autoethanogenum can use CO as the sole carbon and energy source to produce ethanol, acetate as well as CO2. In the experimental range, higher ethanol production was favored by higher yeast extract concentrations, and the maximum ethanol concentration of 3.45 g/L was obtained at 1.0 g/L of yeast extract. Study with various bottled gases showed that C. autoethanogenum preferred to use CO other than CO2 and produced the highest level of ethanol with 100% CO as the substrate. C. autoethanogenum can also utilize biomass-generated syngas (36.2% CO, 23.0% H2, 15.4% CO2, 11.3% N2), but the process proceeded slowly and insufficiently due to the presence of O2 and C2H2. In our study, C. autoethanogenum showed a better performance in the bioconversion of CO to ethanol than Clostridium ljungdahlii, a strain which has been most studied, and for both strains, ethanol production was promoted by supplementing 0.5 g/L of acetate. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of biomass is often used to improve bio-oil quality and energy content. In order to better understand the interactions between various catalysts and biomass components, individual components of biomass were isolated and pyrolyzed with different catalysts. Understanding the interactions between pyrolysis vapors and catalysts is important to create catalysts that can improve bio-oil quality and energy content in the future. In this study, cellulose, guaiacol (as a model for lignin), and Hinoki wood were pyrolyzed and catalyzed with silica, ZrO2&amp;TiO2, and ZSM-5 with an SiO2-to-Al2O3 (SAR) ratio of 40 and 1500. GC–MS analysis was used to measure the effects of the different catalysts on the pyrolysis vapors. It was found that silica had a strong interaction with the hydroxyl groups of levoglucosan and significantly decreased sugars in both cellulose and Hinoki wood pyrolysis. ZrO2&amp;TiO2 increased the amount of cyclopentanones and aromatics with Hinoki wood pyrolysis. The ZSM-5 catalysts also increased aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons with Hinoki wood pyrolysis. Based on these results, specific reactions of the catalysts were proposed. Additionally, ZSM-5 with a SAR ratio of 1500 has very few acidic sites, so the steric effects of ZSM-5 could be isolated. These results are discussed and contrasted with ZSM-5 with a SAR ratio of 40. These results show that microporous catalysts and moderate acidity are optimal for improving bio-oil quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: With the aim of producing high potential biomass derived chemicals and biofuels in safe environment, carbon–MgO composite (MgO-CX, X = wt% of carbon content) eco-friendly metal-free catalysts have been prepared via in-situ transformation technique using rice grain as carbon precursor. All these MgO-CX catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction, BET surface area, temperature programmed desorption of CO2, Raman and FT-IR. The MgO-CX catalysts are subjected to catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural into furfuryl alcohol, using isopropanol as H-donor in continuous process at atmospheric pressure. MgO-C68 is the best catalyst of this series, which exhibited 100% conversion of furfural with 98% selectivity of furfuryl alcohol. The existence of large number of suitable basic sites on the surface of MgO-C68 catalyst is responsible for its superior catalytic activity and durability.

AB  - The utilization of abandoned lignocellulosic residues for chemical production has a strong potential to partially substitute chemicals, which are traditionally produced from non-renewable resources. Softwood especially, with its high availability, presents a sustainable resource for the conversion to higher value-added products such as biofuels and bioplastics. In this study, we investigate mature and innovative technologies for the conversion of softwood to the platform chemical sugar from an economic and environmental perspective. We show that the conventional enzymatic hydrolysis has high economic as well as environmental burdens and that the increase of enzyme availability via a carbocation scavenger process is the key solution to overcome them. Furthermore, we present a process design based on concentrated acid hydrolysis, which is both environmentally and economically competitive compared to conventional production from sugarbeet. The low energy and raw material requirements combined with heat integration and moderate capital costs makes this technology attractive for utilization of softwood residues. This proves that lignocellulosic residues have the potential to become an important raw material in the future bioeconomy. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: At commercial level, the biodiesel production process is well established for many types of feedstock. However, economic feasibility depends on regional fluctuating data, making each case unique. A calculation model to analyze the economic feasibility of biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas was developed, along with an analysis of the energetic balance derived from this process. RESULTS: Yucatán state has the cultivation surface to replace 10% of its fossil diesel fuel consumption with biodiesel. Two scenarios were studied: the use of biodiesel–fossil diesel blends B5 and B10. The net energy ratio (NER) of biodiesel production is 2.88, indicating that the system provides more energy than it consumes. The economic analysis indicates that biodiesel cost remains constant with production capacities of 10 000 m3 year−1 and higher. Field labor, pesticides, and fertilizers are the major costs at J. curcas plantations, representing 64.3, 16.3 and 11.5% of total biodiesel cost, respectively. The net present value (NPV) was always negative, proving that the biodiesel–jatropha chain is not economically viable. CONCLUSIONS: Actual seed productivity (1 495 kg ha−1 year−1) must be increased 2.17 times to attain economic viability. Agricultural practices need to be enhanced in order to lower labor cost and the use of fertilizers. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is crucial for biofilm structure, microbial nutrition and proximal stability of habitat in a variety of environments. However, the production patterns of microbial EPS in soils as affected by heavy metal contamination remain uncertain. Here we investigate the extracellular response of the native microbial biomass in a grassland soil treated with refined glycerol or crude unrefined biodiesel co-product (BCP) with and without ZnCl2. We extracted microbial EPS and more readily soluble microbial products (SMP), and quantified total polysaccharide, uronic acid, and protein content in these respective extracts. Organic addition, especially BCP, significantly stimulated the production of EPS-polysaccharide and protein but had no impact on EPS-uronic acids, while in the SMP-fraction, polysaccharides and uronic acids were both significantly increased. In response to the inclusion of Zn2+, both EPS- and SMP-polysaccharides increased. This implies firstly that a tolerance mechanism of soil microorganisms against Zn2+ toxicity exists through the stimulation of SMP and EPS production, and secondly that co-products of biofuel industries may have value-added use in bioremediation efforts to support in-situ production of microbial biopolymers. Microbial films and mobile polymers are likely to impact a range of soil properties. The recent focus on EPS research in soils is anticipated to help contribute an improved understanding of biofilm dynamics in other complex systems - such as continuously operated bioreactors. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the promising alternative biofuel to petro-diesel. Efficient and effective utilization of low value feedstock is required to meet the current demand on biodiesel. Rice bran is a byproduct of rice milling that contains significant amounts of sugar (~ 48%) and lipids (~ 14%). Immediate recovery of the lipids is uneconomical owing to its moderate lipid content. In this work, hydrolysis of raw rice bran was firstly carried out to concentrate lipids in the hydrolyzed bran to ~ 42%. Hydrolysis of rice bran using 2% sulfuric acid at 90 °C for 3.5 h with stirring at 300 rpm resulted in hydrolysates containing ~ 41 g/L sugars and 3.75 g/L proteins. Rice bran hydrolysate (RBH) obtained was further utilized as growth media for Lipomyces starkeyi, an oleaginous yeast. Lipid content of 40 to 65% can be achieved, suggesting the potential of using RBH in single cell oil production. Composition of microbial oils obtained was similar to that of vegetable oils, which may potentially be adopted as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Furthermore, dried hydrolyzed rice bran was subjected to in-situ (trans)esterification with methanol under subcritical condition which resulted in high FAME yield (87.81%) and conversion (94.82%). This work demonstrated the maximized utilization of rice bran in the production of hydrolysate for fermentation and as biodiesel feedstock. This is to further support the use of direct acid hydrolysis of biomass in the recovery and use of its content of sugars and lipids. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects have been studied for two extraction systems: stirring and Soxhlet, and four different solvents: acetone, chloroform, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether on the physicochemical tomato seed oil properties, for an edible use and for biodiesel production. Oil yield was higher after Soxhlet-petroleum ether extraction (21.19%). Free acidity was always above 2.50%, only Soxhlet-ethyl acetate extracted a tomato seed oil with a very high free acidity (9.51%). The p-anisidine value was lower than 10 after both Sox and stir extractions with ethyl acetate and chloroform. Soxhlet extraction always produced the tomato seed oil with the highest Totox index. Spectrophotometric characteristics described a non-oxidized vegetable oil. Physicochemical properties for biofuel production were: density (20°C) 912.8-926.6 kg/m3; acid value 5.44-18.93 mg KOH (g of oil)-1; oxidative stability index 1.4-8.0 (h). The highest heating value and cetane number were always above 36 MJ (kg of oil)-1 and 39 respectively indicated by DIN 51605 standard for a rapeseed oil for biodiesel production. Essential fatty acids were 57-58% of the total fatty acid methyl ester content. Total mono-unsaturated fatty acid, poly-unsaturated fatty acid and unsaturated fatty acid content was also calculated. The results suggest that tomato seed oil can be used as a feedstock for biodiesel production and as a food. Stirring-chloroform extraction produced the best oil for an edible use except for phenol content and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl index which were highest when ethyl acetate was used for both stirrer and Soxhlet. Stirring-chloroform and stirring petroleum ether extractions showed the best performances for biodiesel production.

AB  - Biodiesel is receiving increasing attention as an alternative fuel due to the ever-growing demand for energy. However, the inferior physiochemical properties of biodiesel render it incompatible for gas turbine application, which needs to meet the standard requirement of gas turbine fuel accordance to ASTM D2880. In this quest, the biodiesel-diesel- bioethanol blends might be a good option. In this paper, the research work was carried out to study experimentally the performance and exhaust emission characteristics of a 25kW micro gas turbine engine (Capstone Model C30) fuelled with biodiesel-dieselbioethanol blends. The assessment on the improved fuel properties of biodiesel by blending with bio-ethanol had shown more superior atomisation characteristics performance compared to unmodified biodiesel. Moreover, the performance test in the micro gas turbine was limited up to 20% blend of biofuel, which showed improved thermal efficiency during the test. Subsequently, the emission test carried out in this work also showed significant enhancement in emissions, except nitrogen oxides (NOx) which contributed to the higher formation in comparison with the distillate diesel. Finally, B80E20 (80:20 of biodiesel-bioethanol) was proposed to be selected as an ideal blended fuel ratio to be applied in micro gas turbine engine due to its adaptability to replace diesel fuel, while showed better performance and emission properties as compared to the pure petroleum diesel. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang Publishing.

AB  - The design and development of heterogeneous catalysts is very critical for the synthesis of various chemicals and fuels derived from superfluous biomass. The synthesis of biofuel 2-methylfuran typically derives from the conversion of the formyl group of biomass-derived furfural, because this process is very valuable in terms of the amelioration and remission of the environment and energy crisis. Herein, we designed a series of bifunctional catalysts formed in line with the spatial restriction strategy by anchoring copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) on phyllosilicate-like structures to enhance copper dispersion and provide properly assembled Lewis acid sites to promote the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of the formyl group in furfural, and first applied them to the conversion of the formyl group with high efficiency. However, the modulation of the Cu-Si molar ratio is extremely critical to the possible reduction of metal consumption, full exploitation of the prerequisite metal sites and great improvement of activity. In this work, the catalyst with a Cu-Si molar ratio (actual value = 0.33) lower than that of the industrial catalyst (theoretical value = 1.0) exhibited higher yields of the intermediate furfuryl alcohol (yield = 83.4%) and the desired product 2-methylfuran (yield = 95.5%). More importantly, with the continuous increase of the Cu-Si molar ratio, it is discovered that Cu dispersion regularly decreased and the size of the Cu NPs sequentially increased, and the change of assembled Lewis acid sites surprisingly kept pace with the integrity of the layered structure, as revealed by a series of detailed characterization studies. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The impact of fatty acids on the lubricity of diesel and biodiesel fuels was investigated in steel/steel contacts at two different temperatures of 40 °C and 100 °C. The addition of 7% v/v Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) to fuels, to form biodiesel, lubricates the steel-steel contact and the friction coefficient is reduced by about 30%. Further addition of fatty acids leads to a significant reduction in friction by a factor of 2 at the highest temperature of 100 °C. Some unsaturated fatty acid additives boost the friction reduction by a synergistic effect with the biofuel. The analysis of worn surfaces by XPS revealed the formation of an insulating film mainly located at the center of the tracks and the disappearance of carboxylic groups. PM-IRRAS analysis demonstrated the lack of carbon double bonds in the tribofilm and the presence of some esters (iron and/or organic soaps). By combining high-resolution photoemission soft X-ray absorption and SIMS studies, we found that the extreme surface of the tribofilm is formed by planar arrangements of sp2-rich molecules such as quinones and/or graphene oxides. It is thought that under the effects of shearing, temperature and possibly oxygen from air or fuel, complex chemical reactions between FAME and unsaturated additives occur in the diesel matrix generating a new tribofilm material on the steel surface. As double bonds are involved in the process, the basic tribochemistry mechanism is thought to be related to a reticulation process catalyzed by the formation of oxide particles in the sliding interfacial contact zone accompanied by an aromatization of the fatty acids at the extreme surface. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Separation of lignocellulose constituents and hydrolysis of the polysaccharides fraction to sugars are pre-requites in production of biofuels and chemicals. In this study, a sequential organosolv fractionation of sugarcane bagasse and saccharification of the cellulose-enriched pulp in hot compressed water using a coupled heterogenous acid promoter/catalyst was studied. Among the liquid and solid acids tested, H3PO4-Activated carbon showed a high performance on promoting selectivity and yield in fractionation related to its high BET surface area and acid site density. Fractionation in a ternary mixture of methyl isolbutylketone:methanol:water (16:68:16) at 180 °C for 60 min using 5%w/w H3PO4-Activated carbon resulted in 88.9% recovery of cellulose enriched in the solid, together with 84.6% recovery of the hemicellulose as pentoses in the aqueous-alcohol fraction and 76.0% lignin in the organic phase. With no separation of the solid acid, the cellulose fraction could be further hydrolyzed under hot compressed water conditions at 225 °C for 10 min, resulting in the maximal hexose yield of 58.3% from the starting material. The catalyst retained &gt;80% activity after reusing in five consecutive batch cycles. The work demonstrates an efficient integrated fractionation/hydrolysis process with coupling use of the acid promoter/catalyst, with advantages on its high activity, selectivity and reusability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Replacing fossil fuels with biomass-based alternatives is a potential carbon neutral, renewable and sustainable option for meeting the world's growing energy demand. However, pyrolytic conversions of biomass-to-biofuels suffer marginal total energy gain, and technical limitations such as bio-oils’ high viscosity and oxygen contents that result in unstable, corrosive and low-value fuels. This work demonstrates a new integrated biorefinery process for the co-production of biofuels and silver nanomaterials. By impregnating pure cellulose and corn stalk with silver nitrate, followed by pyrolysis, the gas yield (especially hydrogen) increases substantially. The condensable bio-oil components of the impregnated samples are considerably higher in furfurals (including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural). Though the overall activation energy barrier, as determined via the Distributed Activation Energy Model, does not change significantly with the silver nitrate pre-treatment, the increase in gases devolatilized, and improved 5-hydroxymethylfurfural yield, suggest a catalytic effect, potentially increasing decarboxylation reactions. After using this metal impregnation to improve pyrolysis fuel yield, following pyrolysis, the silver-char composite materials are calcined to remove the biomass template to yield silver nanomaterials. While others have demonstrated the ability to biotemplate such nanosilver on cellulosic biomass, they consider only impregnation and oxidation of the template. This is the first work that demonstrates the potential to extract upgraded biorenewable fuels during the biotemplating of nanomaterials, the same nanomaterials often used in catalytic energy applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An experimental investigation was carried out in an automotive diesel engine with 5.59 kW rated power in order to analyse the effect of soya soap stock based acid oil biodiesel on engine's performance, combustion, and emissions characteristics at maximum torque and power conditions. The measured physico-chemical properties show the acid oil biodiesel is mainly composed of 72.3% unsaturated fatty acids and it meets the desired fuel quality for automotive diesel engine. Carbon mono oxide, unburnt hydrocarbon and Smoke emissions with acid oil biodiesel decreased significantly however oxides of nitrogen emission increased in the range from 12% to 38%. In addition to this, power output also dropped marginally and thermal efficiency decreased. The peak in-line fuel pressure and in-cylinder temperature are higher with acid oil biodiesel than base diesel. The results emerged from this study indicate the acid oil biodiesel can be a potential fuel for automotive compression ignition engines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a found promising alternative biofuel to popular fossil fuel because of to its renewable and biodegradable nature and thus is considered as environmentally benign. This paper reports on the synthesis of a novel heterogeneous manganese-nickel doped on sulfated zirconia catalyst (MnO-NiO-SO4 −2/ZrO2) by using simple wet impregnation method for biodiesel production from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). The synthesized catalyst was characterized through ammonia temperature programmed desorption (TPD-NH3), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), pyridine adsorption via FTIR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. The synthesized catalyst was tested for PFAD through esterification reaction where more than 97% of biodiesel yield was observed under the optimized reaction conditions of 15:1 methanol to PFAD ratio, 70 °C reaction temperature, 3 wt% catalyst loading and 3 h reaction time. The reusability of the catalyst was tested and found that it could be reused for at least five times without significant reduction in activity. Hence, the catalyst was found suitable for biodiesel production from low grade feedstock. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ability to in situ upgrade pyrolysis biofuels, together with the production of a value-added byproduct from the solid biomass residue, would reduce the economic and environmental costs of the integrated biorefinery. In the present work, biomass samples (mango pits and pineapple plants) were immersed in Fuller's Earth (bentonite clay) suspensions. Pyrolysis at low temperatures (290–350 °C) showed that the incorporation of Fuller's Earth into both biomasses increases the amount of H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6evolved as compared to raw biomass. The biomasses’ behavior diverges in terms of bio-oil and biochar quality. For mango pit, pretreatment with Fuller's Earth increased desirable compounds such as furans and hexanes, whereas for pineapple plant oxygenated and high molecular weight compounds increased with pretreatment. While surface areas of both biomasses increased with incorporation of bentonite clay, the mango pit saw a significant increase in adsorption capacity and rate of methylene blue removal from water, whereas the pineapple plant adsorption rate decreased with pretreatment; capacity increased at low pyrolysis temperature and decreased at high temperature. While incorporation of Fuller's Earth increased the thermal energy required to heat the impregnated mixtures to pyrolysis temperature, a distributed activation energy model analysis shows that activation energy of pyrolysis was virtually the same for impregnated and raw biomass samples, suggesting that this may be either a thermally catalytic or chemically catalytic effect. Thus, incorporation of bentonite into some biomasses may represent positive benefits in terms of in situ upgrading bio-fuels and hybrid biochars produced at lower pyrolysis temperatures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transesterification is known as slow reaction that can take over several hours to complete. The process involves two immiscible reactants to produce the biodiesel and the byproduct glycerol. Biodiesel commercialization has always been hindered by the long process times of the transesterification reaction. Catalyzing the process and increasing the agitation rate is the mode of intensifying the process additional to the increase of the molar ratio, temperature, circulation that all penalize the overall process metrics. Finding shorter path by reducing the reaction into a few minutes and ensures high quality biodiesel, in economically viable way is coming along with sonication. This drastic reduction moves the technology from the slow batch process into the high throughput continuous process. In a practical sense this means a huge optimization for the biodiesel production process which opens pathways for faster, voluminous and cheaper production. The mechanism of sonication assisted reaction is explained by the creation of microbubbles which increases the interfacial surface reaction areas and the presence of high localized temperature and turbulence as these microbubbles implode. As a result the reaction kinetics of sonicated transesterification as inferred by several authors is much faster. The aim of this work is to implement the inferred rates in a high fidelity numerical reactive flow simulation model while considering the reactor geometry. It is based on Navier–Stokes equations coupled with energy equation for non-isothermal flow and the transport equations of the multiple reactive species in an annular continuous reactor. Following model validation, the spatial reaction rate is evaluated to bring more insight to the reaction progression and species distributions. The two methods (conventional and sonication) then are compared on the basis of their sensitivity to the Alcohol:Oil molar ratio. The spatial distribution of the yield and their favorable sonication method is a key enabler of the development of an optimal process reactor that renders more economy to the process when operating at lower AL:TG ration, catalyst amount, and temperature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Performance of microbial carbon capture cells (MCCs), having a low-cost clayware separator, was evaluated in terms of wastewater treatment and electricity generation using algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa in MCC-1 and Anabaena ambigua in MCC-2 and without algae in a cathodic chamber of MCC-3. Higher power production was achieved in MCC-1 (6.4 W/m3) compared to MCC-2 (4.29 W/m3) and MCC-3 (3.29 W/m3). Higher coulombic efficiency (15.23 ± 1.30%) and biomass production (66.4 ± 4.7 mg/(L*day)) in MCC-1 indicated the superiority of Chlorella over Anabaena algae for carbon capture and oxygen production to facilitate the cathodic reduction. Algal biofilm formation on the cathode surface of MCC-1 increased dissolved oxygen in the catholyte and decreased the cathodic charge transfer resistance with increase in reduction current. Electrochemical analyses revealed slow cathodic reactions and increase in internal resistance in MCC-2 (55 Ω) than MCC-1 (30 Ω), due to lower oxygen produced by Anabaena algae. Thus, biomass production in conjunction with wastewater treatment, CO2 sequestration and electricity generation can be achieved using Chlorella algal biocathode in MCC. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Microwave-induced catalytic fast pyrolysis of medicinal herb residue was implemented to produce biofuel with the use of ZSM-5 catalyst and microwave receptive material (SiC). This research aims to explore the effect of reaction atmosphere on the pyrolytic product yields and oil chemical compositions. The results demonstrate that CO atmosphere leads to the lowest total liquid and oil fraction yields and the highest water yield. The hydrocarbon relative contents in bio-oil of the four reaction atmospheres follow the order of CO &gt; CO2 &gt; H2 â‰ N2, while the oxygenate relative contents in bio-oil show the opposite tendency. Further, CO atmosphere gives rise to the lowest selectivity of methoxy-containing phenols in oil fraction and thus can favor the production of a more stable pyrolytic bio-oil. Additionally, CO2 atmosphere causes the highest yield of syngas (CO + H2), which can be used as high quality fuel. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The nanostructure of diesel particulates has been shown to impact its oxidation rate and burnout trajectory. Additionally, this nanostructure can evolve during the oxidation process, furthering its influence on the burnout process. For this study, exhaust particulates were generated on a light-duty diesel engine with conventional diesel fuel, biodiesel, and intermediate blends of the two at a single load-speed point. Despite the singular engine platform and operating point, the different fuels created particulates with varied nanostructure, thereby greatly expanding the window for observing nanostructure evolution and oxidation. The physical and chemical properties of the particulates in the nascent state and at partial oxidation states were measured in a laboratory reactor and by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy as a function of the degree of oxidation in O2. X-ray photoacoustic spectroscopy analysis, thermal desorption, and solvent extraction of the nascent particulate samples reveal a significant organic content in the biodiesel-derived particulates, likely accounting for differences in the nanostructure. This study reports the nanoscale structural changes in the particulate with biofuel blend level and during O2 oxidation as observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and quantitated by fringe analysis and Brunnauer-Emmet-Teller total surface area measurements. It was observed that initial fuel-related differences in the lamella lengths, spacing, and curvature disappear when the particulate reaches approximately 50% burnout. Specifically, the initial ordered, fullerenic, and amorphous nanostructures converge during the oxidation process and the surface areas of these particulates appear to grow through these complex changes in internal particle structure. The specific surface area, measured at several points along the burnout trajectory, did not match the shrinking core projection and in contrast suggested that internal porosity was increasing. Thus, the appropriate burnout model for these particulates is significantly different from the standard shrinking core assumption, which does not account for any internal structure. An alternative burnout model is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image analysis. © 2016 IMechE.

AB  - There is a growing interest in lignin valorization to biofuels and chemicals. Here, we propose a novel and simple noncatalytic process to directly liquefy lignin rich solid residual from second generation bioethanol production by solvolysis with ethanol. Through an extensive parameter study in batch autoclaves assessing the effects of varying reaction temperature, reaction time, and solvent:lignin ratio, it is shown that hydrothermally pretreated enzymatic hydrolysis lignin solvolysis in supercritical ethanol can produce a heptane soluble bio-oil without the need for exhaustive deoxygenation. The process does not require addition of catalyst or a reducing agent such as hydrogen. The process is advantageously carried out with a low reaction period (<1 h) and with a reduced amount of solvent to lignin feedstock (ethanol:lignin (w/w) ratio of 2:1) which is a previously unexplored domain for lignin solvolysis. The resulting bio-oil product is mainly a mixture of di- and monomeric lignin species where the original lignin unit linkages have been broken. The oxygen content is lowered to <10 wt % (corresponding to an HHV of 36 MJ/kg) and the bio-oil is stable and acid free (verified by NMR), and due to the use of sulfur free lignin rich residual as feedstock, the resulting oil product is equally sulfur free. The residual solid product (char) has a reduced oxygen content relative to the lignin feed and equally increased higher heating value, making it a candidate for use as a biochar. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The reliable prediction of the pressure drop of packed beds requires an accurate estimation of the packed-bed porosity as its error propagation multiplies the occurring errors by a factor of about four. The commonly used correlations to determine porosity depend only on the tube to particle diameter ratio. To improve accuracy, the influence of the filling method and of material properties, in particular surface roughness, density, and restitution coefficient are investigated for random packings of spheres in cylindrical confining walls. Furthermore, statistical methods are applied to identify interconnecting effects between these influencing parameters. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass to obtain high value-added products and biofuels has been highlighted in the last years, introducing the biorefinery concept. Among the types of lignocellulosics that can be used in biorefineries, there are rice husk and rice straw, byproducts of rice production usually treated as waste. Every year, 650–975 million tons of rice straw and 800 million tons of rice husk are generated during cultivation and processing of rice. This paper accomplishes a review of potential utilization of rice husk and rice straw in biorefineries approaching its chemical, biochemical, and thermochemical conversions in biofuels, biomaterials, biochemicals, bioenergy, and other high value-added products. The composition of lignocellulosic biomass, as well as the intra and intermolecular interactions among cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin in the biomass structure responsible for its recalcitrant characteristics are discussed. The need of performing a pretreatment prior to bioconversion due to biomass recalcitrance and different possible bioconversion processes are approached. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper describes the physicochemical and chromatographic characterization of crambe oil and the process of its methyl transesterification via alkaline catalysis using response surface methodology (RSM). The reaction conditions developed by applying 24 full factorial central composite design were made in duplicate (obtaining the standard deviations) and the FAMEs content ranging from 75.35 to 99.85%. In the model obtained, the first order effect on catalyst percentage, temperature and reaction time showed a positive influence on the yield, however, their quadratic effects and crossed interactions resulted in negative influence. From the model obtained, a milder reaction condition with a theoretical 98.0% of FAMEs content was created and tested to evaluate its accuracy. This reaction condition present the following parameters values: oil/methanol ratio = 1:4.5; catalyst percentage = 3.5%; temperature = 38.0 °C and reaction time = 1.90 h, the experimental FAMEs content obtained was 97.8 ± 0.1%. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lubrication is one of the most essential requirements for proper working of internal combustion engines, and mineral lubricants are extensively used for that. However, their disposal causes environmental degradation. A logical solution for this may be achieved by using bio-degradable and environmentally acceptable lubricants. A few recent researches have focused on utilizing biofuels, which are primarily used as alternative engine fuels, as lubricants to address environmentally related issues with mineral lubricant. In this context, straight vegetable oils seem to be a promising option. The available literature suggests that 20 % biodiesel has superior effects on the lubricating oil properties compared to diesel when mineral oil is used as lubricant. Therefore, the study of the effect of infiltration of lubricant into the fuel side on the performance and emission characteristics on one hand and infiltration of fuel in the lubricant on the other have been considered in the present work for long-term engine operation. For that, the performance and emission characteristics of palm biodiesel blends with palm oil as lubricant were compared with those of conventional diesel fuel with mineral lubricant for 60 h operation. The variations in viscosity and density of both the lubricants for 60 h operation were also considered. Based on the comparative assessment of the considered fuel–lubricant combinations, it is concluded that the same B30 palm biodiesel fuel blend with palm straight vegetable oil as lubricant may be considered as the most suitable combination. This fuel–lubricant combination will surely reduce the dependency on fossil fuel to a large extent and earn more carbon credits. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The successful implementation of innovative fuels relies on many factors and requires a precise description of the combustion characteristics. In practice, traditional indicators, such as octane or cetane numbers, are used. Obtaining these numbers however requires a specific setup. Moreover, they are not sufficient to predict the combustion timing for innovative concepts, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Evaluating and reporting the characteristics of new fuels is therefore challenging. Using a regular diesel engine converted to HCCI operation, we developed a screening methodology to easily characterize and present key features of new fuels. This paper describes the methodology and then applies it to new fuels produced from biomass: valeric biofuels. The methodology presented in this study intends to bridge the work on fundamental chemical kinetics with conventional engine experiments. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Ashbya gossypii is a filamentous fungus that is currently exploited for the industrial production of riboflavin. The utilization of A. gossypii as a microbial biocatalyst is further supported by its ability to grow in low-cost feedstocks, inexpensive downstream processing and the availability of an ease to use molecular toolbox for genetic and genomic modifications. Consequently, A. gossypii has been also introduced as an ideal biotechnological chassis for the production of inosine, folic acid, and microbial oils. However, A. gossypii cannot use xylose, the most common pentose in hydrolysates of plant biomass. Results: In this work, we aimed at designing A. gossypii strains able to utilize xylose as the carbon source for the production of biolipids. An endogenous xylose utilization pathway was identified and overexpressed, resulting in an A. gossypii xylose-metabolizing strain showing prominent conversion rates of xylose to xylitol (up to 97% after 48 h). In addition, metabolic flux channeling from xylulose-5-phosphate to acetyl-CoA, using aheterologous phosphoketolase pathway, increased the lipid content in the xylose-metabolizing strain a 54% over the parental strain growing in glucose-based media. This increase raised to 69% when lipid accumulation was further boosted by blocking the beta-oxidation pathway. Conclusions: Ashbya gossypii has been engineered for the utilization of xylose. We present here a proof-of-concept study for the production of microbial oils from xylose in A. gossypii, thus introducing a novel biocatalyst with very promising properties in developing consolidated bioprocessing to produce fine chemicals and biofuels from xylose-rich hydrolysates of plant biomass. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The concerns in oil reserves depletion and environmental problems demand renewable energy sources, including biofuel, to be continuously developed. The residue from Spirulina platensis extraction is a source of biomass which can be pyrolysed to obtain liquid fuel. This paper examines the characteristics of pyrolysis with Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and the slow pyrolysis of Spirulina platensis residue (SPR) with a fixed-bed reactor without catalysts. The result of TGA analysis with a heating range from 30 to 1000°C indicated that 20°C/min was the best heating rate while the minimum temperature for thermal decomposition was 302.06°C. Pyrolysis experiments in a fixed-bed reactor were performed using 50 grams of SPR as feed, with a pyrolysis temperature between 400-650°C. The maximum bio-oil yield of 25% was produced at a temperature of 550°C, where the aromatic components and phenol increased. The higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil was quite high (25.70 MJ/kg). On the other hand, the gas products which were dominated by H2, CO, and CH4, can be used as syngas fuel meanwhile the bio char product that had high C content (50.31%) and ash content (11.80%) exhibits a great potential as an adsorbent and catalyst.

AB  - In this work, the influence of catalyst content on the physicochemical properties (acid value, saponification value, specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, and flash point), yield and chemical composition (hydrocarbons and oxygenates) of organic liquid products (OLP) obtained by thermal-catalytic cracking of palm oil (Elaeis guineensis, Jacq.) has been systematically investigated in technical scale. The pilot experiments were carry out in a stirred tank slurry reactor of 143 L, operating in batch mode at 450 °C and 1.0 atm, using 5, 10, 15, and 20% (wt.) Na2CO3as catalyst. The catalyst has been characterized by XRF and SEM techniques. The organic liquid products have been physicochemical characterized for acid and saponification values, specific gravity, refractive index, kinematics viscosity, copper strip corrosion, and flash point. The chemical composition of organic liquid products was determined by GC–MS. The experimental results indicate that initial cracking temperature, as well as specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, acid value, and saponification value of OLP show a tendency to decrease with increasing catalyst content. Hydrocarbons and oxygenates were the major chemical compounds present in OLP, with chemical composition strongly dependent on the catalyst content. The major hydrocarbons present in the organic liquid products have carbon chain length ranging from C12to C15and its summation shows a tendency to increase with increasing catalyst content, while the summation of oxygenate compounds shows a tendency to decrease. In addition, the distribution of hydrocarbons classes (normal paraffins, olefins, and naphthenics) present in OLP shows a maximum concentration for normal paraffins and naphthenics and a minimum concentration for olefins using 10% (wt.) Na2CO3as catalyst. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydrogen-lacking characteristic of bio-oil leads to a low yield of desired product and easy coke formation during its cracking for aromatic hydrocarbon generation. Therefore, an improved hydrogenation-cocracking process which could supply hydrogen in two stages to enhance aromatic hydrocarbon production was developed in this study. Furfural was chosen as the model compound of bio-oil to be coprocessed with methanol, and hydrogen supply behavior was regulated by varying hydrogenation temperature and methanol coprocessing ratio in the feedstock. The results showed that raising hydrogenation temperature in the range of 150–250 °C increased the hydrogenation degree and thus facilitated aromatic hydrocarbon production in the cracking stage. However, a further increase of temperature to 300 °C caused low-reactivity saturated gaseous hydrocarbon production, which decreased the ultimate oil phase yield. The increase of methanol coprocessing ratio in feedstock strengthened the hydrogen supply in the cracking stage, which could promote the deoxygenation of furanic ring and consequently increased aromatic hydrocarbon yield and reduced coke formation. By coprocessing 25% furfural and 75% methanol with a hydrogenation temperature of 250 °C, the oil phase yield reached 26.4% with an aromatic hydrocarbon content of 94.4%. Finally, the hydrogenation-cocracking mechanism was proposed according to the experimental results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of non-edible, second-generation feedstocks for the production of biodiesel has been an active area of research, due to its potential in replacing fossil diesel as well as its environmentally friendly qualities. Despite this, more needs to be done to remove the technical barriers associated with biodiesel production and usage, to increase its quality as well as to widen the choice of available feedstocks; so as to avoid over-dependence on limited sources. This paper assesses the feasibility of using a local plant, Reutealis trisperma, whose seeds contain a high percentage of oil of up to 51%, as one of the possible feedstocks. The techno-economic and sensitivity analysis of biodiesel production from Reutealis trisperma oil as well as implementation aspects and environmental effects of the biodiesel plant are discussed. Analysis indicates that the 50 kt Reutealis trisperma biodiesel production plant has a life cycle cost of approximately 710 million, yielding a payback period of 4.34 years. The unit cost of the biodiesel is calculated to be 0.69/L with the feedstock cost accounting for the bulk of the cost. The most important finding from this study is that the biodiesel from Reutealis trisperma oil can compete with fossil diesel, provided that appropriate policies of tax exemptions and subsidies can be put in place. To conclude, further studies on biodiesel production and its limitations are necessary before the use of biodiesel from Reutealis trisperma oil may be used as a fuel source to replace fossil diesel. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel or fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is primarily synthesized using edible vegetable oils and methanol with a catalyst. However, in the present study, FAMEs were synthesized from a non-edible oil (Calophyllum inophyllum also called as sura honne, Punnagam, Alexandrian Laurel) in different supercritical fluids: methanol (MeOH), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), methyl acetate (MeOAc) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) non-catalytically. Reactions were performed from 523 K to 673 K at 30 MPa with a molar ratio of 40:1 with times varying from 3 min to 3 h. Conversions higher than 80% were obtained within 30 min for oil reaction with MeOH and DMC at 623 K and conversions of 60% and 70% were obtained at 673 K with MeOAc and MTBE, respectively. Pseudo first order kinetics was used to obtain the rate constants and the activation energies followed the order: EMeOH &lt; EDMC &lt; EMeOAc &lt; EMTBE. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) was studied for separation of bio-oil applying different pressures (100, 200, 300 bar), temperatures (60, 80 °C), carriers (SiO2, activated carbon), and times (1–6 h). The maximum extraction yield (13–14 wt%) was obtained at 300 bar, 60 °C with SiO2 as carrier. The composition of the scCO2 extracts was determined by GC–MS/FID. The concentration progress of 32 typical compounds in the extracts at 200 bar was monitored in detail. At 200 bar pressure, the contents in the scCO2 extracts of aldehydes, furanones, coniferyl alcohol, coniferyl aldehyde, and vanillin increased with extraction time. Acids, ketones and most of the guaiacols decreased while phenols and pyrans remained the same. More acids, ketones, and furaldehydes could be obtained at a lower temperature and more aromatic compounds could be extracted when SiO2 as the carrier was employed. The yields of individual components were mainly depending on the duration of extraction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The search for alternative energy sources encompasses increasing the capacity of renewable energy, while reducing the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. The nontoxic and biodegradable character of biomass justifies its exploitation as a fuel to generate power. Specifically, Sapindus saponaria L. oil, with its high lipid content, thermal stability, suitable saponification values, and acid and iodine content, seems to be a promising source for the production of biocombustibles. In this work, biodiesel was produced from the methyl esterification of fatty acids from S. saponaria L. oil. In addition, blends were prepared from the mixture of petrodiesel and biofuel in proportions of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% (v/v). The biodiesel and its blends were evaluated for their rheological properties, thermal profile (thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analyses), density, and refractive index. The biodiesel presented a Newtonian behavior and a kinematic viscosity value of 5.029 mm2/s at 40 °C, in accordance with the ASTM D6751, EN 14214, and CNS 15072 standards. The slight increase in the biodiesel's viscosity, compared to that of petrodiesel (3.442 mm2/s), is advantageous because it provides an increased lubricity and reduces engine wear. Blends B5 to B25 also presented kinematic viscosity values in accordance with the ASTM D976, ASTM D7467, EN 590, and CNS 1471 standards. The obtained biodiesel (Tonset = 188.14 °C) showed a superior thermal stability to petrodiesel (Tonset = 102.17 °C). Differential scanning calorimetry revealed the phase transition between the liquid state to the crystallization of fuels at low temperatures. The compilation of these results highlights the potential of S. saponaria L. oil to generate a biofuel suitable for future commercialization. © 2017

AB  - We report the hydrodeoxygenation of 2-furyl methyl ketone over iron phosphide catalyst to reform the C6structure into C7compounds with higher octane ratings. High conversion and yield were achievable from the reaction at 400 °C when 5 wt% Fe2P/γ-Al2O3catalyst calcined at 600 °C was used. High calcination temperature and reaction temperature are the favorable conditions to achieve high conversion in the reaction. The highest conversion of 92.60% was achieved with 2-allyl furan yield of 79.34% and methyl cylcohexane yield of 13.26% in the liquid phase and 100% carbon dioxide in the gas phase. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lipases are the most widely employed enzymes in commercial industries. The catalytic mechanism of most lipases involves a step called “interfacial activation”. As interfacial activation can lead to a significant increase in catalytic activity, it is of profound importance in developing lipase immobilization methods. To obtain a potential biocatalyst for industrial biodiesel production, an effective strategy for enhancement of catalytic activity and stability of immobilized lipase was developed. This was performed through the combination of interfacial activation with hybrid magnetic cross-linked lipase aggregates. This biocatalyst was investigated for the immobilization of lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (RML). Under the optimal conditions, the activity recovery of the surfactant-activated magnetic RML cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) was as high as 2058%, with a 20-fold improvement over the free RML. Moreover, the immobilized RML showed excellent catalytic performance for the biodiesel reaction at a yield of 93%, and more importantly, could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by simple magnetic decantation, and retained more than 84% of its initial activities after five instances of reuse. This study provides a new and versatile approach for designing and fabricating immobilized lipase with high activation and stability. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The butanol-ethanol (B–E) mixture with water, obtained from ABE (Acetone-Butanol-ethanol) fermentation, is utilized as a renewable biofuel for the production of clean energy carrier hydrogen by steam reforming process (SRB–E). The thermodynamic analysis of steam reforming process for B–E mixture is carried out by Gibbs free energy minimization method. The thermal and exergy efficiencies for the process are investigated to exploit the potential of B–E mixture for hydrogen production. For performance evaluation, the variational trends of moles of products (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, and carbon) are studied at equilibrium as a function of temperature (573–1473 K), pressure (1–10 atm), steam/fuel molar feed ratio (0–12) for composition of B–E mixture (50 to 90% B). For mixture (90% B), the maximum production of H2 (9.555 mol per mol of fuel) is achieved at 973 K temperature, 1 atm pressure, molar feed ratio of 12. Methane and carbon formation are negligible at high temperature (&gt;873 K) and molar feed ratio (&gt;5) for all B–E compositions. Energy required per mol of H2 is 50.77 kJ/mol for mixture (90% B) and is lower than that for steam reforming of butanol. The thermal efficiency is 70.071%, close to maximum for mixture (90% B), which is higher than butanol (69.885%), and ethanol (68.491%). For 90% B mixture, exergy efficiency (48.582%) is also comparable with that of butanol (48.693%) and ethanol (46.145%). This study proposes an economic process for hydrogen production via steam reforming of B–E mixture directly. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biological treatments, such as activated sludge process, are common methods to treat municipal and industrial wastewaters. However, they produce huge amounts of waste activated sludge (WAS). The excess sludge treatment and disposal are a challenge for wastewater treatment plants due to economic, environmental, and regulatory factors. In this study, photo-Fenton pretreatment (oxidation using hydrogen peroxide and iron catalyst aided with UV light) was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) to determine the effects of three operating parameters (H2O2 dosage, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio, and irradiation time) on disintegration and dewaterability of WAS. MLVSS removal, capillary suction time (CST) reduction, sCOD, and EPS were obtained as 70%, 25%, 12,000 mg/L, and 500 mg/L, respectively, at the optimal conditions, i.e., 725 g H2O2/kg TS, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio 80, and irradiation time 40 min. Two batch-fed completely mixed mesophilic anaerobic digesters were then operated at 15-day solid retention time (SRT) and 37 ± 0.5 °C to compare the digestibility of untreated and photo-Fenton pretreated sludge in terms of volatile solids (VS) reduction, COD removal, and biogas production at steady-state operations. Photo-Fenton pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion of WAS was very effective and yielded 75.7% total VS reduction, 81.5% COD removal, and 0.29–0.31 m3/kg VSfed·d biogas production rate, compared to 40.7% total VS solid reduction, 54.7% COD removal, and 0.12–0.17 m3/kg VSfed·d biogas production rate for control. Thus, photo-Fenton can be a useful pretreatment step in sludge management. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Algal biomass has received attention as an alternative carbon resource owing not only to its high oil production efficiency but also, unlike corn starch, to its lack of demand in foods. However, algal residue is commonly discarded after the abstraction of oil. The utilization of the residue to produce chemicals will therefore increase the value of using algal biomass instead of fossil fuels. Here, we report the use of algal residue as a new carbon resource to produce important chemicals. The application of different homogeneous catalysts leads to the selective production of methyl levulinate or methyl lactate. These results demonstrate the successful development of new carbon resources as a solution for the depletion of fossil fuels. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The intrinsic structural properties of branched long-chain fatty alcohols (BLFLs) in the range of C12 to C18 make them more suitable as diesel fuel replacements and for other industrial applications than their straight-chain counterparts. While microbial production of straight long-chain fatty alcohols has been achieved, biosynthesis of BLFLs has never been reported. In this work, we engineered four different biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli to produce BLFLs. We then employed a modular engineering approach to optimize the supply of α-keto acid precursors and produced either odd-chain or even-chain BLFLs with high selectivity, reaching 70 and 75% of total fatty alcohols, respectively. The acyl-ACP and alcohol-producing modules were also extensively optimized to balance enzyme expression level and ratio, resulting in a 6.5-fold improvement in BLFL titers. The best performing strain overexpressed 14 genes from 6 engineered operons and produced 350 mg/L of BLFLs in fed-batch fermenter. The modular engineering strategy successfully facilitated microbial production of BLFLs and allowed us to quickly optimize new BLFL pathway with high titers and product specificity. More generally, this work provides pathways and knowledge for the production of BLFLs and BLFL-related, industry-relevant chemicals in high titers and yields. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation of sugar alcohols can be tuned to produce monofunctional oxygenates for use as jet or diesel fuel precursors. However, the catalysts typically utilize precious metals and are not highly selective. Here, the hydrodeoxygenation of aqueous sorbitol was studied over a Co/TiO2 catalyst to produce monofunctionals at a 56 C% yield. The majority of these species are alcohols (69%) or heterocycles (23%) while ketones and aldehydes are readily hydrogenated. 67% of the monofunctionals are C5-C6. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry provided evidence for the coupling of C3 and C6 oxygenates to C9+ oligomeric species, which likely fragment and deoxygenate to form C1-C6 monofunctionals and gases. Co/TiO2 deactivation occurred irreversibly due to sintering and leaching promoted by oxygenated species. Our results suggest that low-cost base metal catalysts can be as effective as many precious metal catalysts for monofunctional production from sorbitol toward heavy fuels if catalyst deactivation issues can be overcome. The production of jet- and diesel-range hydrocarbons from aqueous carbohydrate solutions remains a challenge, in part due to high catalyst costs and low product selectivities. Here, monofunctional fuel precursors were produced using low-cost Co/TiO2 at yields exceeding those from costly noble metal catalysts. The majority of these monofunctionals are C5-C6 alcohols and heterocycles, which can be coupled and hydrotreated into distillate-range hydrocarbons. FT-ICR MS shows the formation of C9 and C12 oligomers, which are likely intermediates in the hydrodeoxygenation route. This study shows that low-cost base metals can be effectively utilized in this chemistry if catalyst deactivation challenges, due to sintering and leaching, can be overcome for this type of catalyst. Monofunctional fuel precursors (alcohols and heterocycles) can be produced through the hydrodeoxygenation of the C6 polyol sorbitol using Co/TiO2 at yields exceeding those from expensive noble metal catalysts. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biodiesel was produced using waste coffee grounds (WCGs) via a two-step process comprising lipid extraction and subsequent transesterification steps. Each step was statistically analyzed, and optimum conditions for each step were suggested. WCGs were found to have 16.4% lipid content with 1.9% free fatty acid (FFA) content. The liquid-solid ratio (LSR) significantly influenced lipid extraction from WCGs, while extraction time and temperature did not; 92.7% of lipid extraction efficiency was achieved at 13.7 mL-hexane/g-WCGs, 30 min of extraction time, and 25°C. Owing to the relatively low FFA content, an alkaline catalyst (NaOH) reaction was used that requires less amount of catalyst, methanol, and shorter reaction time compared to an acid catalyst reaction. Reaction time and temperature were the major factors affecting biodiesel conversion, and 94.0% of biodiesel conversion was obtained at optimum conditions for transesterification: 0.5% catalyst, 1.5 mL-methanol/g-lipid, 45°C, and 9 h of reaction time. With the use of statistical analysis tools, high lipid extraction efficiency and biodiesel conversion were achieved at relatively mild conditions, which would reduce biodiesel production cost substantially. © 2017, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Crude bio-oil from the brown alga Saccharina japonica was separated into distilled fractions under reduced pressure (40 mmHg). The three bio-oil distillates were depending on temperature (Fraction I; ≤40 °C, Fraction II; 40–120 °C, Fraction III; 120–160 °C, solid residue; b.p. > 160 °C). The characteristic of the middle distillates showed that aliphatics (including alkanes) and aromatics (including heterocyclics) were mostly distributed in a dark hydrophobic oil (DHO) of Fractions II and III, while anhydrosugars, acids, ketones and ethers were mainly concentrated in a transparent hydrophilic oil (THO) of Fractions II and III. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Increasing fuel prices lead to developing an alternative renewable fuel for internal combustion engines. Pine oil possesses lower viscosity, boiling point and flash point, similar to other plant based fuels like ethanol and eucalyptus oil. Pine oil has been identified to contain terpineol, a higher alcohol, along with pinene, which is an alicyclic hydrocarbon. In this research work, the various performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine were studied by using an alternative fuel of the biofuel mixed with pine oil and its blends. The results were compared with standard diesel fuel. From the results, it was found that there is a slight increase in brake thermal efficiency and a decrease in brake specific fuel consumption in all pine blended fuels when compared with regular diesel fuel. The use of pine oil resulted in lower emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and increased emissions of nitrogen oxides. © 2017, Rasayan Journal of Chemistry, c/o Dr. Pratima Sharma.

AB  - Research on biomass conversion into energy through pyrolysis has emerged in the past several years. Pyrolysis is believed to have a real future for green-fuel production and as the means of the revitalization of the Canadian pulp and paper industry. As pyrolysis has recently been successfully optimized through the use of heterogeneous catalysts, attention has been drawn to ultrasound for its ability to cleave lignocellulosic bonds. In this study, we investigated the use of ultrasound techniques as a pretreatment for biomass before wood pyrolysis with respect to bio-oil yields. Different conditions in terms of frequency (40, 68 and 170 kHz), time (0.5, 1 and 1.5 h) and power (125, 250, 500 and 1000 W) were explored to include the primary action mechanisms of ultrasound: mechanical and sonochemical effects. The combination of using 40 kHz and 170 kHz frequencies in a sequence of 0.5 h at 170 kHz and 1.5 h at 40 kHz and a power of 1000 W has been demonstrated to be the best, achieving a 12% increase in bio-oil yield compared to untreated wood. However, contrary to what was thought at first, the best energy efficiency was obtained at low power (125 W) with a Watt per percentage of extra oil produced ratio of 47. Therefore, depending on the final production goal, the ultrasonic conditions could be adjusted accordingly. Finally, the chemical analysis of the oils by GC indicated no influence of the pretreatment on the final composition of the recovered oils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The thermodynamic equilibrium of steam reforming of propionic acid (HPAc) as a bio-oil model compound was studied over a wide range of reaction conditions (T = 500–900 °C, P = 1–10 bar and H2O/HPAc = 0–4 mol/mol) using non-stoichiometric equilibrium models. The effect of operating conditions on equilibrium conversion, product composition and coke formation was studied. The equilibrium calculations indicate nearly complete conversion of propionic acid under these conditions. Additionally, carbon and methane formation are unfavorable at high temperatures and high steam to carbon (S/C) ratios. The hydrogen yield versus S/C ratio passes a maximum, the value and position of which depends on temperature. The thermodynamic equilibrium results for HPAc fit favorably with experimental data for real bio-oil steam reforming under same reaction conditions. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Many inexpensive biofuel feedstocks, including those containing free fatty acids (FFAs) in high concentrations, are typically disposed of as waste due to our inability to efficiently convert them into usable biofuels. Here we demonstrate that carbon derived from waste tires could be functionalized with sulfonic acid (-SO3H) to effectively catalyze the esterification of oleic acid or a mixture of fatty acids to usable biofuels. Waste tires were converted to hard carbon, then functionalized with catalytically active -SO3H groups on the surface through an environmentally benign process that involved the sequential treatment with L-cysteine, dithiothreitol, and H2O2. When benchmarked against the same waste-tire derived carbon material treated with concentrated sulfuric acid at 150 °C, similar catalytic activity was observed.

AB  - A compound additive consisting of methanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and acetone was obtained with the A-Optimal mixture design of Design-Expert. How the solvent effected the stability of bio-oil was analyzed on the basis of viscosity, moisture content, and pH. Bio-oil with the optimal compound additive (1 wt % methanol, 5.064 wt % DMF, and 1.940 wt % acetone) had a low viscosity and moisture content and high pH after aging (80 °C for 24 h). The corresponding property values were 4.36 mm2/s, 24.03%, and 4.49, respectively, and the result was better than bio-oil with a single solvent. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the phenol contents in all of the compounds in bio-oil were high. After aging, the contents of sugars and esters increased and several chemical compounds, such as 2-ethoxy-5-(1-propen-1-yl) and 5-hydroxy-2-methylbenzaldehyde, disappeared in bio-oil with the compound additive. Elemental analysis showed that the contents of O and N increased after the addition of the optimal compound additive. The compound additive exerted a positive effect on the bio-oil during storage. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A pilot-scale algal biofilm reactor (P-ABR) was assessed for its potential to provide a continuous supply of high volume algal biomass to be utilized as feedstock for hydropyrolysis. The half-year long performance assessment showed significantly high productivity of 15-20 g m-2 d-1 with uniform biochemical composition. Hydropyrolysis (HyPy) using ZSM-5 was used to convert and partition ABR-grown algal biomass components into energy-rich biocrude (HyPyO), nutrient-rich aqueous condensate (HyPyA), carbon-rich solid residue (HyPyS), and gases. The effect of temperature on yield and composition of different HyPy products was quantified in terms of carbon and nitrogen recovery. The maximum yield of biocrude was 31% at 200 °C and decreased to 18% with an increase in temperature up to 300 °C. The influence of temperature on recovery of nitrogen showed preferential accumulation of nitrogen in the aqueous phase with increasing temperature. The highest carbon recovered was 41% in the form of biocrude (HyPyO) at 200 °C followed by 31% in HyPyA at 300 °C. In the context of energy and nutrient recovery potential of each of the HyPy products, applications of different fractions was explored for development of a sustainable algal biorefinery. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, a series of CeO2–ZrO2 and CeO2–TiO2 materials with different composition were prepared, characterized by BET and XRD analysis, and their hydrothermal stability was studied by subjecting the samples to acetic acid solutions at 533 K. All of the materials, especially C1Z1 (50 mol% CeO2 with 50 mol% ZrO2) and C1T1 (50 mol% CeO2 with 50 mol% TiO2), exhibited excellent stability with no phase transformation and minimal decrease in their specific surface area (SSA) was observed even after 16 h. After being loaded by Pt, these catalysts were used for the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of the low-boiling fraction of bio-oil (LBF) to investigate their catalytic performance. Among these catalysts Pt/C1Z1 and Pt/C1T1 showed superior catalytic activity, probably due to their lowest reduction temperature and the largest amount of O vacancies generated by the reduction of the surface oxygen of well-dispersed CeO2. Thus, Pt/C1Z1 and Pt/C1T1 were chosen to investigate their recyclability. The catalytic activity and H2 selectivity of Pt/C1Z1 and Pt/C1T1 can be almost recovered after being calcined in air at 773 K for regeneration. After three cycles, the particle size of Pt/C1Z1 and Pt/C1T1 only experienced a slight increase, while for Pt/Al2O3 it increased from 2.9 nm to 7.8 nm. So, compared with Pt/Al2O3, the Pt/C1Z1 and Pt/C1T1 catalysts were identified as effective and recyclable candidates for the production of H2 rich fuel gas from APR of LBF. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil is a promising process to convert biomass into hydrogen. To shed light on this process, acetic acid is selected as the model compound of the oxygenates in bio-oil, and density functional theory is applied to investigate the mechanism of acetic acid steam reforming on the Ni(111) surface. The most favorable pathway of this process on the Ni(111) surface is suggested as CH 3 COOH* → CH 3 COO* → CH 3 CO* → CH 2 CO* → CH 2 * + CO* → CH* → CHOH* → CHO* → CO*, followed by the water gas shift reaction to produce CO 2 and H 2 . CH* species are identified as the major carbon deposition precursor, and the water gas shift reaction is the rate-determining step during the whole acetic acid steam reforming process, as CO* + OH* → cis-COOH* is kinetically restricted with the highest barrier of 1.85 eV. Furthermore, the formation pathways and initial dissociation of important intermediates acetone and acetaldehyde are also investigated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Conversion of softwoods into sustainable fuels and chemicals is important for parts of the world where softwoods are the dominant forest species. While they have high theoretical sugar yields, softwoods are amongst the most recalcitrant feedstocks for enzymatic processes, typically requiring both more severe pretreatment conditions and higher enzyme doses than needed for other lignocellulosic feedstocks. Although a number of processes have been proposed for converting softwoods into sugars suitable for fuel and chemical production, there is still a need for a high-yielding, industrially scalable and cost-effective conversion route. Results: We summarise work leading to the development of an efficient process for the enzymatic conversion of radiata pine (Pinus radiata) into wood sugars. The process involves initial pressurised steaming of wood chips under relatively mild conditions (173°C for 3-72 min) without added acid catalyst. The steamed chips then pass through a compression screw to squeeze out a pressate rich in solubilised hemicelluloses. The pressed chips are disc-refined and wet ball-milled to produce a substrate which is rapidly saccharified using commercially available enzyme cocktails. Adding 0.1% polyethylene glycol during saccharification was found to be particularly effective with these substrates, reducing enzyme usage to acceptable levels, e.g. 5 FPU/g OD substrate. The pressate is separately hydrolysed using acid, providing additional hemicellulose-derived sugars, for an overall sugar yield of 535 kg/ODT chips (76% of theoretical). The total pretreatment energy input is comparable to other processes, with the additional energy for attrition being balanced by a lower thermal energy requirement. This pretreatment strategy produces substrates with low levels of fermentation inhibitors, so the glucose-rich mainline and pressate syrups can be fermented to ethanol without detoxification. The lignin from the process remains comparatively unmodified, as evident from the level of retained β-ether interunit linkages, providing an opportunity for conversion into saleable co-products. Conclusions: This process is an efficient route for the enzymatic conversion of radiata pine, and potentially other softwoods, into a sugar syrup suitable for conversion into fuels and chemicals. Furthermore, the process uses standard equipment that is largely proven at commercial scale, de-risking process scale-up. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Lignocellulosic biorefineries have tonnage and throughput requirements that must be met year round and there is no single feedstock available in any given region that is capable of meeting the price and availability demands of the biorefineries scheduled for deployment. Significant attention has been historically given to agriculturally derived feedstocks; however, a diverse range of wastes, including municipal solid wastes (MSW), also have the potential to serve as feedstocks for the production of advanced biofuels and have not been extensively studied. In addition, ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment with certain ILs is receiving great interest as a potential process that enables fractionation of a wide range of feedstocks. Acid catalysts have been used previously to hydrolyze polysaccharides into fermentable sugars following IL pretreatment, which could potentially provide a means of liberating fermentable sugars from lignocellulose without the use of costly enzymes. However, successful optimization and scale-up of the one-pot acid-assisted IL deconstruction for further commercialization involve challenges such as reactor compatibility, mixing at high solid loading, sugar recovery, and IL recycling, which have not been effectively resolved during the development stages at bench scale. Results: Here, we present the successful scale-up demonstration of the acid-assisted IL deconstruction on feedstock blends of municipal solid wastes and agricultural residues (corn stover) by 30-fold, relative to the bench scale (6 vs 0.2 L), at 10% solid loading. By integrating IL pretreatment and acid hydrolysis with subsequent centrifugation and extraction, the sugar and lignin products can be further recovered efficiently. This scale-up development at Advanced Biofuels/Bioproducts Process Demonstration Unit (ABPDU) will leverage the opportunity and synergistic efforts toward developing a cost-effective IL-based deconstruction technology by drastically eliminating enzyme, reducing water usage, and simplifying the downstream sugar/lignin recovery and IL recycling. Conclusion: Results indicate that MSW blends are viable and valuable resource to consider when assessing biomass availability and affordability for lignocellulosic biorefineries. This scale-up evaluation demonstrates that the acid-assisted IL deconstruction technology can be effectively scaled up to larger operations and the current study established the baseline of scaling parameters for this process. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The chemical effects of carbon dioxide on the oxidation of biodiesel surrogate, methyl butanoate (MB) were investigated experimentally in the SJTU laminar flow reactor at equivalence ratios of 1.5, 1 and 0.5, at atmospheric pressure. Generally, there are three kinds of effects from carbon dioxide (CO2): thermal, dilution and chemical effects. In this study, argon was replaced by CO2 as the dilute gas as a way to isolate the chemical effects by keeping the factors of temperature profile and dilution ratio constant. Therefore, the differences in concentrations of species at the exit from the flow reactor could be attributed to the chemical effects of CO2. Good agreement was found between the experimental and the computational results. The chemical effects were classified into two types. First, there was the radical factor, by which the reaction CO2 + H = OH + CO played a significant role in the oxidation of MB. In CO2 atmosphere, radical factors led to the reduction in reactivity and suppressed the decomposition of MB. The second effect was the collision factor, which derived from the high frequency of third-body collisions of CO2. This collision factor contributed to the formation of carbon monoxide and ethane. Moreover, in the combustion of biodiesel engine with EGR, pure chemical effects of CO2 addition decreased the concentration of acetylene as well as suppressed formation of larger PAHs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - T{(NPI), 1999 #117}his research compares the effects of oxygenated fuels on engine blow-by during engine cold and hot start operation using a common rail, turbocharged diesel engine. Diesel, waste cooking biodiesel and a highly oxygenated additive, triacetin, were used to make a range of fuel oxygen contents (0–13.57%). This study investigated engine blow-by and its correlation with indicated, brake and friction power; and blow-by normalised by different parameters. Result showed that neat diesel produces higher blow-by during cold start than the oxygenated fuels. There was a strong correlation between blow-by and indicated power, and the fuel calorific value was identified as a leading factor. To further analyse the results, this study normalised the engine blow-by by power to reveal the other influences on engine blow-by. The result verified the strong influence of power. This study also furthered the analysis by normalising the blow-by data by exhaust flow rate, intake air flow rate and injected fuel flow rate. It was discovered that oxygenated fuels perform better between hot and cold start, when compared to diesel. The blow-by inhibited properties of oxygenated fuels, such as higher lubricity and viscosity may be the cause for better performance of oxygenated fuels during cold start. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The chemical composition, structure of bio-oil and reaction mechanism of pine sawdust pyrolysis by fluidized-bed reactor at 500 °C with hot vapor filter (HVF) at temperatures of 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C and 500 °C were investigated. According to elemental and GPC analysis, the average formula of HVF bio-oils at HVF temperature 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C and non-HVF bio-oil were expressed as C36.60H54.17O15.37, C17.11H25.50O9.07, C15.22H22.53O7.61, C15.80H22.43O8.37 and C15.23H21.47O8.99, respectively. Quantitative NMR result showed that the aromatic carbon fraction and the hydroxyl and alkyl carbons in carbohydrate fraction increased, but the C–O bonds in phenolic-methoxy fraction and the methoxyl-aromatic fraction decreased with the increased HVF temperature. GC × GC-TOFMS analysis showed that the contents of phenols, aldehydes and alcohols in HVF bio-oils and non-HVF bio-oil had a similar increasing tendency. In contrast, ketones, furans and carbohydrates had a similar decreasing tendency. Tentative chemical transformation pathways showed that guaiacol-type compounds with side chains of two carbons or longer were decreased. The Ar–OH bonds in catechol-type were more stable than the Ar–OCH3 bonds when HVF temperature was between 400 °C and 500 °C. Experimental results showed that hot vapor filter had a positive effect on the composition and structure of bio-oil, and more stable and higher quality bio-oil can be produced. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis is an emerging and promising technology for producing cellulosic biofuels. Ex situ catalytic hydropyrolysis offers additional benefits of operational flexibility and catalyst performance. The unique feature of a two-step ex situ hydropyrolysis vapor upgrading process has been demonstrated for the first time using a double fluidized-bed reactor system. Product distribution (35.2-46.7% C5+ organic yield on a carbon basis) and oxygen content of the organic liquid product (2-17 wt%) can be tailored by adjusting process conditions. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to identify oxygen functionalities and representative species in the organic liquid products. The structural information was further related to product stability, a key property pertaining to product storage, transportation, and processing. Unlike pyrolysis oil, the products contained minimal amounts of reactive oxygenates (e.g., aldehydes, acids, sugars, and other multifunctional oxygenates) that could cause stability issues. As a result, the products were stable in storage at 40°C for 2 months. Further thermal stability tests show that all of the products were more stable than pyrolysis oil and soybean oil at elevated temperatures. The products with 6 wt% oxygen or less showed high thermal stability (behaving much like a petroleum distillate hydrotreater feed in the tests) and possessed low total acid number (<1 mg KOH per g), indicating good petroleum refinery compatibility. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - This study demonstrated that the bio-oil derived from fast pyrolysis of lignin was excellent candidate to be converted into the jet and diesel fuel range hydrocarbons by catalytic upgrading process. This research addresses specifically the kinetic and mechanism of cyclohexanone conversion using sulfided CoMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed-bed flow reactor. The main routes of cyclohexanone upgrading included hydrodeoxygenations (HDO), dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and coupling. The selectivity-conversion analyses at different operating condition indicate that benzene, cyclohexene, phenol, and 2-cyclohexen-1-one formed as primary products and the other main products, 2-methylphenol, cyclohexylbenzene, biphenyl, 2-phenylphenol, 2-cyclohexylcyclohexan-1-one, 2-cyclohexylidenecyclohexane-1-one and 2-cyclohexylphenol appeared as non-primary products. An approximate reaction network and a first order kinetic model are developed to determine kinetic parameters. Kinetic investigations indicate that among the various reactions on sulfided CoMo/Al2O3, HDO is characterized by the highest rate and that selectivities for oxygen removal are favored by operation at higher temperatures and pressures. The apparent activation energy for the HDO reaction that leads to benzene formation is approximately 35.6 kJ/mol; coupling is the reaction class characterized by the highest apparent activation energy. The pseudo-first-order rate constants for formation of the main products of cyclohexanone conversion decrease in the following order: benzene &gt;2-cyclohexylidenecyclohexane-1-one &gt; cyclohexylbenzene &gt; 2-cyclohexen-1-one &gt; 2-phenylphenol &gt; phenol &gt; cyclohexene &gt; 2-cyclohexylphenol &gt; 2-methylphenol &gt; 2-cyclohexylcyclohexan-1-one &gt; biphenyl. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Flat enzyme-based lactate biofuel cell (ELBC) integrated with power management system (PMS) was developed as a potential power supply for wearable sensors. Kinetic models of power output and chemical reagent concentration (lactate oxidase LOx and lactate) were developed to determine the limiting factor of the ELBC performance. Given the lactate concentration (0–40 mM) in human sweat, the optimum LOx amount coated on the anode ranged from 6U to 54U based on the experimental maximum power output. In the ELBC-PMS entity simulation test, power discharge/recharge frequency was calculated for self-sustained sensing and data transmission, indicating that the ELBC could support wearable sensors (power requirement: 1–1350 mW; signal transfer frequency: 1–1320 times/h). The electrochemical activity of LOx coated anode was validated using the cyclic voltammetry (CV). The coefficient of variance and regression statistical analysis revealed the high stability and long lifespan (2 weeks) of ELBC without the need of lactate refill. © 2017

AB  - Continuous hydrothermal liquefaction (CHTL) of lignocellulosic biomass with subsequent hydrotreating is carried out to study the effect of NH3versus NaOH as alkaline HTL catalyst. Product analysis include Py-GCxGC–MS, simulated distillation and fractional distillation. Ammonia enhances biocrude quality slightly in terms of H/C ratio, density and HHV, but a significant coke formation of 11 wt.% is observed. Furthermore, ammonia pollutes the biocrude with 2.7 wt.% nitrogen, which is observed to inhibit hydrotreating conversion. In comparison, CHTL with NaOH is associated with a 43 wt.% yield of a hydrotreatable biocrude, stable TOC levels during aqueous phase recirculation and mass, carbon and energy balance closure. Hydrotreating eliminates the TAN, reduces oxygen to 2–3 wt.% and produces a promising fuel bio-blendstock with ultra-low sulphur and a diesel fraction equal to 43%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The unprocessed bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is a mixture of hundreds of oxy-compounds which vitiate the quality of bio-oil. Eugenol is one of the most promising model compounds of the phenolic fraction of unprocessed bio-oil and it comprises two oxy-functionals, namely, hydroxyl and methoxy functionals. In this study, eight reaction pathways are carried out, using eugenol as the model compound, producing many important products viz. toluene, propylbenzene, guaiacol, allylbenzene, 4-propylphenol, isoeugenol, etc. in a gas phase environment by using the B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p) level of theory under the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The thermochemical study of these reactions is also carried out in a wide range of temperatures between 298-898 K with an interval temperature of 100 K and fixed pressure of 1 atm. The direct cleavage of the functional groups of eugenol followed by an atomic hydrogenation reaction to produce lower fraction products is found to be not favourable; however, an atomic hydrogenation reaction prior to the removal of functional groups of eugenol makes these reactions more favourable. The activation energy for the production of guaiacol from eugenol under reaction scheme 2 is reported to be 10.53 kcal mol-1 only, which is the lowest activation energy required amongst all reaction schemes. The reaction scheme 5, i.e., the production of propylcyclohexane from eugenol, is reported to be the most exothermic and spontaneous reaction at all temperature conditions; however, ΔG values increase with increasing temperature and ΔH values decrease with increasing temperature. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this study, the reactive separation system has been designed and operated for fuel bioadditive ethyl levulinate synthesis from ethanol and levulinic acid by using a catalytic composite membrane. The catalytic composite membrane was prepared by coating hydroxyethyl cellulose membrane with a thin layer of sulfated zirconia. The membranes were characterized and the stability of the catalytic composite membrane was confirmed by consecutive experiments. Batch reactor experiments were carried out by using powder sulfated zirconia catalyst. While the levulinic acid conversion was 34.92% in 7 h by using the powder sulfated zirconia catalyst in the batch reactor, the conversion reached to a level of 95% in 7 h by using sulfated zirconia coated hydroxyethyl cellulose catalytic membrane under the same conditions (reaction temperature 70 °C, catalyst concentration 8 g/L and initial molar ratio 3:1) in the pervaporation catalytic membrane reactor (PVCMR). Results showed that the conversion in the PVCMR was much higher than those in the batch reactors. The effects of temperature, catalyst concentration and initial molar ratio of ethanol to levulinic acid on the conversion value of levulinic acid were investigated for both batch reactor and the pervaporation catalytic membrane reactor. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The consumption of pellets and alternative biofuels, such as some agricultural residues, has experienced a tremendous growth in Mediterranean countries, which has changed the panorama of biomass burning emissions. To apply source apportionment models, specific chemical signatures for smoke aerosols are necessary. In this study, filter samples of fine particles (PM2.5) from the combustion of four different types of pellets and three agro-fuels (shell of pine nuts, olive pit and almond shell) in a pellet stove were collected. The PM2.5 samples were extracted with dichloromethane/methanol and the dried extracts were silylated before injection into the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The analysis included monosaccharide anhydrides, resin acids, methoxyphenols and sterols. The amounts emitted were highly variable and dependent on both biofuel and combustion temperature. On average, the anhydrosugar particle mass fractions for the seven biofuels were 30 to 70 times lower than the values reported for manually fired systems. The highest levoglucosan emissions were observed for olive pit. Levoglucosan to mannosan ratios ranged from values around 2 for pellets and shell of pine nuts to much higher quotients, similar to those reported for hardwood combustion. Irrespective of biofuel, vanillin and vanillic acid were always present in the smoke samples. Coniferyl alcohol was only detected in samples from the combustion of olive pit and pellets with the highest softwood content. Sinapyl alcohol was exclusively emitted by olive pit. Dehydroabietic and isopimaric acids were represented in emissions whether from all type of pellets or from shell of pine nuts, whilst abietic acid was only quantifiable in PM2.5 from the combustion of pellets made of coniferous wood. Sitosterol was solely detected in smoke particles from shell of pine nuts and olive pit. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - High energy demand along with large capital costs have been the main drawbacks of Fischer-Tropsch plants, which may call into question the economic viability of the Fischer-Tropsch process. The second issue is the focus of this paper, which presents a techno-economic assessment of biofuels production by a low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with electricity as a co-product from supercritical water reforming of the bio-oil aqueous phase. A plant size of 60 t/h was considered and a heat-integrated process was designed to be energy self-sufficient, which includes syngas production and upgrading, as well as liquid fuels production by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and refining. The simulation and optimization was performed with the aid of Aspen Plus, and some case-studies were performed. Using a feeding concentration of 25 wt%, 2.74 t/h biofuels and 5.72 MWe were obtained. In this case, by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, with 10% rate of return and 100% equity financing, the minimum selling prices for the refined FT-gasoline, FT-diesel and FT-jet fuel were 1.20, 0.93 and 0.26 €/kg (0.84, 0.75 and 0.20 €/L), respectively, which are competitive prices with respect to the market values of the equivalent fossil fuels. Likewise, the decrease in the selling prices as the plant capacity increases was also analyzed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research was carried out in southern Italy with the aim to assess the quality of faba bean residual biomass and its potential for biorefinery application. Faba bean is a sustainable crop, due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, and a large amount of biomass remains after harvest which can be valorised for energy production. Greenhouse and early planting are known to affect pod yield and, in this respect, even the residual biomass quality needs to be assessed. For this purpose, the effects of five planting times (i.e. the dates of transplants ranging from 27 September to 22 November at two-week interval, earlier and later than the common planting date of 25 October in Naples province) on pods yield, residual biomass, and saccharification potential were evaluated in faba bean grown in open field and in greenhouse. The third planting time resulted in the highest fruit and residual biomass yield under greenhouse, whereas the fourth was the best in open field. Harvest index was best affected by the third and fourth planting times in open field. Greenhouse grown biomass showed higher values of lignin, hemicellulose and pectin, compared to open field, whereas the opposite trend was recorded with cellulose. Lignin content showed a gradual decrease from the first to the last planting time (17.7%–13.7% biomass fraction respectively), as well as pectin (from 14.1 to 11.5% biomass fraction); conversely, cellulose increased from the first to the last planting time (from 41.1 to 48.7% biomass fraction). Glucose was the most represented monosaccharide (46.7 mol%), followed by xylose (27.4 mol%) and galactose (9.9 mol%). Overall, the potential of faba bean residual biomass for energy production was best affected by open field growing, the latest planting time and alkali pre-treatment, the latter giving the highest value of saccharification (60.7 g kg−1 h−1 compared to 27.6 relevant to hot water pre-treatment). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in greenhouse gas emission due to the burning of fossil fuels since the last century has led to global warming. This has triggered numerous researches in green hydrocarbon alternatives from renewable oil. Microalgae is one of the potential sources of green hydrocarbon, which will reduce the dependency on fossil fuel. This is because microalgae have a high oil or lipid content, rapid growth rate, and high ability to sequester carbon dioxide. Besides that, their cultivation does not require arable land and will, therefore not compete with global food production. The current biofuel production is based on the transesterification of triglyceride to biodiesel which suffered from several drawbacks such as high acidity, high viscosity, and low heating value, etc. A more efficient reaction route needs to be developed to produce biofuel which possesses similar properties as the fossil-derived fuel. Therefore, this review aims to encompass the conversion of microalgae oil towards green hydrocarbons via various catalytic reactions. The fundamental chemistry and mechanisms involved in the conversion of microalgae oil to useful chemical products are also discussed in detail. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - It is a great challenge for even the most complex refineries to ensure an economic yield distribution that satisfies the increased diesel fuel and biofuel consumption of the European Union. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the use of different gas oil fractions (e.g. low value streams) for producing diesel fuel blending components and the integration possibilities of biofuel production to a refinery. According to that the co-hydrogenation of mixtures of fatty acid by-products (0–20%) and different gas oil fractions (untreated gas oil fraction, light cycle oil) on commercial, sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated. The effects of feed compositions and process parameters (temperature, pressure, liquid hourly space velocity) on the quality and quantity of the gas oil products were investigated. The applied process parameters were the following: P = 40–70 bar, T = 320–380 °C, LHSV = 1.0–2.0 h−1, hydrogen/feedstock ratio = 600 Nm3/m3. We concluded that gas oil boiling range products with high yield can be produced from 10 to 20% fatty acid by-product and 10% light cycle oil containing feedstocks on the studied catalyst. The products are good quality diesel fuel blending components and have high waste derived component content. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work investigates the thermochemical valorization of camelina straw, which is a waste generated during the harvesting of Camelina sativa, an oilseed crop for the production of biodiesel or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). In particular, it is focused on obtaining bio-oil via thermal or catalytic fast pyrolysis, which would be the first stage on a sequence of chemical processes for biofuel production. The catalytic interference of the inorganic matter present in the biomass was studied by preparing a batch of de-ashed camelina straw by washing with diluted nitric acid. Chemical analysis revealed this treatment effectively removed alkaline (K and Na) and alkaline earth (Ca and Mg) metals. Pyrolysis of de-ashed camelina straw led to higher mass and energy yields of bio-oil in water-free basis (bio-oil*), but with higher oxygen concentration. Catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 was also studied in both raw and de-ashed feedstocks. This catalyst promoted mainly decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions of the pyrolysis vapors, leading to much higher gas yields and lower of bio-oil*, but with better quality. Catalytic pyrolysis of untreated camelina straw exhibited a synergetic effect between both the inorganic matter and the external HZSM-5 catalyst, so that bio-oil* yield was the lowest (20 wt%) due to an extensive deoxygenation (18 wt% oxygen content), which resulted in the highest HHV obtained (37.3 MJ/kgdb). Significant differences were also found on the molecular composition of the bio-oils* with larger proportion of anhydro sugars when the biomass was de-ashed, while HZSM-5 strongly promoted the formation of oxygenated aromatics and aromatic hydrocarbons. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biodiesel production may provide a sustainable route to reduce environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption. In order to minimize environmental impacts of biodiesel production, the chemical process should be optimized to minimize waste generation and energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to design biodiesel chemical reactions and processes using green chemistry and green engineering principles to develop sustainable chemical processes. This study provides the results of the synergistic effect of microwave and ultrasound irradiations to produce biodiesel using ethanol or methanol as the alcohol donor. The biodiesel yields are presented along with their respective green metrics, such as atom economy, environmental factor (E-factor), atom economy (utilization) or atomic efficiency, mass intensity, reaction mass efficiency, atom utilization, and stoichiometric factor. These green metrics are crucial to determine the sustainability and environmental impact of biodiesel production. Evaluation of these green metrics indicates that methanol is a better alternative for biodiesel production provided it is derived from renewable sources. Sustainability indicator concepts used for biodiesel production in this study can be applied to various biofuels and other chemical reaction designs, synthesis and process development. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In-situ hydrodeoxygenation of phenol with aqueous hydrogen donor over supported Ni catalyst was investigated. The supported Ni catalysts exerted very poor performance, if formic acid was used as the hydrogen donor. Catalyst modification by loading K, Na, Mg or La salt could not make the catalyst performance improved. If gaseous hydrogen was used as the hydrogen source the activity of Ni/Al2O3 was pretty high. CO2 was found poisonous to the catalysis, due to the competitive adoption of phenol with CO2. If formic acid was replaced by methanol, the catalyst performance improved remarkably, with major products of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. The better effect of methanol enlightened the application of the supported Ni catalyst in in-situ hydrodeoxygenation of phenol. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The effect of pyrolysis temperature, retention time and inert gas (i.e. N2) flow rate on the conversion of Mahua Press Seed Cake (PSC) into bio-oil was studied in a slow pyrolysis fixed bed batch reactor. The optimum operating conditions for the process were derived using a Response Surface Methodology (RSM). It was found that the highest bio-oil yield (49.25 wt.%) can be achieved at a moderate temperature of 475 °C and a retention time of 45 min. As expected, the bio-oil yield was found to be affected by the reaction temperature. In a GC-MS analysis of the bio-oil, major compounds found were 6-octadecenoic acid, octadecanoic acid and free fatty acids (FFAs). The physicochemical properties of a raw PSC and bio-char were studied using bomb calorimeter, elemental analysis, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy techniques. The heating value of the pyrolytic bio-oil (31.53 MJ/kg) at 475 °C was found to be increased by 46% compared to that of raw PSC (21.592 MJ/kg). The FT-IR analysis indicates that there was a decrease in the number of O-H (hydroxyl), C-H (alkanes) and C-O (primary alcohol) groups and an increase in the number of C=C (aromatics) functional groups with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature. Bio-gas analysis confirmed that, at higher temperatures, higher gas yield with increased CO and CH4 contents was observed. Finally, from the energy balance and economic analysis, it has been confirmed that at the derived optimum operating conditions it is feasible to produce bio-oil from Mahua PSC. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the batch enzymatic production of biodiesel in solvent-free system under ultrasound using as substrates ethanol, soybean oil and macauba fruit oil. For this purpose, a Plackett &amp; Burman experimental design was carried out for soybean oil while a 24−1 design was conducted for macauba oil in order to maximize the biodiesel conversion for each system. Good conversions to fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), 88% for soybean oil and 75.2% for macauba oil, was obtained thus demonstrating the potential use of ultrasound for this reaction system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrogen production from bio-oil, a by-product of the pyrolysis of palm empty fruit bunches, using different reforming processes, i.e., steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR), is theoretically investigated using the actual composition of bio-oil. The effect of the reaction temperature, steam to carbon (S/C) ratio and oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio on the hydrogen production and coke formation of the reformers is analysed. Favourable operating conditions to inhibit carbon formation, to produce low CO concentrations and to achieve high hydrogen yields for the hydrogen production processes coupled with a high-temperature water-gas shift reactor (HT-WGSR) in a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system is also investigated. The results show that an S/C ratio above two is preferred for the bio-oil steam reformer to keep the CO concentration below the maximum allowable limit of the high-temperature PEMFC. However, the CO concentration in the product gas from an HT-WGSR integrated with an autothermal reformer and a partial oxidation reactor is lower than the 5% limit at all temperatures (300–1000 °C), S/C ratios (1–2) and O/C ratios (0.3–1) considered. The efficiency of different bio-oil reforming processes integrated with high-temperature PEMFC systems is studied. The highest system efficiency is achieved from the integrated system consisting of a bio-oil steam reformer, an HT-WGSR and a high-temperature PEMFC with heat integration. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In this study inexpensive, non-toxic, and noble metal free mono- and bimetallic catalysts on activated carbon were tested in liquid phase catalytic furfural hydrotreatment to a potential biofuel component 2-methylfuran. High yields of 2-methylfuran were achieved in the study, the highest yield was achieved with 10 wt-% Ni/C (48.9%) in 120 minutes and good results were obtained also with bimetallic 2/2 wt-% CuNi/C and CuFe/C (yield 44.2 and 41.0%, respectively). These high yields were achieved applying significantly shorter reaction time (60 – 120 min) compared to many published studies. The activity of nickel catalysts was very high resulting eventually in further hydrogenation of 2-methylfuran. With increasing nickel loading also ring-opening and decarbonylation reactions were promoted. Addition of iron to nickel was beneficial for decreasing decarbonylation and other side reactions. Copper/nickel and copper/iron combinations were observed to have beneficial interaction as activity and selectivity to MF increased significantly. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In the late 1850s, Charles Friedel's dry distillation of calcium acetate gave the world a novel route to the commercial production of acetone, a process that would later be referred to as decarboxylative dehydration (ketonization). While the subsequent development of the petrochemical industry made this route to acetone uncompetitive, today there is considerable interest in ketonization as means for converting biomass-derived fatty acids to produce longer-chained ketones, which could serve as precursors to fuels and lubricants. However, the lack of strategies beyond direct hydrogenation of the ketones into hydrocarbons has limited the practical application of ketonization for producing biofuels. We describe here integrated catalytic sequences for converting a range of biomass-derived carboxylic acids, sourced through fermentation of sugars, hydrolysis of lipids, or biomass pyrolysis, to compounds that are fully compatible with the existing energy infrastructure and require minimal hydrogen input. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - To improve microalgae biomass utilization efficiency during biofuel production process, medium-low temperature hydrothermal hydrolysis pretreatment was adopted in this study. The pretreatment kinetic characteristics of concentrated wet microalgae Chlorella vulgaris biomass (50 g/L) under medium-low temperature hydrolysis (100°C-200°C) were experimentally investigated. The hydrothermal hydrolysis kinetics describing the coupled effects of temperature, initial pressure and retention time then were proposed using response surface methodology (RSM). The maximum carbohydrate yield reached 327.3 mg/g dried biomass under initial pressure of 4 MPa at reaction temperature of 150°C for 120 min. The maximum protein yield (321.5 mg/g dried biomass) was obtained under initial pressure of 4 MPa at reaction temperature of 200°C for 60 min. Based on the hydrothermal hydrolysis kinetic models, it was confirmed that temperature was the most important factor affecting both carbohydrate and protein release during hydrothermal hydrolysis process. Hydrothermal initial pressure and retention time were significant to carbohydrate release, but not to protein release. While, lipid was mainly distributed in microalgae residual and almost did not exist in supernatant (about 8.03 mg/g). And with assistance of mixed hexane and methanol (the ratio of hexane to methanol was 7:3), 67.69% of microalgae lipid was extracted out from hydrothermal hydrolysed microalgae residual (123.3 mg/g dried biomass). © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - A new process to produce low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch products from the syngas obtained by supercritical water reforming technology of the bio-oil aqueous phase is developed and analyzed. The process includes four sections: syngas production from supercritical water reforming, syngas upgrading by water–gas-shift and dry reforming reactors as well as pressure swing adsorption systems, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and products refining and upgrading through a distillation columns train and hydrocracking reactor. The aim is to produce maximum biofuels and electrical power, achieving the overall energy self-sufficiency. The energy scheme also involves cogeneration (e.g., hot water for district heating) and removal of CO2 for sequestration. Process simulations were carried out by Aspen Plus. The effect of the main operating parameters (feed concentration and composition, as well as operating conditions of Fischer-Tropsch reactor) on the process performance (carbon efficiency with or without refining, biofuel and electricity production) was studied by a sensitivity analysis. This way, the optimal conditions were found, so for a feeding of 60 t/h with a total organic concentration of 35 wt%, carbon efficiency with refining is 38.5% (4.6 t/h biofuel) and 5.3 MWe is generated. The CO2 for sequestration is 0.50 kg/kg of organic feeding. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study were to efficiently produce fermentable sugars by continuous type supercritical water hydrolysis (SCWH) of Quercus mongolica at the pilot scale with varying acid catalyst loading and to use the obtained sugars for ethanol production. The SCWH of biomass was achieved in under one second (380 °C, 230 bar) using 0.01–0.1% H2SO4. With 0.05% H2SO4, 49.8% of sugars, including glucose (16.5% based on biomass) and xylose monomers (10.8%), were liberated from biomass. The hydrolysates were fermented with S. cerevisiae DXSP and D452-2 to estimate ethanol production. To prepare the fermentation medium, the hydrolysates were detoxified using activated charcoal and then concentrated. The ethanol yield of fermentation with S. cerevisiae DXSP was 14.1% (based on biomass). The proposed system has potential for improvement in yield through process optimization. After further development, it is expected to be a competitive alternative to traditional systems for ethanol production from woody biomass. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A process of much future-potential for upgrading of biofuels derived from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is catalytic hydrotreatment. HTL bio-oil, manufactured from Chlorella microalgae in a reactor operating in continuous flow mode was processed via hydrotreatment using a bio-Pd/C catalyst. This catalyst comprises a bacterial biomass support decorated with Pd(0) nanoparticles. The hydrotreatment performance of commercial Pd/C catalyst and bio-Pd/C was compared in order to benchmark the latter catalyst preparation. Oil:catalyst ratio, time and temperature were investigated as three variables for optimization. Similar conversion was observed for both Pd/C (76% liquid yield, 4.2% O) and bio-Pd/C (77% liquid yield, 3.9% O) catalysts under equivalent conditions (4 h reaction time, 5 wt% Pd loading, 325 °C). The oxygen content was reduced by 65%, whilst the nitrogen content decreased by 35%, with a bio-oil:catalyst ratio of 20, at a temperature of 325 °C and reaction time of 4 h. The upgraded oil was further studied by elemental analysis, Simulated Distillation and GC–MS, in order to quantify the improvement in fuel properties. The fresh and spent catalysts were analyzed using elemental analysis, TGA and ICP-MS, showing that the bio-oil yield was augmented by conversion of the biomass component from bio-Pd/C. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This study introduces a process combining wet in situ transesterification and hydrothermal liquefaction (iTHL) for fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) production from intact microalgae, Nannochloropsis gaditana without catalyst at temperatures higher than 160 °C. It is found that the chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, SolvCl (dichloromethane, chloroform, and dichloroethane (DCE)), enhances the FAEE production by providing hydrogen chloride in an ionized form that can act as an acid catalyst. The SolvCl effect on iTHL is compared to acid catalyst assisted wet in situ transesterification. The most effective solvent is DCE with the FAEE selectivity in biocrude equal to 91.85% (maximum transesterifiable lipid basis). The optimum point for maximizing the FAEE yield is 185.08 °C with 4.69 mL ethanol and 1.98 mL DCE/g of dry algal cells based on the response surface methodology. iTHL with both Nannochloropsis and Chlorella species provides a possibility of the process applicable to the other algal species. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 2-Methylfuran (MF), an environmental-friendly biofuel, has drawn extensive attention from fuel researchers. In this study, the particulate matter (PM) and unregulated emissions of diesel engine were investigated. All experiments were performed in a direct injection compression ignition (DICI) engine fueled with diesel–MF blends (10%, 20% and 30% mass fractions of MF were blended with diesel). The test conditions were a constant speed of 1800 rpm and load from 0.13 to 1.13 MPa brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). Among the tested fuels, the emissions of 1,3-butadiene, benzene and acetaldehyde are all decreased with the increase of engine load except benzene of M30 at 1.13 load. In addition, the diesel–MF blends promote acetaldehyde emissions, but reduce benzene and 1,3-butadiene emissions. At the engine load of 0.38 MPa BMEP, with the increase of MF fraction in blends, more particle numbers for both nucleation mode and accumulation mode are yielded than pure diesel. At 0.88 and 1.13 MPa BMEP, with the increment of MF ratio in blend fuels, the particle numbers rise at small diameter of particle (Dp) (5–10 nm) compared to pure diesel, but decline at large diameter of particle (Dp) (10–250 nm). The increment of MF blending ratio increases the particulate number concentration. Moreover, with the rise of MF mass fraction in the mixtures, the particulate mass concentration decreases gradually at above 0.63 MPa BMEP. However, particulate mass concentration of M30 is the highest at lower loads. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For the design and operation of fixed bed gasifiers the understanding of the occurring physicochemical phenomena is essential. In this work, to study the fluid flow, heat and mass transfer as well as chemical reactions a particle-resolved CFD-model is presented. The two-dimensional approach was validated against experiments and simulations for different conditions were conducted and the resulting local temperatures, species mass fractions and carbon mass flux are discussed. Furthermore, the basic two-dimensional approach is compared to three-dimensional representation of packings considering two different configurations, namely random packed bed and simple cubic packed bed. The random packed bed was generated by a sedimentation utilizing Discrete-Element-Method. Furthermore, conditions which can be found in a British Gas Lurgi (BGL) gasifier were applied to simulate carbon conversion in a packing at a pressure of 40 bar. It was found that the results from the basic model are in good agreement with those of the random packed bed. Furthermore, the 3-d distribution of particles in a bed shows significant influence on the fluid flow, heat and mass transfer which is discussed through the flame length. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An enzyme cluster composite (TPA/GOx) formed from glucose oxidase (GOx) and terephthalaldehyde (TPA) that is coated onto polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is suggested as a new catalyst ([(TPA/GOx)/PEI]/CNT). In this catalyst, TPA promotes inter-GOx links by crosslinking to form a large and porous structure, and the TPA/GOx composite is again crosslinked with PEI/CNT to increase the amount of immobilized GOx. Such a two-step crosslinking (i) increases electron transfer because of electron delocalization by π conjugation and (ii) reduces GOx denaturation because of the formation of strong chemical bonds while its porosity facilitates mass transfer. With these features, an enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) employing the new catalyst is fabricated and induces an excellent maximum power density (1.62 ± 0.08 mW cm−2), while the catalytic activity of the [(TPA/GOx)/PEI]/CNT catalyst is outstanding. This is clear evidence that the two-step crosslinking and porous structure caused by adoption of the TPA/GOx composite affect the performance enhancement of EBC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A non-catalytic method to produce biodiesel in situ from a rice milling by-product, i.e. rice bran, using subcritical water-methanol mixture has been investigated. The method was found to be unaffected by initial moisture and free fatty acids (FFA) contents in rice bran so that no pretreatment was required. The yield and purity of biodiesel were higher under CO2 atmosphere than those under N2 atmosphere due the ability of the gas to acidify water-methanol mixture. Oil extraction from the bran was identified as the limiting step and complete oil extraction could be achieved in 3 h at 200 °C, 4 MPa (under CO2 atmosphere) and 43.8 wt% methanol concentration. Consequently, the highest biodiesel yield was also achieved at those operating conditions. The experimental data suggested that hydrolysis of rice bran oil into FFA followed by methyl-esterification of FFA into biodiesel could be the preferred reaction path to direct transesterification of oil. Subcritical water-methanol mixture was also able to break down complex carbohydrates in rice bran into simple sugars soluble in aqueous phase so that it could be separated easily from biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, we report the first example of using the Al-based porous coordination polymers (Al-PCP) as a template for preparation of nanoporous carbon through a two-step carbonized method. By applying the appropriate carbonized temperature in the first-step carbonization process, both high surface area and large pore volume are realized in the second-step carbonization process even at a high-temperature. The SEM images show that the carbonized Al-PCP before and after HF treatment (PCP) retained mostly crystallite shapes and sponge-like surface morphology. The TEM images of carbonized Al-PCP and PCP clearly exhibited high porosity with a wide range of pore sizes spanning from micro- to macropores. The maximum BET surface area and pore volume were 2773.5 m2 g-1 and 1.885 cm3 g-1, respectively. The obtained highly nanoporous carbon PCPs were used to modify a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) based on glucose oxidase (GOx), resulting in efficient direct electron transfer and excellent bio-catalytic performance. In addition, a glucose/O2 fuel cell constructed using Nafion/GOx/PCP/GCE as the anode and an E-TEK Pt/C modified GCE as the cathode generated a maximum power density of 0.548 mW cm-2 at 0.41 V. The findings in this work may be helpful for exploiting novel nanoporous carbons derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) by using a two-step carbonization method for the immobilization of enzymes in enzymatic biofuel cells or biosensors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Global renewable energy supply is expected to grow in the next three decades to address the issues related to mitigation of atmospheric carbon emissions. Within this scenario, biomass is a renewable resource that, due to its local availability is expected to play a prominent role. Cultivations specifically aimed to biomass production, such as woody short rotation coppices (SRCs), are a promising option for biomass supply in as much as these cultivations are carbon neutral along their life cycle. Nowadays, SRCs are not economically feasible and in the countries where they are implemented on a commercial scale, public subsidies are still needed. We propose that biomass liquefaction can be a possible route for the generation of high valued chemical products and thereby to potentiate the increase of areas allocated to SRCs and at the same time producing a liquid biofuel. By doing so, we believe that a parallel economic cycle can be generated allowing SRCs to be self-sustainable. The work on poplar biomass liquefaction developed so far discloses the high calorific value of bio-oil obtained in comparison with that from fossil fuels. Some preliminary chemical characteristics of the products obtained from liquefaction, are also presented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-processing of bio-oils with conventional petroleum-based feedstocks is an attractive initial option to make use of renewable biomass as a fuel source while leveraging existing refinery infrastructures. However, bio-oils and their processing intermediates have high concentrations of organic oxygenates, which, among their other negative qualities, can result in increased corrosion issues. A range of stainless steel alloys (409, 410, 304L, 316L, 317L, and 201) was exposed at the base of the riser in a fluid catalytic cracking pilot plant while co-processing vacuum gas oil with pine-derived pyrolysis bio-oils that had been catalytically hydrodeoxygenated to ~ 2 to 28% oxygen. A catalyst temperature of 704 °C, a reaction exit temperature of 520 °C, and total co-processing run times of 57–75 h were studied. External oxide scaling 5–30 μm thick and internal attack 1–5 μm deep were observed in these short-duration exposures. The greatest extent of internal attack was observed for co-processing with the least stabilized bio-oil, and more so for types 409, 410, 304L, 316L, 317L stainless steel than for type 201. The internal attack involved porous Cr-rich oxide formation, associated with local Ni-metal enrichment and S-rich nanoparticles, primarily containing Cr or Mn. Implications for alloy selection and corrosion are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In many nations industrial scale AD of non-agricultural waste materials (such as MSW) has not yet reached its full potential, often constrained by the lack of secure, inexpensive, high quality AD feedstocks, and markets for the resulting digestate material. We tested the output material of a high throughput novel industrial process to define its potential as an AD feedstock (based on quality and consistency). This process, designed to circumvent the constraints of source segregation while still generating segregated waste streams, resulted in the production of a temporally homogenous fibrous material with: an average moisture content of 44.2 (±2.33)%; C:N ratio of ∼32.9:1 (±3.46:1), C:P ratio of ∼228:1 and gross calorific value of 17.4 (±0.29) MJ/kg(DM). This material provided a CH4 yield of between 201 and 297 m3 CH4/tonne(DM) (271–401 m3 CH4/tonne(vs)) comparable to commonly used AD feedstocks. Material contaminant levels were temporally consistent (P &gt; 0.05), (average values being Cd 0.63 (±0.19), Cu 56.3 (±7.45), Crtot 51.4 (±4.41), Hg &lt; 0.3, Ni 28.9 (±5.17), Pb 79.2 (±23.71), Zn 202 (±44.5), total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) 2.2 (±0.3), and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) (&lt;0.2) mg/kg(DM)). Calculated digestate contaminant levels were below the median contaminant threshold limits for anaerobic digestates of all countries within the European Union i.e. of Cd 3.35, Cu 535, Crtot 535, Hg 8.15, Ni 185, Pb 397.5, Zn 2100 mg/kg(DM). We suggest that novel high throughput processes that produce high quality AD feedstocks, may have a place in further diversion of waste from landfill. © 2016

AB  - In the present work, a new low-shear rotating reactor concept was introduced for process intensification of heterogeneous catalytic reactions in cocurrent gas–liquid downflow and upflow packed-bed reactors. To properly assess potential advantages of this new reactor concept, exhaustive hydrodynamic experiments were carried out using embedded low-intrusive wire mesh sensors. The effect of the rotational velocity on liquid flow patterns in the bed cross-section, liquid saturation, pressure drop, and regime transition was investigated. Furthermore, liquid residence time and Péclet number estimated by a stimulus-response technique and a macro-mixing model were presented and discussed with respect to the prevailing flow patterns. The results revealed that the column rotation induces different flow patterns in the cross-section of the packed bed operating in a concurrent downflow or upflow mode. Moreover, the new reactor concept exhibits a more flexible adjustment of pressure drop, liquid saturation, liquid residence time, and back-mixing at constant flow rates. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 283–294, 2017. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The thermal stability of bio-oil influences its application in industry and is, therefore, a very important factor that must be taken into consideration. In this study, the stability of low and high molecular weight (Mw) fractions of bio-oil obtained from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of lignin in subcritical water was studied at an elevated temperature (80 °C) for a period of 1 h, 1 day and 1 week. The changes in molecular weight (gel permeation chromatography (GPC)) and chemical composition (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and 2D heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR (18.8 T, DMSO-d6)) of low and high Mw fractions of the HTL bio-oil (i.e. light oil (LO) and heavy oil (HO)) were evaluated before and after ageing. It was found that only a slight formation of high Mw insoluble structures was obtained during ageing at elevated temperature for 1 week: 0.5% for the LO and 3.1% for the HO. These higher Mw moieties might be formed from different polymerisation/condensation reactions of the reactive compounds (i.e. anisoles, guaiacols, phenols, methylene (–CH2–) groups in phenolic dimers and xanthene). The high Mw insolubles in both the LO and the HO were analysed for structural composition using 2D HSQC NMR to obtain a better understanding of the changes in the composition of bio-oil fractions during the accelerated ageing process. In addition, a chemical shift database in DMSO-d6 was analysed for a subset of phenolic model compounds to simplify the interpretation of the 2D HSQC NMR spectra. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Research in Enzymatic Biofuel cells (EBFCs) has evolved during the last decade. However, challenges, such as cost and endurance are the bottlenecks in harnessing their commercialization potential. To overcome these challenges, low cost, readily available pencil leads of various grades modified with polyaniline (PANI) and multi walled carbon nano tubes (MWCNT) have been examined as EBFC biocathode. Total four pencils of various grades (B, H, 3H, and 5H) were used to fabricate biocathode by covalently immobilizing Laccase(Lac) enzyme on to MWCNT coated (BC1) and electrodeposited polyaniline and MWCNT coated (BC2) on the surface of pencil graphite electrodes (PGEs). The fabricated biocathodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET surface area and conductivity measurements and electrochemical analysis was performed by the Open circuit potential (OCP) and Cyclic voltammetry (CV). Among the pencils tested in this work, the 5H pencil coated with PANI/MWCNT/Lacexhibited highest current density of 1209.23 μA/cm2 with OCP of 0.528 V. Moreover, the PANI/MWCNT/Lac modified PGEs showed significant enhancement (80%) in electrochemical behavior when compared with unmodified (bare) and MWCNT/Lac coated PGE. Both types of Bioelectrodes (PGE/MWCNT/Lac,PGE/PANI/MWCNT/Lac) showed good stability and maximum conservation of its activity during the experiments. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - New laccase-based catalysts to improve oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are described, and enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs) adopting these catalysts were developed. These new catalysts are synthesized by combining laccase, poly(ethylenimine) and carbon nanotubes, with attachment of selected elements using the crosslinker, glutaraldehyde (GA). Several characterization approaches are implemented to evaluate catalytic electron transfer in both the absence and presence of mediators and their effects on glucose/O2 biofuel cell performance. [CNT/Lac/PEI/Lac]/GA shows that the best electron transfer rate constants (ks) achieved, in the presence as well as the absence of a mediator, are 8.6 and 1.8 s−1. Additionally, [CNT/Lac/PEI/Lac]/GA results in high performance of Maximum Power Density with a value of 0.2 mW cm−2. Its relative stability can be maintained up to 83.76% with relative efficiency up to 84.73%, while CNT/Lac gives the lowest performance levels. This indicates that GA induces an improvement in catalytic activity by (i) increasing the amount of immobilized laccase and (ii) strengthening interaction between laccase and PEI. Therefore, it induces excellent redox reactivity, promoting the ORR, and glucose/O2 biofuel cell performance. The effect of pH on catalytic activity is also measured, with pH 5 being optimal. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The O2 reactivity of flavoproteins and particularly, glucose oxidase, is a limitation for numerous biotechnological applications, and this has been the subject of intense research. In the present study, we performed site-directed mutations on Val464 of GOx from Penicilium amagasakiense and combined steady-state, rapid kinetics and electrochemistry to investigate the effect of such mutations on the O2 reactivity. We propose that replacing the non-polar Valine with a polar Serine permits to decrease the diffusion/stabilization of O2 near the active redox center without altering the oxidation of glucose. When incorporated in osmium hydrogels, the resulting electrodes were insensitive to O2 in the 0.5–60 mM glucose concentration range and were 4.7 times more stable under continuous operation than similar electrodes made with the native GOx. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in which O2 sensitivity in GOx can be significantly decrease without altering the electrochemical efficiency for glucose oxidation. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The rectangular flake-like mesoporous NiCo2O4 (meso-NiCo2O4) catalysts were first used in glucose bio-sensing and glucose biofuel cell (GBFC) as an enzyme mimic simultaneously. The meso-NiCo2O4 displayed excellent catalytic capability to glucose including a super-fast response time (within 1 s), a super-high sensitivity (662.31 μA (mmol L−1)−1 cm−2), and a super-low detection limit (0.3 nmol L−1 at S/N = 3) on the sensor. On the other hand, meso-NiCo2O4 provided great values in GBFC as anode material with an open circuit voltage of 0.63 V, a maximum power density of 0.092 mW cm−2, and a limiting current density of 1.3 mA cm−2, respectively. The preeminent catalytic abilities may be attributed to the large specific surface area resulting from the mesoporous structure and the surpassing intrinsic catalytic activity of NiCo2O4 itself. These significant findings may promote the development of the supersensitive detection of glucose and will undoubtedly widen the catalytic materials for biofuel cell electrodes. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Biomass is normally processed using acidic or basic catalysts, which both have their drawbacks. One suitable alternative is the application of hydrolytic enzymes that can convert biomass into simpler molecules, which can be fermented and processed into biofuel. Hydrolytic enzymes include proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, mannanases, chitinases, and xylanases. To discover sources of these enzymes, 19 halophilic strains of microorganisms that are significantly resistant to high salt concentrations were analyzed. The objective of this research was to identify halophilic microorganisms that produce the target enzymes with high activities, and to characterize these enzymes according to their salt tolerances. The results obtained indicated that Pseudolateromonas phenolica, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudoalteromonas peptidolytica, Halomonas socia, Marinobacter maritimus, and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum strain 2 produced the highest protease, lipase, amylase, cellulase, mannanase, chitinase, and xylanase relative activities, respectively. Except for protease from P. phenolica, all the enzymes tested for salt resistance either maintained or increased their activities with increasing NaCl concentration. © 2017, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The effect of O2 content in the oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of raw bio-oil has been studied, and the kinetic behavior, particularly deactivation, has been compared between two catalysts (Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 and Rh/CeO2-ZrO2). The experiments have been carried out in an apparatus with two steps in series: (1) thermal treatment (at 500°C, for the controlled deposition of pyrolytic lignin) and (2) catalytic in-line reforming in a fluidized bed. The reaction conditions have been as follows: oxygen/carbon ratio (O/C), 0, 0.17, 0.34, and 0.67; 700°C; steam/carbon ratio (S/C), 6; space time, 0.3 gcatalysth/gbio-oil (for Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3) and 0.15 gcatalysth/gbio-oil (for Rh/CeO2-ZrO2); time on stream, 4 h. The content and morphology of the coke deposited on the catalysts has been determined by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), and the deterioration of the metallic properties of the catalysts by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results (bio-oil conversion, product yield and their evolution with time on stream) show that for Rh/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst the decrease in coke deposition as O/C ratio is increased involves attenuation of catalyst deactivation. Consequently, this catalyst is stable after 24 h operation for high O/C ratios, thus keeping constant the activity for reforming reactions and the WGS reaction, with a high yield of H2 and low yields of CO, CH4, and hydrocarbons. However, for the Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst of lower activity than the Rh/CeO2-ZrO2, the decrease in coke content as O/C ratio is increased does not involve a noticeable attenuation in catalyst deactivation, which is due to Ni sintering. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuels and hike in crude oil prices were some of the main reasons to explore new alternatives from renewable source of energy. This work presents the impact of various bowl geometries on diesel engine with diesel and biodiesel samples. Three non-edible oils were selected, namely pumpkin seed oil, orange oil and neem oil. These oils were converted into respective biodiesel using transesterification process in the presence of catalyst and alcohol. After transesterification process, the oils were termed as pumpkin seed oil methyl ester (PSOME), orange oil methyl ester (OME) and neem oil methyl ester (NOME), respectively. The engine used for experimentation was a single-cylinder four-stroke water-cooled direct-injection diesel engine and loads were applied to the engine using eddy current dynamometer. Two bowl geometries were developed, namely toroidal combustion chamber (TCC) and trapezoidal combustion chamber (TRCC). Also, the engine was inbuilt with hemispherical combustion chamber (HCC). The base line readings were recorded using neat diesel fuel with HCC for various loads. Followed by 20% of biodiesel mixed with 80% neat diesel for all prepared methyl esters and termed as B1 (20% PSOME with 80% diesel), B2 (20% OME with 80% diesel) and B3 (20% NOME with 80% diesel). All fuel samples were tested in HCC, TCC and TRCC bowl geometries under standard injection timing and with compression ratio of 18. Increased brake thermal efficiency and reduced brake specific fuel consumption were observed with diesel in TCC geometry. Also, higher heat release and cylinder pressures with lower ignition delay were recorded with TCC bowl geometry. TCC bowl geometry showed lower CO, HC and smoke emissions with B2 fuel sample than diesel and other biodiesel samples. But, higher NOx emission was observed in HCC and TCC than that in TRCC bowl geometry. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In order to reduce the CO2 produced from the combustion of fossil fuel, bioethanol produced from biomass can serve as an alternative fuel. Rice husk, known as a widely available lignocellulosic biomass and one of the most prominent agricultural residues would be a suitable alternative. For producing bioethanol and improving enzymatic hydrolysis, this study successfully pretreated rice husk using ammonium carbonate solution. The maximum glucan digestibility yield of the pretreated rice husk was 67.7% and 65.7% respectively, with 20% and 25% ammonium carbonate solution with 10 FPU/g glucan loading of a commercial cellulase enzyme for 72 h 10.61 g/L ethanol concentration was achieved from 20% ammonium carbonate pretreated rice husk in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process under anaerobic condition at 37 °C with Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 3 days. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As part I of two companion papers, the present paper evaluates the economic feasibility of hydrocarbon biofuel production via two pathways: a one-step production pathway through fast pyrolysis of biomass followed by the catalytic upgrade of bio-oil to a liquid hydrocarbon biofuel and a novel two-step pathway that includes a torrefaction pretreatment step prior to fast pyrolysis and then the catalytic upgrade. These two pathways were modeled using Aspen Plus to process 1000 dry metric tons/day of feed through the fast pyrolysis unit operating at 530 °C whereas torrefaction for the two-step pathway was investigated at three different torrefaction temperatures of 290, 310, and 330 °C. Three scenarios of producing process heat from natural gas, internal byproducts biochar supplemented with natural gas, and torrefaction condensate were investigated, with additional heat integration considered. Minimum selling price ranged from $4.01/gal to $4.78/gal for the heat-integrated processes whereas the price ranged from $4.70/gal to $6.84/gal without heat integration. Analysis indicated that a one-step pathway and a two-step pathway with torrefaction taking place at 290 °C yielded comparable least minimum selling price and it increased with increasing torrefaction temperature. Sensitivity analysis showed that the yield of hydrocarbon biofuel, total project investment, and internal rate of return have the greatest impact. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study, as part II of two companion papers, investigated the environmental performance of liquid hydrocarbon biofuel production via fast pyrolysis of pine through two pathways: a one-step pathway via fast pyrolysis only, and a two-step pathway that includes a torrefaction step prior to fast pyrolysis. Fast pyrolysis in all cases took place at a temperature of 530 °C whereas for the two-step pathways, torrefaction was investigated at temperatures of 290, 310, and 330 °C. Bio-oil produced was then catalytically upgraded to hydrocarbon biofuel. Different scenarios for providing the required process heat either by using fossil energy or renewable energy, as well as the effect of heat integration, were also investigated. Our life cycle analysis indicated that using the energy allocation approach, a two-step heat integrated pathway with torrefaction taking place at 330 °C had the lowest global warming potential among all scenarios of about 29.0 g CO2 equiv/MJ biofuel. Using the system expansion approach, significantly higher reductions in GHG emissions of about 56 to 265% relative to conventional gasoline were observed for the heat integrated processes. More modest percentage reduction in emissions of about 34 to 67% was observed across all scenarios using the energy allocation approach. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Conversions of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural as model components in bio-oil were investigated over Ni–Cu/C catalyst with formic acid as hydrogen donor in isopropanol solvent to produce biofuels. The effects of reaction temperature, feed ratio, and reaction time were studied. A high yield of 2-methylfuran up to 91 mol% was obtained from furfural in 8 h at 200°C, and under same conditions 80 mol% yield of 2,5-dimethylfuran could also be obtained from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in 6 h. The results verified the catalyst performance and the availability of the reaction conditions for producing biofuels from furan derivatives. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuels are considered as eco-friendly fuels and can readily replace fossil fuels while helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable rural development. Although Algeria is an oil producer and exporter, the development of renewable energies is a strategic goal for public authorities, which are giving new impetus to this sector to replace the fossil energy resources of which are becoming increasingly scarce. In this context, the life-cycle assessment (LCA) of a second-generation biodiesel derived from Ricinus communis feedstock is undertaken. LCA is a tool that can be used effectively in evaluating various renewable energy sources for their sustainability and can help policy makers to choose the optimal energy source for specific purpose. The life cycle of Castor bean-based biodiesel production includes the stages of cultivation, oil extraction, and biodiesel production. The impact categories studied were global warming, Energy return-on-energy investment (EROEI), human health, and ecosystem. We have used the impact 2002 + evaluation method which is implemented in the SimaPro© software package. Moreover, it is the most useful method for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. Results show that among all the production stages, the cultivation process of Ricinus communis and the conversion of oil to biodiesel are the largest contributors to most of environmental impact categories. Life-cycle analysis revealed that the use of castor for biodiesel production could have many advantages like an energy return-on-energy investment (EROEI) of 2.60 and a positive contribution to climate-change reduction as revealed by a positive carbon balance. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Emissions from diesel engines have been considered as major air pollution sources. The blending of feedstocks is motivated by the desire to enhance the properties and reduce the cost of biofuels. In this study, a rubber seed/palm oil mixture at equal blend ratios was used to produce biodiesel. The effects of irreverent parameters on transesterification were studied using the response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the maximum yield. Methyl ester at optimized conditions was produced, and its thermophysical properties were studied. Methyl ester effect on the emissions and performance of an unmodified indirect injection diesel engine (IDI) at partial and full load was examined. The results showed that the torque and brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) were 1.1 and 1 % lower than diesel fuel, respectively. Compared to diesel fuel, power and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) were 1.1 and 1.3 % lower, respectively, and the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was 1.4 % higher at full load. CO was also reduced by 2 % while CO2, NOx, and exhaust temperature increased on average by 1, 1.2, and 1.1 %, respectively. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Diffusion of biomass pyrolysis vapors and their upgraded products is an essential catalytic property of zeolites during catalytic fast pyrolysis and likely plays a critical role in the selectivity of these catalysts. Characterizing the diffusivities of representative biofuel molecules is critical to understand shape selectivity and interpret product distribution. Yet, experimental measurements on the diffusivities of oxygenated biofuel molecules at pyrolysis temperatures are very limited in the literature. As an alternative approach, we conducted MD simulations to measure the diffusion coefficients of several selected molecules that are representative of biomass pyrolysis vapors, namely water, methanol, glycolaldehyde, and toluene in H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The results show the diffusion coefficients calculated via MD simulations are consistent with available NMR measurements at room temperature.1 The effect of molecular weight and molecular critical diameter on the diffusivity among the chosen model compounds is also examined. Furthermore, we have characterized the diffusivities of representative biofuel molecules, namely xylene isomers, in H-ZSM-5. Our calculations determined that the ratio of the diffusion coefficients for xylene isomers is pxylene: o-xylene:m-xylene ≈ 83:3:1 at 700 K. Additionally, our results also demonstrate the different diffusivity between p-xylene and toluene is due to the molecular orientations when the molecules diffuse along the channels in H-ZSM-5 and provide deep insight into the effect of molecular orientation on its diffusivity. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Isobutanol is an ideal gasoline replacement due to its high energy density, suitable octane number and compatibility with current engine technology. It can be formed by the Guerbet reaction in which (bio)ethanol and methanol mixtures are converted to this higher alcohol in the presence of a suitable catalyst under basic conditions. A possible limitation of this process is the catalyst's water tolerance; a twofold problem given that water is produced as a by-product of the Guerbet reaction but also due to the need to use anhydrous alcoholic feedstocks, which contributes significantly to the cost of advanced biofuel production. Isobutanol formation with pre-catalyst trans-[RuCl2(dppm)2] (1) has been shown to be tolerant to the addition of water to the system, achieving an isobutanol yield of 36% at 78% selectivity with water concentrations typical of that of a crude fermentation broth. Key to this success is both the catalyst's tolerance to water itself and the use of a hydroxide rather than an alkoxide base; other catalysts explored are less effective with hydroxides. Alcoholic drinks have also been used as surrogates for the fermentation broth: the use of lager as the ethanol source yielded 29% isobutanol at 85% selectivity in the liquid phase. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Hydroconversion of soybean oils to aviation fuel-like hydrocarbons was investigated over aggregated hierarchical ZSM-5 microspheres composed of small ZSM-5 nanoparticles, which were synthesized via a hydrothermal method by controlling the Si/Al ratio with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the template. The prepared ZSM-5 microspheres were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and desorption (N2-BET) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A low Si/Al ratio resulted in small-sized seed crystals, which then grew into ZSM-5 microspheres through 3D island growth. A high Si/Al ratio resulted in the opposite growth behavior and was prone to forming well-formed individual "classic-boat" ZSM-5 by 2D layer growth. The CNTs acted not only as a mesopore template, but also as a cage to offer suitable space making the ZSM-5 grow into the nanoparticles and form microspheres. The obtained ZSM-5 microspheres had a uniform size (2-3 μm) with a hierarchical structure containing intracrystalline and intercrystalline mesopores. The spherical ZSM-5 zeolites supporting a NiMo catalyst showed high activity and selectivity toward hydroconversion of soybean oil to aviation-like biofuel (C9-C15 hydrocarbons). © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The incorporation of hydrodynamics in an industrial wall-cooled packed bed reactor model is essential to describe the performance of highly exothermic oxidation reactions. Although the conventional hydrodynamic approach (CHA), Navier-Stokes equations coupled to Darcy-Forchheimer terms, has been the most used approximation to describe velocity profiles in these packed bed reactors, it is itself inconsistent and the computation time for its numerical solution, when coupled to the reactor model, is still demanding. This work is aimed at developing a practical but reliable hydrodynamic approach (PHA) to describe velocity profiles in packed bed reactors presenting a low tube to particle diameter ratio. In this approach, velocity profiles are described at the core and close to the wall of the reactor. The core model makes use of the Darcy-Forchheimer equation (DFE), and the wall model makes use of Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) using an effective viscosity to account for turbulence. The PHA predicts similar results to those obtained by the CHA and properly fits velocity observations from packed beds with a tube to particle diameter ratio (dt/dp) ranging from 3 to 6. The PHA allows the estimation of both turbulent viscosity (μt) involved in the viscous term of the NSE and parameters influencing viscous (α) and inertial (β) flow resistances in Darcy and Forchheimer terms, respectively. Then, hydrodynamics is coupled to a heat transport model accounting for conductive anisotropy to fit temperature observations in absence of reaction from a pilot-scale packed bed reactor with a dt/dp = 3.048. Hydrodynamics and heat transfer results are, then, transferred to a pseudo heterogeneous reactor model to simulate the behavior of a novel technology to perform the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on a multimetallic MoVNbTeO formulation. This is the first study modeling this reactor system accounting for hydrodynamics, information that is essential for its conceptual design in future studies. Finally, it is worth stressing that the PHA, coupled to the heat transport model or the reactor model, leads to significantly lower computation times than the CHA, which is attributed to the analytical rather than numerical solution of the former. © 2017

AB  - To seek a sustainable way of CO2 sequestration and conversion, enzymatic electrosynthesis (EES) of formate from CO2 reduction has been investigated in a hybrid biofuel cell system. In an enzymatic fuel cell (EFC), waste CO2 species are specifically reduced to energy-rich product of formate under mild biological conditions. Efficient formate production can be achieved at lowered electrode potential owing to the electrochemically active participation of formate dehydrogenase (CbFDH) as a biocatalyst. Electropolymerized neutral red (PolyNR) is proven to be a promising modifier to enhance the electrochemical behavior of enzymatic electrode, as well as a reducing reagent to regenerate mediator of NADH in enzymatic CO2 reduction. Electrons for EES are extracted from the organic pollutants in wastewater by microbial fuel cell (MFC) stacks arranged in series and/or parallel with different unit numbers (n = 1, 2 and 3). The maximum formate production rate reaches around 60 mg L−1 h−1 with a Faraday efficiency of 70% in the EFC powered by a three-MFC stacked in series. In view of practical applications, the hybrid MFC-EFC system has been demonstrated to be advantageous in both product specificity and energy sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We selected acetic acid and sulfuric acid as liquid acid catalysts to investigate their performance on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae major model components, including polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides-proteins mixture. The aim of this study was to understand the catalytic effects of liquid acid catalysts as well as the formation process mechanisms and properties of the bio-oils from HTL of algae. We also used the two acids in HTL process of Chlorella vulgaris to estimate their catalytic performances in algae and compare this performance with the results from HTL of model components. Product distributions from different catalytic conditions were compared with blank results. Bio-oils were analyzed by elemental analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the addition of acetic acid or sulfuric acid had no positive effect on the enhancement of bio-oil yield from HTL of individual algae major model components; however, the use of liquid acid catalysts could prevent the detrimental effect of interaction between polysaccharides and proteins on bio-oil yield. H/C ratios and higher heating values (HHVs) of bio-oils obtained from HTL of algae major model components increased significantly in the presence of acid catalysts. Sulfuric acid favored the oxygen removal process, and acetic acid reduced the nitrogen content in bio-oil from HTL of proteins. GC–MS results showed that bio-oil composition was greatly altered when adding acids. The light component proportion of catalytic upgraded bio-oils was significantly higher than that of bio-oils obtained with no catalyst. The results of HTL of Chlorella vulgaris with acid catalysts indicate that both acids favor to the hydrolysis of cellulose; therefore, the use of acid catalysts could accelerate the formation of bio-oil from cellular components. The difference between the HTL of algae major model components and real algae using acid catalysts was probably due to the complexity of algae structure. © 2017

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of biomass produces a liquid product consisting of organic and aqueous streams. The organic stream is typically slated for hydrotreating to produce hydrocarbon biofuels, while the aqueous stream is considered a waste stream, resulting in the loss of residual biogenic carbon. Here, we report the detailed characterization and catalytic conversion of a CFP wastewater stream with the ultimate aim to improve overall biomass utilization within a thermochemical biorefinery. An aqueous stream derived from CFP of beech wood was comprehensively characterized, quantifying 53 organic compounds to a total of 17 wt % organics. The most abundant classes of compounds were acids, aldehydes, and alcohols. The most abundant components identified in the aqueous stream were C1-C2 organics, comprising 6.40% acetic acid, 2.16% methanol, and 1.84% formaldehyde on wet basis. The CFP aqueous stream was catalytically upgraded to olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons using a Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst at 500 °C. When the conversion yield of the upgraded products was measured with fresh, active catalyst, 33% of the carbon in the aqueous stream was recovered as aromatic hydrocarbons and 29% as olefins. The majority of the experiments were conducted using a molecular beam mass spectrometer, and separate GC-MS/FID experiments were used to confirm the assignments and quantification of products with fresh excess catalyst. The recovered 62% carbon in the form of olefins and aromatics can be used to make coproducts and/or fuels potentially improving biorefinery economics and sustainability. Spent catalysts were collected after exposure to varying amounts of the feed, and were characterized using multipoint-Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to monitor deactivation of Ga/HZSM-5. These characterization data revealed that deactivation was caused by coke deposits, which blocked access to active sites of the catalyst, and spent catalysts regained total activity after regeneration. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cladophora glomerata algal oil is extracted using modified Soxhlet extraction method. Maximum oil percentage is found to be 18 w/w% from methanol-chloroform solvent mixtures at 65°C for a time extent of 3.5 h. The parameters such as dryness of biomass, extraction time, choice of solvent, and use of co-solvent along with primary solvent are optimized in order to enhance the yield of bio oil production. The algal oil functional groups and composition are characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Further, basic fuel properties were determined to characterize oil quality of the algal oil according to ASTM, AOCS, and IS/ISO standards. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Synthesis of biodiesel from a non-edible source as Pistacia khinjuk seed oil via ultrasonic cavitation (UC) system is reported in this study. A heterogeneous catalyst sulphated tin oxide impregnated with silicon dioxide (SO42-/SnO2–SiO2) was employed during the transesterification reaction in an UC reactor. Parametric optimisation results revealed the maximum Pistacia khinjuk methyl ester (PiKME) yield was 88 wt.% at reaction time of 50 min, amplitude of 50%, catalyst amount of 3.5 wt.% and molar ratio of 13:1 (alcohol:oil). Performance of UC at optimised values was compared with mechanical stirring (MS). UC proved advantageous over MS with 3 times more time efficient. Hence, the superiority of UC over MS was established. About 3.2 fold higher reaction rate constant using UC (0.029 min−1) compared to MS (0.009 min−1). PiKME production via UC can potentially subsidise the overall cost of production by having 3.2 fold higher reaction rate constant than MS. PiKME met most of the fuel properties enlisted in EN14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water fractions derived from biofuel production contain oxygenated hydrocarbons that can be converted by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) into hydrogen. As a result, the product efficiency of biorefineries may improve. However, the hydrothermal and high pressure operating conditions of APR limit the reaction kinetics, thermodynamics and catalyst stability. To overcome these limitations, an active and durable catalyst should be developed to selectively convert oxygenated hydrocarbons into hydrogen. For this study, methanol was selected as a model compound. Nickel-based catalysts with dopants such as copper and cerium and different supports were tested for the APR of methanol. The results revealed enhanced performance of doped catalysts in comparison to monometallic materials, and the effect of supports improved in the order α-Al2O3 &lt; β-SiC &lt; ZrO2 &lt; γ-Al2O3. Accordingly, NiCe/γ-Al2O3 exhibited the highest values of methanol conversion and hydrogen yield. These results satisfied the target of this study to develop an active and hydrogen-selective catalyst and proved the suitability of cerium-doped nickel on alumina to convert methanol into hydrogen. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biological reduction of CO2 driven by sunlight via photosynthesis is a crucial process for life on earth. However, the conversion efficiency of solar energy to biomass by natural photosynthesis is low. This translates in bioproduction processes relying on natural photosynthesis that are inefficient energetically. Recently, hybrid photosynthetic technologies with the potential of significantly increasing the efficiency of solar energy conversion to products have been developed. In these systems, the reduction of CO2 into biofuels or other chemicals of interest by biocatalysts is driven by solar energy captured with inorganic devices such as photovoltaic cells or photoelectrodes. Here, we explore hybrid photosynthesis and examine the strategies being deployed to improve this biotechnology. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The hydroconversion of waste cooking oil into hydrocarbon fuel was investigated over the hierarchical USY zeolite-supported NiMo catalysts which were prepared by dealumination ((NH4)2SiF6)/desilication (NaOH). The physical and acidity properties of the hierarchical catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The Brønsted/Lewis (B/L) acid distribution was little affected by dealumination and the acid density decreased significantly. However, the highly-desilicated catalysts decreased the B/L ratio obviously. Therefore, many more Mo species in the NiMoO4− and MoO3 phases were produced in the AHFS-treated catalysts, while more high-valence-state Mo species in the NiMoO4− phase were formed in the NaOH-treated catalysts. The AHFS-treated catalysts showed higher catalytic activity and better DCO2 selectivity and selective cracking for jet fuel. The 42.3% selectivity of jet fuel and 13.5% selectivity of jet-range aromatics was achieved over the 8 wt % (NH4)2SiF6-treated catalyst with 67% DCO2 selectivity. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis bio-oils possess unfavorable physicochemical properties and poor stability, in large part, owing to the presence of carboxylic acids, which hinders their use as biofuels. Catalytic esterification offers an atom- and energy-efficient route to upgrade pyrolysis bio-oils. Propyl sulfonic acid (PrSO3H) silicas are active for carboxylic acid esterification but suffer mass-transport limitations for bulky substrates. The incorporation of macropores (200 nm) enhances the activity of mesoporous SBA-15 architectures (post-functionalized by hydrothermal saline-promoted grafting) for the esterification of linear carboxylic acids, with the magnitude of the turnover frequency (TOF) enhancement increasing with carboxylic acid chain length from 5 % (C3) to 110 % (C12). Macroporous–mesoporous PrSO3H/SBA-15 also provides a two-fold TOF enhancement over its mesoporous analogue for the esterification of a real, thermal fast-pyrolysis bio-oil derived from woodchips. The total acid number was reduced by 57 %, as determined by GC×GC–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC–ToFMS), which indicated ester and ether formation accompanying the loss of acid, phenolic, aldehyde, and ketone components. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Internal combustion engine emissions belong among the major anthropogenic sources of air pollution in urban areas. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there is sufficient evidence of the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust in human beings. Although alternative fuels, mainly biodiesel, have recently become popular, little is still known about the genotoxicity of emissions from these fuels. We analysed DNA damage expressed as the frequency of micronuclei (MN) in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), induced by extractable organic matter (EOM; tested concentrations: 1, 10 and 25 μg/ml) obtained from particle emissions from various blends of biodiesel with diesel fuels (including neat diesel fuel (B0), a blend of 70% B0 and 30% biodiesel (B30) and neat biodiesel (B100)). We also tested the effect of selected diesel exhaust organic/genotoxic components [benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) concentrations: 25, 100 and 200 μM; 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) concentrations: 1, 5 and 10 μM; 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) concentrations: 1, 5 and 50 μM]. The cells were treated with the compounds for 28 and 48 hr. Our results showed that most of the tested compounds (except for the 25 μM B[a]P, 28-hr treatment) significantly increased MN frequency. The genotoxicity of EOMs from the engine emissions of diesel and biodiesel engines was comparable. Both nitro-PAH compounds demonstrated higher genotoxic potential in comparison with B[a]P. Considering our results and due to increasing popularity of alternative fuels, it is prudent that the potential genotoxic effects of various fuels are investigated across engine technologies and operating conditions in a relevant model system. © 2016 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is one of the most important and versatile biomass-derived platform chemicals for the synthesis of a wide range of industrial chemicals, including biofuels. HMF can be obtained by dehydration of glucose with acid catalysts. The conversion proceeds through two steps, that is, glucose–fructose isomerization and dehydration of fructose to HMF. During the first step, water plays an important role as a proton shuttle to promote the reaction and reduce the energy barriers, which results in the acceleration of the reaction. Besides, water can also block the side reaction. The role of water joining and catalyzing the reaction is further proved by experimental findings, that is, by using DMSO/D2O as solvent deuterium was found at C1 of HMF from NMR analysis. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The role of solvents in the conversion of oleic acid over Pt/C was studied. Three solvent systems (solvent-free, water, and dodecane systems) were employed for the conversion of oleic acid over Pt/C at 350°C. Decarboxylation, hydrogen transfer, and aromatization were observed in these three reaction systems. In comparison to the non-solvent reaction system, much slower decarboxylation and aromatization rates and fewer heptadecane and aromatic products were observed in the hydrothermal and dodecane reaction systems. The decarboxylation and aromatization rates and yields of heptadecane and aromatics decreased with increased dodecane loading in the dodecane reaction system, and the decarboxylation and aromatization rates and yields of heptadecane and aromatics significantly decreased with the increase of water in the hydrothermal reaction system. The effects of solvent loading, catalyst loading, and reaction time on the reactions (decarboxylation, hydrogen transfer, and aromatization) were investigated. The reaction behaviors of 1-heptadecene with different solvents were studied, and N2 adsorption-desorption and thermogravimetric analysis of fresh and spent Pt/C in the three reaction systems were also performed. The results indicate that the competition of dodecane for the Pt/C active sites is mainly responsible for the slow decarboxylation and aromatization rates. In addition to the similar influencing factor to that in the dodecane system, H+ released from water and hydrogen bonding, which inhibited the ionization of carboxyl groups, was the key influencing factor for the slower decarboxylation and aromatization rates obtained under hydrothermal conditions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) and (bio)ethylene are converted into biofuel with an evenly rising boiling point curve, which fulfills the strict boiling specifications prescribed by the fuel standard EN 590 for modern (petro)diesel engines. Catalyzed by a Pd/Ru system, RME undergoes isomerizing metathesis in a stream of ethylene gas, leading to a defined olefin, monoester, and diester blend. This innovative refining concept requires negligible energy input (60°C) and no solvents and does not produce waste. It demonstrates that the pressing challenge of increasing the fraction of renewables in engine fuel may be addressed purely chemically rather than by motor engineering.

AB  - Biofuel cells based on electrocatalytic oxidation of NADH and reduction of H2O2 have been prepared using carbon fiber electrodes functionalized with graphene nano-flakes. The electrochemical oxidation of NADH was catalyzed by Meldola's blue (MB), while the reduction of H2O2 was catalyzed by hemin, both catalysts were adsorbed on the graphene flakes due to their π-π staking. In the next set of experiments, the MB- and hemin-electrodes were additionally modified with glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and glucose oxidase (GOx), respectively. The enzyme catalyzed reactions in the presence of glucose, NAD+ and O2 resulted in the production of NADH and H2O2 in situ. The produced NADH and H2O2 were oxidized and reduced, respectively, at the bioelectrocatalytic electrodes, thus producing voltage and current generated by the biofuel cell. The enzyme-based biofuel cells operated in a human serum solution modelling an implantable device powered from the natural biofluid. Finally, two enzyme-based biofuel cell connected in series and operating in the serum solution produced electrical power sufficient for activation of an electronic watch used as an example device. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Nanoporous gold (NPG) structures, which possess abundant high-index facets, kinks, and steps, have been demonstrated as effective catalysts for the glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells. Herein, we designed surface-clean NPG structures with high-index facets by a trisodium citrate (Na3Cit) self-initiated reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) in a water-ice bath followed by a kinetically controlled self-assembly manner. This strategy breaks through the traditional trisodium citrate thermal-reducing chloroauric acid approach where solutions are required to heat to a certain temperature for the reaction to initiate. However, herein, the surface-clean NPG structures yielded highly enhanced catalytic activity in glucose electrooxidation with approximately 9 A cm−2 mg−1 current density, which is over 20 times higher than that of Au nanoparticles devised by Turkevich (Turkevich-Au NPs) under the same conditions. This remarkable electrocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the large electrochemically active surface area, clean surface, and high-index facets or highly active sites of the porous structure. The employment of the surface-clean NPG with high-index facets for glucose electrooxidation promises a substantial improvement in the current biofuel cell technology and indicates the potential of biofuel cells in practical applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis and catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of biomass produce a liquid product stream comprised of various classes of organic compounds having different molecule size and polarity. This liquid, either spontaneously in the case of catalytic fast pyrolysis or by water addition for the noncatalytic process separates into a nonpolar organic-rich fraction and a highly polar water-rich fraction. The organic fraction can be used as a blendstock or feedstock for further processing in a refinery while, in the CFP process design, the aqueous phase is currently sent to wastewater treatment, which results in a loss of residual biogenic carbon present in this stream. This work focuses on the catalytic conversion of the biogenic carbon in pyrolysis aqueous phase streams to produce hydrocarbons using a vertical microreactor coupled to a molecular beam mass spectrometer (MBMS). The MBMS provides real-time analysis of products while also tracking catalyst deactivation. The catalyst used in this work was HZSM-5, which upgraded the oxygenated organics in the aqueous fraction from noncatalytic fast pyrolysis of oak wood to fuels comprising small olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons. During processing of the aqueous bio-oil fraction, the HZSM-5 catalyst exhibited higher activity and coke resistance than those observed in similar experiments using biomass or whole bio-oils. Reduced coking is likely due to ejection of coke precursors from the catalyst pores that was enhanced by excess process water available for steam stripping. The water reacted with coke precursors to form phenol, methylated phenols, naphthol, and methylated naphthols. Conversion data shows that up to 40 wt % of the carbon in the feed stream is recovered as hydrocarbons. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) is a fuel octane enhancer considered as a major bio-fuel in Europe. Blended with gasoline fuels, ETBE improves fuel combustion and reduces toxic hydrocarbon emissions. ETBE industrial synthesis leads to an azeotropic mixture EtOH/ETBE (20/80 wt%), which cannot be separated by simple distillation. According to former works, cellulose acetate (CA) membranes were extremely selective with a permeate EtOH content of 100% but their flux was too low for ETBE purification by the pervaporation (PV) membrane process. The affinity of the bio-based polylactide (PLA) for ethanol has also been reported for poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)/PLA blends for this application. In this work, new bio-based membranes were obtained by grafting CA with controlled PLA amounts by a “grafting onto” strategy. The CA-g-PLA copolymers were characterized by ATR-FTIR, 1H NMR, DSC and SAXS. Their membrane properties were investigated in terms of structure-morphology-property relationships for the sorption and pervaporation of the targeted EtOH/ETBE mixture. PLA grafting onto CA strongly improved the flux (×12) while the ethanol permeate content remained in the very high range (C′&gt;90 wt%) for ETBE purification by pervaporation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agroforestry waste being used as biochar, for agricultural, environmental and climatic applications, has attracted considerable attention, but there are few reports on biochar as electrode modified materials and solid fuel briquettes. In this paper, we demonstrated a new strategy for the mass preparation of micro/nano-powders of biochar with water-dispersibility and their potential applications in different fields. Ultra-fine powders of biochar were easily obtained through pyrolyzing fine powders of smashed biomass waste based on pitch pine at high temperature under oxygen-limited conditions. Micro/nano-powders of biochar were facilely prepared through milling and sieving ultra-fine powders of biochar. Water-dispersible biochars were easily developed through sonicating and centrifugally separating micro/nano-powders of biochar. The structures and properties of two biochar types were characterized, and upper-layer biochar was more steadily dispersed in water and of a smaller size than lower-layer biochar, which was mainly employed as an electrode material in a Pb2+ voltammetric sensor and as solid fuel briquettes for pellet biofuels, and other preliminary applications like use as rice bio-fertilizers and Pb2+ bio-adsorbents also were given. The satisfactory results indicated that micro/nano-structured and/or water-dispersible biochar will provide promising platforms for electrochemical applications as electrode materials, as a cleaner and renewable alternative to coal fuel, and for other uses, like as bio-fertilizers for crop seedling and growth, and as bio-adsorbents for the removal of hazardous substances. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Dedicated bioenergy crops grown on marginal lands such as reclaimed mine lands and other non-arable lands are auspicious cellulosic sources for sustainable bioenergy production. In this study, characterization of pyrolysis products were documented for two dedicated bioenergy crops grown on reclaimed coal-mine lands in West Virginia. Two clonal varieties (Private and Public varieties) of Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and two varieties (Bomaster and Kanlow varieties) of Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) were used in this study. The oven-dried samples were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed batch reactor under an inert condition and at a temperature of 500 °C to produce biochar and bio-oil (vapor condensate). The pyrolysis product, energy and carbon conversion yields were calculated. Additionally, biochar and bio-oil were characterized for elemental composition, volatile, ash and calorific values. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the biochar yields (about 30.00% yield) obtained from the clonal varieties of Switchgrass and Miscanthus. The bio-oil yields were in the range of 45.00–51.00% with the Miscanthus (Private variety) having the highest bio-oil yield of 50.61%. The carbon content of the biomass, biochar and bio-oil were found to be 46.80–48.02%, 77.72–80.23% and 54.68–59.68%, respectively. Average calorific values were found to be 19.49 MJ/kg, 29.01 MJ/kg and 24.98 MJ/kg for the biomass, biochar and bio-oil, respectively. Results for the surface chemistry of the biochars showed carbon and oxygen to be the major chemical constituents of the surfaces of the biochars. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were found to be the major components of the non-condensable gas and the CO:CO2ratio showed that the non-condensable gas cannot be used as a fluidizing medium. © 2016

AB  - As a biofuel feedstock, microalgae has good scalability and potential to supply a significant proportion of world energy compared to most types of biofuel feedstock. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is well-suited to wet biomass (such as microalgae) as it greatly reduces the energy requirements associated with dewatering and drying. This article presents experimental analyses of chemical and physical properties of bio-crude oil produced via HTL using a high growth-rate microalga Scenedesmus sp. in a large batch reactor. The overarching goal was to investigate the suitability of microalgae HTL bio-crude produced in a large batch reactor for direct application in marine diesel engines. To this end we characterized the chemical and physical properties of the bio-crudes produced. HTL literature mostly reports work using very small batch reactors which are preferred by researchers, so there are few experimental and parametric measurements for bio-crude physical properties, such as viscosity and density. In the course of this study, a difference between traditionally calculated values and measured values was noted. In the parametric study, the bio-crude viscosity was significantly closer to regular diesel and biodiesel standards than transesterified (FAME) microalgae biodiesel. Under optimised conditions, HTL bio-crude's high density (0.97'1.04 kg-1) and its high viscosity (70.77-73.89 mm2s-1) had enough similarity to marine heavy fuels. although the measured higher heating value, HHV, was lower (29.8 MJ-kg-1). The reaction temperature was explored in the range 280-350°C and bio-crude oil yield and HHV reached their maxima at the highest temperature. Slurry concentration was explored between 15% and 30% at this temperature and the best HHV, O:C, and N:C were found to occur at 25%. Two solvents (dichloromethane and n-hexane) were used to recover the bio-crude oil, affecting the yield and chemical composition of the bio-crude. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Catalytic deoxygenation of pyrolytic vapors represents a great challenge to produce biofuels by flash pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. A wide variety of catalysts, particularly zeolites, have been investigated for this purpose, however, quick deactivation was often reported. Although they are cheap and can have a hierarchical pore structure, activated charcoal-based catalysts have received only little attention. This paper presents an innovative method to synthesize activated charcoal based catalysts doped with CeO2, Fe2O3 or Mn3O4 nanoparticles. We investigated the performances of those catalysts to deoxygenate two biomass pyrolytic model compounds − acetic acid and guaiacol − on a fixed-bed reactor between 350 °C and 450 °C. Ceria-based catalyst was highly active and remarkably stable to enhance ketonic decarboxylation of acetic acid, leading to the formation of acetone. Huge amounts of produced phenol attest for the partial deoxygenation of guaiacol, particularly when using iron-based catalyst. This study demonstrates the potential of activated charcoal-based catalysts to produce weak-acidic and partially deoxygenated bio-oils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A systematic study on copper (II)-alginate beads as catalysts for the synthesis of biodiesel via esterification of oleic acid and methanol is here reported for the first time. The chemical structure and morphologies of these catalysts were fully characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and SEM. The copper (II)-alginate beads showed a tubular structure with entangled reticulation. In the presence of copper (II)-alginate catalyst, the biodiesel conversion of 71.8% was achieved from oleic acid with methanol under the most mild conditions (1/10 oleic acid to methanol molar ratio, 250 mg catalyst, 70°C for 3 h), optimized by single-factor experiments. The catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction mixture and stabilized for a certain time. This material can also catalyze other esterification of fatty acids with different carbon chain lengths, as well as the pretreatment of non-edible oils with high acid value. Our findings showed that the copper (II)- alginate is a suitable catalyst for esterification and would provide more choices for industrial application in the future. © 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - We have demonstrated possible use of microbial oil in biopolymer industries. Microbial oil was produced from biodiesel based crude glycerol and subsequently converted into polyol. Fermentation of crude glycerol in a batch bioreactor using Rhodosporidium toruloides ATCC 10788 produced 18.69 g/L of lipid at the end of 7 days. The microbial oil was then chemically converted to polyol and characterized using FT-IR and 1H NMR. For comparison, canola oil and palm oil were also converted into their respective polyols. The hydroxyl numbers of polyols from canola, palm and microbial oil were found to be 266.86, 222.32 and 230.30 (mg KOH/g of sample) respectively. All the polyols were further converted into rigid and semi-rigid polyurethanes (maintaining the molar –NCO/–OH ratio of 1.1) to examine their suitability in polymer applications. Conversion of microbial lipid to polyurethane foam also provides a new route for the production of polymers using biodiesel based crude glycerol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study is aiming at exploring the genuine role of CO2in pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass by investigating the susceptibility of pyrolysis of monosaccharide (e.g., xylose and glucose), disaccharide (e.g., sucrose), and polysaccharide (e.g., woody biomass) to CO2. To do this, the thermal degradation of these four biomass samples was characterized in N2and CO2. The thermal characterization results reveal that the physical aspects of biomass decomposition (i.e., thermal degradation rate and residual mass difference) associated with CO2were nearly the same; however, the chemical aspects were significantly different. In other words, CO2enhanced thermal cracking of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated from thermal degradation of biomass. In addition, our experiment results show that xylose (a major constituent of hemicellulose) and lignin exhibited a high sensitivity to CO2in pyrolysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As environmental policies drive to increase the renewables participation in the transportation sector, biomass-derived fuels are becoming an attractive alternative to replace, totally or partially, fossil ones. Taking into account the sustainability concerns about first generation biofuels, attention is paid to second generation ones. Their main drawbacks are the high CAPEX and OPEX required if high quality fuels are required as final product due to the current deployment of its technology. In this way, co-processing of biomass-derived feedstocks in oil refineries can be a good solution and can pave the way for the introduction of biofuels in the market, since it reduces environmental impacts from fossil fuels, decreases the oil dependency of countries and, the most important one, takes advantage of existing facilities avoiding the erection of new plants. In this work, the co-processing of hydrodeoxigenated pyrolysis oil (HDO-oil, from lignocellulosic biomass) with vacuum gas oil (VGO) in a FCC unit is modelled and implemented in a calculation block in MS Excel inside Aspen Plus®. 40 pseudocomponents and 10 real components are defined to represent both feedstocks and their possible cracking products. These components are used in a pseudoreaction mechanism of more than 12,000 single reactions, developed from a probabilistic reaction system. Such a large number of reactions is handled by considering key parameters for the estimation of each reaction rate constant and integrated along the riser which is modelled using a finite volume method. Tuning parameters are used to fit the model depending on the feedstock and the riser conditions, and have to be estimated using experimental data. Thereby, the kinetic reactor model allows to work with different feedstocks and conditions. Material, heat and hydrodynamic balances are performed in all volume elements of the modelled riser reactor, which results in a composition and temperature profiles along the riser. The model is validated with experimental data, showing a low relative error. Therefore, this model can be used to predict product yields, according to different feedstocks and experimental conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solvent-free NaOH catalyzed aldol condensation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) was studied, producing branched C11and C12furan compounds in high yields of up to 96%. Through use of a Pd/C and Eu(OTf)3catalytic system, the condensation products of the bio-based starting materials were further hydrodeoxygenated (HDO) in one-step to biofuel compatible branched alkanes 2-methylundecane (3) and 2-methyldecane (4) in excellent yields of 90% and 98%, respectively. In the one-step HDO developed herein, the variation of solvent had a significant effect on the reaction route and degree of conversion of furans to alkanes in the HDO process. Very high overall yields of alkanes 3 (86%) and 4 (94%) were obtained starting from the biomass-based HMF and furfural. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The properties of eggshells (EGS) as neutralizing and immobilizing agent were investigated for hydrogen (H2) production using crude glycerol (CG) by co-culture system. Eggshells of different sizes and concentrations were used during batch and repeated-batch fermentation. For batch and repeated-batch fermentation, the maximum H2production (36.53 ± 0.53 and 41.16 ± 0.95 mmol/L, respectively) was obtained with the EGS size of 33 μm &lt; x5&lt; 75 μm. Hydrogen production increased with the decreasing size of EGS. Eggshells maintained the fermentation pH (6.00–6.30) and provided immobilization support as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. As media components, the EGS concentration of 0.25% (w/v) was found to be optimum for maximum H2production (31.66 ± 0.55 mmol/L) and the production profile was comparable to H2production (32.07 ± 0.92 mmol/L) obtained with all media components. In scale-up study with semi-continuous bioreactor (7.5 L), almost 1.5-fold increase (in comparison to mono-culture) i.e. 312.12 mmol-H2/L-of medium with 86.65% glycerol utilization was obtained. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - SiO2-supported monometallic Ni and bimetallic Ni-In catalysts were prepared and used for hydrodeoxygenation of anisole, which was used as a model bio-oil compound, for BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) production. The effects of the Ni/In ratio and Ni content on the structures and performances of the catalysts were investigated. The results show that In atoms were incorporated into the Ni metal lattice. Although the Ni-In bimetallic crystallites were similar in size to those of monometallic Ni at the same Ni content, H2 uptake by the bimetallic Ni-In catalyst was much lower than that by monometallic Ni because of dilution of Ni atoms by In atoms. Charge transfer from In to Ni was observed for the bimetallic Ni-In catalysts. All the results indicate intimate contact between Ni and In atoms, and the In atoms geometrically and electronically modified the Ni atoms. In the hydrodeoxygenation of anisole, although the activities of the Ni-In bimetallic catalysts in the conversion of anisole were lower than that of the monometallic Ni catalyst, they gave higher selectivities for BTX and cyclohexane as a result of suppression of benzene ring hydrogenation and C-C bond hydrogenolysis. They also showed lower methanation activity. These results will be useful for enhancing carbon yields and reducing H2 consumption. In addition, the lower the Ni/In ratio was, the greater was the effect of In on the catalytic performance. The selectivity for BTX was primarily determined by the Ni/In ratio and was little affected by the Ni content. We suggest that the performance of the Ni-In bimetallic catalyst can be ascribed to the geometric and electronic effects of In. © 2017, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - To examine the possibility of better utilizing Chlorella vulgaris biomass including its carbohydrate as well as lipid contents, it was investigated whether cell disruption for lipid extraction could render the remaining microalgal residue (MR) suitable for enzymatic saccharification, possibly due to the disruption of cell wall structures. The C. vulgaris biomass was subjected to lipid extraction with different cell disruption methods (autoclaving, microwave irradiation, osmotic shock, and sonication), and recovered MRs were hydrolyzed using an enzyme produced from Trichoderma koningiopsis KUC21269 in this study. The enzyme was produced on-site with a highly simplified medium of barley straw, an agricultural byproduct. As a result, the saccharification rate of MR treated with microwave was more than twice that of the control group, and microwave irradiation appeared to be a promising method for both lipid extraction and subsequent saccharification. Our results suggested that both lipids and carbohydrates in C. vulgaris can be utilized by applying proper cell disruption method and a fungal enzyme produced on-site using an agricultural byproduct, respectively. This study revealed the high potential of C. vulgaris as an integrated bio-resource for both lipids and glucose, which can be converted to biodiesel and bioethanol, providing clues for overcoming hurdles in economically feasible biofuel production using microalgae. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Epidemiological data indicate that exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) from traffic emissions is associated with higher risk of morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, accelerated progression of atherosclerotic plaques, and possible lung cancer. While the impact of DEPs from combustion of fossil diesel fuel on human health has been extensively studied, current knowledge of DEPs from combustion of biofuels provides limited and inconsistent information about its mutagenicity and genotoxicity, as well as possible adverse health risks. The objective of the present work was to compare the genotoxicity of DEPs from combustion of two first-generation fuels, 7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) (B7) and 20% FAME (B20), and a second-generation 20% FAME/hydrotreated vegetable oil (SHB: synthetic hydrocarbon biofuel) fuel. Our results revealed that particulate engine emissions from each type of biodiesel fuel induced genotoxic effects in BEAS-2B and A549 cells, manifested as the increased levels of single-strand breaks, the increased frequencies of micronuclei, or the deregulated expression of genes involved in DNA damage signaling pathways. We also found that none of the tested DEPs showed the induction of oxidative DNA damage and the gamma-H2AX-detectable double-strand breaks. The most pronounced differences concerning the tested particles were observed for the induction of single-strand breaks, with the greatest genotoxicity being associated with the B7-derived DEPs. The differences in other effects between DEPs from the different biodiesel blend percentage and biodiesel feedstock were also observed, but the magnitude of these variations was limited. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The widely established production of CH4 from renewable biomass in industrial scale anaerobic reactors may play a major role in the future energy supply. It relies on methanogenic archaea as key organisms which represent the bottleneck in the process. The quantitative analysis of these organisms can help to maximize process performance, uncover disturbances before failure, and may ultimately lead to community-based process control schemes. Existing qPCR and fluorescence microscopy-based methods are very attractive but can be cost-intensive and laborious. Results: In this study we present an autofluorescence-based, flow cytometric method for the fast low-cost quantification of methanogenic archaea in complex microbial communities and crude substrates. The method was applied to a methanogenic enrichment culture (MEC) and digester samples (DS). The methanogenic archaea were quantified using the distinct fluorescence of their cofactor F420 in a range from 3.7 × 108 (± 3.3 × 106) cells mL-1 and 1.8 x 109 (± 1.1 × 108) cells mL-1. We evaluated different fixation methods and tested the sample stability. Stable abundance and fluorescence intensity were recorded up to 26 days during aerobic storage in PBS at 6 °C. The discrimination of the whole microbial community from the ubiquitous particle noise was facilitated by SYBR Green I staining and enabled calculation of relative abundances of methanogenic archaea of up to 9.64 ± 0.23% in the MEC and up to 4.43 ± 0.74% in the DS. The metaprofiling of the mcrA gene reinforced the results. Conclusions: The presented method allows for fast and reliable quantification of methanogenic archaea in microbial communities under authentic digester conditions and can thus be useful for process monitoring and control in biogas digesters. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - New heterogeneous poly(ionic liquids) catalysts (PAL-PILs) were successfully prepared by grafting polymerization of acid ionic liquids (ILs) (1-butysulfonate-3-vinylimidazole hydrogen sulfate) onto nanofiber-like palygorskite (PAL) supports that had been, in advance, covalently modified by γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane (OPAL). Using the ester yields and PILs grafting degrees as main indexes, the optimized immobilization conditions were that the mass ratio of OPAL to ILs monomer was 1:2, the immobilization temperature and time were 60 °C and 30 h, the initiator (2,2′-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) dosage was about 5 wt%, respectively. Then, the esterification between methanol and oleic acid was carried out to investigate the catalytic properties of PAL-PILs. For the homogeneous ILs catalyst, the yield of methyl oleate was about 85%. For the PAL-PILs, on which only about 41% of ILs used in homogeneous catalysis was immobilized, the yield could reach over 69% after reacting only 5 h at 75 °C at atmospheric pressure, when the molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid is adjusted to 12:1. More importantly, the yield of methyl oleate still maintained at about 22% after 6 recycling experiments. Moreover, the PAL-PILs catalysts exhibited efficient catalytic properties and could be recycled easily. These results offer great potential for the PAL-PILs in the biodiesel production for further research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel by non-edible oils via ultrasonic cavitational technique offers a unique and novel approach towards waste management. This study aims to synthesis biodiesel from two non-edible sources namely; Salvadora alii oil and Thespesia populneoides oil. Transesterification was carried out in the presence of solid base calcium oxide catalyst while using an ultrasonic cavitation (UC) reactor. Parametric optimisation was conducted by central composite design and response surface methodology. Results revealed that optimum condition to obtain maximum yield (≈92 wt %) of Salvadora alii methyl ester was as; molar ratio = 10:1 (alcohol: oil), catalyst amount = 3 wt %, and amplitude = 50% in 30 min of reaction time. Similarly, optimum condition was found satisfactory to render maximum yield (≈88.6 wt %) of Thespesia populenoides methyl ester as molar ratio = 6:1 (alcohol: oil), catalyst amount = 3.5 wt %, and amplitude = 45% in 30 min of reaction time. At obtained optimised values UC was compared with mechanical stirring (MS). UC showed 3 fold higher reaction constants and 3 fold more time efficiency than MS. The superiority of UC over MS can be established. Biomass waste to biofuel can make biodiesel synthesis towards cleaner fuel. These results suggest that combination of non-edible oils and UC technology have the potential to make cleaner process. Most of the fuel properties were met the EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751 standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The upgrade of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) mixture from biomass to high-value biofuels has aroused increasing attention. However, a reported heterogeneous catalyst, metal-containing MgAl-hydrotalcite (HT), is confronted with a serious water-resistance problem due to an inherent memory effect of HT materials. With the aim of exploring catalysts with improved water-resistance, metal-containing MgO-SiO2 catalysts were synthesized and evaluated. An investigation on the effect of metal type including Ni, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Co, metal loading, and reaction temperature on catalytic performance indicates that the 10 wt % Ni-MgO-SiO2 catalyst provides the best catalytic performance, giving a yield of 81.5% to C5-C15 ketones and alcohols at 240 °C. As expected, the catalyst exhibits an excellent water-resistance. It could tolerate up to 3 wt % water, which was much higher than 0.5 wt % over that of Cu- or Pd-HT as reported. Results from XRD and 29Si MAS NMR analyses indicate that the high water-resistance could be ascribed to the more stable structure of magnesium silicates formed in the catalyst than HT materials. For a further study of the effect of catalyst property on catalytic performance, 10 wt % Ni-SiO2, 10 wt % Ni-MgO, and 10 wt % Ni-MgO-SiO2 catalysts were investigated and characterized. Results from CO2-TPD, pyridine-IR, and NH3-TPD analyses reveal that the catalytic performance is significantly affected by an acid-base property. Obtaining a high catalytic performance necessitates a cooperation of enough acidic sites and basic sites. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Recent remarkable progress in understanding and engineering enzymes and whole cells as highly selective and environment-friendly catalysts enabling novel routes for the production of pharmaceuticals, fine and platform chemicals, and biofuels has spurred the quest for fast biocatalyst screening and development of efficient processes with long-term biocatalyst use. Besides this, current efforts towards more sustainable production systems and bio-based products have triggered an intense research on chemo-enzymatic cascades and establishment of continuous end-to-end processing. Microreaction technology, which has in the last two decades changed the paradigm in the laboratory and production scale organic synthesis, is recently gaining attention also in the field of applied biocatalysis. Based on the trends highlighted within this article, microfluidic systems linked with appropriate monitoring and feedback control can greatly contribute to successful implementation of biocatalysis in industrial production. Microflow-based droplets facilitate ultrahigh-throughput biocatalyst engineering, screening at various operational conditions, and very fast collection of data on reaction kinetics using minute amounts of time and reagents. Harnessing the benefits of microflow devices results in faster and cheaper selection of substrate(s) and media, and development of suitable immobilization methods for continuous biocatalyst use. Furthermore, the use of highly efficient reactor designs integrated with downstream processing enabling also faster and more reliable scale-up can bridge the gap between the academic research and industrial use of biocatalysts. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó.

AB  - Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) has been considered as an effective process for converting wet algal biomass to biocrude. A major limitation of HTL however, is its inability to harvest high value-added byproducts or recover nutrients. Sequential Hydrothermal Liquefaction (SEQHTL) was recently developed to overcome this limitation to allow the simultaneous extraction of co-products and biocrude production. In this study, the performance for SEQHTL treating different algal species was assessed in terms of process versatility, biocrude production and nutrient recovery. The impact of feedstock and relevant feed stream thermophysical properties was evaluated. The biocrudes produced had moderately low oxygen content (< 14%), reduced nitrogen content (< 8%), very low sulfur (< 1.4%), and HHV ranging from 33 to 37 MJ/kg. Galdieria sulphuraria produced less crude (~ 20 wt%) as well as less char (~ 11 wt%). The Chlorella sp. had higher crude yields (~ 30 wt%) and superior nutrient recovery in aqueous effluents, ranging from 2640 to 3600 mg/L of phosphorous and from 2100 to 3700 mg/L of total nitrogen. The results also show non-Newtonian shear thinning and increasing effective viscosity at higher solid loadings. Although SEQHTL proved more suitable for algae with moderate to high lipid content, its versatility and mild reaction conditions allow for the harvesting significant quantities of water-soluble nutrients. These findings compare favorably to HTL studies and suggest that these compounds can be recovered for either recycle or producing other value-added co-products. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work focuses on the simultaneous reduction of NO–smoke–CO2 emission in a Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME)-fueled single-cylinder compression ignition engine by using low-carbon biofuel with exhaust after-treatment system. Replacement of KOME for diesel reduced smoke emission by 3% but resulted in increase of NO emission and CO2 emission by 13 and 35% at 100% load condition. In order to reduce CO2 emission, tests were conducted with a blend of KOME and orange seed oil (OSO), a low-carbon fuel on equal volume basis (50–50). At the same operating conditions, compared to KOME, 27% reduction in CO2 emission and 5% reduction in smoke emission were observed. However, a slight increase in NO emission was observed. To achieve simultaneous reduction of NO–smoke–CO2 emissions, three catalysts, namely monoethanolamine, zeolite and activated carbon, were selected for exhaust after-treatment system and tested with optimum KOME–OSO blend. KOME–OSO + zeolite showed a great potential in simultaneous reduction of NO–smoke–CO2 emissions. NO, smoke and CO2 emissions were simultaneously reduced by about 15% for each emission compared to diesel at 100% load condition. The effect of exhaust after-treatment system with KOME–OSO blend on combustion, performance and other emission parameters is discussed in detail in this study. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry analysis and testing were done to identify the absorbance characteristics of zeolite material. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A low-cost and high-purity calcium oxide (CaO) was prepared from waste crab shells, which were extracted from the dead crabs, was used as an efficient solid base catalyst in the synthesis of biodiesel. Raw fish oil was extracted from waste parts of fish through mechanical expeller followed by solvent extraction. Physical as well as chemical properties of raw fish oil were studied, and its free fatty acid composition was analyzed with GC-MS. Stable and high-purity CaO was obtained when the material was calcined at 800 °C for 4 h. Prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and TGA/DTA. The surface structure of the catalyst was analyzed with SEM, and elemental composition was determined by EDX spectra. Esterification followed by transesterification reactions were conducted for the synthesis of biodiesel. The effect of cosolvent on biodiesel yield was studied in each experiment using different solvents such as toluene, diethyl ether, hexane, tetrahydrofuran, and acetone. High-quality and pure biodiesel was synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR and FT-IR. Biodiesel yield was affected by parameters such as reaction temperature, reaction time, molar ratio (methanol:oil), and catalyst loading. Properties of synthesized biodiesel such as density, kinematic viscosity, and cloud point were determined according to ASTM standards. Reusability of prepared CaO catalyst was checked, and the catalyst was found to be stable up to five runs without significant loss of catalytic activity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The elucidation of bio-oil composition is important to evaluate the processes of biomass conversion and its upgrading, and to suggest the proper use for each sample. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS) is a widely applied analytical approach for bio-oil investigation due to the higher separation and resolution capacity from this technique. This work addresses the issue of analytical performance to assess the comprehensive characterization of real bio-oil samples via GC×GC-TOFMS. The approach was applied to the individual quantification of compounds of real thermal (PWT), catalytic process (CPO), and hydrodeoxygenation process (HDO) bio-oils. Quantification was performed with reliability using the analytical curves of oxygenated and hydrocarbon standards as well as the deuterated internal standards. The limit of quantification was set at 1 ng µL−1 for major standards, except for hexanoic acid, which was set at 5 ng µL−1. The GC×GC-TOFMS method provided good precision (&lt;10%) and excellent accuracy (recovery range of 70–130%) for the quantification of individual hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds in real bio-oil samples. Sugars, furans, and alcohols appear as the major constituents of the PWT, CPO, and HDO samples, respectively. In order to obtain bio-oils with better quality, the catalytic pyrolysis process may be a better option than hydrogenation due to the effective reduction of oxygenated compound concentrations and the lower cost of the process, when hydrogen is not required to promote deoxygenation in the catalytic pyrolysis process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from crambe oil by enzyme interesterification assisted by ultrasound was investigated. The experiments evaluated the effect of temperature, reaction time, methyl acetate (MA)/oil molar ratio, enzyme loading, catalyst reuse and influence of ultrasound. The best results were obtained at 60 °C, temperature at which the reaction reached equilibrium in 6 h. FAME yield was maximal at MA/oil molar ratio of 12 and the enzyme loading of 20 wt% (relative to oil mass) gave the best yields. The use of methyl acetate promoted the enzyme stability throughout successive cycles, with a decrease of only 10% and 8% in FAME yield and enzymatic activity. The results allow us to conclude that ultrasound reduced total reaction time and percentage of enzyme loading, when compared to the process without ultrasound. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pyrolysis oils are complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds that can be described as a mixture of few chemical macro-families. This description is highly desirable for modeling bio-oil combustion, cracking, separation, and evaporation. In one of our previous papers we recommended the deconvolution of bio-oil DTG curves as the basis for characterizing bio-oils in chemical families. However, the positioning of the peaks was based on the shape of the DTG curve. More specific guidelines are needed to position the peaks in this deconvolution strategy. In this paper we developed and tested a methodology to identify the position and shape of the peaks in the DTG curves. The first strategy uses the FTIR spectra of the TG evolved pyrolysis oil vapors. The second consists of doping the bio-oil with model compounds and with its fractions. The IR studies provided information on the position and width of the fitting curves describing the behavior of the very light volatile compounds (<150°C) and of the heavy oligomeric fraction (>400°C). The range between these two temperatures was fitted based primarily on the shape of the DTG curve and the results from the oil doping studies. Contribution of the chemical families toward formation of coke residue was examined based on the doping studies, and rules for coke assignment were developed. The developed DTG deconvolution method was applied to ten pyrolysis oils produced from compositionally diverse biomass feedstocks and production technologies. The chemical composition of the oils obtained by our new DTG deconvolution strategy was compared with other well accepted characterization methods. Our results show that the method proposed could be used to estimate the changes in the content of water, light volatile compounds, and water-soluble (WS) and water insoluble (WIS) fractions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignocellulosic plant matter, as a second generation biomass, has potential as a feedstock for the production of liquid bio-fuels providing an alternative to fossil fuels. Herein, we report detailed catalyst screening and parameter optimization for catalytic hydrotreatment of bio-crude produced from the continuous hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of aspen wood. Three different commercial metal oxide catalysts, NiW/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3 with a high and low NiMo loading, were examined. Elemental analysis showed significant oxygen expulsion from 10.7 wt% in the bio-crude down to a minimum of 0.7 wt% in the hydrotreated bio-oil. Considering the degrees of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) along with yields, NiMo/Al2O3 with a high NiMo loading showed the best performance with a yield of 71.9 wt% and an oxygen content of 2.4 wt% for the final bio-oil, followed by low loaded NiMo/Al2O3 (yield 67.4 wt%, oxygen content 3.8 wt%) and NiW/Al2O3 (yield 58.7 wt%, oxygen content 6.9 wt%) under relatively mild conditions. Characterization by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry pointed towards possible conversion pathways of the main bio-crude components during hydrotreatment. These included the conversion of substituted cyclopentenones to cycloalkanes, and oxygen-containing substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. anthracene, phenanthrene and naphthalene) and cracking of fatty acids to aliphatic hydrocarbons. The effects of initial hydrogen pressure and reaction time were investigated. The results demonstrate the potential of upgrading the bio-crude produced from the HTL of aspen wood to a hydrocarbon product with properties similar to petroleum derived transportation fuels. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Phenolic compounds derived from biomass are important feedstocks for the sustainable production of hydrocarbon biofuels. Hydrodeoxygenation is an effective process to remove oxygen-containing functionalities in phenolic compounds. This paper reported a simple method for producing hydrocarbons by liquefying biomass and upgrading liquefied products. Three phenolic compounds fractions (1#, 2#, and 3#) were separated from liquefied biomass with stepwise precipitation and extraction. Based on HSQC NMR analysis, three phenolic compounds fractions were mainly comprised of aromatic and phenolic derivatives. Three phenolic compounds fractions were hydrogenated and deoxygenated to cyclohexanes using bifunctional catalysts via in situ hydrodeoxygenation. During the in situ hydrodeoxygenation, we introduced bifunctional catalysts combined of Raney Ni with HZSM-5. The bifunctional catalysts showed high selectivity for removing oxygen-containing groups in biomass-derived phenolic compounds. And the hydrogen was supplied by aqueous phase reforming of methanol without external H2. Additionally, the mechanism based on our investigation of in situ hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic compounds was proposed. During the in situ hydrodeoxygenation, the metal-catalyzed hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis/dehydration were supposed to couple together. Current results demonstrated that in situ hydrodeoxygenation using bifunctional catalysts is a promising and efficient route for converting biomass-derived phenolic compounds into fuel additives and liquid hydrocarbon biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this paper is to investigate the anti-knock quality of sugar-derived levulinic esters (methyl levulinate (ML) and ethyl levulinate (EL)) and cyclic ethers (furfuryl ethyl ether (FEE) and ethyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether (ETE)). To this end, combustion experiments were carried out in both an engine and a constant volume autoignition device (modified ignition quality tester (IQT)). The results from both apparatuses demonstrate that ML, EL and FEE have superior anti-knock quality to the reference Euro95 gasoline. ETE, conversely, performed markedly worse than the reference fuel on both setups and might therefore be a more appropriate fuel additive for compression ignition engines. The main reason of the distinctions in anti-knock quality can be found in the molecular structure of the neat biofuels. ML and EL are levulinic esters, with a ketone (C[dbnd]O) functionality and an ester (C([dbnd]O)–O) group on the carbon chain. They can readily produce stable intermediates during the auto-ignition process, thereby slowing down the overall reaction rate. The unsaturated cyclic ether (FEE) has very strong ring C–H bonds. However, the saturated cyclic ether (ETE) has weak ring C–H bonds, which facilitate more readily ring opening reactions. Ethyl side chains on the cyclic ethers further accelerate the reaction rate. Importantly for future research, our results suggest that the modified (IQT) and engine experiments are interchangeable setups with respect to qualitative anti-knock quality evaluation of novel compounds. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - In this study, a new pretreatment strategy for lignocellulosic was developed using a fully recyclable solid acid, Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH). A combined hydrolysis factor (CHF) as a pretreatment severity was used to balance enzymatic saccharification and the structural characteristics of lignin. The results from degradation of carbohydrates, enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and characterization of lignin by FT-IR, 31P NMR, GPC, 2D-HSQC NMR indicated that a CHF of approximately 3.90 was the optimal pretreatment severity to facilitate enzymatic saccharification and the potential serviceability of lignin. Then approximately 90% of the xylan was removed to result in a reasonable sugar yield of 76%. Residual lignin showed low molecular weight (Mw, 5783 g/mol), narrow polydispersities (Mw/Mn, 1.10) and high content of phenolic hydroxyl groups (3.702 mmol/g); it may be a potential feedstock for phenol monomer and polymeric materials production. In short, this process was regarded as a promising approach to achieve an efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to sugar products and lignin-based materials. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydroprocessing of pyrolysis oils from biomass produces hydrocarbons that can be considered for liquid fuel production. This process requires removal of oxygen and cracking of the heavier molecular weight bio-oil constituents into smaller fragments at high temperatures and pressures under hydrogen. We present in this paper the characterization of a group of five distillate fractions from each of two types of hydroprocessed oils from oak pyrolysis oil: a low oxygen content (LOC, 1.8% O, wet basis) oil and a medium oxygen content (MOC, 6.4% O, wet basis) oil. The LOC oil was generated using a sulfided hydrotreating system consisting of RuS/C and xMoS/Al2O3 while the MOC was produced using non-sulfided catalysts, Ru/C and Pd/C. Elemental analysis and 13C NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) results suggest that the distillate fractions from both oils become more aromatic/unsaturated as they become heavier. Carbonyl and carboxylic groups were found in the MOC light fractions, while phenols were present in the heavier fractions for both MOC and LOC. Paraffin, iso-paraffin, olefin, naphthene, aromatic (PIONA) analysis of the light LOC fraction shows a predominance of paraffins with a minor amount of olefins. Sulfur analysis showed the comparative concentration of sulfur in the different fractions as well as the surprising similarity in content in some sulfided and non-sulfided fractions. These results can be used to direct future research on refinery integration and production of value-added product from specific upgraded oil streams. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present experimental study aims to find the effect of the nozzle opening pressure (NOP) on the behaviour of a single cylinder, direct injection, compression ignition engine, run on a non-petroleum fuel; i.e. JMETPO20 blend, which contains 80% jatropha methyl ester and 20% tyre pyrolysis oil on a volume basis. In order to find an optimum NOP for the blend, tests were conducted at an optimized injection timing with five different NOPs viz. 210, 220, 230, 240 and 250 bar in addition to the original NOP of 200 bar, and the findings were matched with those of diesel operation. The combustion parameters were analysed for the blend and test results showed that the peak cylinder pressure and maximum heat release rate were marginally increased at the NOP of 220 bar in comparison to the original NOP of 200 bar at full load. Further, it was found from the results that for the blend with the NOP of 220 bar, the brake thermal efficiency increased by about 5.12%, while the smoke opacity, brake specific carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon emissions were decreased by about 9.5%, 1.57% and 6.26% respectively when compared to those of the original operating condition at full load. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Production of ETBE is one of most important industrial processes. It is used both as biofuel and bio additive in gasoline. The motivation behind its use is that, its blend with gasoline reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Present work focuses on the synthesis of ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) by using Reactive dividing wall column (RDWC) and a comparative assessment with three other process alternatives as-reactor followed by distillation sequence, reactor plus reactive distillation (RD), and RD. The comparison was done in terms of energy requirements, CO2 emissions, total annual costs (TAC), total investment costs (TIC) and total operating costs (TOC). RDWC proved its forte in saving energy therefore cutting CO2 emissions and handling the reactions limited by chemical equilibrium. RDWC was found to be the most promising alternative out of the four process alternatives. It gave highest purity of the product ETBE 99.999% (mol.), the CO2 emissions were reduced by 74% and 43% as compared to conventional sequence and RD respectively, and also the energy requirements were very less as compared to the conventional sequence and RD. TIC reduction as high as 68% was observed, this also established RDWC as a lucrative option for the synthesis of ETBE. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A major challenge for the implementation of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) as a continuous process is the formulation of lignocellulosic feedstock, which is prone to phase separation into water and biomass parts when pressurized. One approach to remedy such phase separation is to reduce the dry matter content; however, as this approach is detrimental to process cost efficiency, designing an appropriate pretreatment step to ensure pumpability at high dry matter content is preferable. This paper evaluated the effect of various pretreatment methods on product distribution and composition resulting from the HTL of willow and proposes short rotation coppice as an alternative biomass feedstock for biofuels production. Alkaline–thermal pretreatment, besides making high dry matter pumpable feedstock slurries, also led to an increase in the production of the bio-crude product with an oxygen content lower than 8 wt% and a higher concentration of aromatics and phenolic compounds. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Phosphomolybdic acid (PMo12) was used as an electron mediator and proton carrier to mediate biomass pretreatment for ethanol production and electricity generation from wheat straw. In the pretreatment, lignin was oxidized anaerobically by PMo12with solubilization of a fraction of hemicelluloses, and the PMo12was simultaneously reduced. In an external liquid flow cell, the reduced PMo12was re-oxidized with generation of electricity. The effects of several factors on pretreatment were investigated for optimizing the conditions. Enzymatic conversion of cellulose and xylan were about 80% and 45%, respectively, after pretreatment of wheat straw with 0.25 M PMo12, at 95 °C for 45 min. FeCl3was found to be an effective liquid mediator to transfer electrons to air, the terminal electron acceptor. By investigating the effects of various operation parameters and cell structural factors, the highest output power density of about 11 mW/cm2was obtained for discharging of the reduced PMo12. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a powerful technology for heat and power generation that can be combined with many applications. This study presents a thermodynamic analysis of the Ca-looping sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of bio-oil integrated with an SOFC. Acetic acid is used as a model compound to represent a bio-oil aqueous fraction. Useful heat from an SOFC is utilized in the regenerator to improve the performance of the SOFC system. The effects of key parameters in operating the Ca-looping sorption-enhanced steam reformer and SOFC are discussed. The results indicate that Ca-looping SESR integrated with SOFC has a higher performance than the conventional process. Increasing the SESR temperature, the CaO/fuel ratio, the SOFC temperature, and the fuel utilization increases the electrical efficiency, but it decreases with S/F ratio. Regarding an energy analysis, the regenerator requires higher energy when it operates at a high steam and CaO/fuel ratio but lower energy when it operates at high SESR temperatures. In addition, the system efficiency of the SOFC integrated process decreases with SESR temperature and steam due to the high amount of energy to feed and air preheating. Heat integration using the pinch analysis method to certify the maximum heat recovery improves the system efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In situ transesterification of oleaginous yeast wet biomass for fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) production using acid catalyst, methanol with or without N-Lauroyl sarcosine (N-LS) treatment was performed. The maximum FAMEs yield obtained with or without N-LS treatment in 24 h reaction time was 96.1 ± 1.9 and 71 ± 1.4% w/w, respectively. The N-LS treatment of biomass followed by with or without ultrasonication revealed maximum FAMEs yield of 94.3 ± 1.9% and 82.9 ± 1.8% w/w using methanol to lipid molar ratio 360:1 and catalyst concentration 360 mM (64 μL H2SO4/g lipid) within 5 and 25 min reaction time, respectively. The FAMEs composition obtained in in situ transesterification was similar to that obtained with conventional two step lipid extraction and transesterification process. Biodiesel fuel properties (density, kinematic viscosity, cetane number and total glycerol) were in accordance with international standard (ASTM D6751), which suggests the suitability of biodiesel as a fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The oxidation behavior of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) a novel second-generation biofuel was investigated. Specifically ignition delay time measurements in two different combustion reactors e.g. rapid compression machine and high-pressure shock tube were performed. Measurements for 2-MTHF/oxidizer/diluent mixtures were performed at 639 K - 1413 K at 10 20 and 40 bar and at three different equivalence ratios of 0.5 1.0 and 2.0. A detailed chemical kinetic model describing both low-and high-temperature chemistry of 2-MTHF was developed and validated against new ignition delay measurements and already existing flame species profiles and ignition delay measurements. The mechanism provides satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. Reaction path and sensitivity analyses were carried out to identify key reactions at various combustion conditions and to attain a better understanding of the combustion behavior.

AB  - The efficient immobilization of enzymes on favorable supporting materials to design enzyme electrodes endowed with specific catalysis performances such as deep oxidation of biofuels, and direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalysis is highly desired for fabricating enzymatic biofuel cells (BFCs). In this study, carbon nanodots (CNDs) have been used as the immobilizing matrixes and electron relays of enzymes to construct (NAD+)-dependent dehydrogenase cascades-based bioanode for the deep oxidation of methanol and DET-type laccase-based biocathode for oxygen reduction to water. At the bioanode, multiplex enzymes including alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and formate dehydrogenase are coimmobilized on CNDs electrode which is previously coated with in situ polymerized methylene blue as the electrocatalyst for oxidizing NADH to NAD+. At the biocathode, fungal laccase is directly cast on CNDs and facilitated DET reaction is allowed. As a result, a novel membrane-less methanol/O2 BFC has been assembled and displays a high open-circuit voltage of 0.71(±0.02) V and a maximum power density of 68.7 (±0.4) μW cm-2. These investigated features imply that CNDs may act as new conductive architectures to elaborate enzyme electrodes for further bioelectrochemical applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass continues to show promise in experimental and pilot scale tests for carbon partitioning toward desirable multi-phase organic products. Results from a techno-economic investigation are presented for a commercial scale stand-alone plant with primary production of renewable liquid fuels compatible with current transportation infrastructure. The plant feedstock was forest residues and the non-catalytic hydrothermal conditions were set to 330 °C and 210 bar. A sequential flowsheet was developed and simulated on Aspen Plus® that includes pre-treatment, hydrothermal liquefaction, fuel upgrading and residue recovery functional blocks. Different scenarios for the valorization of the liquefaction residue streams are examined to maximize organic recovery and eliminate process waste streams. The highest plant thermal efficiency on lower heating value basis was recorded for the polygeneration of renewable liquid fuels, Bio-char and hydrogen gas at 85.2%. The plant recorded a minimum selling price of 66 € per MWh of co-products. The break-even prices of the co-products under existing market conditions was found to be 1.03 € per kg of gasoline or 2.46 € per kg of hydrogen gas or 51.4 € per MWh of Bio-char. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxgenation of ketones or aldehydes allows for efficient transformation of oxygen containing raw materials into value-added chemicals and biofuels, which calls for efficient but inexpensive alternative catalytic systems. In the present contribution, a nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NHPC) was fabricated in a “leavening” method, functioning as a superior support for the anchoring of highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles (Ni/NHPC with ∼ 6.5 nm Ni nanoparticles). When tested in hydrodeoxygenation of bio-derived vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), this catalyst demonstrated much enhanced catalytic activity as compared to Ni/HPC (HPC means hierarchical porous carbon without nitrogen doping). A direct hydrogenolysis or hydrogenation-hydrogenolysis reaction mechanism was proposed, which allows the present Ni/NHPC to exert full oxygen removal of a broad set of aromatic substrates with carbonyl or -OH at benzylic position. The modified electronic state of nickel interacted with nitrogen dopant and enhanced mass transfer contributed by the hierarchical porous structure of NHPC may be reasons for high reactivity. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - γ-Valerolactone (GVL) is receiving increasing attention because of its significant characteristics of an ideal sustainable liquid fuel. In this work, a novel and nonprecious metal catalytic method of the hydrogenation of biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) into GVL by water splitting is first reported. Commercially available nonprecious metals of Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mo exhibited significantly catalytic activities in the hydrogenation of LA into GVL. Over 90% yield of GVL from LA can be obtained at a relatively low temperature of 180 °C, and an excellent 98% yield of GVL was achieved over the Fe catalyst at 250 °C. Catalyst Fe is stable and still keeps the high catalytic activity after recycles. The extraordinary catalytic activity of the general Fe powder is probably because of the role of hot water and also a synergistic role of the Fe and ZnO or Zn/ZnO. Also, the reactor wall of a reactor made of the stainless steel material acted as a significant catalyst, and a considerably high GVL yield of 56% can be obtained even without any addition of catalyst. This method is simple, highly efficient, and requires neither gaseous hydrogen nor precious metal catalyst, which is key for the practical application. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - During fluidized bed biomass gasification, complex gas-solid mixing patterns and numerous chemical and physical phenomena make identification of optimal operating conditions challenging. In this work, a parametric experimental campaign was carried out alongside the development of a coupled reactor network model which successfully integrates the individually validated sub-models to predict steady-state reactor performance metrics and outputs. The experiments utilized an integrated gasification system consisting of an externally-heated, bench-scale, 4-in., 5 kWth, fluidized bed steam/air blown gasifier fed with woody biomass equipped with a molecular beam mass spectrometer to directly measure tar species. The operating temperature (750–850°C) and air/fuel equivalence ratio (ER = 0–0.157) were independently varied to isolate their effects. Elevating temperature is shown to improve the char gasification rate and reduce tar concentrations. Air strongly impacts the composition of tar, accelerating the conversion of lighter polycyclic-aromatic hydrocarbons into soot precursors, while also improving the overall carbon conversion. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 1543–1565, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Biogas derived from anaerobic digestion of organic wastes, and lignocellulosic biomass can be used to produce drop-in diesel fuel via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. In this study, we developed a process-based simulation model for the biogas to liquid fuel (BgTL) plant to conduct mass and energy balances and to evaluate techno-economic assessment of producing drop-in FT fuels. The BgTL plant operations consisted of biogas cleaning, biomethane reforming, FT synthesis of syngas and hydrocracking and final distillation to produce drop-in liquid fuels. The unconverted syngas and syncrude were utilized to generate steam and electricity to meet internal plant demand, while the excess power was sold to the grid. The base case BgTL plant (2 000 Nm3/h) produced about 4.6 million gallons per annum of total FT fuels which consisted of 62% diesel, 32% gasoline, 6% LPG with an overall biogas conversion of 54%. A discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFOROR) approach for the Nth plant was used to estimate the capital and operating costs with the minimum selling price for the FT drop-in fuels of about $5.67/gal ($5.29/GGE). The increase in plant feed capacity to 20 000 Nm3/h decreased the minimum selling price to $2.06/gal ($1.92/GGE). The sensitivity analysis conducted on the base case plant demonstrated that the internal rate of return (IRR), FT conversion rate, plant operating hours, and biogas cost were the most sensitivity parameters to the minimum selling price. Overall, the BgTL technology is deemed to be economically feasible to meet US biofuels demand. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In this work, the reforming of model biogas was investigated on a Rh/MgAl2O4 catalyst. In situ transient and steady-state diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were used to gain insight into the reaction mechanism involved in the activation of CH4 and CO2. It was found that the reaction proceeds through of an initial pathway in which methane and CO2 are both dissociated on Rh metallic sites and additionally a bifunctional mechanism in which methane is activated on Rh sites and CO2 is activated on the basic sites of the support surface via a formate intermediate by H-assisted CO2 decomposition. Moreover, this plausible mechanism is able to explain why the observed apparent activation energy of CO2 is much lower than that of CH4. Our results suggest that CO2 dissociation facilitates CH4 activation, because the oxygen-adsorbed species formed in the decomposition of CO2 are capable of reacting with the CHx species derived from methane decomposition. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - With the significant development of efficient pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass towards using carbohydrate compositions for biofuel production, the valorization of associated lignin products into valuable chemicals has gained much attention. Four lignins obtained by pretreatment of corn stover with emerging ionic liquid-based mixed organic electrolytes (ILOE) and alkaline twin-screw extrusion (ATSE) pretreatment technologies were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), FTIR, HSQC, 31P NMR spectroscopy, and SEM. These lignins were valorized by using Pd/C under various conditions, followed by an elucidation of the relationship between the lignin structure and valorization efficiency and selectivity. The pretreatment/separation methods have a significant effect on lignin structure and subsequent valorization efficiency. HSQC spectra revealed that corn stover lignin consisted of β-O-4, β-5, β-1 linkages, and cinnamyl alcohol end groups. The extracted lignins (EL) showed less carbohydrates and β-O-4 units than those of enzymatic hydrolytic lignins (EHL). The yields of bio-oils were 61.7 % and 57.9 % for ATSE-EL and ILOE-EL, and 34.2 % and 45.1 % for ATSE-EHL and ILOE-EHL under optimal and comparative conditions, respectively. Part of the syringyl (S) units were converted into guaiacyl or p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units by release of methoxyl groups on the aromatic ring through hydrogenolysis, which led to a decreased proportion of S units and an increased proportion of H units in oil compared with in lignin. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The efficiency of oil extraction from Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. using different cell disruption and solvent system was investigated. The ultrasound cell disruption method showed the maximum oil extraction in both algae. Oil extraction with hexane resulted in maximum oil yield for both algae. The kinetic parameters were studied and the extraction followed the first-order kinetics. The activation energy and thermodynamic activation parameters were calculated for both microalgae and the results suggested that the extraction was endothermic, irreversible and spontaneous. The methyl ester yields by two-step transesterification and direct transesterification were 95 and 96% for Scenedesmus sp. and 89 and 92% for Chlorella sp. respectively. Both methods had similar net energy consumption suitable for industrial application. The methyl ester properties were analysed in comparison with those of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751 standards. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A food industry waste, almond shell, was pyrolyzed under three different environment static, nitrogen, and steam to produce bio-oil and its derivatives. The oil yield obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 600°C was 24.23% in a static atmosphere, whereas it increased to 27.25% and 33.05% in nitrogen and steam atmospheres, respectively. The bio-oil obtained under steam atmosphere is very efficient due to the production of high liquid and gas yields. Moreover, co-feeding steam during the pyrolysis altered the bio-oil structure by increasing the aliphatics and reducing the asphaltenes. Moreover, steam treatment also increases H/C and heating value of bio-oils. According to the obtained results, steam pyrolysis is an alternative option for future applications in refineries. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Exhaust particle emissions from a heavy duty diesel engine using B20 biodiesel (20% biodiesel blend with 80% diesel by volume) were investigated, and the engine was equipped with three kinds of exhaust aftertreatment devices: DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst), DOC + DPF (diesel particle filter), and DOC + CDPF (catalyzed diesel particle filter). Particle mass, particle number and size distribution, and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and inorganic ions in the particle emissions from the engine were studied. Compared with the engine without exhaust aftertreatments, DOC decreased nucleation mode particle number by 19.83%, while accumulation mode particles exhibited slight changes. The DOC + DPF reduced the total particle number by 82.54%, while the DOC + CDPF reduced it by 91.71%. Compared with the engine without exhaust aftertreatments, the three aftertreatments were shown to reduce total PAH emissions. DOC + DPF and DOC + CDPF can decrease total TEQ (toxicity equivalent quantity) effectively with a sharp decrease in PAH mass. The DOC increased the TEQ of particles by 46.9%. The catalyst in the DOC increased some high molecular weight PAHs such as BaA, BbF + BkF, and BaP, which led to the increase in TEQ. The DOC increased the total inorganic ions by 2%, while the DOC + DPF and DOC + CDPF decreased inorganic ions by 89.5% and 82.9%, respectively. Catalysts in DOC and CDPF promotes the formation of SO42− and NO3−, which leads to higher inorganic ion emissions with DOC than no aftertreatments and higher inorganic ion emissions with a DOC + CDPF than with a DOC + DPF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been identified as a potential candidate for biofuels and a high-potential intermediate chemical compound. The obtention of HMF from fructose is efficiently carried out using acid catalysts. In this work, a new catalyst of alumina synthesized by sol-gel as support was bifunctionalized with thiol ([sbnd]SH) and sulfonic (SO3 −) groups by the grafting method and compared with other supports, i.e., synthesized boehmite and commercial alumina. The 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane was utilized as a source of the thiol group to promote fructose tautomerization to its furanose form. The sulfonic group was obtained from 1,3-propanesultone, which carries out the dehydration of the fructose molecule. The prepared bifunctionalized catalysts were tested in the fructose dehydration reaction. The functional groups were identified through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as the primary characterization. The type of acid site was identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (–pyridine (FTIR-py)) and quantified by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (TPD-NH3). The molecular structures of thiol and the sulfonic groups anchored on the supports were resolved by nuclear magnetic resonance with cross-polarization (CP) and magic angle spinning (MAS) (CP-MAS-NMR). The bifunctionalized catalyst of alumina synthesized by sol-gel, being a very competitive material, reached a 55% selectivity to HMF at a 72% conversion at 453 K. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In present study, statistical optimization of biodiesel–derived crude glycerol fermentation to DHA by immobilized G. oxydans cells over polyurethane foam is reported. Effect of DHA (product) inhibition on crude glycerol fermentation was analyzed using conventional biokinetic models and new model that accounts for both substrate and product inhibition. Optimum values of fermentation parameters were: pH = 4.7, temperature = 31 °C, initial substrate concentration = 20 g/L. At optimum conditions, DHA yield was 89% (17.83 g/L). Effect of product inhibition on fermentation was trivial for DHA concentrations ≤30 g/L. At higher concentrations (≥50 g/L), kinetics and yield of fermentation showed marked reduction with sharp drop in Vmax and KS values. Inhibition effect was more pronounced for immobilized cells due to restricted transport of fermentation mixture across polyurethane foam. Retention of fermentation mixture in immobilized matrix resulted in higher localized DHA concentration that possibly enhanced inhibition effect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Generally, biorefineries convert lignocellulosic biomass into a range of biofuels and further value added chemicals. However, conventional biorefinery processes focus mainly on the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions and therefore produce only low quality lignin, which is commonly burnt to provide process heat. To make full use of the biomass, more attention needs to be focused on novel separation techniques, where high quality lignin can be isolated that is suitable for further valorisation into aromatic chemicals and fuel components. In this paper, three types of lignocellulosic biomass (softwood, hardwood and herbaceous biomass) were processed by microwave-assisted acidolysis to produce high quality lignin. The lignin from the softwood was isolated largely intact in the solid residue after acidolysis. For example, a 10 min microwave-assisted acidolysis treatment produced lignin with a purity of 93% and in a yield of 82%, which is superior to other conventional separation methods reported. Furthermore, py-GC/MS analysis proved that the isolated lignin retained the original structure of native lignin in the feedstock without severe chemical modification. This is a large advantage, and the purified lignin is suitable for further chemical processing. To assess the suitability of this methodology as part of a biorefinery system, the aqueous phase, produced after acidolysis of the softwood, was characterised and assessed for its suitability for fermentation. The broth contained some mono- and di-saccharides but mainly contained organic acids, oligosaccharides and furans. While this is unsuitable for S. cerevisiae and other common ethanol producing yeasts, two oleaginous yeasts with known inhibitor tolerances were selected: Cryptococcus curvatus and Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Both yeasts could grow on the broth, and demonstrated suitable catabolism of the oligosaccharides and inhibitors over 7 days. In addition, both yeasts were shown to be able to produce an oil with a similar composition to that of palm oil. This preliminary work demonstrates new protocols of microwave-assisted acidolysis and therefore offers an effective approach to produce high purity lignin and fermentable chemicals, which is a key step towards developing a zero-waste lignocellulosic biorefinery. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Commercial ion-exchange commercial resins (Amberlyst 35 and Amberlyst 36) and a resin synthetized in the laboratory, sulfonated poly(divinylbenzene) were evaluated as catalysts in the esterification of fatty acids (palmitic and oleic) with alcohols (methanol, ethanol and butanol). The study was developed in order to obtain a high rate of fatty acid conversion. The esterification reactions with fatty acids and methanol presented satisfactory conversion to methyl esters achieving a final conversion over 90% in both palmitic and oleic acid. A sample of waste vegetable oils with a high acid content from the residue of the palm oil and soybean oil refining industry were evaluated in the esterification with methanol. The best results were achieved with the new sulfonic resin, poly(divinylbenzene), which was synthesized in the laboratory and has proved efficient for the reaction in the study. Maximum biodiesel production was achieved from a fatty acid residue of the soybean oil refining industry and methanol (93%) which showed conversions very close to those obtained from their respective fatty acids. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sorption enhanced steam reforming of acetic acid over sorbent assisted catalyst of Ni-CaO-La2O3 were investigated for high-purity H2 production. Ni-CaO-La2O3 with 8, 16 and 20 wt% Ni were developed by sol-gel combustion synthesis and were characterized by TG, TPR, BET, SEM, XRD and XPS. The catalytic activities and stability of the catalysts were tested in a fixed reactor. H2 yield and H2 concentration through Ni-CaO-La2O3 with 20 wt% Ni reaches 86.02% and 92.24% during pre-breakthrough period, respectively, which is attributed to sufficient Ni active sites on the surface and good Ni dispersion. Catalytic activities of Ni-CaO-La2O3 with 20 wt% Ni maintain stable during sorption-enhanced steam reforming reaction, but CO2 sorption capacity slightly decreases due to blockage of pores and size increase of CaO particles within nine sorption/desorption cycles. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The work investigates a new potential feedstock source for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) driven biocrude production. Specifically, the focus is set on utilizing spent mushroom compost (SMC), the primary waste by-product from mushroom farming. It is considered as a feedstock for HTL conversion due to its organic nature (e.g. straw, horse manure and sphagnum) and ample availability with an annual production of over 17 million metric tonnes, globally. Locally acquired samples were analysed and converted hydrothermally. A biocrude yield of 48% on dry ash-free (DAF) basis was obtained but it was accompanied by a solid fraction (organics and inorganics) of 50% on dry basis, considered to be critically high in a continuous HTL context. Acid leaching (citric acid) of the SMC and co-liquefaction (with aspen wood (AW)) were investigated as means to decrease the solid fraction. Whereas the SMC leaching showed to be ineffective, co-liquefaction showed potential. The solid fraction could be reduced to half (24.5%) by mixing SMC:AW in a 1:3 mass ratio. © 2017

AB  - In this work, spent mushroom substrate (SMS) was co-pyrolyzed with oil shale semi-coke (OSS) to investigate the effects of the OSS on yield and chemical compositions of bio-oil product. Oil shale semi-coke was mixed with biomass in the OSS/SMS mass ratios of 0:1, 1:4, 1:1, 4:1 and 1:0. The pyrolysis experiment was carried out by using a lab-scale pyrolysis reactor. The experimental results showed that the addition of the OSS led to an increase of bio-oil yield. The maximum of bio-oil yield was obtained at the OSS/SMS mass ratio of 1:1. The characteristics of the obtained oils were studied by elemental analyzer, FTIR and GC–MS. It was found that the bio-oil obtained from the pyrolysis of mixed SMS and OSS had higher carbon and hydrogen content, lower oxygen content than those produced by the pyrolysis of biomass alone. Moreover, there were more aromatics and aliphatic compounds in the obtained bio-oil product. These variations indicated that the existence of the OSS significantly influenced the chemical compositions of bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tetrahydrofuran and its alkylated derivatives of the cyclic ether family are promising future biofuels because of their advantages over other biofuels e.g. ethanol. The reaction of tetrahydrofuran with OH radicals was studied at 800-1340 K and near 1.5 bar. The reaction can proceed via either direct or indirect abstraction pathways in an overall exothermic process. The indirect channel proceeded via an addition-elimination mechanism in which all the stationary points along the reaction pathway were below the energy of the reactants. The THF + OH (R1) reaction proceeded via either direct or indirect H-abstraction from various sites leading to the formation of tetrahydrofuran-2-yl (THF-R2) or tetrahydrofuran-3-yl (THF-R3) radicals and water. Theoretical kinetic analysis revealed that both channels are important under conditions relevant to combustion.

AB  - A new enzyme catalyst is formed by fabricating gold nano particle (GNP)-glucose oxidase (GOx) clusters that are then attached to polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotube (CNT) with cross-linkable terephthalaldehyde (TPA) (TPA/[CNT/PEI/GOx-GNP]). Especially, amide bonds belonging to TPA play an anchor role for incorporating rigid bonding among GNP, GOx and CNT/PEI, while middle size GNP is well bonded with thiol group of GOx to form strong GNP-GOx cluster. Those bonds are identified by chemical and electrochemical characterizations like XPS and cyclic voltammogram. The anchording effect of amide bonds induces fast electron transfer and strong chemical bonding, resulting in enhancements in (i) catalytic activity, (ii) amount of immobilized GOx and (ii) performance of enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) including the catalyst. Regarding the catalytic activity, the TPA/[CNT/PEI/GOx-GNP] produces high electron transfer rate constant (6 s−1), high glucose sensitivity (68 μA mM−1 cm−2), high maximum current density (113 μA cm−2), low charge transfer resistance (17.0 Ω cm2) and long-lasting durability while its chemical structure is characterized by XPS confirming large portion of amide bond. In EBC measurement, it has high maximum power density (0.94 mW cm−2) compatible with catalytic acitivity measurements. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyanobacteria engineered for production of biofuels and biochemicals from carbon dioxide represent a promising area of research in relation to a sustainable economy. Previously, we have succeeded in producing isopropanol from cellular acetyl-CoA by means of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 into which a synthetic metabolic pathway was introduced. The isopropanol production by this synthetic metabolic pathway requires acetate; therefore, the cells grown under photosynthetic conditions have to be transferred to a dark and anaerobic conditions to produce acetate. In this study, we achieved acetate production under photosynthetic conditions by S. elongatus PCC 7942 into which we introduced the pta gene encoding phosphate acetyltransferase from Escherichia coli. The metabolic modification (via pta introduction) of the isopropanol-producing strain enabled production of isopropanol under photosynthetic conditions. During 14 days of production, the titer of isopropanol reached 0.55 mM (33.1 mg/l) with an intermediate product, acetone, at 0.21 mM (12.2 mg/l). © 2016 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Partially sulfonated polystyrene (PSS), synthesized from expanded polystyrene waste (EPS), was used as a catalyst for free fatty acid (FFA) conversion in non-edible oils. Acidic and water absorbing properties of the PSS facilitated the catalytic action for the FFA conversion by esterification reaction. The reaction was done on simulated acid oil (WCO) containing oleic acid and sunflower oil, and rubber seed oil (RSO). Effects of temperature, catalyst amount and alcohol to acid molar ratio were studied. FFA conversion increased with each of these factors. The advantage of this heterogeneous catalyst is that it is efficient as commercial ion exchange resin and easily removable from the reaction mixture. PSS is found to substantially reduce the acid value of WCO and RSO from 17 to 3.2 mg KOH/g and from 28.8 to 4.8 mg KOH/g respectively at 75°C. The WCO and RSO with reduced acid value may be used as a feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oils derived from low-value or waste biomass have been shown to be useful as low-cost, sustainable additives to improve the adhesion or moisture resistance of bituminous asphalt binder. The chemical profile of bio-oil is complex, and identifying the most active compounds in the mixture and understanding how they work to modify bitumen properties is essential for synthesizing bio-based additives with desired characteristics and performance. Hexadecanamide and hexadecanoic acid, two surfactants prevalent in both animal- and plant-derived bio-oils, are notable candidates as active compounds responsible for altering the colloidal or interfacial properties of bitumen. In this study, pure forms of these surfactants were mixed into bitumen to examine their effects on binder composition and morphology. AFM and FTIR data show that the amide strongly separated from the mixture, much of it crystallizing at the exposed surface. The DFT-based studies indicate that self-assembly of amide molecules is energetically preferred to adsorption of amides to asphaltenes or wax crystals in bitumen. The acid seemed to mix in well but induced the growth of a unique morphology at the glass interface. However, in combination, the amide and acid improve each other's solubility without strongly interacting with each other. Other molecules in bio-oil may similarly work to improve the solubility of the total mixture and make it an effective surface-modifying additive. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste Cyanophyta biomass at different temperatures (factor A, 260–420 °C), times (factor B, 5–75 min) and algae/water (a/w) ratios (factor C, 0.02–0.3) by single reaction condition and Response Surface Method (RSM) experiments was investigated. By single reaction condition runs, maximum total bio-oil yield (29.24%) was obtained at 350 °C, 60 min and 0.25 a/w ratio. Maximum bio-oil HHV of 40.04 MJ/kg and energy recovery of 51.09% was achieved at 350 °C, 30 min, 0.1 a/w ratio and 350 °C, 60 min, 0.25 a/w ratio, respectively. RSM results indicate that effect of AB interaction was significant on light bio-oil yield. Both AC and AB had more remarkable influence than BC on heavy bio-oil yield and aqueous total organic carbon (TOC) recovery whereas BC was noticeable on ammonia nitrogen (NH3[sbnd]N) recovery in aqueous products. By model-based optimization of highest bio-oil yield, the highest bio-oil yield reached 31.79%, increasing by 8.72% after RSM optimization, and light and heavy bio-oil yield was 17.44% and 14.35%, respectively. Long-chain alkanes, alkenes, ketones, fatty acids, phenols, benzenes, amides, naphthalenes were the main components in light bio-oil. Some alcohols, phenols and aromatics were primarily found in heavy bio-oil. Solid residue after HTL consisted of numerous microparticles (∼5 μm) observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) analysis shows these particles primarily contained C, O, Mg, P and microelements, derived from Cyanophyta cells. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass from various types of wood has become a renewable resource for production of biofuels and biobased chemicals. Because xylan is the major component of wood hemicelluloses, highly efficient enzymes to enhance xylan hydrolysis can improve the use of lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, a xylanolytic gene cluster was identified from the crude oil-degrading thermophilic strain Geobacillus thermodenitrificans NG80-2. The enzymes involved in xylan hydrolysis, which include two xylanases (XynA1, XynA2), three β-xylosidases (XynB1, XynB2, XynB3), and one α-l-arabinofuranosidase (AbfA), have many unique features, such as high pH tolerance, high thermostability, and a broad substrate range. The three β-xylosidases were highly resistant to inhibition by product (xylose) accumulation. Moreover, the combination of xylanase, β-xylosidase, and α-l-arabinofuranosidase exhibited the largest synergistic action on xylan degradation (XynA2, XynB1, and AbfA on oat spelt or beechwood xylan; XynA2, XynB3, and AbfA on birchwood xylan). We have demonstrated that the proposed enzymatic cocktail almost completely converts complex xylan to xylose and arabinofuranose and has great potential for use in the conversion of plant biomass into biofuels and biochemicals. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is emerging as a promising route for the production of liquid fuels from biomass. However, pyrolysis-derived bio-oil needs to be upgraded prior to its utilization as a fuel and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is an important catalytic step for its upgrade. Design of suitable catalysts with high activity and selectivity for the HDO process requires detailed understanding of the underlying catalytic reaction mechanism. As ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts have been proposed to be the most effective HDO catalysts, the complete reaction network for HDO of furfural, a representative of furanic compounds present in bio-oil, is elucidated in this study on the Ru(0 0 1) surface by using first-principles density functional theory calculations. The reaction pathways for the formation of furfuryl alcohol (FA), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), methylfuran (MF), cyclopentanol, 1,2- and 1,5-pentane diols, furan, and pentanes are established. Furan ring-opening is facile on Ru surfaces and our calculations predict pentane formation to be thermodynamically and kinetically favored in the vapor-phase hydrodeoxygenation of furfural on Ru surfaces. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Rice straw is deemed as an attractive feedstock for biofuel and platform chemical production owing to its renewability and availability on regional as well as global scale. However, the recalcitrance of rice straw compels an ancillary pretreatment step in the bioconversion process that effectively fractionates the lignocellulosic components. The present article evaluates the OrganoCat process as a pretreatment for rice straw and its effect on the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis owing to the novel application of OrganoCat pretreatment to rice straw. The maximum cellulose recovery of 98.99%, hemicellulose solubilization and lignin removal of 88.79% and 71.46% respectively was achieved during the OrganoCat pretreatment of rice straw along with improved cellulose accessibility leading to maximum glucose release of 160.57 ± 2.7 g/kg untreated rice straw at different pretreatment conditions included under the range of operating conditions examined in the present study. OrganoCat pretreatment also led to effective fractionation and cell wall breakdown, thereby, enhancing the cellulose accessibility as distinctly evident from the adsorption studies and indirectly deduced from SEM and FT-IR analysis. The material balance of the input & output streams indicated an efficient one-step fractionation with 50% catalyst recovery and 80% solvent recovery. The significance of the obtained results are reported and discussed to gain an insight into the overall potential of the process. © 2017

AB  - This work was aimed at proposing a flexible and reliable framework based on combination of three soft computing techniques, i.e., artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, and fuzzy systems for multi-objective exergetic optimization of continuous photobiohydrogen production process from syngas by Rhodospirillum rubrum bacterium. To this end, artificial neural network (ANN) coupled with fuzzy clustering method (FCM) to model exergetic outputs on the basis of input variables. The outputs of modeling system were then fed into a novel optimization approach developed by hybridizing additive linear interdependent fuzzy multi-objective optimization (ALIFMO) and the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The optimization was carried out to minimize the normalized exergy destruction and maximize the rational and process exergetic efficiencies, simultaneously. The solutions of the proposed approach were also compared with conventional fuzzy multi-objective optimization procedure with independent objectives. Overall, the modeling system predicted the exergetic parameters of photobioreactor with a coefficient of determination higher than 0.90. Furthermore, the optimization approach suggested syngas flow rate of 13.35 mL/min and agitation speed of 383.34 rpm as the best operational condition by considering the preferences of process exergy efficiency, rational exergy efficiency, and normalized exergy destruction, respectively. This condition could yield the normalized exergy destruction of 1.56, process exergetic efficiency of 21.66%, and rational exergetic efficiency of 85.65%. The obtained results showed the superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional fuzzy method in optimizing the complex biofuel production systems. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Currently, the catalytic conversion of biomass-derived compounds into biofuels is of great significance in terms of environmental protection and sustainable development. Among them, valeric esters derived from γ-valerolactone (GVL) are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels. Herein, the highly efficient one-pot transformation of GVL to produce a series of valeric esters was successfully achieved over novel ZrO2-incorporated ZnAl2O4-composite-supported Cu-based catalysts. An extensive investigation gave clear evidence that the incorporation of ZrO2 into composites could lead to the enhanced metal dispersion and surface acidity. Especially, the catalyst with a Zr/Zn mass ratio of 0.2 exhibited the best selectivity of 99% in the transformation of GVL into pentyl valerate to date, together with a comparable conversion of 91% with respect to the Cu-based catalyst previously reported. The superior catalytic performance was attributable to the surface cooperation effect between highly dispersed active copper species and abundant surface acid sites. Especially, different surface types of acidic sites on catalysts could induce the reaction to efficiently proceed in different paths. The present work provides a valuable approach for precious metal substitution research in future large-scale biorefineries. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is a fungal extracellular oxidoreductase which fuels lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase with electrons during cellulose degradation. Interdomain electron transfer between the flavin and cytochrome domain in CDH, preceding the electron flow to lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase, is known to be pH dependent, but the exact mechanism of this regulation has not been experimentally proven so far. Methods To investigate the structural aspects underlying the domain interaction in CDH, hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX-MS) with improved proteolytic setup (combination of nepenthesin-1 with rhizopuspepsin), native mass spectrometry with ion mobility and electrostatics calculations were used. Results HDX-MS revealed pH-dependent changes in solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding at the interdomain interface. Electrostatics calculations identified these differences to result from charge neutralization by protonation and together with ion mobility pointed at higher electrostatic repulsion between CDH domains at neutral pH. In addition, we uncovered extensive O-glycosylation in the linker region and identified the long-unknown exact cleavage point in papain-mediated domain separation. Conclusions Transition of CDH between its inactive (open) and interdomain electron transfer-capable (closed) state is shown to be governed by changes in the protein surface electrostatics at the domain interface. Our study confirms that the interdomain electrostatic repulsion is the key factor modulating the functioning of CDH. General significance The results presented in this paper provide experimental evidence for the role of charge repulsion in the interdomain electron transfer in cellobiose dehydrogenases, which is relevant for exploiting their biotechnological potential in biosensors and biofuel cells. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sulfonic acid groups functionalized aromatic carbon microspheres (Ar-CMSs–SO3H) were first successfully fabricated directly from waste Camellia oleifera shells by simple steps in the assistance of phloroglucinol. As a heterogeneous solid Brønsted acid catalyst, the as-prepared Ar-CMSs–SO3H showed considerably high activity because of its numerous spherical microstructure and abundant surface sulfonic acid groups (–SO3H). Subsequently, the as-prepared Ar-CMSs–SO3H was applied to the synthesis of biofuels 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) from biological platform compounds 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The catalytic results showed that both sulfonation conditions in the course of Ar-CMSs–SO3H preparation and catalytic reaction conditions in the course of EMF synthesis had a significant effect on the EMF yield and HMF conversion rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative techno-economic analysis (TEA) of five conversion pathways from biomass to gasoline-, jet-, and diesel-range hydrocarbons via indirect liquefaction with a specific focus on pathways utilizing oxygenated intermediates. The four emerging pathways of interest are compared with one conventional pathway (Fischer-Tropsch) for the production of the hydrocarbon blendstocks. The processing steps of the four emerging pathways include biomass-to-syngas via indirect gasification, syngas clean-up, conversion of syngas to alcohols/oxygenates followed by conversion of alcohols/oxygenates to hydrocarbon blendstocks via dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation. Conversion of biomass-derived syngas to oxygenated intermediates occurs via three different pathways, producing: (i) mixed alcohols over a MoS2catalyst, (ii) mixed oxygenates (a mixture of C2+oxygenated compounds, predominantly ethanol, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate) using an Rh-based catalyst, and (iii) ethanol from syngas fermentation. This is followed by the conversion of oxygenates/alcohols to fuel-range olefins in two approaches: (i) mixed alcohols/ethanol to 1-butanol rich mixture via Guerbet reaction, followed by alcohol dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation, and (ii) mixed oxygenates/ethanol to isobutene rich mixture and followed by oligomerization and hydrogenation. The design features a processing capacity of 2000 tonnes/day (2205 short tons) of dry biomass. The minimum fuel selling prices (MFSPs) for the four developing pathways range from $3.40 to $5.04 per gasoline-gallon equivalent (GGE), in 2011 US dollars. Sensitivity studies show that MFSPs can be improved with co-product credits and are comparable to the commercial Fischer-Tropsch benchmark ($3.58/GGE). Overall, this comparative TEA study documents potential economics for the developmental biofuel pathways via mixed oxygenates. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Due to the negative effects of acids and aldehydes, crude bio-oil has to be upgraded before its application as a high-graded fuel. A novel method for bio-oil upgrading by simultaneous catalytic esterification and alkylation with azeotropic water removal using n-butanol and 2-methylfuran was investigated in this work. Under the optimum upgrading conditions, water content was evidently decreased from 27.82% to 3.21%, and acid number was reduced from 41.12 mg NaOH/g to 6.17 mg NaOH/g. High heating value of upgraded bio-oil was more than 2 times higher than crude bio-oil and the other properties were also improved significantly. GC-MS analysis indicated that labile acids, aldehydes, ketones and lower alcohols were transformed to stable target products. The introduction of 2-methylfuran effectively suppressed acetalization reactions and the yields of more stable alkylation products were higher than acetals. In addition, oxygenated liquid fuel and sugars and their derivatives could be effectively separated from upgraded bio-oil by H2O/CH2Cl2 extraction. The main product in crude sugars part was butyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, which was formed by means of hydrolysis of levoglucosan and the following glycosidation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the influence of pyrolysis oil components on the activity, selectivity and deactivation of nickel-based catalysts during hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is fundamental to optimise the process for long-term operation and to develop new catalyst formulations. In this study, HDO of a bio-oil light phase and an aqueous solution of phenol (as a model compound) were investigated over fresh and regenerated NiCu/Al2O3 in a batch reactor at 250 and 340 °C. The produced upgraded oil over the fresh catalyst contained significant quantities of ketones and phenolic compounds, which were not further converted during hydrotreatment. In the bio-oil environment, the regenerated catalyst showed only marginally lower activity (15% less H2 consumption) in comparison to the fresh one. In contrast, phenol in water was completely converted over fresh NiCu/Al2O3 with high selectivity towards cyclohexanol at 250 °C and cyclohexane at 340 °C. Once exposed to bio-oil the catalyst no longer showed activity towards phenol conversion in water. Characterization of the spent catalysts indicated the formation of Ni3S2 in addition to coke and alkali metal deposition on the catalyst surface. Other nickel-based catalysts (with different supports and loadings) and two bio-oils with varying sulphur concentration and no minerals were also investigated. Overall the results elucidated that the catalyst activity, selectivity and deactivation of certain reaction paths was mainly determined by the presence of sulphur. By limiting the effects of sulphur poisoning, Ni-catalysts may be considered for the production of fine chemicals, such as ketones and phenols, in addition to fuel synthesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pavlova microalga was pyrolysed in presence of titania based catalysts in a fixed bed reactor at various temperatures. The effects of catalysts on Pavlova microalga pyrolysis were investigated. A large fraction of the starting energy (∼ 63–74% daf) was recovered in the bio-oils when the catalysts were used. The bio-oil yield was 20% higher in presence of Ni/TiO2 (22.55 wt%) at 500 °C. The High Heating Values of the produced bio-oils were in the range of ∼ 35–37 MJ/kg and suffered strong deoxygenation, with O content (% daf) diminished from 51 wt% to ∼ 9–12 wt%. The 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resounance and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry suggested that the titania catalysts enlarged the aliphatics and aromatic compounds and decreased oxygenates in the bio-oils. Ni/TiO2 had the greatest activity in increasing aliphatic protons (60%) and decreasing coke formation. Its enhanced cracking activity was due to its higher availability on the catalyst surface, compared to Co and Ce, and to strong interaction between Ni and TiO2 support. Despite the fact that the bio-oils were partially de-nitrogenated, the N-content still represent a major limitation for their use as bio-fuels without further upgrading. © 2017

AB  - Soybean is currently recognized as a high value crop, allowing the manufacture of a broad range of products. This contribution investigates the synergies resulting from coupling the production of biodiesel with soybean processing facilities, defining the core structure of a soy-based biorefinery. Simulations in Aspen Plus® were performed, employing a detailed modeling framework. A base case scenario was established, allowing a detailed economic assessment of the process, a profitability and risk analysis, as well as the identification of plant integration opportunities. Increased process integration leads to an 18% decrease of the biodiesel production costs, corresponding to a 9% reduction of the break-even price (from 875 to 798 $/t of biodiesel). This is accompanied by an overall decrease of hot and cold utilities consumption of 20%, with a heat exchanger network that performs closely to the energy recovery targets determined through pinch technology. The need for fresh water in biodiesel production is also completely eliminated and the generation of wastewater is mitigated by 9%. The risk analysis, carried out through Monte Carlo simulations, shows that the new plant configuration becomes more robust to variations in the key economic factors considered. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bio-oil from rice hull fast pyrolysis was distillated under reduced pressure at 0.005 Mpa, then mixed with ethanol (2:3 by weight). The mixture was subjected to catalytic co-cracking over Ni-ZSM-5/MCM-41 molecular sieves in a fixed-bed at 500 °C and 3.75 h−1 of the WHSV. The distillation results showed the distilled bio-oil, compared with raw bio-oil, contained lower oxygen content (decreased from 45.91 wt.% in raw bio-oil to 33.74 wt.%), higher (H/C)eff ratio (0.35) and HHV value (22.81 MJ/kg). The ethanol was involved in the ketonization, esterification, aromatization and dehydration during the catalytic co-cracking of distilled bio-oil and ethanol. The Ni loaded on ZSM-5/MCM-41 molecular sieves reduced char formation compared with ZSM-5/MCM-41. The ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst exhibited higher activity in the esterification and aromatization, which converted acids in upgraded bio-oil to esters, aromatics or phenols. The Ni-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalysts showed excellent activity that transformed acids to ketones by ketonization process. The 6% Ni-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst performed the good activity with the minimum char formation (7.3 wt.%) and higher upgraded bio-oil (40.8 wt.%). Moreover, the acid content in the upgraded bio-oil dropped to 0.1 wt.% and the total concentration of CO2 and CO in the gas products was 36.8 vol.%. © 2017

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells can generate electricity directly from the chemical energy of biofuels in physiological fluids, but their power density is significantly limited by the performance of the cathode which is based on oxygen reduction for in vivo applications. An oxygen-independent and membrane-less glucose biobattery was prepared that consists of a dealloyed nanoporous gold (NPG) supported glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) bioanode, immobilised with the assistance of conductive polymer/Os redox polymer composites, and a solid-state NPG/MnO2 cathode. In a solution containing 10 mM glucose, a maximum power density of 2.3 µW cm−2 at 0.21 V and an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.49 V were registered as a biobattery. The potential of the discharged MnO2 could be recovered, enabling a proof-of-concept biobattery/supercapacitor hybrid device. The resulting device exhibited a stable performance for 50 cycles of self-recovery and galvanostatic discharge as a supercapacitor at 0.1 mA cm−2 over a period of 25 h. The device could be discharged at current densities up to 2 mA cm−2 supplying a maximum instantaneous power density of 676 μW cm−2, which is 294 times higher than that from the biobattery alone. A mechanism for the recovery of the potential of the cathode, analogous to that of RuO2 (Electrochim. Acta 42(23), 3541–3552) is described. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Polyaniline-silver (PANI-Ag)/ferritin (Frt)/glucose oxidase (GOx) biocompatible anode was utilized for creating power from glucose. The synthesized nanocomposite was investigated by EIS (Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), CV (Cyclic voltammetry), and LSV (Linear sweep voltammetry) to know the morphology, crystallinity and electrochemical behaviour of the nanocomposite. The electroactive support (PANI-Ag) was utilized for the immobilization of the enzyme (GOx) and a biocompatible mediator (Frt) to enhance the electrical signals. The electrochemical estimations of the manufactured bioanode were done by utilizing cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The current density obtained by the PANI-Ag/Frt/GOx bioanode was observed to be 25.40 ± 2 mA cm-2 at 40 mM of glucose concentration at a scan rate of 100 mVs-1. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Microwave assisted with alkaline (MW-A) condition was applied in the pretreatment of swine manure, and the effect of the pretreatment on anaerobic treatment and biogas production was evaluated in this study. The two main microwaving (MW) parameters, microwaving power and reaction time, were optimized for the pretreatment. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the effect of alkaline microwaving process for manure pretreatment at various values of pH and energy input. Results showed that the manure disintegration degree was maximized of 63.91% at energy input of 54 J/g and pH of 12.0, and variance analysis indicated that pH value played a more important role in the pretreatment than in energy input. Anaerobic digestion results demonstrated that MW-A pretreatment not only significantly increased cumulative biogas production, but also shortened the duration for a stable biogas production rate. Therefore, the alkaline microwaving pretreatment could become an alternative process for effective treatment of swine manure. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - A new continuous-flow ultrasound assisted oxidative desulfurization (UAOD) process was developed in order to decrease energy and aqueous phase consumption. In this process the aqueous phase is injected below the horn tip leading to enhanced mixing of the phases. Diesel fuel as the oil phase with sulfur content of 1550 ppmw and an appropriate mixture of hydrogen peroxide and formic acid as the aqueous phase were used. At the first step, the optimized condition for the sulfur removal has been obtained in the batch mode operation. Hence, the effect of more important oxidation parameters; oxidant-to-sulfur molar ratio, acid-to-sulfur molar ratio and sonication time were investigated. Then the optimized conditions were obtained using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) technique. Afterwards, some experiments corresponding to the best batch condition and also with objective of minimizing the residence time and aqueous phase to fuel volume ratio have been conducted in a newly designed double-compartment reactor with injection of the aqueous phase to evaluate the process in a continuous flow operation. In addition, the effect of nozzle diameter has been examined. Significant improvement on the sulfur removal was observed specially in lower sonication time in the case of dispersion method in comparison with the conventional contact between two phases. Ultimately, the flow pattern induced by ultrasonic device, and also injection of the aqueous phase were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively by capturing the sequential images. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Saccharification is the most crucial and cost-intensive process in second generation biofuel production. The deficiency of β-glucosidase in commercial enzyme leads to incomplete biomass hydrolysis. The decomposition of biomass at high temperature environments leads us to isolate thermotolerant microbes with β-glucosidase production potential. Results: A total of 11 isolates were obtained from compost and cow dung samples that were able to grow at 50 °C. On the basis of qualitative and quantitative estimation of β-glucosidase enzyme production, Bacillus subtilis RA10 was selected for further studies. The medium components and growth conditions were optimized and β-glucosidase enzyme production was enhanced up to 19.8-fold. The β-glucosidase from B. subtilis RA10 retained 78% of activity at 80 °C temperature and 68.32% of enzyme activity was stable even at 50 °C after 48 h of incubation. The supplementation of β-glucosidase from B. subtilis RA10 into commercial cellulase enzyme resulted in 1.34-fold higher glucose release. Furthermore, β-glucosidase was also functionally elucidated by cloning and overexpression of full length GH1 family β-glucosidase gene from B. subtilis RA10. The purified protein was characterized as thermostable β-glucosidase enzyme. Conclusions: The thermostable β-glucosidase enzyme from B. subtilis RA10 would facilitate efficient saccharification of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugar. Consequently, after saccharification, thermostable β-glucosidase enzyme would be recovered and reused to reduce the cost of overall bioethanol production process. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - We introduce a novel approach for the high-value production of nano/micro hierarchical structured Sn anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by utilizing microalgal biomass residues that collaterally form during oil extraction for biofuel production. The Sn/C composites made from the oil-extracted microalgal biomass residues (the extracted Sn/C) exhibit the following advantages as high-energy-density anodes: 1) a homogeneous distribution of Sn nanoparticles in the carbon matrix (Sn/C), which efficiently relieves the strain caused by volume changes of the active materials; 2) a high porosity of Sn/C composites; and 3) a homogeneous distribution of the hetero elements N and P in the carbon matrix. Overall, the extracted Sn/C exhibit improved electrochemical performance in LIBs compared with the Sn/C composites made from the microalgal biomass residues without oil extraction (non-extracted Sn/C). The extracted Sn/C have improved rate capabilities (160.0 and 72.9 mAh g−1 for the extracted Sn/C and the non-extracted Sn/C, respectively, at the 80th cycle, 3.5 A g−1) and improved cycle performances (511.7 and 493.2 mAh g−1 for the extracted Sn/C and the non-extracted Sn/C, respectively, at the 300th cycle, 200 mA g−1). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodynamics of gas–liquid two-phase flow in micropacked beds are studied with a new experimental setup. The pressure drop, residence time distribution, and liquid holdup are measured with gas and liquid flow rates varying from 4 to 14 sccm and 0.1 to 1 mL/min, respectively. Key parameters are identified to control the experimentally observed hydrodynamics, including transient start-up procedure, gas and liquid superficial velocities, particle and packed bed diameters, and physical properties of the liquids. Contrary to conventional large packed beds, our results demonstrate that in these microsystems, capillary forces have a large effect on pressure drop and liquid holdup, while gravity can be neglected. A mathematical model describes the hydrodynamics in the micropacked beds by considering the contribution of capillary forces, and its predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 4694–4704, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Biofuels can contribute significantly to reducing environmental damage. Lignocellulosic bioethanol can be an alternative to fossil fuels and is of great strategic importance to Brazil. In this context, the life cycle assessment (LCA) of bioethanol production from cattle manure (CM) was studied. CM is a biomass rich in cellulose that can be converted to glucose and other fermentable sugars. In the LCA, 1000 kg of CM were used as a functional unit of processing. The ReCiPe method and the EcoInvent libraries were used in SimaPro software version 7.3.2. We considered the following categories of impact: climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation, particulate matter formation, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, ionizing radiation, agricultural land occupation, urban land occupation, natural land transformation, water depletion, mineral resource depletion and fossil resource depletion. The categories damaged were human health, ecosystems and natural resources. The results obtained in the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and the proposed changes in the process contributed to the reduction of environmental impacts. The inputs/outputs that made the greatest contribution to environmental impacts were energy consumption, drying emissions, sulfuric acid in the pretreatment, buffer in the enzymatic hydrolysis and sodium phosphate in the fermentation. Bioethanol production from CM has a low impact on most of the categories and is a process that can be improved to reduce its impact mainly by changing the energy type. In the LCIA, it was observed that the CM bioethanol production eliminates the need for disposal treatment of the manure and uses residual raw material in a biofuel production, thus counterbalancing the environmental impacts of the bioethanol process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Syngas fermentation, the bioconversion of CO, CO2, and H2 to biofuels and chemicals, has undergone considerable optimization for industrial applications. Even more, full-scale plants for ethanol production from syngas fermentation by pure cultures are being built worldwide. The composition of syngas depends on the feedstock gasified and the gasification conditions. However, it remains unclear how different syngas mixtures affect the metabolism of carboxidotrophs, including the ethanol/acetate ratios. In addition, the potential application of mixed cultures in syngas fermentation and their advantages over pure cultures have not been deeply explored. In this work, the effects of CO2 and H2 on the CO metabolism by pure and mixed cultures were studied and compared. For this, a CO-enriched mixed culture and two isolated carboxidotrophs were grown with different combinations of syngas components (CO, CO:H2, CO:CO2, or CO:CO2:H2). Results: The CO metabolism of the mixed culture was somehow affected by the addition of CO2 and/or H2, but the pure cultures were more sensitive to changes in gas composition than the mixed culture. CO2 inhibited CO oxidation by the Pleomorphomonas-like isolate and decreased the ethanol/acetate ratio by the Acetobacterium-like isolate. H2 did not inhibit ethanol or H2 production by the Acetobacterium and Pleomorphomonas isolates, respectively, but decreased their CO consumption rates. As part of the mixed culture, these isolates, together with other microorganisms, consumed H2 and CO2 (along with CO) for all conditions tested and at similar CO consumption rates (2.6 ± 0.6 mmol CO L-1 day-1), while maintaining overall function (acetate production). Providing a continuous supply of CO by membrane diffusion caused the mixed culture to switch from acetate to ethanol production, presumably due to the increased supply of electron donor. In parallel with this change in metabolic function, the structure of the microbial community became dominated by Geosporobacter phylotypes, instead of Acetobacterium and Pleomorphomonas phylotypes. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for the potential of mixed-culture syngas fermentation, since the CO-enriched mixed culture showed high functional redundancy, was resilient to changes in syngas composition, and was capable of producing acetate or ethanol as main products of CO metabolism. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Waste newspaper (WP) was first co-pyrolyzed with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to enhance the yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons. The effects of WP: HDPE feed ratio (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100) and temperature (500–800 °C) on products distribution were investigated and the interaction mechanism during co-pyrolysis was also proposed. Maximum yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons reached 85.88% (feed ratio 50:50 wt.%, 600 °C). Hydrogen supplements and deoxidation by HDPE and subsequently fragments recombination result in the conversion of aldehydes and ketones into branched hydrocarbons. Radicals from WP degradation favor the secondary crack for HDPE products resulting in the formation of linear hydrocarbons with low carbon number. Hydrocarbons with activated radical site from HDPE degradation were interacted with hydroxyl from WP degradation promoting the formation of linear long chain alcohols. Moreover, co-pyrolysis significantly enhanced condensable oil qualities, which were close to commercial diesel No. 0. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study deals with the application of an advanced oxidation process combining UV irradiation in the presence of the photocatalyst titanium dioxide (TiO2), as an effective pretreatment method of wheat straw as means for increasing its biodegradability for increased biogas production by anaerobic digestion (AD). Especially attention was paid in oxidation of the lignin in straw, besides release the sugars from the lignocellulosic structure of straw. Specifically, four different TiO2 concentrations (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% (w/w) TiO2) were tested at three different irradiation times (0, 1, 2, and 3 h). Products of lignin-fraction oxidation, namely, vanillic acid, ferullic acid and acetic acid were quantified for each set of pretreatment conditions. Subsequently, biochemical methane potentials (BMPs) assays were conducted under thermophilic conditions from differentially pretreated samples and the pretreatment with the best performance was further tested in continuous mode operation. From BMP assays, 1.5% (w/w) TiO2/straw at 3 h of UV light exposure pretreatment resulted in 37% (p &lt; 0.05) increase in methane yield and 25% in CSTRs. It was concluded that the presence of TiO2 and the products of lignin oxidation did not inhibit the AD process. Finally, a simplified energy assessment showed that all pretreatment conditions become feasible when amounts of substrate to be treated are greater than the threshold value of 1.15 g. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Propylsulfonic acid (PrSO3H) derivatised solid acid catalysts have been prepared by post-modification of mesoporous SBA-15 silica with mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS), and the impact of co-derivatisation with octyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) groups to impart hydrophobicity to the catalyst was investigated. Turnover frequencies (TOFs) for acetic acid esterification with methanol increase with PrSO3H surface coverage across both families, suggesting a cooperative effect between adjacent acid sites at high acid site densities. Esterification activity is further promoted upon co-functionalisation with hydrophobic octyl chains, with inverse gas chromatography (IGC) measurements indicating that the increased activity correlates with decreased surface polarity or increased hydrophobicity. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - A new enzyme catalyst consisting of pyrenecarboxaldehyde (PCA) and glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilized on polyethyleneimine (PEI) and a carbon nanotube supporter (CNT/PEI/[PCA/GOx]) is suggested, and the performance and stability of an enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) using the new catalyst are evaluated. Using PCA, the amount of immobilized GOx increases (3.3 U mg -1) and the electron transfer rate constant of the CNT/PEI/[PCA/GOx] is promoted (11.51 s -1). Also, the catalyst induces excellent EBC performance (maximum power density (MPD) of 2.1 mW cm -2), long-lasting stability (maintenance of 93% of the initial MPD after 4 weeks) and superior catalytic activity (flavin adenine dinucleotide redox reaction rate of 0.62 mA cm -2 and Michaelis-Menten constant of 0.99 mM). These characteristics are ascribed to effects of (i) electron collection due to hydrophobic interactions, (ii) electron transfer pathways due to c-conjugated bonds and (iii) enzyme stabilization due to π-hydrogen bonds that are newly induced by the PCA/GOx composite. The existence of such positive interactions is properly verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and enzyme activity measurements. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Sludge taken from a wastewater treatment plant of the petrochemical industry was dewatered and pyrolyzed to produce liquid oil as an alternative fuel via microwave heating. Element contents of dried sludge were 45.9 ± 3.85 wt.% carbon, 7.70 ± 1.43 wt.% hydrogen, 4.30 ± 0.77 wt.% nitrogen and 3.89 ± 0.52 wt.% sulfur. Two major thermal degradation peaks of sludge were determined during the microwave pyrolysis process, one at 325–498 K (most of the water was vaporized, and the weight loss was over 85 wt.%) and the other at 548–898 K for sludge constituent decomposition. Zn content was high in the dried raw material and residues. Other toxic elements such as Ni, Cr, Pb, As and Cd contents were 0.61–0.99, 0.18–0.46, 0.15–0.25, 0.018–0.034, and 0.006–0.017 mg/g, respectively. About 14–20 wt.% of oil was produced based on the dried sludge cake, and the oil major elements were C (69–72 wt.%), H (5.7–6.7 wt.%), N (1.9–2.2 wt.%), and S (0.58–0.82 wt.%). The heat values of liquid oils were 8700–9200 kcal/kg at 400–800 °C. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalysts play an important role in biofuel production but are rarely included in biofuel life cycle analysis (LCA). In this work, we estimate the cradle-to-gate energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Pt/γ-Al2O3, CoMo/γ-Al2O3, and ZSM-5, catalysts that could be used in processes to convert biomass to biofuels. We also consider the potential impacts of catalyst recovery and recycling. Integrating the energy and environmental impacts of CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and ZSM-5 into an LCA of renewable gasoline produced via in-situ and ex-situ fast pyrolysis of a blended woody feedstock revealed that the ZSM-5, with cradle-to-gate GHG emissions of 7.7 kg CO2e/kg, could influence net life-cycle GHG emissions of the renewable gasoline (1.7 gCO2e/MJ for the in-situ process, 1.2 gCO2e/MJ for the ex-situ process) by up to 14% depending on the loading rate. CoMo/γ-Al2O3 had a greater GHG intensity (9.6 kg CO2e/kg) than ZSM-5, however, it contributed approximately only 1% to the life-cycle GHG emissions of the renewable gasoline because of the small amount of this catalyst needed per kg of biofuel produced. Given that catalysts can contribute significantly to biofuel life-cycle GHG emissions depending on the GHG intensity of their production and their consumption rates, biofuel LCAs should consider the potential influence of catalysts on LCA results. © 2017

AB  - Nanoporous gold (NPG) electrodes were prepared by dealloying sputtered gold:silver alloys. Electrodes of different thicknesses and pore sizes areas were prepared by varying the temperature and duration of the dealloying procedure; these were then used as supports for FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) (Glomorella cingulata) and bilirubin oxidase (BOx) (Myrothecium verrucaria). Glucose dehydrogenase was immobilized by drop-casting a solution of the enzyme with an osmium redox polymer together with a crosslinked polymer, whereas bilirubin oxidase was attached covalently through carbodiimide coupling to a diazonium-modified NPG electrode. The stability of the bilirubin-oxidase-modified NPG electrode was significantly improved in comparison with that of a planar gold electrode. Enzyme fuel cells were also prepared; the optimal response was obtained with a BOx-modified NPG cathode (500 nm thickness) and a GDH-modified anode (300 nm), which generated power densities of 17.5 and 7.0 μW cm−2 in phosphate-buffered saline and artificial serum, respectively. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - -Valerolactone (GVL) is one of the versatile platform molecules and biofuel additives derived from the lignocellulosic biomass. Herein, the efficient synthesis of GVL from biobased ethyl levulinate (EL) using alcohol as both H-donor and solvent without an external hydrogen source has been achieved over porous Ti/Zr microspheres. The catalysts (TixZry) with different Ti/Zr molar ratios were synthesized using hexadecylamine (HDA) as a structure-directing agent via a sol-gel process combined with solvothermal treatment and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, NH3/CO2-TPD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and pyridine-IR. A high GVL yield of 90.1% at 100% EL conversion was obtained at 180 °C for 6 h over Ti2Zr8 in 2-propanol. The microspheric and porous structure, enhanced surface areas, and acid/base contents by the proper introduction of Ti species into Zr oxide were demonstrated to be responsible for the pronounced performance. The microspheric Ti2Zr8 porous catalyst could be reused at least six times with no decrease in catalytic activity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The production of energy from wood biomass is as old as humanity itself. In the last 20 years there has been enormous progress in research of torrefaction, pyrolysis and mainly gasification of biomass. Products from conventional pyrolysis of biomass are gas known as pyrolysis gas, a liquid condensate known as bio-oil and char named bio-char. Most of the articles dealing with convectional pyrolysis of biomass are focused on the production of bio-oil. Only some works deal with the possibility of producing high-quality syngas (H2 + CO) or hydrogen itself. For this purpose, the technology of microwave pyrolysis could be suitable. Microwaves can generate microplasma and hot spots, which promote heterogeneous catalytic reactions and produce a greater concentration of hydrogen in the resulting gas than convectional pyrolysis. In this work, an experimental study of spruce sawdust microwave pyrolysis was performed in the presence of catalysts to maximize the yield of hydrogen or syngas. Experiments were carried out in a microwave reactor with a power of 400 W. As catalysts char from sawdust, or sawdust char-doped with metal ions (Ni, Co, Fe) were used. Ions of metals were used to increase the yield of hydrogen (e.g. Nickel is widely used in the catalytic cracking of methane). The influence of the catalyst on the quantity of products (gas, liquid and solid) was studied, as well as the amount of hydrogen generated in the pyrolysis gas, or the amount of waste water in the liquid condensate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although the research of microalgae pyrolysis has been conducted for many years, there is a lack of investigations on energy efficiency and life cycle assessment. In this study, we investigated the biocrude yield and energy efficiency of direct pyrolysis, microalgae residue pyrolysis after lipid extraction (indirect pyrolysis), and different microalgae co-pyrolysis. This research also investigated the life cycle assessment of the three different pyrolysis pathways. A system boundary of Well-to-Wake (WTWa) was defined and included sub-process models, such as feedstock production, fuel production and pump-to-wheels (PTW) stages. The pathway of Isochrysis indirect pyrolysis shows the best performance in the mass ratio and energy ratio, produces the most kerosene component precursor, has the lowest WTWa total energy input, fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and resultes in the best energy efficiency. All the evidence indicates that Isochrysis R2 pathway is a potential and optimal pyrolysis pathway to liquid biofuels. The mass ratio of pyrolysis biocrude is shown to be the decisive factor for different microalgae species. The sensitivity analysis results also indicates that the life cycle indicators are particularly sensitive to the mass ratio of pyrolysis biocrude for microalgae-based hydrotreated pyrolysis aviation fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper intend to investigate the effects of biodiesel fuel blends comprising of waste-cooking oil and butanol-diesel (B10W10–B10W40) under steady-state conditions. Both particulate organic carbon (OC) and PM including PM2.5 and PM10 significantly decreased with the increasing percentage of biodiesel fuel blends. The fuel blend of B10W40 also demonstrated the most effective function in reducing the emissions of PM10 and PM2.5 in the volume by 59.4% and 57.7%, respectively. Moreover, the emissions of nitrogen oxides decreased with the blending of B10W10-B10W40 (13.9–28.5%), while the brake specific fuel consumption was substantially increased (5.69–13.4%). The overall biological toxicity of PM10 generated from the fuel tested in this study was determined according to Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis assay in human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells and micronucleus assay in CHO-K1 cells. In addition, the volume of more than 20% waste-cooking oil (B10W20 and B10W40) significantly reduced diesel-induced genotoxicity in lung cells and micronucleus formation in CHO-K1 cells. Collectively, these results indicated that biodiesel fuel blends with the butanol could be a potential alternative fuels for diesel engines because of its substantial property with a significant reduction of the PM-related genotoxicity and the emissions of PM, particulate OC, and NOX. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A systematic study of non-catalytic pyrolysis of saw dust has been carried out in a batch reactor (fixed bed mode) in the temperature range of 375–475 °C at the heating rate of 10 °C/min to optimize the reaction temperature for maximum liquid yield. Also, catalytic cracking of pyrolysis vapors was carried out using Y-Zeolite at 450 °C. Produced bio-oil has been characterized using elemental analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), 1H NMR and bio-char using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FT-IR and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). It has been observed that highest bio-oil yield of 26 wt.% was obtained at 450 °C without catalyst while the addition of catalyst reduces liquid yield. The obtained results showed that the bio-oil could be used as liquid fuel after upgradation and bio-char could be utilized for the generation of activated carbon. © 2017

AB  - Here, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), the monomer composing the second most abundant biopolymer, chitin, was efficiently converted into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) using ionic liquid (IL) catalysts in a water/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixture solvent. Various reaction parameters, including reaction temperature and time, DMSO/water mass ratios and catalyst dosage were optimized. A series of ILs with different structures were analyzed to explore their impact on GlcNAc conversion. The substrate scope was expanded from GlcNAc to D-glucosamine, chitin, chitosan and monosaccharides, although 5-HMF yields obtained from polymers and other monosaccharides were generally lower than those from GlcNAc. Moreover, the IL N-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([Hmim][HSO4]) exhibited the best catalyst performance (64.6% yield) when GlcNAc was dehydrated in a DMSO/water mixture at 180 °C for 6 h without the addition of extra catalysts. To summarize, these results could provide knowledge essential to the production of valuable chemicals that are derived from renewable marine resources and benefit biofuel-related applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Acid leaching and torrefaction were investigated as biomass pretreatments for fast pyrolysis of Pinus radiata. Both pretreatments were required to limit competitive primary and secondary reactions of pyrolysis vapours catalysed by water, organic acids, and inorganics present in the biomass. Torrefaction reduces the cost of acid leaching by providing the leaching reagent and eliminating the need for biomass rinsing prior to the leaching. It also reduces the biomass grinding costs, which helps offset the additional process costs of pretreating biomass. Acid leaching was required because pyrolysis of solely torrefied biomass was constrained by the high torrefaction temperatures required for significant bio-oil improvements, leading to low bio-oil yields due to the mass loss during torrefaction and increased char formation during pyrolysis. Finally, the reduced thermal conductivity of dry torrefied biomass increased the time avaliable for inorganics to catalyse primary reaction pathways during the biomass heating. The optimal pretreatment conditions were 1% acetic acid leaching at 30 °C for 4 h followed by torrefaction at 270 °C for 20 min. Pyrolysis of raw biomass yielded (dry basis) 55.3 wt% bio-oil, 25.0 wt%, char, and 12.5 wt% non-condensable gas, whereas pyrolysis of pretreated biomass yielded 57.8 wt% bio-oil, 23.7 wt%, char, and 11.5 wt% non-condensable gas. Integrating leaching and torrefaction as biomass pretreatments significantly reduced the heterogeneous and homogeneous secondary reactions of pyrolysis vapours. This integrated pretreatment improved the bio-oil's quality in terms of the organic acid (2.46–0.16%), water (16.8–3.6 wt%), aldehyde (1.58–0.50%), high molecular weight compound (10.2–4.2%), and inorganic (0.162–0.091 wt%) content, as well as the stability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel down-tube reactor demonstration plant has been designed and built with the biomass throughput capacity of over 300 kg·h− 1. The main components of the pyrolysis demonstration plant were described and their performance was tested and evaluated. Preliminary experiments were conducted at the selected range of 400–550 °C to investigate the effect of temperature on the products. The components of non-condensable gases and the chemical compositions of bio-oil were studied. The good features of the reactor (high heat transfer rate, short residence time, good liquidity of biomass and ceramic balls, etc.) were beneficial to increase the yield of bio-oil. The maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at 500 °C up to 52.5 wt.%, with the yield of gas and char being 27% and 20.5%, respectively. The major components of non-condensable gas were CO2 and CO which were accounted for 90.4 vol.% at 400 °C. The chemical compositions of bio-oil are also affected by temperature above all the proportion of ketones, acids, furans, phenols and sugars. Acids is the main product and the maximum yield is up to 32.3 wt.% at 550 °C. This study has provided a referenced basis for the industrial biomass pyrolytic liquefaction demonstration plant. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Using a continuous flow reactor, bio-oil prepared by the pyrolysis of sawdust was upgraded to produce petroleum-like deoxygenated hydrocarbon fuels. Dispersed tiny bio-char particles in the raw bio-oil were removed by extraction using diethyl ether to suppress solid-particle-nucleated coking. Noble metal catalysts, instead of molybdenum-based catalysts, were selected to avoid the continuous addition of sulfur compounds. Among the catalysts, tungstate-zirconia-supported Ru catalysts (Ru/WZr) exhibited high hydrodeoxygenation activity and less formation of cokes, which characteristics are important in the development of feasible upgrading processes. The investigation of catalysts used in this study demonstrates that the larger quantity of Brønsted acid sites compared to Lewis acid sites suppresses the formation of cokes. © 2017

AB  - The selective transformation of furfural (FF) into bio-based succinic acid (SA) promoted by co-existence of H2O2 and SO3H-CD-carbon catalyst was investigated using an ultrasonic system. This research was proposed on the novel catalytic system with the environmental friendly for SA production. A new SO3H-CD-carbon catalyst was synthesized via in-situ hydrothermal carbonization with sulfonation using β-cyclodextrin (CD) as a carbon source and hydroxyethylsulfonic acid as a sulfonating agent. The results showed that the synergistic effects of SO3H-CD-carbon catalyst and H2O2 on the FF oxidation had a significant importance for improving the SA yield. A highest SA yield of 81.2% was successfully achieved through the optimum conditions obtained from 2k factorial and Box-Behnken designs. The SO3H-CD-carbon catalyst also exhibited the better catalytic performance when compared with various commercial sulfonic acid catalysts such as Amberlyst-35, Nafion SAC-13 and SiO2-Tosic acid. Moreover, the spent catalyst was be easily regenerated recovering its initial density of acid sites which resulted in the well recyclability up to 13 cycles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, we develop a decisional framework and a mathematical model for the sustainable design of biodiesel supply chain networks (BSCND). We consider a broad group of sustainable aims, i.e. standard economic goals (revenue and logistics costs of BSCND), environmental issues based on a biodiesel production life cycle assessment (LCA), and the social incidental aspects (e.g. crime control, political stability, and community attitude, among others). The framework begins with a simulation of the biodiesel production system, feeding later, with suitable input parameters and suitable solutions, and a macro-location model designed to establish the regional positioning of biofuel conversion plants. Optimal regions are used as initial feasible solution space for the proposed micro-location model. In this part of the framework, we introduce an adaptation of Extended Goal Programming to rank the best municipalities (definitive locations) emphasizing the social aspects under consideration. The framework application is set up in the following Colombian context: first generation biodiesel production from palm oil feedstock. Our computational results indicate that the Colombian city of Rionegro (in the Santader region) is the most sustainable location for a new biodiesel plant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a four-cylinder common-rail turbocharged diesel engine fuelled with Jatropha curcas biodiesel-diesel blends. A kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) model is developed in this study using MATLAB software in order to predict the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of the engine. To acquire the data for training and testing the KELM model, the engine speed was selected as the input parameter, whereas the performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics were chosen as the output parameters of the KELM model. The performance, emissions and combustion characteristics predicted by the KELM model were validated by comparing the predicted data with the experimental data. The results show that the coefficient of determination of the parameters is within a range of 0.9805–0.9991 for both the KELM model and the experimental data. The mean absolute percentage error is within a range of 0.1259–2.3838. This study shows that KELM modelling is a useful technique in biodiesel production since it facilitates scientists and researchers to predict the performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics of internal combustion engines with high accuracy. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of temperature on the yield and properties of the subfractions derived from the pyrolysis of seed cakes of Calophyllum inophyllum. The seed cake of Calophyllum inophyllum, a large evergreen tree found in southern coastal belts of India, was Pyrolysed in three different temperatures of 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C in a fixed bed batch type reactor at a constant heating rate of 30 °C/minute and average particle size of 1.44 mm. The sub fractions were characterized by analytical techniques like FTIR, GC–MS and GC along with physicochemical characterization using ASTM D7544 standard. The highest yield of bio-oil was observed in the pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C above which the gas yield increases due to secondary cracking of volatiles. Major changes in FTIR spectra and peak area of GC–MS were observed for the products derived in three different temperature conditions. Proximate and ultimate analysis showed the significant changes in the composition of char obtained at various temperatures. It was observed that H/C and O/C ratio of biochar decreased with increase in operating temperature. Among the physicochemical of bio-oil, kinematic viscosity decreased by 21.32% as the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 450 °C to 550 °C whereas water content increased by 19.73% in the same temperature range. Meanwhile, other properties like calorific value, density and cetane number showed minor variations for the bio-oil obtained at dissimilar temperatures. The results proved that the pyrolysis temperature affects the properties of the products in a wide range. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) is an excellent substrate to obtain high-value esters that can be used as second-generation biofuels and biofuel additives. The present study focuses on the identification and definition of the key parameters crucial for the development of chemically and environmentally efficient protocols operating in continuous-flow for the preparation of structurally diverse alkyl levulinates via the esterification of LA. We have focused on the use of solid acid catalysts consisting of sulfonated cation exchange resins and considered different aliphatic alcohols to prepare levulinates 3 and 11–17 regioselectively, and in good to high yields (50–92%). Direct correlations between several reaction parameters and catalyst activity have been investigated and discussed to set proper flow reactors that allow minimal waste production during the workup procedure, enabling Environmental factor (E-factor) values as low as ca. 0.3, full recoverability and reusability of the catalysts, and the production of levulinates up to ca. 5 gxh−1 scale. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Pyrolytic bio-oil was chemically upgraded after physically distilled upgrades to meet the petroleum transportation fuel substitute. A Pd/C catalyst was used to upgrade the microalgae pyrolytic bio-oil to determine the effect of different distillation fractions and catalytic upgrading conditions on the yields and properties. The middle distillation fraction (F2) was upgraded under various temperature (130 to 250 °C) and pressure (4.1 to 8.3 MPa) conditions based on response surface methodology (RSM). The light distillation fraction (F1) and raw bio-oil were also catalytically upgraded for the comparison. The distillation step prior to catalytic upgrading led to a better quality of upgraded bio-oil compared to the direct bio-oil upgrades. Both the oxygen and hydrogen contents of light and middle fraction upgrades were improved, while the upgraded raw bio-oil showed limited improvement. The other properties of HHV and TAN with the middle fraction upgrades were improved to 42.9 MJ/kg and 1.09 mg KOH/g, respectively, at the severe condition as most of the ketones in upgrades were removed. Also, paraffin and aromatic chemical groups were significantly produced at the expense of the olefin groups through hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Thus, the catalytic upgrading after a distillation stage enhanced the quality of biofuel that can be a petroleum fuels substitute or additives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main purpose of the study was to achieve effective immobilization of lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) onto 3D spongin-based scaffolds from Hippospongia communis marine demosponge for rapeseed oil transesterification. Successful immobilization onto the marine sponge skeleton was confirmed for the first time. Lipase B-containing biocatalytic system exhibited the highest catalytic activity retention (89%) after 60 min of immobilization at pH 7 and temperature of 4 °C. Immobilization was found to improve the thermal and chemical stability compared to free lipase, and retain over 80% of its initial catalytic activity over a wide range of temperature (30–60 °C) and pH (6–9). Additionally, immobilized lipase has good storage stability and retains over 70% of its initial activity even after catalyzing of 25 reaction cycles. The obtained product was used in a transesterification reaction of rapeseed oil with methanol and proved to be an efficient biocatalyst for biofuel production. The highest conversion value and fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) concentration were observed after a process conducted at 40 °C and pH 10. The possible mechanism of interaction between the enzyme and the spongin-based support is proposed and discussed. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Fast microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis (fMACP) of soapstock for hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil using different catalysts was investigated in this study. Effects of catalyst, pyrolysis temperature and catalyst to feed ratio on product fractional yields and chemical composition were studied. Experimental results indicated that the use of catalyst increased the relative content of hydrocarbons and selectivity of aromatics. Moreover, HZSM-5 catalyst enhanced the bio-oil yield. When HZSM-5 zeolite was used as a catalyst, 600 °C was the optimal pyrolysis temperature, which provides the maximum bio-oil yield and high content of hydrocarbons. At the cost of the decrease of bio-oil yield, the increase of catalyst to feed ratio increased the relative content of hydrocarbons from 65.41% to 88.59% and selectivity of aromatics from 5.99% to 29.46%. In addition, the analytical results of bio-char show that bio-char with micropore structure and high contents of the essential plant nutrients and micronutrients can be used as a soil amendment to improve soil productivity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of high purity hydrogen via the sorption-enhanced steam reforming of acetic acid, a model compound of bio-oil, was investigated in this work. A bi-functional catalyst with stable catalytic activity and CO2-capture ability, Ni/CexZr1−xO2-CaO, was prepared by a sol–gel method and characterized in details by BET, XRD, TPR and SEM-EDX analytic techniques. The characterization of these materials showed that the catalysts were mainly composed of Ni, CexZr1−xO2 and CaO. As CaO loading increased, a new species, CaZrO3 with a perovskite structure was formed. The presence of CaZrO3 in the catalysts acted as a barrier to CaO grain growth at high temperatures and thus improved the CO2-capture stability. These catalysts exhibited good CO2 sorption capacity in 15 consecutive carbonation–calcination cycles, even at a high calcination temperature of 900 °C. Particularly, in case of the Ni/CZC-2.5 catalyst, 98% high purity H2 could be obtained during the prebreakthrough stage when the catalysts were tested in the SESR of acetic acid at 550 °C with an S/C ratio of 4. In addition, high hydrogen purity was maintained over 15 cyclic reaction-calcination operations, which was mainly attributed to the uniform distribution of Ni, CaO, CexZr1−xO2 and CaZrO3 in the catalysts. These results indicated the great potential of the SESR technique for hydrogen production from bio-oil. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Sewage sludge liquefaction bio-oil is capturing extensive attention for its sustainability and easy availability. However, some limitations of bio-oil such as high viscosity and poor cold flow properties hamper its direct application in engines. Two microemulsions including ethanol-in-diesel (M1) and diesel microemulsion (M2) were produced to upgrade bio-oil. Adding ethanol in M1 facilitated bio-oil solubilization and improved fuel properties of bio-oil. Because of low viscosity and low pour point of ethanol, M1 with ethanol as polar phase produced a more promising biofuel with acceptable viscosity and better cold flow properties compared with M2. Through microemulsification in diesel, hydrophilic and hydrophobic bio-oil components may penetrate into the polar core and the continuous phase, respectively, while amphiphilic components mainly located at the interface. The hydrogen bonding between ethanol and hydrophilic bio-oil components could enhance solubility and improve stability. Besides, polar phase ethanol could also act as a solvent to dissolve more less-hydrophilic bio-oil components into the polar core. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Silica-supported catalysts based on mono and bimetallic nickel and iron phosphides with different Ni:Fe molar ratios (1:0, 3:1, 2:1 and 0:1) were synthesised and tested in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction of phenol, a model molecule present in bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of biomass. Tests were performed in a fixed bed reactor under hydrogen pressure (1.5 and 3 MPa) for different contact times. Freshly reduced catalysts were characterised by physisorption of N2 at −196 °C, CO chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electronic microscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and hydrogen, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Characterization results revealed that the presence of Ni increased their ability to activate hydrogen and the number of active sites, while the presence of Fe favored the spillover process. By increasing the amount of Ni, the surface became enriched with P, and this was associated with the presence of surface P-OH groups that provided Brönsted acid sites to activate O-containing compounds as well as surface hydrogen species that minimised deactivation by coke deposition. Ni-containing phases presented higher HDO capabilities than FeP ones, but generated some O-containing intermediates. In contrast, the FeP catalyst transformed all phenol molecules into O-free compounds (cyclohexane and mainly cyclohexene). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Researchers prepared silicalite-1 containing intracrystalline nanovoids under hydrothermal synthesis conditions by adding corn stem pith powder into the zeolite synthesis gel. The nanovoids found to increase the external surface area of the zeolite and, when HPA was supported, it was loaded onto these nanovoids which improved dispersion of HPA and accesssiblity of acid sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 31 31P- MAS NMR indicated interfacial bond formation between the silicalite-1 surface and HPA which would facilitate dispersion.

AB  - The present work investigates the suitability of pretreated corn stover (CS) to serve as feedstock for high gravity (HG) ethanol production at solids-content of 24 wt%. Steam explosion, with and without the addition of H2SO4, and organosolv pretreated CS samples underwent a liquefaction/saccharification step followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). Maximum ethanol concentration of ca. 76 g/L (78.3% ethanol yield) was obtained from steam exploded CS (SECS) with 0.2% H2SO4. Organosolv pretreated CS (OCS) also resulted in high ethanol concentration of ca. 65 g/L (62.3% ethanol yield). Moreover, methane production through anaerobic digestion (AD) was conducted from fermentation residues and resulted in maximum methane yields of ca. 120 and 69 mL/g volatile solids (VS) for SECS and OCS samples, respectively. The results indicated that the implementation of a liquefaction/saccharification step before SSF employing a liquefaction reactor seemed to handle HG conditions adequately. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel, integrated process for economical high-yield production of D-mannose and ethanol from coffee residue waste (CRW), which is abundant and widely available, was reported. The process involves pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, color removal, and pervaporation, which can be performed using environmentally friendly technologies. The CRW was pretreated with ethanol at high temperature and then hydrolyzed with enzymes produced in-house to yield sugars. Key points of the process are: manipulations of the fermentation step that allowing bioethanol-producing yeasts to use almost glucose and galactose to produce ethanol, while retaining large amounts of D-mannose in the fermented broth; removal of colored compounds and other components from the fermented broth; and separation of ethanol and D-mannose through pervaporation. Under optimized conditions, approximately 15.7 g dry weight (DW) of D-mannose (approximately 46% of the mannose) and approximately 11.3 g DW of ethanol from 150 g DW of ethanol-pretreated CRW, were recovered. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important platform chemical derived from biomass. Tremendous efforts have been made to transform HMF into valuable chemicals for applications in biofuels, materials science, and pharmaceuticals. Here we report the conversion of HMF into 5-hydroxymethyl-2-vinylfuran (HMVF), a versatile adhesive. HMVF can bond to a variety of substrates, e.g. metal, glass, plastics and rubber, under heating or acid treatment at room temperature. Mechanistic studies show that the vinyl group undergoes free radical polymerization and the hydroxyl group dehydrates to form an ether linkage to crosslink HMVF under either heating or acid treatment. The bonding strength (τ) of HMVF cured by heating (h-HMVF) is close to that of Krazy Glue (Loctite 401, cyanoacrylate) and higher than that of white glue (Pattex No. 710, PVA) and Pattex PKME15C epoxy glue. The outstanding adhesive performance of HMVF is attributed both to the interaction of hydroxyl groups with substrates and crosslinking by etherification between hydroxyl groups. Similar to Krazy Glue, HMVF is also used in its monomer form, which eliminates the use of solvents. Cells show good adhesion on crosslinked HMVF, which makes HMVF a potential bio-adhesive. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - The ketonization of aldehydes joins two molecules, with n carbon atoms each, to a ketone with 2n - 1 carbon atoms. When employing cerium oxide as a catalyst with nano-sized crystals (<15 nm) the ketone can be obtained in almost 80% yield. In addition, other ketones are observed so that the total ketone selectivity reached almost 90%. Water is consumed during the reaction when the aldehyde is oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid, which is established as a reaction intermediate, co-producing hydrogen. Consequently, water has to be co-fed in the reaction to enhance the reaction rate and to improve the catalyst stability with time on stream. In contrast to zirconium oxide which possesses catalytic activity for the aldol condensation liberating water, with cerium oxide water is not abundant on the surface and the reaction kinetics show that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of the water in the gas-phase, in addition to the dependence on the gas-phase concentration of the aldehyde. The liberated hydrogen can be consumed in the hydrodeoxygenation of the ketone product. Doing so, when starting from heptanal, a biomass derived aldehyde, an alkane mixture was obtained with almost 90% diesel content. For the whole cascade reaction with five single steps no reagents are necessary and the only by-product is one molecule of innocuous carbon dioxide (related to two molecules of aldehyde). This shows that cerium oxide possesses a big potential to convert biomass derived aldehydes into biofuels in a very sustainable way. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Novel and efficient multi-SO3H functionalized mesoporous polymeric solid acid (PD-En-SO3H) was synthesized from sulfonation of ethylenediamine (En)-functionalization of mesoporous polydivinylbenzene (PD). The catalyst was characterized by XPS, FT-IR, N2adsorption-desorption, TEM, SEM, TG and elemental analysis. Characterizations suggest that PD-En-SO3H possess abundant mesoporosity, high BET surface area (369.00 m2/g) and high acidity (2.10 mmol/g). The catalytic activity was investigated for biodiesel (BD) production by esterification of various free fatty acids (FFAs) and synthesis of levulinate esters (BD additive) from fructose. The effects of reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction time, molar ratio of methanol to oil and catalyst amount on conversion of oleic acid were also explored. Interestingly, PD-En-SO3H showed excellent catalytic performance, which was more active than commercial Amberlyst 15 and Nafion NR50. Moreover, it could be reused for four times and still maintained high catalytic activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The performance of a biodiesel system can be affected by varied risk factors. The numbers of such risk factors are large and their interdependencies are vague and complex. The purpose of this study is to define relationships among such risk factors and integrate them with an objective risk analysis approach. In the present study, an interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach was used to identify relationships among risk factors while a Bayesian Network (BN) approach was employed to define the strength of dependence and conduct a risk analysis. The results indicate that among 25 risk factors, operational safety is a key biodiesel performance factor. The analysis also highlights that the impacts of occupational health and natural resources depletion are strongly dependent on environmental parameters. Occupational health is also strongly dependent on plant safety. The results show that the interdependency between occupational health and natural resources depletion is weak. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study bio prospecting of thirty seaweeds from Indian coasts was analyzed for their biochemical components including pigments, fatty acid and ash content. Multivariate analysis of biochemical components and fatty acids was done using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) to manifest chemotaxonomic relationship among various seaweeds. The overall analysis suggests that these seaweeds have multi-functional properties and can be utilized as promising bioresource for proteins, lipids, pigments and carbohydrates for the food/feed and biofuel industry. © 2016

AB  - In this study, the analysis of organic compounds in the products obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae (Dunaliella tertiolecta) was carried out, with particular attention on the identification of compounds in aqueous phases via the integration of two pre-treatment methods namely dried aqueous extracts (DAE) and solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) along with GC-MS analysis. The results showed that the strong polar compounds in aqueous phases, such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, amides, glycerol, and N-containing compounds were determined through DAE method. The weak polar compounds like phenols, cyclic hydrocarbons, and indoles were identified via SPME method. In addition, CO2and CO are the main components of the gaseous phase products, the rest of components include CH4, N2, H2, C2H4, C2H6, etc. Bio-oil is mainly composed of ketones, phenols, alcohols, hydrocarbons and N-containing compounds. Based on the compounds in the bio-oil, aqueous and gaseous phases compared with the other previous published works, the plausible pathways of Dunaliella tertiolecta HTL are proposed. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 259–268, 2017. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - Algae could offer a potential source of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and biofuels. In this study, a green synthesis of dispersed cuboidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was achieved using red algae, Gelidium amansii reacted with HAuCl4. It was found to be 4–7 nm sized cubical nanoparticles with aspect ratio of 1.4 were synthesized using 0.5 mM of HAuCl4 by HRSEM analysis. The crystalline planes (111), (200), (220), (311) and elemental signal of gold was observed by XRD and EDS respectively. The major constitutes, galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose in the alga played a critical role in the synthesis of crystalline AuNPs with cubical dimension. Further, the antibacterial potential of synthesized AuNPs was tested against human pathogens, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The synthesized AuNPs found biocompatible up to 100 ppm and high concentration showed an inhibition against cancer cell. This novel report could be helped to exploration of bioresources to material synthesis for the application of biosensor and biomedical application. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, liquefaction of Chlorella vulgaris biomass grown in photo-bioreactor using wastewater as source of nutrition was studied and influence of process parameters on the yield of bio-oil was analysed. Different biomass to water ratio (5 g/200 ml, 10 g/200 ml, 15 g/200 ml, and 20 g/200 ml) was taken and bio-oil yield at various temperatures ranging from 220 to 340 °C was studied. Catalyst loading of the range 2.5–8% wt of NaOH was also studied to analyse the influence of catalyst concentration on bio-oil yield. Obtained bio-oil was characterized using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Results showed that maximum bio-oil yield of 26.67%wt was observed at operating conditions of 300 °C, 15 g/200 ml biomass load and 2.5% wt of NaOH at 60 min holding time. Fatty acids and other high carbon compounds were detected in the bio-oil obtained through liquefaction process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the effect of the addition of 5% alcohol (butanol) with biodiesel-diesel blends on the performance, emissions, and combustion of a naturally aspirated four stroke multi-cylinder diesel engine at different engine speeds (1200 to 2400 rpm) under full load conditions. Three types of local Australian biodiesel, namely macadamia biodiesel (MB), rice bran biodiesel (RB), and waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCB), were used for this study, and the data was compared with results for conventional diesel fuel (B0). Performance results showed that the addition of butanol with diesel-biodiesel blends slightly lowers the engine efficiency. The emission study revealed that the addition of butanol additive with diesel-biodiesel blends lowers the exhaust gas temperature (EGT), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions whereas it increases hydrocarbon (HC) emissions compared to B0. The combustion results indicated that in-cylinder pressure (CP) for additive added fuel is higher (0.45–1.49%), while heat release rate (HRR) was lower (2.60–9.10%) than for B0. Also, additive added fuel lowers the ignition delay (ID) by 23–30% than for B0. Finally, it can be recommended that the addition of 5% butanol with Australian biodiesel-diesel blends can significantly lower the NOx and PM emissions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Banana is one of the most cultivated fruit crops around the world. After its harvest, it generates large amounts of agricultural wastes. The objective of this study was to optimise the operational conditions of steam explosion pretreatment of the two main banana lignocellulosic residues, rachis and pseudostem, in order to achieve high overall sugar yields. RESULTS: A response surface statistical model (22 + star points with triplicate at central point) was used for the optimisation, considering the enzymatic hydrolysis yield and the overall yield of glucose and xylose as main criteria. The optimal conditions of steam explosion pretreatment for pseudostem were established at 177 °C, 5 min and 2.2% H2SO4 (v/v), presenting a high overall glucose yield of 91.0%. For rachis, the optimal conditions were 198 °C, 5 min and 1.5% H2SO4 (v/v) with an overall glucose yield of 87.1%. CONCLUSION: Optimal conditions for steam explosion pretreatment of agricultural banana wastes were determined. An acid-catalysed pretreatment was needed due to the low presence of acetyl groups in both feedstocks. After rachis pretreatment, extractives, soluble ashes and hemicellulose were solubilised causing an enrichment of cellulose in the insoluble fraction. However, due to the high amount of starch in pseudostem, a significant amount of glucose was recovered in the liquid fraction. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Various supported metal catalysts are screened for hydrogenation of lauric acid and 2-octanone as model reactions for the transformation of biomass-derived oxygenates to liquid alkanes (biofuels) in a batch reactor under solvent-free conditions. Among the catalysts tested, Pt and MoOx co-loaded on TiO2 (Pt–MoOx/TiO2) shows the highest yields of n-alkanes for both of the reactions. Pt–MoOx/TiO2 selectively catalyzes the hydrodeoxygenation of various fatty acids and triglycerides to n-alkanes without C−C bond cleavage under 50 bar H2 and shows higher turnover numbers than the catalysts in the literature. Pt–MoOx/TiO2 is effective also for the hydrodeoxygenation of various ketones to the corresponding alkanes. In situ IR study of the reaction of adsorbed acetone under H2 suggests that the high activity of Pt–MoOx/TiO2 is attributed to the cooperation between Pt and Lewis acid sites of the MoOx/TiO2 support. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Uniform, ordered mesoporous ZnCo2O4 (meso-ZnCo2O4) nanospheres were successfully synthesized using a sacrificing template method. The meso-ZnCo2O4 nanospheres were used for the first time for H2O2 biosensing and in glucose biofuel cells (GBFCs) as an enzyme mimic. The meso-ZnCo2O4 nanospheres not only exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the H2O2 sensor, achieving a high sensitivity (658.92 μA·mM–1·cm–2) and low detection limit (0.3 nM at signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 3), but also performed as an excellent cathode material in GBFCs, resulting in an open circuit voltage of 0.83 V, maximum power density of 0.32 mW·cm–2, and limiting current density of 1.32 mA·cm–2. The preeminent catalytic abilities to H2O2 and glucose may be associated with the large specific surface area of the mesoporous structure in addition to the intrinsic catalytic activity of ZnCo2O4. These significant findings provide a successful basis for developing methods for the supersensitive detection of H2O2 and enriching catalytic materials for biofuel cells.

AB  - In this study, the pyrolysis of several Canadian straw biomasses was studied using a thermogravimetric analyzer and a bench-scale horizontal fixed-bed reactor, in order to better understand the devolatilization process and to obtain information about the product yields of these biomasses. The straw biomasses were converted through pyrolysis performed in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures of 500 °C to study the influence of the feedstock on product yields. The effects of various catalysts on product yields are also discussed. When using zeolite catalysts, the bio-oil and bio-char yields of the straw pyrolysis were increased to 46.44% and 38.77%, respectively, while the bio-gas yield was decreased to 13.65%. The use of catalyst zeolite ZY-SS had the most significant effect on overall bio-oil and bio-char yields, increasing the bio-oil yield by about 2% and the bio-char yield by 8%. This catalyst had the most significant effect on the pyrolysis of flax straw, where the bio-oil yield was increased to 46.44%. In the pyrolysis of oat straw, the use of the catalyst consistently decreased the bio-gas yield; however, the bio-oil yield increased the most significantly (43.32%) with the use of catalyst zeolite ZY-NS. The use of zeolite ZY-NS also increased the bio-oil yield during the pyrolysis of barley straw (43.03%). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The simultaneous conversion of cyclopentanone and m-cresol has been investigated on a series of solid-acid catalysts. Both compounds are representative of biomass-derived streams. Cyclopentanone can be readily obtained from sugar-derived furfurals through Piancatelli rearrangement under reducing conditions. Cresol represents a family of phenolic compounds, typically obtained from the depolymerization of lignin. In the first biomass conversion strategy proposed here, furfural is converted in high yields and selectivity to cyclopentanone (CPO) over metal catalysts such as Pd-Fe/SiO2 at 600 psi (∼4.14 MPa) H2 and 150 °C. Subsequently, CPO and cresol are further converted through acid-catalyzed hydroxyalkylation. This C−C coupling reaction may be used to generate products in the molecular weight range that is appropriate for transportation fuels. As molecules beyond this range may be undesirable for fuel production, a catalyst with a suitable porous structure may be advantageous for controlling the product distribution in the desirable range. If Amberlyst resins were used as a catalyst, C12–C24 products were obtained whereas when zeolites with smaller pore sizes were used, they selectively produced C10 products. Alternatively, CPO can undergo the acid-catalyzed self-aldol condensation to form C10 bicyclic adducts. As an illustration of the potential for practical implementation of this strategy for biofuel production, the long-chain oxygenates obtained from hydroxyalkylation/aldol condensation were successfully upgraded through hydrodeoxygenation to a mixture of linear alkanes and saturated cyclic hydrocarbons, which in practice would be direct drop-in components for transportation fuels. Aqueous acidic environments, which are typically encountered during the liquid-phase upgrading of bio-oils, would inhibit the efficiency of base-catalyzed processes. Therefore, the proposed acid-catalyzed upgrading strategy is advantageous for biomass conversion in terms of process simplicity. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - We describe the fabrication of a self-powered ethanol biosensor comprising a β-NAD+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) bioanode and a bienzymatic alcohol oxidase (AOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) biocathode. β-NAD+ is regenerated by means of a specifically designed phenothiazine dye (i. e. toluidine blue, TB) modified redox polymer in which TB was covalently anchored to a hexanoic acid tethered poly(4-vinylpyridine) backbone. The redox polymer acts as an immobilization matrix for ADH. Using a carefully chosen anchoring strategy through the formation of amide bonds, the potential of the TB-based mediator is shifted to more positive potentials, thus preventing undesired O2 reduction. To counterbalance the rather high potential of the TB-modified polymer, and thus the bioanode, a high-potential AOx/HRP-based biocathode is suggested. HRP is immobilized in a direct-electron-transfer regime on screen-printed graphite electrodes functionalized with multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The nanostructured cathode ensures the wiring of the iron-oxo complex within oxidized HRP, and thus a high potential for the reduction of H2O2 of about +550 mV versus Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl. The proposed biofuel cell exhibits an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of approximately 660 mV and was used as self-powered device for the determination of the ethanol content in liquor. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In the present study, Eucalyptus was subjected to organosolv pretreatment processes with aqueous 2-propanol at 200–220 °C to obtain lignin with benign characters for its valorization and digestible substrates for bioethanol production. Results showed that different delignification ratios (64.00%–81.26%) and molecular weights (Mw = 610–2680 g/mol) of lignin fractions were dissociated from various pretreatment conditions, and the glucose yields of all the pretreated substrates significantly increased to 54.65–88.59% as compared to that of raw material (9.20%). Additionally, the amounts of β-O-4, β-β, and β-5 substructures were regularly decreased with the increased temperature and time. By contrast, the structural characteristics of the lignin fractions obtained with 70% 2-PrOH/water were less-altered than those with 50% 2-PrOH/water pretreatment. Remarkably, lignin with the lowest molecular weight (Mw = 610 g/mol) and less-altered chemical structure was achieved at 200 °C for 120 min, which is beneficial to subsequent catalytic degradation of lignin. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To alleviate high friction and corrosive wear in piston ring and cylinder liner friction pairs lubricated with bio-oil, four kinds of coatings: Ni-P, Ni-P-MoS2, Ni-P-GO and Ni-P-MoS2-GO have been prepared via chemical nickel plating technology. A multi-functional engine piston ring-cylinder liner tribometer was employed to evaluate their tribological behaviors. Furthermore, the changes of the bio-oil under different frictional conditions were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that adhesive wear, scratching, spalling and mild wear took place respectively on the worn surfaces of piston rings with Ni-P, Ni-P-MoS2, Ni-P-GO, and Ni-P-MoS2-GO coatings. Ni-P-MoS2-GO coated piston rings showed excellent friction-reducing and anti-wear performance and subsequently have great potential for accelerating the application of bio-oil in IC engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biohythane is a renewable energy fuel composed of methane and hydrogen gas at a certain ratio. Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) have been employed to produce biohythane but the composition of the produced gas is not well controlled. Herein, an innovative MEC system was developed at a large scale of 19 L to investigate biohythane production affected by operational factors. The goal was to understand the interaction between operation and performance towards the development of effective strategies for controlling biohythane composition. To achieve this goal, the performance of this MEC system was studied by varying the key operational factors including anolyte recirculation rate, external resistance, and hydraulic residence time (HRT). It was found that the optimized operational condition for this MEC system included the anolyte recirculation rate of 800 mL min−1, external resistance of 1 Ω, and HRT of 24 h. This condition led to the biohythane production of 0.64 ± 0.06 L day−1 with 16.5% H2 proportion and positive net energy recovery of 1.52 ± 0.19 kW h day−1. The ANOVA test indicated that the anolyte recirculation rate significantly impacted the methane production rate while the external resistance strongly affected the proportion of hydrogen gas in biohythane. HRT had a minor effect on the biohythane composition but could significantly influence organic removal rate. This is the first study that attempted to use operational factors to control biohythane composition, and its results will provide important implications to formulate control strategies for biohythane production and to scale up MEC systems towards practical applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brazil is a leader in the production of biodiesel, and some challenges still exist in improving the energy usage and feedstocks alternatives for the transesterification process. In this paper, an industrial scale simulation was conducted to show a comparison of the traditional alkali-catalyzed process using catalysis sodium hydroxide with an enzyme-catalyzed process novel developed by the research team of one of the authors. LCA methodology was used to evaluate the potential multiple effects on the environment in Brazilian scenarios. In this regard, three basic cases were carried out: Case 1, where 1 t of soybean biodiesel was produced from the alkali-catalyzed process; Case 2 and 3, where 1 t of biodiesel, using the enzyme-catalyzed process, was produced from soybean oil and waste cooking oil respectively. The results reveal that considerable contribution can be made to the environment in Case 3 when waste cooking oil (WCO) is considered as a nearly environment-burden-free resource. Additionally, as illustrated in Case 2, not only the feedstock but also the technologic process can generate great influence on the environment when producing biodiesel in a large-scale plant. The efficiency of electric and thermal energy usage should be appropriately considered to diminish these impacts as much as possible. Likewise, chemicals and waste disposal also need to be well managed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The function of ethanol and Brønsted acid for the dehydration-etherification of fructose to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) has been theoretically investigated at G4 level in ethanol solution. Initially, fructose prefers to dehydration other than etherification with ethanol in the presence of Brønsted acid. The proton H+ should be solvated on ethanol other than fructose, resulting in [C2H5OH2]+ as the catalytically active species. Both protonation and [C2H5OH2]+ exhibit good catalytic performance, but ethanol does not. Furthermore, [C2H5OH2]+ displays better catalytic performance than protonation, which reflects the promotion catalytic role of C2H5OH on the proton H+. The turnover frequency analysis shows that the SN2 nucleophilic substitution for the etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to EMF is the rate-controlling step in the whole reaction catalyzed by [C2H5OH2]+. The catalytic performance of [C2H5OH2]+ stems from the positive charge of –OH2 group, which assists both the H2O release of fructose to HMF and the etherification of HMF to EMF. For the dehydration of fructose, the catalytic superiority of [C2H5OH2]+ to protonation comes from the shift of the intramolecular H-shift catalyzed by protonation to the intermolecular H-shift catalyzed by [C2H5OH2]+, which lowers the activation energy barrier for the H2O release. The present study is useful for understanding the roles of ethanol and Brønsted acid in acid-catalyzed dehydration-etherification of carbohydrates to biofuel in ethanol solution. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Producing bio-intermediates from lignocellulosic biomass with minimal process steps has a far-reaching impact on the biofuel industry. We studied the metal chloride catalyzed aldol condensation of furfural with acetone under conditions compatible with the upstream polysaccharide conversions to furfurals. In situ far infrared spectroscopy (FIR) was applied to guide the screening of aldol condensation catalysts based on the distinguishing characteristics of metal chlorides in their coordination chemistries with carbonyl-containing compounds. NiCl2, CoCl2, CrCl3, VCl3, FeCl3, and CuCl2 were selected as the potential catalysts in this study. The FIR results further helped to rationalize the excellent catalytic performance of VCl3 in furfural condensation with acetone, with 94.7% yield of biofuel intermediates (C8, C13) in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) solvent. Remarkably, addition of ethanol facilitated the acetal pathway of the condensation reaction, which dramatically increased the desired product selectivity over the furfural pathway. Most significantly, we demonstrate for the first time that VCl3 catalyzed aldol condensation in acidic medium is fully compatible with upstream polysaccharide hydrolysis to monosaccharide and the subsequent monosaccharide isomerization and dehydration to furfurals. Our preliminary results showed that a 44% yield of biofuel intermediates (C8, C13) can be obtained in one-pot conversion of xylose catalyzed by paired metal chlorides, CrCl2 and VCl3. A number of prior works have shown that the biofuel intermediates derived from the one-pot reaction of this work can be readily hydrogenated to biofuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - In present work, ordered mesoporous material SBA-15 was synthesized and used as the support for the dispersion of the nickel and cobalt active metal. XRD, N2 sorption, ICP, H2-TPR and TEM techniques were used for the Ni/SBA-15 and Co/SBA-15 catalysts characterization. Both Ni/SBA-15 and Co/SBA-15 catalysts were tested for the hydrogenation of the typical oxygen-containing molecule present in bio-oil in order to produce the renewable aromatic. Ni/SBA-15 catalyst exhibit much higher catalytic performance as compared with Co/SBA-15 catalyst for the hydrodeoxygenation reaction performance of anisole, but it is also obvious that the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst would inevitably lead to the emergence of partial hydrodeoxygenation product methoxycyclohexane. On the contrary, the direct hydrogenolysis of methoxy-functional group from anisole molecule could prevail over the Co/SBA-15, leading to much higher aromatic selectivity over the Co/SBA-15. Co/SBA-15 could selectively hydrogenolyse the C[sbnd]O bond and could act as the potential hydrodeoxygenation catalyst for aromatic production from the bio-oils because of its high efficiency in the removal of oxygen by a direct hydrogenolysis route. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The recovery of waste as feedstock away from organizational limitations corresponds to a prospective supplementary revenue stream for the organization. A novel waste eggshell of Gallus domesticus derived superbasic nanocatalyst was synthesized through betaine amphoteric surfactant-assisted decomposition, adsorption and precipitation processes. By varied the duration synthesis of gel mixture, the morphology transformation from liquid-solid interconnected macro-size particles to regular spheroidal nanoassemblies particles is detected. The surfactant at the liquid-solid interface facilitates the mono dispersion of nanoparticles by hindering growth of crystals. The average particle diameter of the produced superbasic nanocatalyst was in the range of 27–16 nm. The synthesized nanoparticle formation mechanism in the presence surfactant has also been addressed in this study. The catalytic activity of superbasic nanocatalyst was investigated for biodiesel production from crude Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) via glycerolysis and transesterification with methanol at atmospheric pressure. Artificial neural network (ANN) based on the genetic algorithm (GA) was applied for optimization of varied reaction parameters. It was observed that the reduction of acidity varied with varying reaction conditions. The highest fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield (97%) was obtained when the reaction was allowed to run at 60 °C for 300 min, while at 90 °C the maximal FAME yield of 98% was achieved after 120 min. The kinetic parameters of nanocatalyst were determined, and the reaction system followed pseudo first order kinetics. The results suggest that this two steps process using superbasic nanocatalyst affords a promising method to convert oils with high FFA level to biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgraded bio-oil can partly replace fossil fuels to reduce the environmental issues caused by the massive consumption of fossil fuels. Hydrodeoxygenation is a promising route for upgraded bio-oil production from pyrolysis bio-oil. Non-sulfide catalysts are effective in bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation due to low cost and high activity. Ni-Zn/Al2O3 catalysts were first used to selectively produce hydrocarbon upgraded bio-oil through bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation. Upgrading pine sawdust bio-oil to upgraded hydrocarbon bio-oil was performed using a series of Ni and/or Zn loaded Al2O3 catalysts. The crystalline structure of Al2O3 was maintained after Ni and/or Zn loading, but BET surface area and total pore volume of Ni-Zn/Al2O3 catalysts decreased significantly compared to Al2O3 support. Bimetallic Ni-Zn/Al2O3 catalysts were more effective than monometallic Ni/Al2O3 or Zn/Al2O3 catalyst. Bimetallic 15%Ni-5%Zn/Al2O3 catalyst generated the highest upgraded bio-oil yield at 44.64 wt% and produced the upgraded bio-oil with the highest hydrocarbon content at 50.12%. Physicochemical properties of upgraded bio-oils including heating value, water content and pH were significantly improved in comparison with raw bio-oil. The improved catalytic performance of bimetallic Ni-Zn/Al2O3 catalyst was associated with the synergistic effect of Ni and Zn on Al2O3 support. © 2017

AB  - This study investigates direct hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of refinery oily-sludge (ROS) to produce bio-oil (BO). Optimum operating conditions of HTL were experimentally determined by response surface methodology (RSM). Experiments were implemented in a tube-bomb reactor at various temperatures (275–350 °C), reaction time (30–75 min) and ROS content (10–40 wt%) in feed. BO yield reached to 45.52 wt% on dry ash-free basis at optimum conditions (290 °C, 65 min and 16 wt% of ROS). GC/MS analysis showed that BO mainly contained aliphatic, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, monoaromatic and polyaromatic compounds. Moreover, it was found that by increasing temperature, small compounds were converted into heavier molecules via repolymerization reactions. With increasing reaction time at low temperatures, the amount of nitrogen-containing compounds increased, emphasizing the undesired effect of very long reaction time. Results also indicated that catalytic upgrading is required for dehydrogenation, oxygen removal and new C[sbnd]H bonds creation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) was performed to understand the effects of confining walls on mass transfer through a packed bed for laminar regime (Re ≤ 100). The X, Y and Z coordinates of the center of the spheres in a randomly packed bed with varying ratios D/d (D is the diameter of the column and d is the diameter of the particle) were generated using a Discrete Element Method - Computational Fluid Dynamics (DEM-CFD) code. Naphthalene-air system (Sc ∼ 2.52) was considered for all the cases. The grid resolution, method and boundary conditions were validated by comparing the computed (overall) Sherwood number with the published experimental data. Local Sherwood number was computed around each particle for all ratios, D/d, and spatial and probability distributions throughout the packed bed column as a function of D/d are reported. It was observed that for D/d's ≤ 8.6, the effects of wall on particle's Sherwood number was evident, while for D/d's ≥ 10.8, the Sherwood number was predominantly uniform all through the column. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work describes the economic feasibility of hydroprocessed diesel fuel production via catalytic decarboxylation of rubber seed oil in Malaysia. A comprehensive techno-economic assessment is developed using Aspen HYSYS V8.0 software for process modelling and economic cost estimates. The profitability profile and minimum fuels selling price of this synthetic fuels production using rubber seed oil as biomass feedstock are assessed under a set of assumptions for what can be plausibly be achieved in 10-years framework. In this study, renewable diesel processing facility is modelled to be capable of processing 65,000 L of inedible oil per day and producing a total of 20 million litre of renewable diesel product per annual with assumed annual operational days of 347. With the forecasted renewable diesel retail price of 3.64 RM per kg, the pioneering renewable diesel project investment offers an assuring return of investment of 12.1% and net return as high as 1.35 million RM. Sensitivity analysis conducted showed that renewable diesel production cost is most sensitive to rubber seed oil price and hydrogen gas price, reflecting on the relative importance of feedstock prices in the overall profitability profile. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The thermodynamic analysis of the sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR) process of bio-oil for hydrogen production was investigated in terms of equilibrium compositions, energy consumption, with the comparison with the conventional steam reforming (CSR) process. Compared to CSR process, the SESR process could obtain higher H2 yield and concentration at lower temperature and S/C ratio, with both of the yield and concentration reaching over 90%. For decreasing the energy consumption, the sensible heat of the hot output streams from the two processes was recovered, with the recovered heat calculated by pinch analysis. To produce the same amount H2, the total energy demand of the SESR process was obviously lower the CSR process, especially under low temperature zone. Finally, the parameters of the two processes were optimized with a matrix analysis method. For SESR process, the optimal SR conditions were the temperature of 500 °C–600 °C, the S/C ratio of 3.0, under which the consumptions of bio-oil and energy were about 20% and about 30% lower than those under the optimal conditions of CSR process, respectively. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This study laid an emphasis on the possible employment of biochar generated from pyrolysis of chicken manure to establish a green platform for producing biodiesel. To this end, the pseudo-catalytic transesterification reaction using chicken manure biochar and waste cooking oil was investigated. Compared with a commercial porous material (SiO2), chicken manure biochar generated from 350 °C showed better performance, resulting in 95.6% of the FAME yield at 350 °C. The Ca species in chicken manure biochar imparted strong catalytic capability by providing the basicity for transesterification. The identified catalytic effect also led to the thermal cracking of unsaturated FAMEs, which decreased the overall FAME yield. For example, 40–60% of converted FAMEs were thermally degraded. To avoid undesirable thermal cracking arising from the high content of the Ca species in chicken manure biochar, the fabrication of chicken manure biochar at temperatures ≥350 °C was highly recommended. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Plant lignocellulosic biomass can be a source of fermentable sugars for the production of second generation biofuels and biochemicals. The recalcitrance of this plant material is one of the major obstacles in its conversion into sugars. Biomass is primarily composed of secondary cell walls, which is made of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Xylan, a hemicellulose, binds to the cellulose microfibril and is hypothesised to form an interface between lignin and cellulose. Both softwood and hardwood xylan carry glucuronic acid side branches. As xylan branching may be important for biomass recalcitrance and softwood is an abundant, non-food competing, source of biomass it is important to investigate how conifer xylan is synthesised. Results: Here, we show using Arabidopsis gux mutant biomass that removal of glucuronosyl substitutions of xylan can allow 30% more glucose and over 700% more xylose to be released during saccharification. Ethanol yields obtained through enzymatic saccharification and fermentation of gux biomass were double those obtained for non-mutant material. Our analysis of additional xylan branching mutants demonstrates that absence of GlcA is unique in conferring the reduced recalcitrance phenotype. As in hardwoods, conifer xylan is branched with GlcA. We use transcriptomic analysis to identify conifer enzymes that might be responsible for addition of GlcA branches onto xylan in industrially important softwood. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo activity assays, we demonstrate that a white spruce (Picea glauca) gene, PgGUX, encodes an active glucuronosyl transferase. Glucuronic acid introduced by PgGUX reduces the sugar release of Arabidopsis gux mutant biomass to wild-type levels indicating that it can fulfil the same biological function as native glucuronosylation. Conclusion: Removal of glucuronic acid from xylan results in the largest increase in release of fermentable sugars from Arabidopsis plants that grow to the wild-type size. Additionally, plant material used in this work did not undergo any chemical pretreatment, and thus increased monosaccharide release from gux biomass can be achieved without the use of environmentally hazardous chemical pretreatment procedures. Therefore, the identification of a gymnosperm enzyme, likely to be responsible for softwood xylan glucuronosylation, provides a mutagenesis target for genetically improved forestry trees. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The main goals for sustainable water resource recovery include maximizing energy generation, minimizing adverse environmental impacts, and recovering beneficial resources. Wastewater biosolids pyrolysis is a promising technology that could help facilities reach these goals because it produces biochar that is a valuable soil amendment as well as bio-oil and pyrolysis gas (py-gas) that can be used for energy. The raw bio-oil, however, is corrosive; therefore, employing it as fuel is challenging using standard equipment. A novel pyrolysis process using wastewater biosolids-derived biochar (WB-biochar) as a catalyst was investigated to decrease bio-oil and increase py-gas yield for easier energy recovery. WB-biochar catalyst increased the py-gas yield nearly 2-fold, while decreasing bio-oil production. The catalyzed bio-oil also contained fewer constituents based on GC-MS and GC-FID analyses. The energy shifted from bio-oil to py-gas, indicating the potential for easier on-site energy recovery using the relatively clean py-gas. The metals contained in wastewater biosolids played an important role in upgrading pyrolysis products. The Ca and Fe in WB-biochar reduced bio-oil yield and increased py-gas yield. The py-gas energy increase may be especially useful at water resource recovery facilities that already combust anaerobic digester biogas for energy since it may be possible to blend biogas and py-gas for combined use. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL) synthesis from biorenewable feedstocks in the presence of metal salts and under non-microwave instant heating reaction environment has been studied. Initial screening suggested CuCl2 and FeCl3 as an efficient catalyst for EL synthesis from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), thereby resulting into 47.5% and 43.3% EL yield respectively at 160 °C in 5 min. Interestingly, environmentally benign and widely available metal salt, AlCl3, was found to yield comparable EL (39.0%) when experiments were performed under identical reaction conditions. Therefore, further study was performed using AlCl3 to estimate the effect of operating parameters and catalyst concentration over EL yield and HMF conversion. Thereafter, a comparative study on the effect of microwave vs non-microwave instant heating reaction environment has been done to develop a sustainable process for EL synthesis. Consequently, mechanistic insights on reactant conversion and product yield have been attempted to understand various pathways followed. Thereafter, effect of reaction temperature, catalyst loading, ethanol concentration and heating rates were explored. EL synthesis from HMF under instant heating reaction conditions in the presence of metal salts is reported for the first time. We anticipate that present work would be helpful in providing insights on effects of instant heating method and operating conditions for EL synthesis from HMF. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioelectrocatalytic carbon nanotube based pellets comprising redox enzymes were directly integrated in a newly conceived flow-through fuel cell. Porous electrodes and a separating cellulose membrane were housed in a glucose/oxygen biofuel cell design with inlets and outlets allowing the flow of electrolyte through the entire fuel cell. Different flow setups were tested and the optimized single cell setup, exploiting only 5 mmol L-1 glucose, showed an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.663 V and provided 1.03 ± 0.05 mW at 0.34 V. Furthermore, different charge/discharge cycles at 500 ω and 3 kω were applied to optimize long-term stability leading to 3.6 J (1 mW h) of produced electrical energy after 48 h. Under continuous discharge at 6 kω, about 0.7 mW h could be produced after a 24 h period. The biofuel cell design further allows a convenient assembly of several glucose biofuel cells in reduced volumes and their connection in parallel or in series. The configuration of two biofuel cells connected in series showed an OCV of 1.35 V and provided 1.82 ± 0.09 mW at 0.675 V, and when connected in parallel, showed an OCV of 0.669 V and provided 1.75 ± 0.09 mW at 0.381 V. The presented design is conceived to stack an unlimited amount of biofuel cells to reach the necessary voltage and power for portable electronic devices without the need for step-up converters or energy managing systems. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The alkyl ester of vegetable oil represents as an alternative fuel for diesel engines which is to reduce the cost of biodiesel by increasing the efficiency of biodiesel production by single step reaction i.e. production of biodiesel by combing extraction of oil from oilseed and reaction of extract with alcohol by using ultrasonication. This process is called ultrasonic reactive-extraction. It consists of the investigation of the optimum conditions i.e. seed size >1–<2, molar ratio oilseed to methanol 1:100, catalyst concentration 1.5 wt% of oilseed, reaction time 20 min and ultrasonic amplitude 50%, cycle 0.3 s gives the maximum conversion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydroisomerisation/hydrocracking properties of Ni-zeolite catalysts (H-MFI and H-Beta) are studied using n-hexadecane as model compound and compared with those of Ni/ASA (amorphous silica-alumina) as reference catalyst. In the case of H-Beta, the effect of the introduction of mesoporosity by controlled desilication is also investigated. The results indicate that Ni on desilicated H-Beta catalysts shows very interesting characteristics for the potential use in the production of biofuel from vegetable/algal oil, or the upgrading of biomass-derived Fischer–Tropsch waxes. Ni/H-Beta shows lower activity with respect to Ni/H-MFI, but significantly lower formation of gases and much better hydroisomerisation activity. The introduction of mesoporosity by desilication enhances the activity, while still maintaining an acceptable gas formation and good hydroisomerisation properties. Furthermore, the desilication treatment improves the stability with respect to carbon formation. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Oxymethylene dimethyl ethers (OMEs) are promising fuel additives that are accessible from renewable resources. We present a mechanistic investigation of the zeolite-catalyzed synthesis of OMEs from trioxane and OME1 based on first-principles calculations. The most favorable mechanism proceeds via direct incorporation of trioxane rather than formaldehyde incorporation after prior trioxane decomposition to formaldehyde. The computed mechanism is in agreement with the experimental kinetics as well as the selectivity after short and long reaction times. The competition between direct incorporation of trioxane and formaldehyde is predicted to depend on the acidity of the catalyst as well as the concentration of protic species in solution.

AB  - Fixed-bed pyrolysis experiments of walnut shell have been conducted in a well-swept tubular reactor to investigate the effects of various process parameters on product yields. For this purpose, pyrolysis temperature, reaction time and sweeping gas (N2) flow rate were set in the ranges of 350–650 °C, 10–50 min and 50–450 ml min−1, respectively. The heating rate was fixed at 40 °C min−1. Maximum liquid yield was obtained at 500 °C, 30 min and 150 ml min−1 as 48.2%. The liquid product was characterized by FTIR and GC–MS analyses, and shown to be a highly oxygenated complex mixture with 32 identified compounds whose carbon distribution was between C2-C10. In addition, the solid product was analyzed by means of FTIR, SEM and BET surface area which showed that solid product, as produced, was not appropriate for activated carbon applications. However, the higher heating value of solid product was higher than that of sub-bituminous coal, indicating a valuable solid fuel. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The emissions and the potential health effects of particulate matter (PM) were assessed from two heavy-duty trucks with and without emission control aftertreatment systems when operating on CARB ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and three different biodiesel blends. The CARB ULSD was blended with soy-based biodiesel, animal fat biodiesel, and waste cooking oil biodiesel at 50 vol%. Testing was conducted over the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) in triplicate for both trucks. The aftertreatment controls effectively decreased PM mass and number emissions, as well as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared to the uncontrolled truck. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) exhibited increases with the biodiesel blends, showing some feedstock dependency for the controlled truck. The oxidative potential of the emitted PM, measured by means of the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, showed reductions with the use of biodiesel blends relative to CARB ULSD for the uncontrolled truck. Overall, the cellular responses to the particles from each fuel were reflective of the chemical content, i.e., particles from CARB ULSD were the most reactive and exhibited the highest cellular responses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - SrO/SiO2 composite was synthesized in a few minutes by reacting Strontium acetylacetonate in benzyl alcohol with mm size SiO2 beads using microwave radiation under argon atmosphere. The current work illustrates the optimization of a one-stage method whereby Nannochloropsis microalgae is converted to biodiesel using direct transesterification by microwave irradiation, the SrO/SiO2 serving as a base catalyst. Microwave radiation accelerates the disruption of the microalgae cells, and eases the release of oil. The SrO/SiO2 has been characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron micrograph (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The activity of the catalyst particles in the transesterification reaction was studied using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The catalyst was reused for six cycles without appreciable loss in catalytic activity and the biodiesel yield of the Nannochloropsis microalgae was measured. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ni/CMK-3 catalyst, the mesoporous carbon material loading Ni activity, was prepared and used in the in-situ hydrogenation of mixed model compounds (including acetone, acetic acid, furfural, o-cresol, ethanediol and water) of bio-oil (MCB) and actual bio-oil in this paper. The effects of hydrogen donors, solvents and the dosages of catalyst were all investigated in the in-situ hydrogenation process. The results showed that the hydrogen donor of methanol, ethanol and formic acid could all provide hydrogen for the in-situ hydrogenation but the product distributions of bio-oils were different after in-situ hydrogenation. Using alcohols as hydrogen donors, esterification reaction happened between the hydrogen donors and acetic acid. The formic acid could promote the phenols conversion but the conversion of acetic acid was restrained. When the radio of water and methanol was 10:3 and 10:5, most of ketones and aldehydes in the raw bio-oil converted to alcohols and the conversion of acids and phenols was beyond 50%. The contents of alcohols and esters in raw bio-oil increased from 18.52% to 51.14% and 48.21%. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Multistage systems utilize a staged thermal gradient to fractionate bio-oil into product streams consisting of distinct functional groups, and multi-step chemical synthesis for downstream processing of bio-oil fractions to hydrocarbon fuels. Results at the process scale reveal that multistage systems have several advantages over the base-case including: (1) ∼40% reduction in process hydrogen consumption and (2) the product distribution for multistage systems are skewed towards longer carbon chain compounds that are fungible with diesel-range fuels. LCA reveals that the median Energy Return On Investment (EROI) and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for multistage systems range from 1.32 to 3.76 MJ-fuel/MJ-primary fossil energy and 17.1 to 52.8 gCO2e/MJ-fuel respectively, over the host of co-product scenarios and allocation schemes analyzed, with fossil-derived hydrogen constituting the principle GHG and primary energy burden across all systems. These results are compelling and indicate that multistage systems exhibit comparatively higher gasoline/diesel-range fuel yield relative to current technology, and produce a high quality infrastructure-compatible hydrocarbon transportation fuel capable of achieving over 80% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions relative to baseline petroleum diesel. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The chemical and structural changes of three lignocellulosic biomass samples during pyrolysis were investigated using both conventional and advanced characterization techniques. The use of ATR-FTIR as a characterization tool is extended by the proposal of a method to determine aromaticity, the calculation of both CH2/CH3 ratio and the degree of aromatic ring condensation ((R/C)u). With increasing temperature, the H/C and O/C ratios, XA and CH2/CH3 ratio decreased, while (R/C)u and aromaticity increased. The micropore network developed with increasing temperature, until the coalescence of pores at 1100 °C, which can be linked to increasing carbon densification, extent of aromatization and/or graphitization of the biomass chars. WAXRD-CFA measurements indicated the gradual formation of nearly parallel basic structural units with increasing carbonization temperature. The char development can be considered to occur in two steps: elimination of aliphatic compounds at low temperatures, and hydrogen abstraction and aromatic ring condensation at high temperatures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We develop an integrated strategy for the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. Cellulose and hemicellulose fractions are first hydrolyzed into sugars using a mixture of γ-valerolactone (GVL), water, and toluene as a solvent containing dilute sulfuric acid as a catalyst, and the sugars are then co-fermented into ethanol over engineered yeast strains. Separation subsystems are designed to effectively recover GVL and toluene for reuse in biomass hydrolysis and to recover lignin and humins for heat and power generation. We also develop an alternative process, in which we recover sugars and GVL from the residual biomass. To minimize utility requirements, we conduct heat integration, which allows us to meet all heating requirements using biomass residues. Finally, we perform a range of system-level analyses to identify the major cost and technological drivers. The proposed strategy is shown to be cost-competitive with other strategies. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production by using supercritical methyl acetate in a continuous flow reactor was investigated for the first time. The aim of this study was to elucidate the reaction kinetics of biodiesel production by using supercritical methyl. Experiments were conducted at various reaction temperatures (300–400 °C), residence times (5–30 min), oil-to-methyl acetate molar ratio of 1:40, and a fixed pressure of 20 MPa. Reaction kinetics of biodiesel production with supercritical methyl acetate was determined. Finally, biodiesel yield obtained from this method was compared to that obtained with supercritical methanol, ethanol, and MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether). The results showed that biodiesel yield with supercritical methyl acetate increased with temperature and time. The developed kinetic model was found to fit the experimental data well. The reactivity of supercritical methyl acetate was the lowest, followed by that of supercritical MTBE, ethanol, and methanol, under the same conditions. © 2017

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of biodiesel production from Salvia macrosiphon oil (SMO) using the ultrasonic system. The major properties of Salvia macrosiphon methyl ester was compared with ASTM standards and the specifications met the requirements of biodiesel standards. This allows Salvia macrosiphon oil to be utilized for biodiesel production and be a potential substitute to diesel fuel; it can also be blended with diesel fuel. The performance and the exhaust emissions of a diesel engine operating on Salvia macrosiphon biodiesel-diesel blended fuels have been investigated. The experimental test results indicated that by using biodiesel-diesel blends, brake power, torque and concentrations of the CO2 and NOx emissions increased while the specific fuel consumption (SFC) and concentration of CO and HC emissions decreased. The results obtained revealed that high oxygen content of Salvia macrosiphon biodiesel resulted in significant overall improvements in the combustion reaction especially in B20 (20 vol% biodiesel and 80 vol% diesel fuel). CO and HC were reduced by up to 25% and 31.82% respectively in B20 compared to neat diesel fuel (B0). The innovated fuel blend also increased engine performances, which are the power and torque, by up to 18% and 15.8% respectively, and decreased specific fuel consumption by 4.6%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Experimental trials have been conducted using an optical swirl burner to compare the heat release and emission profiles from the application of four different aviation fuel blends with changing inlet conditions. The mixtures comprised fossil Jet A-1 and a HRJ (Hydrotreated Renewable Jet fuel) batch produced from used cooking oil processing, and blended in discrete ratios. Changes in the produced emissions were quantified with varying combustor pressure and equivalence ratio, in addition to analysing the distribution of combustion heat release using OH∗ chemiluminescence, and monitoring operational rig temperatures. Results suggest the presence of HRJ can reduce emissions and lead to a more compacted and homogenous heat release zone, beneficial as localised hot-spots can lead to the generation of soot and thermal NOx. An increase in pressure was also shown to compact the flame brush at constant thermal power, due to density changes in the combustion air, and reduced bulk flow. The presented heat release distributions and experimental data are useful for the validation of numerical simulations, particularly for the use of alternative fuels. The work also highlights the correlation of flow/acoustic perturbations with heat release, crucial in characterising global combustion behaviour. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Furfuralcohol (FOL) is an important intermediate for the production of lysine, ascorbic acid, and lubricants. It can be used as a hypergolic fuel in rocketry. In this study, it was attempted to synthesize FOL from xylose by tandem catalysis with solid acid SO42−/SnO2-Montmorillonite and recombination Escherichia coli CCZU-K14 whole cells. Using SO42−/SnO2-Montmorillonite (3.0 wt% dosage) as catalyst, a highest furfural yield of 41.9% was achieved from xylose at 170 °C for 20 min. Furthermore, Escherichia coli CCZU-K14 whole cells were used for bioconverting furfural to FOL. The optimum biocatalytic reaction temperature, reaction pH, cosubstrate concentration, and substrate concentration were 30 °C, 6.5, 1.5 mol glucose/mol furfural, and 200 mM, respectively. Finally, the yield of FOL from 200 mM furfural was achieved to 100% by Escherichia coli CCZU-K14 whole cells after 24 h. In conclusion, this strategy show high potential application for the effective synthesis of FOL. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass gasification is a proven technology; however, one of the major obstacles in using product syngas for electric power generation and biofuels is the removal of tar. The purpose of this research was to develop and evaluate effectiveness of tar removal methods by cooling the syngas and using wood shavings as filtering media. The performance of the wood shavings filter equipped with an oil bubbler and heat exchanger as cooling systems was tested using tar-laden syngas generated from a 20-kW downdraft gasifier. The tar reduction efficiencies of wood shavings filter, wood shavings filter with heat exchanger, and wood shavings filter with oil bubbler were 10%, 61%, and 97%, respectively. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Characteristics of pulsed corona discharge were investigated experimentally to combine methyl radical decomposition and hydrodeoxygenation reaction for bio oil upgrading. In contrast to conventional upgrading methods, no hydrogen was used as a feed. The required hydrogen was generated in situ considering the ability of plasma to decompose methyl radicals to hydrogen. Pin to plate corona discharge and 4methylanisole as a model of bio oil were used. Effect of operating and design parameters namely, carrier gas flow rate, pulse repetition frequency, plate electrode diameter, pin number and gap distance were studied on the conversion and selectivity of products. Variation of mentioned parameters can alter the electron and energetic species density and energy which results in improving reaction conversion and product selectivity. The upgrading mechanism of 4ethylanisole was described by a reaction pathway. Demethylation, transalkylation, hydrogenolysis, demethoxylation and methane decomposition are the main chemical reactions. It is worth noting that the optimum condition for methyl decomposition and hydrodeoxygenation reaction are similar for most of design and operating parameters. It was found that the most valuable and abundant products were BTX and phenol with maximum selectivity of about 15% and 46%, respectively. Results indicated that corona discharge plasma can overcome the disadvantages of conventional upgrading process which caused by high pressure hydrogen. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - This study evaluated the techno-economic performance and potential benefits of methanol production through catalytic gasification of forest residues and lignin. The results showed that while catalytic gasification enables increased cold gas efficiencies and methanol yields compared to non-catalytic gasification, the additional pre-treatment energy and loss of electricity production result in small or no system efficiency improvements. The resulting required methanol selling prices (90–130 €/MWh) are comparable with production costs for other biofuels. It is concluded that catalytic gasification of forest residues can be an attractive option as it provides operational advantages at production costs comparable to non-catalytic gasification. The addition of lignin would require lignin costs below 25 €/MWh to be economically beneficial. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, conversion of sewage sludge to biogas by anaerobic co-digestion with crude glycerol was examined. When 0.126 g/L crude glycerol was added to the reactor, only methane was produced. Upon addition of 5.04 g/L crude glycerol, hydrogen production occurred, and a significant amount of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) was generated in the liquid phase. On day 6, the dry weight was largely composed of organic acids (48%) and 1,3-PDO (17%), which are water-soluble. Degradation of 1,3-PDO was very slow, which is advantageous for recovery. Crude glycerol, which contains alkaline substances, promoted organic matter degradation by microorganisms, which possibly affected biogas and 1,3-PDO production. Addition of 0.630–2.52 g/L glycerol initially led to hydrogen production, followed by methane production a few days later, which stabilized within 1 week. In conclusion, adjustment of the crude glycerol concentration allows controllable conversion to value-added products for co-digestion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The electrochemical performance of lithium ion battery was enhanced by using biochar derived from Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) as widespread green macroalgae in most areas of the Iran’s Caspian sea coast. By the utilization of the structure of the biochar, micro-/macro-ordered porous carbon with olive-shaped structure was successfully achieved through pyrolysis at 500 °C, which is the optimal temperature for biofuel production, and was activated with HCl. The biochar and HCl treatment biochar (HTB) were applied as anode electrode in lithium ion batteries. Then, electrochemical measurements were conducted on the electrodes via galvanostatic charge–discharge, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. The electrochemical results indicated a higher specific discharge capacity (700 mAh g−1) and good cycling stability for HTB at the current density of 0.1 A g−1 as compared to the biochar. The reason that HTB electrode works better than the biochar could be due to the higher surface area, formation functional groups, removal impurities, and formation some micropores after HCl treatment. The biochar derived from marine biomass and treatment process developed here could provide a promising path for the low-cost, renewable, and environmentally friendly electrode materials. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - In this work, the effect of controlled thermal treatment to tune biochar surface properties such as area/porosity, functionalities and reactivity was investigated. TG-MS, CHN, Raman, IR, BET, Zeta and SEM analyses suggested that thermal treatment led to the decomposition of an organic complex/amorphous phase to produce micropores based on graphene nanostructures and a strong increase on surface area from 3 m2 g−1 for biochar to 30, 408 and 590 m2 g−1, at 400, 600 and 800 °C, respectively. The treatment also led to a gradual decrease on oxygen content from 27 to 14 wt% at 800 °C due to decomposition of surface functionalities changing surface properties such as zeta potential, adsorption of anionic and cationic species and an increase on the activity for sulfide oxidation which is discussed in terms of increase in surface area and the presence of surface redox quinone groups. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Depleting non-renewable energy sources combined with stringent environmental norms necessitate researchers to search for alternative energy sources. Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising alternatives if produced, stored and harnessed properly. Biomass derived bio-oil extracted through fast pyrolysis is an alternative source for sustainable H2 generation via the reforming process. This review summarizes recent work done in the field of H2 generation using steam reforming of bio-oil and the influence of operating parameters such as temperature, S/C ratio and type of catalyst used. Other than steam reforming, several other reforming techniques, such as oxidative steam reforming, aqueous phase reforming and partial oxidation, have also been discussed. Various catalytic systems with Ni, Pt and Ru on different supports have been investigated. Coke deposition on the catalyst surface over a long period of operation is the major shortcoming for reforming reaction which lowers the catalytic activity and requires frequent regeneration. Use of additives like MgO, K, Ca and addition of a small amount of O2 reduces coke formation as well as increases the catalytic activity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study presents first comprehensive thermochemical analysis of Bambara groundnut shell. Pyrolysis characteristics was examined under non-isothermal degradation in nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates (10, 15 and 20 °C/min) using single-step global model kinetic model. The single-step global model average apparent activation energy was found to be 142.64 ± 5.7 kJ/mol. Pyrolysis was conducted in a fixed bed reactor. Effects of pyrolysis temperature (450–750 °C), heating rate (20–50 °C/min) and nitrogen flow rate (5–25 L/min) were investigated collectively. The process variables were optimized using response surface methodology with central composite design. Optimum bio-oil yield of 36.49 wt% was recorded at 600 °C, 50 °C/min and 11 L/min. The bio-oil, bio-char and non-condensable gas collected were comprehensively characterised. Energy analysis of the products was also evaluated. This study revealed that Bambara groundnut shell, a residue from food crop, is a potential source of energy precursors for development of a sustainable bioenergy system and biomaterials. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, diesel (JIS#2) and various biodiesel fuels (BDF20, BDF50, BDF100) are used to operate the diesel engine at 100 Nm, 200 Nm and full load; while the engine speed is 1800 rpm. The system is experimentally studied, and the energy, exergy, sustainability, thermoeconomic and exergoeconomic analyses are performed to the system. The Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer is used to measure the size distribution of engine exhaust particle emissions. Also, the data of the exhaust emissions, soot, particle numbers, fuel consumptions, etc. are measured. It is found that (i) most of the exhaust emissions (except NOx) are directly proportional to the engine load, (ii) maximum CO2 and NOx emissions rates are generally determined for the BDF100 biodiesel fuel; while the minimum ones are calculated for the JIS#2 diesel fuel.

AB  - A family of faujasite (FAU) zeolites with different Si:Al ratio, and/or hierarchical porosity introduced via post-synthetic alkaline desilication treatment, have been evaluated as solid acid catalysts for esterification pretreatments of pyrolysis bio-oil components. Acetic acid esterification with aliphatic and aromatic alcohols including methanol, anisyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, p-cresol and n-butanol was first selected as a model reaction to identify the optimum zeolite properties. Materials were fully characterised using N2 porosimetry, ICP, XRD, XPS, FT-IR, pyridine adsorption, NH3 TPD, In-situ ATR and inverse gas chromatography (IGC). IGC demonstrates that the surface polarity and hence hydrophobicity of FAU decreases with increased Si:Al ratio. Despite possessing a higher acid site loading and acetic acid adsorption capacity, high Al-content FAU possess weaker acidity than more siliceous catalysts. Esterification activity increases with acid strength and decreasing surface polarity following the order FAU30&gt;FAU6&gt;FAU2.6. The introduction of mesoporosity through synthesis of a hierarchical HFAU30 material further enhances esterification activity through improved acid site accessibility and hydrophobicity. Methanol was the most reactive alcohol for esterification, and evaluated with HFAU30 for the pretreatment of a real pyrolysis bio-oil, reducing the acid content by 76% under mild conditions. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Catalytic liquefaction can effectively convert solid biomass into liquid bio-crude that could be upgraded to advanced biofuel, but the exploration of green and efficient catalysts remain a challenge. In this study, bifunctional Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts were firstly combined with supercritical ethanol to produce bio-crude in pine sawdust catalytic liquefaction. The catalysts were characterized by BET, NH3-TPD, XRD and TEM. The effects of Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn loading ratios on the yield and quality of bio-crude and gas were investigated. The results showed that Zn/HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 catalysts improved the yields of bio-crude compared to no catalyst treatment. The use of HZSM-5 based catalysts reduced the contents of oxygenated compounds including acids, ketones, phenols and alcohols in bio-crude products. Hydrocarbons content of the bio-crudes produced by HZSM-5 based catalysts increased compared to bio-crude produced by no catalyst treatment. Compared to HZSM-5 catalyst, Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts exhibited better catalyst performance to improve bio-crude quality due to the additional decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydrogenation reactions induced by Zn loading. 15%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst resulted in the highest yields of bio-crude at 59.09 wt.%, and 10%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst produced bio-crude with the highest hydrocarbons content at 15.03%. The four stages of mechanism for biomass liquefaction reactions on Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts in supercritical ethanol was proposed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this experimental study, glycerol conversion to hydrogen and synthesis gas was carried out by utilizing thermal plasma technology. An entrained-flow reactor equipped with a direct current arc discharge plasma torch, which was used to heat plasma-forming gas via Joule heating effect, and superheated water vapor, which was used to form the plasma, as a main reaction agent and a source of active radicals generation during steam reforming process of glycerol, set up a core of the glycerol conversion system. Glycerol, which is a by-product of biodiesel production during transesterification process, is considered to be a potential feedstock for renewable energy, biofuels, and high value-added chemicals production, such as methanol, hydrogen, etc. The reforming of glycerol was performed at various experimental conditions by changing the flow rate of water vapor and glycerol as well as the plasma torch power. The obtained results showed that the main reaction products were hydrogen and carbon monoxide with total concentration up to 75%. Moreover, the process was quantified in terms of cold gas efficiency, energy efficiency, carbon conversion, and specific energy requirement. Generally, the performed study indicates that hydrogen and synthesis gas could be effectively produced from glycerol by employing thermal plasma technology. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The hydrogenolysis of carbon-oxygen bonds is an important model reaction in upgrading biomass-derived furanic compounds to transportation fuels. One of these model reactions, namely conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to the gasoline additive 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), is especially attractive. In this study, bimetallic Cu-Co catalysts supported on CeO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3 were used for the selective hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF. The structures of the fresh and used catalysts were studied using X-ray diffraction, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction by H2, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, and CHNS analysis. The structures were correlated with the catalytic activities. The Cu-Co/CeO2 catalyst produced mainly 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan via reduction of C=O bonds on large Cu particles. The Cu-Co/Al2O3 catalyst gave the best selectivity for DMF, as a result of a combination of highly dispersed Cu, mixed copper-cobalt oxides, and suitable weak acidic sites. Cu-Co/ZrO2 had low selectivity for DMF and produced a combination of various over-hydrogenolysis products, including 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran and 5,5-oxybis(methylene)-bis(2-methylfuran), because of the presence of strong acidic sites. The reaction pathways and effects of various operating parameters, namely temperature, H2 pressure, and time, were studied to enable optimization of the selective conversion of HMF to DMF over the Cu-Co/Al2O3 catalyst. © 2017, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Micro algae are promising attractive energy carriers. Their biomass productivity is 5–30 times higher than that of first and second generation biomass. Additionally, they utilize CO2 for their photosynthetic process thereby protects possibly the environment and contributes towards CO2 remediation at higher rates. Their cultivation can be combined with wastewater and industrial effluents which consequently leads to the bioremediation of inorganic elements more effectively. Among the conversion technologies for the biofuel production from the micro algal biomass, thermochemical conversion is an enduring sustainable alternative path in the view of engineering as this process utilizes all kinds of the biochemical moieties from the micro algal biomass cellular constitution. This article reviews the bio moieties of micro algal biomass, and subsequent use of them in thermochemical liquefaction (TCL) technologies like pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) for the extraction of liquid fuels and upgrading of bio-oil processes via decarbonylation, decarboxylation (DCO) and hydrogenation for palmitic/oleic using suitable catalysts viz activated carbon with noble metals &amp; cost-effective tungsten based catalysts. These two technically feasible processes in an appropriate technical downstream path are dependent on the oil upgrading process. Moreover, a comparative study of pyrolysis and HTL processes has been evaluated towards the challenges and opportunities of a commercial-scale microalgae-to-fuels process in the consideration for mitigating technical, environmental, and logistical concern. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biological assays often require expensive reagents and tedious manipulations. These shortcomings can be overcome using digitally operated microfluidic devices that require reduced sample volumes to automate assays. One particular challenge is integrating bioassays with mass spectrometry based analysis. Towards this goal we have developed μNIMS, a highly sensitive and high throughput technique that integrates droplet microfluidics with nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS). Enzyme reactions are carried out in droplets that can be arrayed on discrete NIMS elements at defined time intervals for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, enabling time resolved enzyme activity assay. We apply the μNIMS platform for kinetic characterization of a glycoside hydrolase enzyme (CelE-CMB3A), a chimeric enzyme capable of deconstructing plant hemicellulose into monosaccharides for subsequent conversion to biofuel. This study reveals NIMS nanostructures can be fabricated into arrays for microfluidic droplet deposition, NIMS is compatible with droplet and digital microfluidics, and can be used on-chip to assay glycoside hydrolase enzyme in vitro. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Methanol is an alternative fuel offering a lower well-to-wheel CO2 emission as well as a higher efficiency, given that the fuel is derived from biomass. In addition to reduced CO2, methanol does not emit soot particles when combusted which is a great advantage when attempting to reduce NOX levels due to the effectively non-existing NOX-soot trade-off. The engine setup used was a Scania D13 engine modified to run on one cylinder, utilizing a high compression piston with a rc of 27:1. This study analyzes the effects of four control parameters on gross indicated efficiency and the indicated specific emissions; CO, THC and NOX. The control parameters chosen in this work was common rail pressure (PRAIL), EGR, λ and CA50, running at 6 bar IMEPG and 1200 rpm. The effects of the control parameters on performance and emissions was analyzed using a surface response method of the Box-Behnken type. Predictive mathematical models were obtained from regression analysis performed on the responses from the experiments. The highest gross indicated efficiency achieved was ∼53%, when a high level of EGR was applied together with the combustion phasing set to its low level at CA50 = 6 CAD ATDC. The control parameters influencing the CO emissions are λ and the interaction between PRAIL and λ, while THC is only controlled by PRAIL and EGR. NOX emissions was, as expected, influenced mainly by EGR and λ, although PRAIL and CA50 also had minor effects. The effect of increased PRAIL, increased THC emissions which in its turn reduced the gross indicated efficiency. Throughout the experiment, THC concentration never decreased below ∼150 ppm due to utilization of high rc in combination with the volatility of methanol. It was also concluded that a rc = 27 is rather high if operation flexibility is required, especially at the higher load range. © 2017

AB  - Free fatty acids (FFA) in low grade oil could be reduced by using an esterification reaction with glycerol, which itself is a waste product of biodiesel synthesis to give mono- and di-glycerides. This study investigated, for the first time, the reaction between oleic acid as a FFA with glycerol, using a phosphonium-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as a catalyst. The effects of temperature (120 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C) and the DES catalyst concentration (1, 3 and 5 wt%) on the esterification efficiency of fatty acid conversion were observed. The glycerol to fatty acid molar ratio (6:1) and agitation speed (600 rpm) were kept constant. The results revealed that the lowest activation energy of 54.64 kJ/mol was attained using 5 wt% of DES catalyst. Accordingly, optimum reaction conditions were found at a temperature of 150 °C with a 5 wt% DES catalyst, which produced 95% FFA conversion after 30 min of reaction time. In addition, 85% of combined mono- and di-glycerides was observed at the optimum condition, which will be easier to transesterify using alcohol. The process was repeated without adding any fresh catalyst and results showed that catalyst activity sustained very well, suggesting that it can be reused a number of times. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Durian shell (DS) was pyrolyzed in a drop-type fixed-bed reactor to study the physicochemical properties of the products. The experiment was carried out with different particle sizes (up to 5 mm) and reaction temperatures (250–650 °C). The highest bio-oil yield was obtained at 650 °C (57.45 wt%) with DS size of 1–2 mm. The elemental composition and higher heating value of the feedstock, bio-oil (650 °C), and bio-char (650 °C) were determined and compared. The compositions of product gases were determined via gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detector. The chemical composition of bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The bio-oil produced at lower temperature yields more alcohols, whereas the bio-oil produced at higher temperature contains more aromatics and carbonyls. Bio-oil has potential to be used as liquid fuel or fine chemical precursor after further upgrading. The results further showed the potential of bio-char as a solid fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the high protein content in algal species, these precursors require further catalytic removal of heteroatoms such as nitrogen, being upgraded to biofuels. In the current study, first, synthesis of Na+ZSM-5 nanocrystals with well-distribution in size was performed successfully with a novel technique in supercritical water. After converting to H+ZSM-5 type, it was applied for hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of crude bio-oil, obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of chlorella sp. microalgae, in the presence of high temperature water and formic acid (HCOOH) mixture. The effects of reaction temperature (250–500 °C), formic acid as a source of in-situ hydrogen, and nano-catalyst (compared with industrial type) on nitrogen elimination and H/C ratio were investigated comprehensively. Compared with non-catalytic upgrading conditions, a substantial amount of nitrogen removal was obtained in the presence of nano-catalyst and formic acid with the maximum amount of 75 wt% at 400 °C in comparison with the macron-size industrial catalyst (54 wt%) at the same temperature. Due to more miscibility and consequently high degree of liquid fuel recovery (Yliq) with less coking as well as more HDN, T = 400 °C was chosen as the optimum temperature. Furthermore, H/C ratio of upgraded bio-oil, as an index of aromatization, had similar trend which indicates that in the presence of H+ZSM-5, higher temperature is more favorable to aromatization than cracking which makes HDN more difficult. In the absence of a catalyst, H/C ratio showed no substantial trend with temperature which demonstrates the significance of H+ZSM-5 catalyst for cracking. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A combined effect of reaction temperature, ethanol-to-oil molar ratio and catalyst concentration on biodiesel production by H3PMo12O40 (HPMo) supported on niobia from macaw palm oil (Acrocomia aculeata) with high free fatty acid content has been studied herein through the response surface methodology. A 23 face centered central composite design was employed in order to conduct the experimental design and results analysis. Optimum conditions were found to be at 210 °C reaction temperature, 90:1 ethanol-to-oil molar ratio and 20.0% catalyst concentration, rendering high-quality biodiesel (99.65% ester content, 4.90 mm2/s viscosity and low monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol levels). Such high performance can be associated with the catalyst satisfactory features, as characterized by typical analyses such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), N2 Adsorption-desorption and Surface acidity. Furthermore, the catalyst can be reused with no notable loss of catalytic activity until the second reaction cycle, thus maintaining an ester content higher than 94%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the biofuel production efficiency of aquatic weeds Lemna gibba, Lemna minor, Pistia stratiotes and Eichhornia sp. In order to see the thermos-chemical properties of the weed biomass, the proximate, elemental (C, H, N and, O) and, biochemical (carbohydrate, starch and lipids) characteristics of biomass were determined. The lipids from plant biomass was also extracted and then analyzed for preparing the fatty acid profiling (FAME). The results revealed the content of volatile matter, fixed carbon, ash, C, H, N and, O in the ranges of 44.6–59, 18.8–26.3, 18.7–24.9, 32.03–38.02, 4.39–4.87, 2.54–5.31 and, 51.81–59.99%, respectively in dried weed biomass. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis suggested the presence of high energy molecules in weed biomass. The content of starch in weed biomass was comparable with other industrial crops being used for bioethanol production. The GC-FID analysis of lipids (FAME analysis) indicated the presence of C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 as dominant fatty acids (FAs), which found commonly in biodiesel. The bioethanol production efficiency of weed biomass was also investigated using a microreactor-based trial. Results thus showed a yield of 0.218, 0.197, 0.215 and, 0.189 g ethanol in g−1 dry biomass of L. minor, L. gibba, P. stratiotes and, Eichhornia sp., respectively. Our results conferred that the biomass of aquatic weeds can be utilized as potential feedstock for production of ethanol, butanol, biodiesel, etc. under the clean energy initiatives. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - A new continuous process for the selective production of castor-oil green diesel was developed, leading to 95.3% purity and ca. 98% relative yield. Castor oil was hydrotreated in fixed-bed continuous reactors, with one or two stages, using NiMo/Al2O3 as catalyst. It was demonstrated that performing the process in a single hydrotreating bed the presence of hydroxyl groups in castor oil afforded secondary reactions that led to low values of purity and yield. Running the reactions in a two-stage continuous system allowed to remove, in the first bed at 270 °C, hydroxyl groups and unsaturations before the deoxygenation of the carboxylic groups in the second bed at 350 °C, improving in this way the purity and the yield considerably. Physicochemical properties of the so-obtained product met most of the specifications of the European standard EN 590 but the CFPP. Blending of green diesel (20% vol) with petro-diesel satisfied CFPP specifications for diesel grade B. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of temperature and residence time on liquefaction of rice straw in subcritical CO2-subcritical water (subCO2-subH2O) and in subcritical CO2-supercritical ethanol (subCO2-scEtOH), considering the final reaction temperatures (270–345 °C) and residence times (15 and 30 min). Residence time was identified as a crucial parameter in the subCO2-subH2O liquefaction, whereas residence time had a marginal influence on subCO2-scEtOH liquefaction. When reaction conditions were 320 °C and 15 min, solvents have weak impact on the quality of bio-oil, HHV 28.57 MJ/kg and 28.62 MJ/kg, respectively. There was an obvious difference between the subCO2-subH2O and subCO2-scEtOH liquefaction mechanisms. In subCO2-subH2O, CO2promoted the carbonyl reaction. In subCO2-scEtOH, supercritical ethanol have the function of donating hydrogen and promoting the reaction of hydroxyl-alkylation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymatic production of biodiesel from palm oil using partially purified lipase from the hepatopancreas of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) as a low cost catalyst was studied. In this optimization study, the effects of reaction time, enzyme concentration, methanol/oil molar ratio, water content and reaction temperature on the biodiesel yield were considered. The best conditions for biodiesel preparation were: 70 kUnit lipase, 4:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 3% water, 45 °C reaction temperature and a reaction time of 16 h. Under these optimal conditions, the maximum biodiesel yield reached 97.01%. The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) were used to ensure the conversion of palm oil into biodiesel. The biodiesel properties were within the recommended biodiesel standards as prescribed by EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751. Therefore, the lipase from the hepatopancreas of Pacific white shrimp is a potential biocatalyst for the biodiesel industry. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide/Au NPs/nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (RGO/Au NPs/N-doped CNTs) assembly supported on nickel foam was utilized as an anode for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). 3D RGO/Au NPs was obtained by electrodepositing reduced graphene oxide on nickel foam (Ni foam), while Au NPs were co-deposited during the process. Afterwards, nitrogen doped CNTs (N-CNTs) were allowed to grow seamlessly on the surfaces of 3D RGO/Au NPs via a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. In this nanostructure, Au NPs co-deposition and nitrogen doping offer more active sites for bioelectrocatalysis. Additionally, N-CNTs were demonstrated providing high specific surface area for enzyme immobilization and facilitating the electron transfer between glucose oxidase (GOx) and electrode. The resulting bioanode achieved efficient glucose oxidation with high current densities of 7.02 mA cm−2 (0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Coupling with a Pt cathode, the fabricated glucose/air biofuel cell exhibited an open-circuit potential of 0.32 V and generated a maximum power density 235 µW cm−2 at 0.15 V. This novel electrode substrate achieved high performance in current density at bioelectrochemical systems and could be useful for further exploiting the application of three dimensional carbon-based nanomaterials in EBFCs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Expansins are small proteins that loosen plant cell walls and cellulosic materials without lytic activity. First discovered in plants, expansin genes are found in the genomes of numerous bacteria and fungi that interact with plants in pathogenic and mutualistic patterns, as well as in microbes that feed on plant debris. Horizontal gene transfer from plants to microbes and between microbes accounts for expansins' irregular taxonomic distribution. Expansins facilitate plant colonization by Bacillus, Clavibacter, and Trichoderma species, a list likely to grow as knowledge of microbial expansin function deepens. Studies have documented a synergistic action of expansins for cellulose digestion by cellulases, but only rarely to an extent that is commercially relevant. Expansins' biophysical actions remain enigmatic because of limited understanding of cell wall structure. Deeper understanding of microbial expansins may lead to novel approaches for biomass deconstruction and biocontrol of plant diseases. Copyright © 2017 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two-step pyrolysis (TSP) of soybean stalk (SS) was investigated by Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and Thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with FTIR spectrophotometer (TG-FTIR) to obtain high value chemicals and high quality bio-oil. The hemicellulose and cellulose in SS were almost decomposed from 200 °C to 400 °C in TG process, while little lignin was decomposed in this stage. Then the first step temperature (T1) was set from 250 °C to 450 °C, and the second step temperature was set as 650 °C to compare with the one-step pyrolysis at 650 °C (OSP). The yields of volatiles of TSP were lower than that of OSP, but the yields of solid products were similar to each other approximately. T1 of 250 °C and 300 °C torrified the SS, but had little influence on the product distribution of the second step. T1 of 350 °C enhanced polycondensation reaction of SS and reached minimum volatile yield. For optimum conditions at T1 of 400 °C and 450 °C, higher contents of oxygenous products (acids, furans, alcohols, ketones and phenols with methoxyl) and nitrogen compounds were achieved in the first step to increase the selectivities toward high value chemicals, and high quality bio-oil with high contents of hydrocarbons could be obtained in the second step. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrolysis and subsequent degradation of microcrystalline cellulose in five ionic liquids (ILs) using metal salts and/or Brønsted acids as catalysts allowed for the direct access to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), an important renewable biofuel precursor and a useful building block. For each catalytic system, several reaction parameters (temperature, reaction time, catalyst, and cellulose loading) have been selectively changed. Four systems ([BMIM]Cl-CrCl3, [BMIM]Cl-FeCl3, [BMIM]Cl-[MIMC4SO3H][HSO4] and the not yet investigated [BMIM]Cl-TiOSO4) were found to be effective for cellulose degradation into HMF. The extraction of HMF from the reaction media represents however the weak point of all these processes being able to affect negatively both HMF recovery and IL recyclability. The critical step which causes the drastic decrease in HMF yield starting from the first recycle has been clearly identified. Furthermore, the possibility to use TiOSO4 as a sustainable and robust catalyst for the conversion of saccharides (or polysaccharides) in HMF has been shown. The present study could open new perspectives for the one-pot synthesis of HMF starting from cellulose and/or other sugars. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The traditional method to isolate cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is to subject cellulosic materials to strong acid hydrolysis by mineral acids, which usually causes problems such as corrosion of equipment, the need for large amounts of water, the difficulty of acid recovery, and over-degradation of cellulose. Thus, a green and sustainable approach for the preparation of CNCs was developed where mild acid hydrolysis with diluted oxalic acid was used. The reaction kinetics of different preparation parameters, such as reaction temperature, oxalic acid dose, addition of HCl, and reaction time were thoroughly investigated. A high yield of up to 85 % was achieved by mild oxalic acid hydrolysis in comparison to the yield of 35 % using the most common approach with sulfuric acid hydrolysis. The CNCs from the above approach have a high thermal stability, that is, a maximum thermal degradation temperature of 350 °C in comparison to 200 °C when sulfuric acid hydrolysis was used. Importantly, oxalic acid solutions were readily recovered, and exhibited consistently high performance in several continuous runs of reaction. The hydrolysates contained mostly monomeric sugars, which could be further utilized for chemical or biofuel production. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This study was conducted on thermal pyrolysis and thermal-catalytic pyrolysis using the AlMCM-41 catalyst with a Si/Al ratio of 50, as an alternative process for turning sunflower oil into biofuel. The catalyst was characterized by X ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption and total acidity by adsorption of n-butylamine, in which it was confirmed an obtainment of AlMCM-41 with an excellent surface area of 857.7 m2 g−1 and good total acidity. TG curves were used to determine the calcination temperature (450 °C) and the infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed a complete removal of the CTMA+. Two liquid fractions were obtained from the thermal and thermal-catalytic pyrolysis of sunflower oil: the first, named bio-oil, is a mixture of hydrocarbons similar to mineral diesel; the second, which was named acid fraction, is composed mainly of high acidity components. It was found by gas chromatography (GC/MS) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that the proportion of acid present in the fraction of bio-oil without catalyst is higher than the proportion of acids in the fraction of bio-oil with catalyst, which indicates that the deoxygenation of the products occurred. Thus, it can be noted that the thermal catalytic sample of the bio-oil features more appropriate results to the diesel range, indicating that the acid sites found in AlMCM-41 catalysts were effective for the oil pyrolysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the swelling of climatic and environmental hazards, Biodiesel is playing the most potential and significant role as the sustainable source of energy. As a substitute for diesel, biodiesel has been getting the attention of researchers/scientists of all over the world. The R &amp; D have indicated sustainability of biodiesel production from non-edible oil sources such as Jatropha and algal oil. The objective of the present study was to optimize the process parameters for the transesterification of algal oil using CaO and 80% wt. CaO.Al2O3 as catalysts. A low temperature transesterification process was selected. A biodiesel yield of 88.89% was achieved with methanol/oil volumetric ratio (3.2:10) using 80% wt. CaO.Al2O3 as catalyst (1.56% w/w) in 125 min time at 50 °C temperature using Response Surface Methodology. It was observed that catalyst concentration, reaction time and methanol/oil volumetric ratio had a significant effect on yield. Also, this model involving heterogeneous catalyst can be used in the industry for efficient biodiesel production from algal oil, thereby saving time and cost of the process in optimizing the process parameters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An overall kinetic power law model has been successfully applied to study the anaerobic digestion of agricultural wastes. In this comparative kinetic study feed composition, organic load rate, residence time and process temperature have been systematically varied in an automated semi-continuous fermentation system to obtain the dependency of the rate of degradation as biogas production on the organic load rate and temperature. The results show that the overall reaction order depend only on the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) at values between 3.6 and 3.7. The Arrhenius approach shows a shift in the rate determining step between the mesophilic and thermophilic temperature regimes. The activation energy at the temperature insensitive mesophilic regime is very small at 8.9 (kJ/mole), while the activation energy at the temperature sensitive thermophilic regime lies around 117 (kJ/mole). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Attention continues to be focused on biomass as a very promising alternative source of renewable materials for energy production. This research focused on the use of a heterogeneous base alkaline earth metal oxide incorporated with a transition metal oxide catalyst supported on gamma alumina oxide varied with different temperatures, Cr loading and number of alumina coatings that make the biodiesel easily separated, low cost and environmental friendly. The physicochemical properties of Cr/Ca(10:90)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 700 °C investigated by BET surface area and CO2-TPD indicated high surface area, 164.32 m2/g and higher basicity, 3.38 mmol/g, respectively. FESEM-EDX mapping showed the homogeneous distribution of each element presence in Cr/Ca(10:90)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was well-distributed and indicated that the Cr/Ca has a higher dispersion on the surface of the γ-Al2O3. The response surface methodology was used to optimize the catalytic activity of Cr/Ca/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for transesterification of biodiesel from low-grade cooking oil. The most important variable for biodiesel yield was the calcination temperature of the catalyst followed by the Cr loading and the number of alumina coatings. The experimental value achieved with 93.10% conversion of biodiesel closely agreed with the predicted result from RSM and validated the findings of response surface optimization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to their unique physicochemical properties, carbon nanochips (CNCs) have been used for studies of the direct electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties of oxidoreductase. In this report, a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with CNCs, and glucose oxidase (GOx) was immobilized on the modified electrode surface. Chitosan (CS) was employed to fix the GOx/CNCs tightly to the surface of the GCE. Characterization of the modified electrode by SEM, TEM, and FT-IR showed that GOx remained in its native structure when immobilized in CNC film. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and linear sweep voltammetry studies showed that direct electrochemical and bioelectrocatalytic activities of GOx were achieved and that the presence of CNCs enhanced the electrochemical response of GOx. Glucose had a linear current response from 0 to 1.9 mM, with a detection limit of 0.16 mM and an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of 0.15 mM. The polarization curve of the biofuel cell revealed that the bioanode afforded an open circuit voltage of 0.59 V, maximum power density of 55 μW cm−2, and maximum current density of 434 μA cm−2. These results establish that the direct immobilization of protein onto the CNC surface can be used to achieve direct electron transfer of other redox enzymes. Furthermore, the findings provide a new perspective toward understanding the kinetics and thermodynamics of biological redox processes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Two new formulations of non-noble metal based diesel oxidation catalysts based on Co[sbnd]Ce based mixed oxide (DOC2) and perovskite catalysts (DOC3) were prepared and retrofitted in a 4-cylinder diesel engine fueled by diesel and Karanja biodiesel blend (KB20). In this study, their effectiveness in reducing raw exhaust particulate emissions vis-à-vis a commercial diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC1) was evaluated. Emission characteristics such as particle number-size distribution, mass-size distribution, and surface area-size distribution, total particle number concentration and count mean diameter as a function of engine load at constant engine speed were evaluated. Variations in total particle number concentration as a function of engine speed were also determined. The prepared DOCs and the commercial DOC showed varying degrees of performance as a function of engine operating conditions. Overall, effectiveness of the prepared DOC's appeared to be more fuel specific. For diesel exhaust, overall performance of DOC1 was more effective compared to both prepared DOCs, with DOC2 being superior to DOC3. In case of KB20 exhaust, the overall performance of DOC2 was either more effective or nearly comparable to DOC1, while DOC3 being not so effective. This showed that the DOCs based on Co[sbnd]Ce based mixed oxide catalysts have potential to replace commercial noble metal based DOC's, especially in engines fueled by biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The proposed work intended to make an intellectual contribution to the domain of green nanotechnology which emphasizes the chemical synthesis of a conducting nanocomposite based on the incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au) into the redox matrix of polyindole (PIn) along with the subsequent improvement in the overall properties of the composite by the addition of sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO). The bioanode was developed by the deposition of the PIn-Au-SGO nanocomposite with subsequent immobilization of ferritin (Frt) and glucose oxidase (GOx) on the glassy carbon electrode (GC). The successful application of the PIn-Au-SGO nanocomposite toward the development of a ferritin-mediated glucose biofuel cell anode was studied by the electrochemical characterization of the constructed bioanode (GC-PIn-Au-SGO/Frt/GOx) for the bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. The maximum current density obtained by the modified bioanode was found to be 17.8 mA cm-2 at the limiting glucose concentration of 50 mM in 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6 at a scan rate of 100 mVs-1. The lifetime of the concerned bioelectrode when stored at 4 °C was estimated to be 53 days approximately. The appreciable results of the structural and electrochemical characterization of the PIn-Au-SGO based bioelectrode reveal its potential applications exclusively in implantable medical devices. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The main objective of the work was to investigate about the feasibility to produce high-quality bio-oil from Mediterranean sea plant by catalytic pyrolysis process. Therefore, experiments using Posidonia Oceanica at 500 °C in a fixed bed reactor were explored taking into consideration the biomass conversion and bio-products yields. The effect of different “home-made” Ni, Ce, HZSM-5 based catalysts in pyrolysis process was analyzed mainly in terms of conversion yield, bio-oil yield and bio-oil oxygen and organic compounds content. The highest liquid yields were obtained at 500 °C. Particularly, CeO2 (51.15 wt%), NiCe/HZSM-5 (50.66 wt%) and Ni/CeO2 (49.74 wt%) were the most effective catalysts and these have increased the bio-oil yield compared to non-catalytic ones (47.74 wt%). The highest conversions were obtained with Ni/HZSM-5 (80.81%) and CeO2 (79.07%) which were the most efficient catalysts. Oxygen level was decreased in bio-oils from 25.66 wt% in the starting biomass to 6–8 wt% with CeO2, Ni/CeO2 and NiCe/HZSM-5 catalysts. This is due to the potential of these catalysts to promote deoxygenation reactions, such as dehydration, decarboxylation and decarbonylation, that enhance the bio-oil quality. In terms of compositions zeolite and ceria based catalysts were the best. In absolute the highest content of hydrocarbons was obtained with HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5, 39.56 and 34.91% respectively. Therefore, lower content of acids and oxygen in the bio-oil, higher hydrocarbons, combined with higher heating value show promise for production of high-quality bio-oil from Posidonia Oceanica via catalytic pyrolysis. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coal dust is a major byproduct generated during coal mining production. The diffusion of coal dust not only causes severe environmental pollution, but also poses a serious threat to miners' health. How to provide effective control over coal dust remains one of the key topics of coal mine occupational safety research. RESULTS: The present study is focused on the preparation of an environmentally-friendly cementing agent applicable to the transportation, stacking and storage of coal. The product is characterized by a combination of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), simultaneous thermal analyzer (TGA-DSC)and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) so as to analyze the microscopic reaction and structure of the product; single factor experiments focusing on the peeling strength are carried out to determine the optimal synthesis condition. CONCLUSION: A study on the characteristics of the cementing agent produced indicates that it has an effective dust suppression capability and extreme resistance against unfavorable application conditions. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The article presents a review of the state of the art and lines of research on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae (MA). The main advantages of this technology for production of biofuel are that it does not require predrying of the feedstock and ensures a relatively high product yield—the ratio of the end product weight to the feedstock weight—owing to the fact that all the microalgal components, viz., lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, are converted into biofuel. MA hydrothermal liquefaction is considered to be a promising technology for conversion of biomass and is a subject of a series of research studies and, judging by the available publications, the scope of research in this field is expanding currently. However, many significant problems remain unsolved. In particular, an active searched is being conducted for suitable strains that will ensure not only a high lipid yield—necessary to convert microalgae into biodiesel—but also higher biomass productivity and a higher biofuel yield; the chemical reactions that occur during the hydrothermal treatment are being studied; and the effect of significant process variables, such as temperature, heating rate, holdup time at the maximum temperature, biomass concentration in the water suspension, biochemical and elemental compositions of the microalgae, use of catalysts, etc., on the liquefaction processes is being studied. One of the urgent tasks is also the reduction of the nitrogen content in the resulting biofuel. Studies aimed at the development of a continuous process and rational heat-processing plants for thermal microalgal conversion are being conducted to increase the energy efficiency of the HTL process, in particular, to provide the heat recovery and separation of the end product. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - Microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis using HZSM-5 as catalyst was tested on soapstock and waste tire. Effects of co-pyrolysis temperature, catalyst to feed ratio and soapstock to tire ratio on product fractional yields and chemical composition were studied. Experimental results indicated that the optimal co-pyrolysis temperature was 550 °C, where the highest yield of bio-oil and proportion of aromatics in the bio-oil was obtained. The use of catalyst enhanced the proportion of aromatics, but reduced the yield of bio-oil. Waste tire presented a significant synergistic effect with soapstock to facilitate the production of aromatics in the bio-oil. In addition, the char as a by-product can be used as soil amendment or solid fuel. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is an effective method for bio-oil upgrading. However, the high hydrogen consumption resulted in high bio-oil upgrading cost. In this study, an novel method of hydrogen generation from water for bio-oil HDO was reported. Zinc metal with zero valency was used to generate hydrogen through zinc hydrolysis reaction in the bio-oil HDO process. The effects of different temperatures (20 °C, 250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C) on in situ bio-oil HDO was investigated. The results showed that high temperatures resulted in high hydrogen yield that led to promoted HDO activity over zinc metal-based materials. Although 20 °C bio-oil HDO process generated the highest oil phase yield at 14.07%, 400 °C bio-oil upgrading process produced upgraded bio-oil with highest hydrocarbons content at 68.95%. Physicochemical properties of raw bio-oil improved significantly after bio-oil HDO upgrading at higher temperatures (250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C and 400 °C). The pH of upgraded bio-oils (5.70–6.49) increased significantly compared to raw bio-oil (3.24). The higher heating value of upgraded bio-oils (28.67–33.43 MJ/kg) increased significantly compared to raw bio-oil (15.54 MJ/kg), and valuable hydrocarbons content improved significantly from 16.94% in raw bio-oil to 37.86%–68.95% in upgraded bio-oils. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Using sustainable feed stock such as non-edible oil for the biodiesel production can be one of the cost effective approaches considering the ever growing interest towards renewable energy and problems in existing approaches for production. However, due to the high free fatty acid content, non-edible oils require considerable preprocessing before the actual transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. The present work focuses on intensification of the esterification reaction used as preprocessing step based on acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation also presenting the comparison with the conventional approach. Karanja oil with initial acid value as 14.15 mg of KOH/g of oil has been used as a sustainable feedstock. Effect of operating parameters such as molar ratio, catalyst loading, temperature and type of catalyst (sulfuric acid and Amberlyst-15) on the acid value reduction has been investigated. The maximum reduction in the acid value (final acid value as 2.7 mg of KOH/g of oil) was obtained using acoustic cavitation at optimum molar ratio of oil to methanol as 1:5 and 2% sulfuric acid loading at ambient temperature. In the case of hydrodynamic cavitation, acid value reduced upto 4.2 mg of KOH under optimized conditions of first stage processing. In the second stage esterification using hydrodynamic cavitation and conventional approach, the final acid value was 3.6 and 3.8 mg of KOH/g of oil respectively. Energy requirement analysis for ultrasound and conventional approaches clearly established the superiority of the ultrasound based approach. The present study clearly demonstrated that significant intensification benefits can be obtained in terms of the reduction in the molar ratio and operating temperature for the case of acoustic cavitation as compared to the conventional approach with somewhat lower effects for the hydrodynamic cavitation. © 2016

AB  - This study investigated the microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) of straw stalk and soapstock with HZSM-5 as a catalyst. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalyst:feed ratio, and straw stalk:soapstock ratio on bio-oil yield and composition were discussed. Results showed that temperature greatly influenced the yield and product distribution of bio-oil. The maximum bio-oil yield and highest proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained at 550 °C. Adding HZSM-5 decreased bio-oil yield but improved bio-oil quality. Co-feeding straw stalk and soapstock can improved the proportion of aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The optimal range of straw stalk:soapstock ratio was 1:1 to 1:2. Moreover, biochar is rich in various essential elements and can be used as good soil amendment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, a ZrO2-based polycrystalline ceramic foam catalyst was prepared and used in catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste vegetable oil and high density polyethylene (HDPE) for hydrocarbon fuel production. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalyst dosage, and HDPE to waste vegetable oil ratio on the product distribution and hydrocarbon fuel composition were examined. Experimental results indicate that the maximum hydrocarbon fuel yield of 63.1 wt. % was obtained at 430 °C, and the oxygenates were rarely detected in the hydrocarbon fuel. The hydrocarbon fuel yield increased when the catalyst was used. At the catalyst dosage of 15 wt.%, the proportion of alkanes in the hydrocarbon fuel reached 97.85 wt.%, which greatly simplified the fuel composition and improved the fuel quality. With the augment of HDPE to waste vegetable oil ratio, the hydrocarbon fuel yield monotonously increased. At the HDPE to waste vegetable oil ratio of 1:1, the maximum proportion (97.85 wt.%) of alkanes was obtained. Moreover, the properties of hydrocarbon fuel were superior to biodiesel and 0# diesel due to higher calorific value, better low-temperature low fluidity, and lower density and viscosity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The paper is dedicated to new unconventional sources of non-food renewable feedstock for third generation biofuel – microalgae biomass. Methods of lipid induction in microalgae have been considered. It represents the results of advanced microalgae strains state-of-the-art investigations – lipid producers. The paper discusses selection of stressors at two-stage culturing, where 1st stage includes culturing under most optimal conditions to produce maximum amount of biomass, and at 2nd stage biosynthesis and accumulation of lipids in biomass occurs. Types of stressors used for lipid induction have been briefly reviewed on the basis of foreign studies. Proper experimental results on isolation of new candidate microalgae strains from natural sources, as well as on selection of stressors for lipid induction have been shown and discussed. Nitrogen and phosphoric starvation, high and low illuminance, along with temperature conditions have been studied as stressors. Effectiveness of lipid-containing microalgae screening technique by fluorescent dye Nile red staining has been determined. Processible fast-growing Arhtrospira platensis microalgae/cyanobacteria use perspectiveness as a model for selection of stressors and overall lipid-containing microalgae culturing mode have been verified. Method of various microalgae heat-treated biomass conversion into biohydrogen by anaerobic acetone-butanol fermentation using cellular immobilized catalysts based on Clostridium acetobutylicum has been considered. Ultimate hydrogen efficiency has been found for Chlorococcum sp. rsemsu Ccc-7/11 strain biomass (8.4 и 6.1 mmol/l of medium/day); while hydrogen production is 23.7% and 18.6% of notionally possible level, A. platensis strains cultivated under the influence of stressors (rsemsu 1/02-P – 5.6 mmol/l of medium/day, 32.3%; rsemsu 1/02-Т – 3.3 mmol/of medium/day, 28.8%) rank slightly below them in efficiency, outperforming in hydrogen production. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Biodiesel is the potential substitute to petroleum diesel due to its renewable nature as it is derived from bio-based feedstocks. Both methanol and ethanol have been used as alcohol in transesterification reaction, but as methanol is normally derived from fossil resources, biodiesel produced cannot be termed as completely renewable. As per policies of government of India, Ethanol is being promoted as potential biofuel because it is derived from biomass feedstock. Along with its direct use as biofuel, ethanol can also be incorporated as solvent alcohol in transesterification reaction. This work is an attempt to investigate the potential of ethanol in Karanja biodiesel production by analysis of kinetics of transesterification and its comparison with methanol transesterification. The result of experimental investigation shows that maximum yield of 88.7% and 77% was obtained for methanolysis and ethanolysis respectively at reaction temperature 60 °C, 9:1 molar ratio (alcohol to oil), 1.25 wt.% catalyst loading (KOH) and reaction time of 120 min. It was observed that rate constant and activation energy was 0.007105 min−1 and 20.19 kJ/mol for methanolysis respectively whereas same for ethanolysis was 0.006294 min−1 and 23.35 kJ/mol for ethanolysis. This shows that transesterification reaction proceeds slower when ethanol is used and more energy is required. Fuel properties of ethyl ester of Karanja Oil were found to be superior as compared to corresponding methyl ester. Still it is viable option from Indian prospective because Government of India is promoting the use of ethanol as a potential source of biofuel due to its renewable nature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF) and phenol are considered as one of the new-fashioned liquid transportation biofuels and a key motif for industrial chemicals, respectively. Herein, a highly efficient vapor-phase dehydrogenation-hydrogenation coupling process over bimetallic Ni-Cu alloy nanocatalysts was established for the synchronized production of phenol and DMF with unprecedentedly high yields (>97%) from two cyclohexanol (CHL) and biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) substrates, without any external hydrogen and oxygen supply. Systematic characterization and catalytic experiments revealed that the production of phenol went through a consecutive triple-dehydrogenation process from CHL, while HMF was simultaneously hydrogenated into DMF using active hydrogen species generated from the dehydrogenation process. The bimetallic Ni-Cu alloy nanostructures derived from Ni-Cu-Al layered double hydroxide precursors and strong metal-support interactions play important roles in governing the present coupling process. An appropriate Ni-Cu alloy nanostructure could greatly facilitate the dehydrogenative aromatization of CHL, thus significantly improving the selectivities to both phenol and DMF. Such an unparalleled efficient, eco-friendly and versatile coupling process for the synchronized production of various substituted phenols and DMF makes it practically promising for large-scale industrial applications in terms of green chemistry and sustainable development. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The Fischer-Tropsch process is one of the possible routes to produce synthetic liquid fuels and chemicals employed on large scale in Gas-to-Liquid and Coal-to-Liquid processes, after appropriate transformation of respective fossil sources into syngas. However, syngas can be produced by biomass gasification as well. One of the main problems is the need to ensure high H2/CO ratio to allow the Fischer-Tropsch reaction to occur, operation commonly achieved by resorting to a Water-gas shift step. The present work reports an experimental study on biomass gasification. The aim was to set up a more efficient Biomass-to-Liquid process, which ensures a high H2/CO ratio syngas suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis directly from biomass gasification. In this way, it is possible to remove the Water-gas shift section and consequently make biofuels production more attractive, reducing costs and plant complexity. Two types of biomass have been tested: softwood from forest residues and fast growing crops. Moreover, a bubbling fluidized bed reactor and an indirect gasifier with internal circulating fluidized bed have been used. Gasification tests have been conducted by running gasifiers with both inert and catalytic bed materials. The results have shown that, using the direct gasifier with catalytic bed and a proper configuration, H2/CO molar ratio of 2 can been obtained even at low temperature and low steam/biomass ratio, whereas this is not the case in the indirect one. However, tests suggest that an inverted configuration would make it possible to obtain values near two also with indirect gasifiers, resulting in a new interesting approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The performance, combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine fuelled with corn stalk pyrolysis bio-oil/diesel emulsions (CBDEs) with Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 nanoadditive were studied. The density and viscosity of CBDEs increased by 10.7% and 159.3% with increasing bio-oil concentration up to 25%, respectively. Meanwhile, the calorific value was correspondingly reduced by 18.5%. Compared to diesel, a lower specific fuel consumption was achieved with the CBDE fuels at medium and high powers. This was attributed to micro-explosion, which resulted in more thorough splitting of fuel droplets caused by the instantaneous and intense vaporization of water, thereby significantly improving fuel vaporization and combustion process. In addition, the addition of Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 nanoparticles led to reduced ignition delay and rapid oxidation, thus resulting in more complete combustion. The specific fuel consumption of CBDEs first decreased and then increased in correlation to the increased bio-oil content, in which CBDEs with bio-oil proportion of 20% showed the lowest and had the highest fuel saving rate close to 8.4%. By comparison of diesel, the CBDEs with lower bio-oil proportion than 20% reduced CO, HC and smoke emission, which were decreased by reducing bio-oil content. Increasing bio-oil proportion led to the effective reduction of NOx emission. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Multi-stage thermal biomass decomposition coupled with catalytic upgrading has a number of advantages over conventional single-stage pyrolysis with hydrotreating. However, significant gaps still exist in our understanding of the design of such processes. In this paper, we synthesize alternative catalytic upgrading strategies through integration of different chemistries. Using experimental data, we develop a process model for all strategies and conduct heat integration to minimize utility requirements. Then, using a wide range of technoeconomic analyses, we identify (1) the relationship between process complexity and the resulting fuel-range carbon yields and economic feasibility, (2) the economic advantage of integrating different thermal decomposition fractions, and (3) the key cost drivers of the integrated processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Optimization and characterization of biodiesel production from fish oil extracted from rohu (Labeo rohita) processing waste were investigated in the present study. Wet reduction method showed highest oil yield (95.2%, v/v), compared to other methods (P < 0.05). Physicochemical properties of the oils were investigated before preparing biodiesel through transesterification reaction. Various alcohols, catalysts, reaction temperature and reaction time were evaluated for optimal biodiesel conversion of oil. The maximum yield of biodiesel (95.9%) was obtained with 0.75% KOH as catalyst, 1:0.5 (v/v) oil to methanol ratio and a reaction temperature of 55 °C for 60 min. TLC, FTIR and GC analysis suggested the triglycerides in the RPW oil have completely converted into biodiesel, which contained palmitic acid methyl ester and α-linolenic acid methyl ester as the dominant esters. Physicochemical characteristics of biodiesel were evaluated and the results suggested that quality of biodiesel were feasible. DSC study demonstrated the melting temperature of biodiesel were ranged from −52.56–4.11 °C, indicated the better cold flow property. Moreover, the oxidative stability of biodiesel was improved by adding BHT at 300 mg/kg. Therefore, extracted oil from rohu processing waste could well be used as an alternative source of low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study describes the development of performance and emission characteristics on partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) coated diesel engine fuelled by biodiesel with cetane number enhancing additive of Di-tertiary-butyl peroxide (DTBP). Additive was added to biodiesel in 1% by volume. The biodiesel was prepared from palm oil using simple base catalyst transesterification process. Biodiesel with additive and petroleum diesel were used as the test fuels. The experiment was conducted on a single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled and direct injection coated engine and to determine the performance and emission characteristics of engine running on the test fuels. The results were compared to uncoated engine, running on test fuels. The thermal efficiency for biodiesel with additive fuel was found to be comparable to diesel fuel operation at part load and slightly higher at rest of the load in coated condition. Exhaust emission measurements showed that NOx levels could be significantly reduced using biodiesel with additive fuel compared to diesel fuel in the same experimental conditions. There was no significant improvement on performance and emissions (except HC and CO) of uncoated engine running on biodiesel with additive fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oxygenates present in partially hydro processed lignocellulosic-biomass pyrolysis oil to be component of second generation bio-fuels have been examined for their compact on the laminar flame speed of gasoline. Experiments were performed in an elevated pressure combustion vessel designed around a concept of a premixed Bunsen flame. Laminar flame speed measurements were firstly conducted for neat oxygenate fuel (anisole, 4-methylanisole and ethylvalerate)/N2/O2 mixtures at conditions T = 423 K, P = 0.1 MPa and φ = 0.6–1.3. It has been observed that anisole has a higher flame speed compared to 4-methylanisole and ethylvalerate. Meanwhile, very similar values of flame speeds have been obtained for 4-mythlanisole and ethylvalerate fuels. To learn the potential effect of these oxygenates present in biofuels acting as drop-in additives on the petroleum-based gasoline fuel, a five components surrogate gasoline fuel (hexane, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, cyclohexane, isooctane, and toluene) was then proposed and validated by comparing its laminar flame speed with commercial gasoline. Laminar flame speeds measurements were finally performed for the blends mixed by the proposed surrogate gasoline and different percentage of oxygenates over a large working condition range including T = 400–473 K, φ = 0.6–1.3 and P = 0.1–0.8 MPa. The influence of studied oxygenates as additives on gasoline has been found to be negligible for values up to 10% (wt) which is insensitive to the variation of pressure and temperature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Converting chemicals that can be derived from lignocellulose to cyclic hydrocarbons is a promising route for the synthesis of high-density biofuels. But the low-temperature properties of most synthesized fuels are not good, with high viscosity and freezing point. Herein, we presented the synthesis of cyclohexane derivatives by the alkylation of aromatic oxygenates (anisole, guaiacol and phenol) with furfural alcohol (furfuryl alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural), followed with hydrodeoxygenation. It is found that FeCl3 exhibits relatively high activity and selectivity for the alkylation of anisole (guaiacol), and AlCl3 is the best catalyst for phenol. The selectivity of mono-alkylation product is 71.0%, 92.4% and 84.3% for the alkylation of anisole, guaiacol and phenol with furfuryl alcohol when the reactant ratio is 10, respectively. A semi-continuous operation was adopted for the alkylation of furfuryl alcohol to improve the conversion of aromatic oxygenates. When furfuryl alcohol is replaced by 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, the selectivity reaches almost 100%, but the reaction is a little slower and longer time is needed to get full conversion. After hydrodeoxygenation by combination of Pd/C and HZSM-5, the alkylation product was converted to branched cyclohexane with density of 0.804 g/cm3 at 20 °C, kinematic viscosity of 34.4 mm2/s at − 60 °C and freezing point lower than − 80 °C, which shows great potential as additive to promote the low-temperature properties of other fuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Batch, pressurised microwave-assisted pyrolysis of hemicellulose in the absence of any external microwave absorber was found to be a promising route for the production of bio-based chemicals and biofuels. The experiments were conducted in a 10 mL batch reactor using a fixed power of 200 W employing different initial masses of xylan (0.1–0.7 g) for a maximum time, temperature and pressure of 10 min, 250 °C and 200 psi, respectively. The gas, bio-oil and solid (char) yields varied by 16–40%, 2–21% and 40–82%, respectively. Char production is preferential using a low amount of xylan (<0.25 g), while bio-oil production is favoured using a high amount of xylan (0.25–0.7 g). The effect of the sample mass is accounted for by the different physical state of the volatiles released during pyrolysis depending on the pressure attained during the experiment. This permits the process to be easily customised for the selective production of liquid (bio-oil) or solid (bio-char). Regarding the bio-oil, it is composed of a mixture of platform chemicals such as aldehydes, alkenes, phenols, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHC), cyclic ketones and furans, with the composition varying depending on the initial mass of xylan. The char had a higher proportion of C together with a lower proportion of O than the original feedstock. Energy efficiencies of 100 and 26% were achieved for char and bio-oil production, respectively; thus leading to an increase in the HHV of the products (with respect to the original feedstock) of 52% for char and 19% for bio-oil. © 2017

AB  - Hydrogen sulfate ionic liquid as co-solvent and homogeneous catalyst can promote efficient conversion of carbohydrates into 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (5-EMF). Yields of 5-EMF were as high as 77% and 43% from inulin and sucrose, respectively, in the mixed solvent system of ethanol-[BMIM][HSO4] for 30 min reaction time at 130 °C. The ionic liquid could be perfectly recycled with a single pretreatment of activated carbon for 24 h. Based on the characterization with 1H NMR and ATR-FTIR, the mechanism for the hydrogen sulfate ionic liquid promoted conversion of inulin into 5-EMF through stabilization of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) with the C-2 hydrogen of the ionic liquid. Hydrogen sulfate ionic liquid as additive allows efficient conversion of carbohydrates into biofuels and as homogeneous catalysts, they can be easily reactivated and recycled with activated carbon treatment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In-situ catalytic pyrolysis of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) shells was investigated employing modified clinoptilolite. Likewise, conventional pyrolysis of the shells was explored to quantify the deoxygenation degree of bio-oil. Two solid catalysts obtained from natural clinoptilolite were used: one which retained most of the native cations and another one subjected to ion exchange treatment to develop Brønsted acid sites. These catalysts were characterized using different techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy with X-ray microanalysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy by pyridine adsorption, and nitrogen sorptometry. Assays in a bench scale installation based on a fixed bed reactor were conducted at 500 °C and the yields of the three kinds of pyrolysis products (bio-oil, bio-char and gases) were determined. Likewise, the composition and other physical properties of the bio-oil and gases were investigated. Both catalysts led to reduce the oxygen content of the bio-oil, improving its high heating value. On the other hand, catalytic pyrolysis promoted a slight reduction in bio-oil production at expenses of an increase in gases generation. The catalyst subjected to ion exchange performed better than the native form as less water was generated in the catalytic cracking. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sulfonated mesostructured silica-carbon nanocomposites with varying carbon content, acidic site density and porosity, obtained via the one-pot evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) synthesis, were used here to convert sugars into useful chemicals and biofuel components in alcoholic solvent. The nanocomposites show a remarkable catalytic performance in ethanol, yielding up to 80%, predominantly ethyl levulinate, 5-ethoxymethylfurfural and 2-(diethoxymethyl)-5-(ethoxymethyl)furan. Fructose is the sugar substrate of choice, but the sulfonated composites are also able to convert di- and polymeric forms of fructose. Due to a lack of a glucose-to-fructose isomerization ability, the composites are unable to form the above products from the glucose resources (glucose and cellulose), ethyl glucoside being the dominant product from these feedstocks. The composite has a peculiar hierarchical pore architecture, which is stable on shelf in ambient for at least six years. While the mesoporosity facilitates entrance and fast transport (even of soluble poly-carbohydrates like inulin and cellulose polymers), the presence of microporosity is beneficial to attain fast sugar catalysis. Since the microporosity is associated with voids in the carbon phase (preferably pyrolyzed at 400 °C), composites with high carbon contents are preferred. Due to the fast transport, reactions with fructose in ethanol run in the chemical regime in the applied thermal conditions. Kinetic inspection of the reaction further clarifies the complex network of consequent and parallel reactions, demonstrating that HMF is the main precursor of humins, while the formation of EL directly from HMF should also be considered. While this observation corroborates the protective role of alcohols like ethanol, this work also concludes based on a series of reactions in different alcohols and water, that the presence of water plays a crucial role in the HMF-to-humins formation. While alcohols are known to stabilize HMF, the unprotected HMF is fairly stable in non-aqueous reaction circumstances like in tert-butanol solvent. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In situ catalytic fast pyrolysis can be used to produce partially upgraded bio-oils. This process, however, suffers from rapid catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation, which necessitates the use of continuous catalyst regeneration. This can be achieved by using a circulating fluidized-bed reactor. In such a reactor, one key operational variable is the catalyst-to-biomass (C/B) ratio, which influences the extent of the catalytic reactions that take place. In this study, woody biomass is pyrolyzed in a pilot-scale circulating fluidized-bed reactor system using a HZSM-5 zeolite with varying C/B ratios. The C/B ratio influences the overall product distribution, the elemental distribution, and the characteristics of the liquid products. An increase of the C/B ratio enhances the conversion of pyrolysis vapors but this does not result in a continuous improvement in bio-oil quality. The C/B ratio is, nevertheless, a factor that can be used to optimize the catalytic fast pyrolysis process. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This study compared the upgrading of sugar bagasse by thermochemical and dry torrefaction methods and their corresponding combustion behavior relative to raw bagasse. The combustion reactivities were examined by non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis. Thermochemical torrefaction was carried out by chemical pre-treatment of bagasse with acid followed by heating at 160–300 °C in nitrogen environment, while dry torrefaction followed the same heating treatment without the chemical pretreatment. The results showed thermochemical torrefaction generated chars with combustion properties that are closer to various ranks of coal, thus making it more suitable for co-firing applications. Thermochemical torrefaction also induced greater densification of bagasse with a 335% rise in bulk density to 340 kg/m3, increased HHVmass and HHVvolume, greater charring and aromatization and storage stability. These features demonstrate the potential of thermochemical torrefaction in addressing the practical challenges in using biomass such as bagasse as fuel. © 2016

AB  - A variety of bio-based chemicals and biofuels have been produced from residual biomass including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid and ethyl levulinate. In this study, Bronsted-Lewis acidic ionic liquids, which made up of an eco-friendly indium trichloride and a noncorrosive ionic liquids, 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, was developed for a cleaner production of ethyl levulinate from biomass conversions. This coupling catalyst was used for the first time without the corrosive alkyl sulfonic acid functionalised group in the ionic liquids. The conversions involve a sequential depolymerisation and esterification. The depolymerisation was conducted at ionic liquids-to-biomass ratio of 5:1 (w/w), 0.15 mmol indium trichloride, 20% (w/w) water and temperature of 160 °C for 5 h, whereas, the esterification was conducted at the temperature of 90 °C for 10 h in excess ethanol. The coupling catalyst gave ethyl levulinate yields of 13.1% and 14.7%, with process efficiencies of 44.3% and 55.1%, for oil palm empty fruit bunch and oil palm mesocarp fiber conversions, respectively. The coupling catalyst also exhibited minimal losses of <17% of ethyl levulinate yields for the consecutive three runs in reutilisation tests, signifying its potential recycling ability. The experimental results confirm that the proposed non-corrosive coupling catalyst provides a uniquely suitable catalytic system for the conversion of renewable biomass feedstocks into useful products under mild operating conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biofuels are receiving considerable attention as a substitute for petro diesel. For microalgae, the cell density or biomass and lipid contents are key components for biodiesel production. This study was conducted to develop favorable culture conditions for Dunaliella salina to maximize its biomass and lipid accumulation. The effect of salinity (0.5 to 2.5 M NaCl) on the cell population, biochemical composition, and lipid output of Dunaliella salina was examined under a controlled environment for 21 days. Maximum growth (6.57 × 107 to 7.17 × 107cells mL-1) potentials were observed at 1.5 to 2 M NaCl. The photosynthetic pigments and carbohydrates also showed trends similar to growth. The maximum carotenoid level (5.16 mg L-1) was recorded at 2 M NaCl. Almost all physicochemical parameters increased with increases in salinity, biomass (1231.66 ± 1.26 mg L-1) and lipid content (248.33 mg L-1), as recorded at 2 M NaCl. Based on fluorescence intensity, the highest values (11.84 × 107cells/ml) of neutral lipids and total lipids (22.28%) were recorded at optimum salinity levels. The present study suggests that a high biomass and lipid accumulation of Dunaliella salina SA 134 could be obtained at the 2 M NaCl level. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - A three-dimensional architecture of PANI@GO hybrid was synthesized via in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) and carbonized at 1600 °C. The SEM images showed that surfaces of planar GO were covered by a compact nanofiber-like polyaniline (PANI) layer which presented an interconnected network. Nanofiber-like PANI on the GO surface was mostly preserved and became the carbon nanofibers (CNFs) after carbonization. The TEM images showed that the carbonized PANI grew seamlessly on the GO surface and served as conductive “network” between interlayers of GO. The carbonized PANI@GO hybrid was used to modify a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) based on GOx, resulting in efficient direct electron transfer (DET) and excellent bio-catalytic performance. In addition, a glucose/O2 fuel cell constructed using Nafion/GOx/PANI1600@GO/GCE as the anode and an E-TEK Pt/C modified GCE as the cathode generated a maximum power density of 0.756 mW cm−2 at 0.42 V. Findings in this study may be helpful for exploiting novel materials for immobilization of enzymes through carbonizing conducting polymers or their composites with inorganic materials at high temperature for applications in enzymatic biofuel cells or biosensors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel self-curing epoxy resin was synthesized using bio-oil. Bio-oil was produced by hydrothermal liquefaction of loblolly pine and utilized as a biopolyol in the synthesis of bio-oil-based epoxy resin (BOBER) for the first time. Hydroxyl groups in bio-oil were analyzed by quantitative 31P NMR. It was found that not only does the total hydroxyl number of bio-oil influence the yield and epoxy equivalent weight of BOBER, but also the distribution of hydroxyl groups within bio-oil (aliphatic, phenolic, and acidic OH) played an important role in the determination of the optimum amount of catalyst in the synthesis of BOBER. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis proved the self-curing phenomena of BOBER, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested that etherification reaction was the dominate reaction during the self-curing. Glass transition temperature, cross-linking density, and the storage modulus of self-cured BOBER were calculated using a dynamic mechanical analyzer.

AB  - Microalgae are promising alternative plant sources for biodiesel production because of the signiﬁcant increase in lipid yield through heterotrophic cultivation and genetic engineering approaches. This study aims to evaluate the extraction and conversion of lipids from Isochrysis galbana. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize lipid extraction and thereby obtain high yields from the four microalgae species. The optimal lipid yields for Isochrysis galbana is 8.41 wt%. Moreover, the dominant lipid composition found from Isochrysis galbana extractions was palmitic acid (C16:0) at 22.3%. The high saturated acid of Isochrysis galbana contributed to the improved biodiesel properties because biodiesel quality is influenced by the lipid composition of microalgae species. The study employed the two-step esteriﬁcation–transesteriﬁcation process to convert the microalgae oil into biodiesel, glycerol, and water. The FAME content is 99.7% under the methanol to oil molar mass of 12:1, 1 wt%, 65°C, and 800 rpm. Furthermore, the main biodiesel properties, such as viscosity, higher heating value, and iodine value, were measured according to ASTM D6751 and EN 14124. Results show that microalgae oil can potentially be used as biofuel in future applications. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Heating deteriorates the physicochemical properties of a vegetable oil for both edible and biofuel uses. The parameters for edible olive oil are established by European Union regulations and by the International Olive Council. The properties of a vegetable oil to be used as a source for biodiesel production are indicated by the German DIN 51605 for rapeseed oil. Biofuel properties are described by the European EN 14214 and the North American ASTM 6751 standards for biodiesel. It is useful to know how temperature and heating duration influence the physicochemical properties of olive oil. Free acidity, refractive index and myristic acid were not significantly influenced by temperature and heating duration. K232, K266, K270, K274, p-anisidine value, totox index, kinematic viscosity (at 30, 40, 50 °C), estimated higher heating value, relative density, and cetane number increased during olive oil heating. The biological properties: iodine value, oxidative stability index, antiradical (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, DPPH∙) activity, and phenol content, decreased when time and temperature increased. Fatty acid methyl esters were highly influenced by the applied variables. Almost all the fatty acid methyl esters, except myristic, stearic, and arachidic acid esters, were influenced by the combined effect of temperature and time in a very highly significant level. These results show how temperature and duration of heating influence extra virgin olive oil degradation for both edible use and biodiesel production. © 2017, AOCS.

AB  - Although bio-oils produced by pyrolysis and hydrothermal synthesis demonstrate potential toward building a sustainable society, large amounts of char generated as a byproduct and their thermal instability owing to high oxygen content hinder their applications. Hence, a novel approach for the production of high-grade bio-oil was proposed herein. In this approach, zerovalent Fe was used as an agent for generating hydrogen in situ in the hydrothermal liquefaction of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB), a lignocellulosic biomass source, affording bio-oil containing water-soluble (WS) and water-insoluble (WI) fractions in high yields. Hydrogen generated by the reaction between Fe and H2O efficiently converted unstable intermediates obtained from the degradation of EFB into stable compounds, resulting in reduced char formation. Hydroxyketones were detected as components characteristic of the WS fraction in the H2O/EFB/Fe system, which were stable under hydrothermal condition. WS fractions were treated with the HZSM-5 zeolite, affording light olefins (C2-C4), as well as benzene, toluene, and xylene. This conversion was more efficient with the WS fraction obtained in the presence of Fe. The liquefaction of EFB and the conversion of WS fractions into olefins via catalytic cracking were also achieved using recycled Fe. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lime mud, the industrial waste from pulp and paper mills, was used as a raw material for preparing calcium oxide (CaO)-based catalysts. Lime mud was heated at 1000 °C to transform it into active CaO and then modified by adding 5 wt% Fe or Ni (as nitrates) using the wet impregnation method and calcining to form the Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts. The fast pyrolysis of Jatropha residues to bio-oil with no catalyst and with the derived CaO, Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts was studied using an analytical pyrolysis-GC/MS at 500 °C at a biomass: catalyst ratio of 1:1 and 1:5. A Jatropha residue: catalyst ratio of 1:5 was more optimal for enhancing aliphatic hydrocarbon production and decreasing the amount of oxygenated and N-containing compounds. The presence of the CaO catalyst completely eliminated the undesirable acids and sugars in the bio-oil, significantly decreased N-containing compounds and considerably promoted the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons up to 37.3%. The Fe/CaO and Ni/CaO catalysts further increased the selectivity for aliphatic hydrocarbons, and reduced aldehyde formation compared to with CaO, with Ni/CaO being the best catalyst for hydrocarbon selectivity (47.5%). Overall, these CaO-based catalysts derived from industrial lime mud waste can be used for catalytic fast pyrolysis applications. © 2017

AB  - Yellow horn (Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge) seed oil methyl esters have emerged as the potential candidate for producing biodiesel. The present study was conducted on 15 yellow horn germplasm accessions to assess the variability in its seed morphological characteristic, oil content and fatty acid composition. Variations of seed dry biomass, seed coat weight, kernel dry biomass, seed length, seed breadth and seed thickness were significant (P < 0.01). These yellow horn accessions were mainly divided into two groups according to kernel percentage. One group mainly included XS-233 and XS-281 with heavy kernels, while the other was the rest of the yellow horn accessions with heavy seed coats. Wide variability in oil content (49.77%–68.30%) was observed among the 15 accessions. Oil content showed a negative correlation with seed coat weight (r = −0.519*). The palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), eicosenoic acid (C20:1) and erucic acid (C22:1) were the predominant fatty acids in the 15 yellow horn accessions. Meanwhile, a small amount of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) (0.33%) was detected in XS-272 accession. Iodine value, cetane number, density and kinematic viscosity of yellow horn methyl esters changed from 119.1 to 125.6, 46.0–47.6, 881.3–882.3 and 4.50–4.66, respectively. Accessions XS-202 and XS-253 were found most suitable for breeding as biodiesel genotypes. And accessions XS-203, XS-213, XS-222, XS-232, XS-271 and XS-281 may be preserved as potential biodiesel types. Such assessment can be utilized for yellow horn plantations established with promising genotypes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diesel engines are important sources of fine particle pollution in urban environments, but their contribution to the atmospheric formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is not well constrained. We investigated direct emissions of primary organic aerosol (POA) and photochemical production of SOA from a diesel engine using an oxidation flow reactor (OFR). In less than a day of simulated atmospheric aging, SOA production exceeded POA emissions by an order of magnitude or more. Efficient combustion at higher engine loads coupled to the removal of SOA precursors and particle emissions by aftertreatment systems reduced POA emission factors by an order of magnitude and SOA production factors by factors of 2-10. The only exception was that the retrofitted aftertreatment did not reduce SOA production at idle loads where exhaust temperatures were low enough to limit removal of SOA precursors in the oxidation catalyst. Use of biodiesel resulted in nearly identical POA and SOA compared to diesel. The effective SOA yield of diesel exhaust was similar to that of unburned diesel fuel. While OFRs can help study the multiday evolution, at low particle concentrations OFRs may not allow for complete gas/particle partitioning and bias the potential of precursors to form SOA.

AB  - Studies on bio-oil production by thermochemical liquefaction are usually focused on the optimization of temperature, particle size, and residence time to obtain high yields, and the effects of these process parameters on biomass liquefaction are relatively well understood. However, there is a lack of agreement in previous studies on the effect of biomass-to-solvent (BS) ratio, and contradictory results have been reported. In this study, the effect of BS ratio was examined in detail using macroalgae (Saccharina japonica) as the biomass and supercritical ethanol as the liquefaction solvent at 400 °C under N2 environment. The BS ratio was varied by changing the amount of either the biomass or the solvent, and the yields of the liquefaction products (i.e., bio-oil, gas, and solid residue) and the bio-oil quality were compared. When the BS ratio was increased from 0.10 to 0.17 by changing the amount of ethanol, the bio-oil yield decreased significantly from 79.5 to 37.8 wt%, whereas for the same increase in BS ratio effected by changing the amount of biomass, the bio-oil yield decreased less significantly from 79.5 to 60.0 wt%. This was attributed to the combined effect of BS ratio and reaction pressure on the liquefaction reaction. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The complex composition, high degree of unsaturation, and strong corrosiveness of bio-oil make direct catalytic upgrading problematic due to coking and device corrosion, and therefore, proper pretreatment is required. In this study, catalytic hydrogenation-esterification was identified as an efficient pretreatment method for bio-oil upgrading, and the hydrogenation-esterification behavior of typical compounds found in the acid-rich fraction of bio-oil over Cu/SBA-15 catalyst was investigated. It was found that furfural, hydroxyacetone, and guaiacol could be synergistically transformed with acetic acid (AcOH) during hydrogenation-esterification. Meanwhile, a higher reaction temperature promoted AcOH conversion and increased the degree of hydrogenation. On the basis of the quantification of the main products, the reaction pathways in the presence of furfural, hydroxyacetone, or guaiacol were proposed. Finally, the hydrogenation-esterification of simulated bio-oil was performed at 300 °C. The results showed that furfural, hydroxyacetone, and guaiacol were efficiently hydrogenated, and AcOH was almost completely converted into ethanol and esters, with the fraction of acid compounds drastically declining from 25.0 wt % to 0.4 wt %. Thus, a high quality pretreated bio-oil fraction, mainly consisting of alcohols and esters and ready for subsequent upgrading, was obtained in a long-term test. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study investigated microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of waste tires and bamboo sawdusts for bio-oil production with HZSM-5 as the catalyst. Effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalyst to feed ratio, bamboo sawdust to watse tire ratio on bio-oil production was investigated. Results showed that the optimal co-pyrolysis temperature was 550 °C, which provides the maximum bio-oil yield and lowest proportion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Watse tires as the hydrogen donor had a significant promotion on the production of bio-oil and aromatic hydrocarbons. The maximum yield of aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained when the optimal bamboo sawdust to waste tire ratio was 1:1. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF) is an attractive biofuel being stable, insoluble in water and an alternative to gasoline. DMF is accessible via hydrodeoxygenation of the cellulosic bio-based platform chemical 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Efficient transformations of HMF to DMF have been reported to date; however, the kinetics of the reaction and a comprehensive analysis of the reaction network have not been addressed yet. In the present work, a plausible reaction network based on kinetic study of the hydrodeoxygenation of HMF over a carbon-supported nickel catalyst is proposed. The study of the reaction network showed the reaction indeed proceeds via the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group of HMF to form 2,5-bishydroxymethylfuran (BHMF) and subsequent conversion of BHMF to 5-methylfurfurylalcohol (MFA) followed by hydrogenolysis of MFA to DMF. Side reactions include the formation of 2,5-dihydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF) and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF). A suitable kinetic model enabled estimating the kinetic parameters in the reaction temperatures range of 150–190 °C. Kinetics analysis revealed the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF as rate-determining step, while subsequent deoxygenation to DMF proceeds faster. Interestingly, most undesired reactions were kinetically hindered under selected reaction conditions allowing high selectivity to the target product DMF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conversion of Gracilaria gracilis (G. gracilis) into bio-products was carried out via pyrolysis at different temperatures to determine its potential for phenol-rich bio-oil. Co-Mo supported on zeolites (HZSM-5), mesoporous (HMS) catalysts and their composites (ZH) were investigated and compared to each other on catalytic pyrolysis processes. In non-catalytic tests, the maximum weight percentage of bio-oil was 42 wt% at 500 °C and had the maximum amount of phenol (6.28 wt%). in the catalytic tests by ZH composites; the addition of zeolite content in the structure of composites significantly decreased total concentrations of acetic acid and formic acid from 9.56 to 8.12 wt% and slightly decreased phenol and furfural concentrations from 6.65 and 6.98 to 5.88 and 5.49 wt%, respectively. Furthermore, the best selectivity for hydrogen yield (6.08 mmol/g macroalgae) and lowest amount of acetic acid (5.4 wt%) was observed for CoMo/ZH-20 catalyst, that is synthesized by 20 wt% of zeolite. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three semicontinuous continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) operating at mesophilic conditions (35°C) were used to investigate the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on anaerobic digestion of wheat straw. The results showed that the average biogas production with HRT of 20, 40, and 60 days was 46.8, 79.9, and 89.1 mL/g total solid as well as 55.2, 94.3, and 105.2 mL/g volatile solids, respectively. The methane content with HRT of 20 days, from 14.2% to 28.5%, was the lowest among the three reactors. The pH values with HRT of 40 and 60 days were in the acceptable range compared to that with HRT of 20 days. The propionate was dominant in the reactor with HRT of 20 days, inhibiting the activities of methanogens and causing the lower methane content in biogas. The degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and crystalline cellulose based on XRD was also strongly influenced by HRTs. © 2017 Xiao-Shuang Shi et al.

AB  - From an environmental point of view, diesel substitution with biodiesel shows many advantages but often involves environmental issues that must be assessed case by case. The environmental impact of Linum usitatissimum and Camelina sativa oilseed crops for biodiesel production was assessed by Life Cycle Assessment approach considering a cradle-to-gate perspective. The study included three steps: cultivation, oil seed transportation from farm to pressing plant and biodiesel production from vegetable oil by transesterification. The cultivation was carried out in Mediterranean conditions, with low inputs (minimum use of fertilisers and pesticides) and no irrigation. Seed production is responsible for more than 85–90% of the environmental impact of biodiesel; seed pressing represents less than 2% of the biodiesel environmental impact for most of the evaluated impact categories and transesterification ranges between 2% and 10%. For seed production, diesel fuel and exhaust gases emissions from the tractors' engines are the main factors responsible for the environmental impact, while pesticide and fertiliser production accounts for a small environmental load. In general, the differences between the performances of the two biodiesel fuels arise almost completely from the difference in the environmental impact of seed production and, in particular, from seed yield, which is higher for flax. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquid furanic hydrocarbons, a class of biomass-based fuels and chemicals, are typically required to achieve moderate product selectivity and yield under harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature and H2 pressure) involving multi-step processes over different catalysts. In this study, a single-step catalytic process was developed for direct conversion of various saccharides to furanic biofuels such as 2,5-dimethylfuran and 2-methylfuran with high yields (&gt;95%) at 110–130 °C. The negatively charged hydride (H−) of readily available polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) acting as green H-donor over hydrophobic Pd nanoparticles did not obstruct upstream reactions (e.g., hydrolysis, isomerization and dehydration) for the in situ formation of furanic aldehydes/alcohols from sugars, and could selectively facilitate the subsequent hydrodeoxygenation of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups other than the furanic ring in one pot, as clarified by deuterium-labeling study. Importantly, the unreduced Pd(II) nanocatalysts also exhibited comparable performance in the selective hydrodeoxygenation reaction. Moreover, the catalytic strategy was extended to various carboxides for quantitative production of corresponding furanic/aromatic hydrocarbons at room temperature that were more pronounced than previously reported results, and the optimal Pd/MIL-53(Al) coated with polydimethylsiloxane (Pd/MIL-53(Al)-P) was highly stable with little deactivation and Pd leaching for at least five consecutive cycles. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Adding catalyst could improve the yields and qualities of bio-gas and bio-oil, and realize the oriented production. Results showed that the catalytic gas-production capacities of CaO were higher than those of Fe2O3, and the bio-gas yield at 800 °C reached a maximum of 35.1%. Because the polar cracking active sites of CaO reduced the activation energy of the pyrolysis reaction and resulted in high catalytic cracking efficiencies. In addition, the quality of bio-oil produced by CaO was superior to that by Fe2O3, although the bio-oil yield of CaO was relatively weak. The light bio-fuel oriented catalytic pyrolysis could be realized when adding different catalysts. At 800 °C, CaO was 45% higher than Fe2O3 in aspect of H2 production while Fe2O3 was 103% higher than CaO in aspect of CH4 production. Therefore, CaO was more suitable for H2 production and Fe2O3 was more suitable for CH4 production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In light of the availability of low-cost methane (CH4) derived from natural gas and biogas along with increasing concerns of the greenhouse gas emissions, the production of alternative liquid biofuels directly from CH4 is a promising approach to capturing wasted energy. A novel biorefinery concept integrating biological conversion of CH4 to microbial lipids together with lipid extraction and generation of hydrocarbon fuels is demonstrated in this study for the first time. An aerobic methanotrophic bacterium, Methylomicrobium buryatense capable of using CH4 as the sole carbon source was selected on the basis of genetic tractability, cultivation robustness, and ability to accumulate phospholipids in membranes. A maximum fatty acid content of 10% of dry cell weight was obtained in batch cultures grown in a continuous gas sparging fermentation system. Although phospholipids are not typically considered as a good feedstock for upgrading to hydrocarbon fuels, we set out to demonstrate that using a combination of novel lipid extraction methodology with advanced catalyst design, we could prove the feasibility of this approach. Up to 95% of the total fatty acids from membrane-bound phospholipids were recovered by a two-stage pretreatment method followed by hexane extraction of the aqueous hydrolysate. The upgrading of extracted lipids was then demonstrated in a hydrodeoxygeation process using palladium on silica as a catalyst. Lipid conversion in excess of 99% was achieved, with a full selectivity to hydrocarbons. The final hydrocarbon mixture is dominated by 88% pentadecane (C15H32) based on decarbonylation/decarboxylation and hydrogenation of C16 fatty acids, indicating that a biological gas-to-liquid fuel (Bio-GTL) process is technically feasible. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass gasification followed by the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis is becoming a promising pathway to produce synthetic biofuels, having the potential of being coupled with combined-cycle strategies in order to coproduce electricity. In this work, the thermodynamic performance of this type of bioenergy system is evaluated through exergy analysis. A base-case process combining biomass gasification, FT synthesis and a combined cycle is defined. Furthermore, two alternative configurations modifying the base-case process are considered: (i) autothermal reforming (ATR) of a fraction of the FT tail gas to increase the fuel yield, and (ii) combustion of a fraction of the conditioned biosyngas to increase electricity production. The biomass conversion plants are simulated using Aspen Plus® to obtain the data required for the assessment. The indirect gasifier and the gas combustor are identified as the main sources of irreversibility within the three process configurations, with exergy destruction ratios of 21% and 5–7%, respectively. The gasification subsystem is found to contribute over 50% to the overall exergy destruction, showing 68% efficiency. The power generation subsystem also shows a high contribution to the overall exergy destruction (19–28%) due to high fuel consumption and the significant thermodynamic irreversibility of the cycle. Depending on the plant configuration, overall exergetic efficiencies of 24–27% are attained. The ATR case leads to a higher yield of biofuels, at the expense of lower electricity production. This configuration enhances the exergetic efficiency of the system and thus its thermodynamic performance, in contrast to the alternative configuration for increased power generation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid waste from the red ceramic industry (chamotte clay) was assessed as glycerol adsorbent for biodiesel purification by dry washing. Its structure and composition was analyzed by several techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, scanning electron microscopy and particle size. By using a simulated medium (5 w/v% glycerol in an ethanol solution), a face centered composite design was used to analyze the combined effect of chamotte concentration and temperature on glycerol removal. Chamotte levels of 2.5 w/v% at 45 °C maximized glycerol removal (1282 mg glycerol g− 1) with minimum loss of adsorbate. Kinetic data on glycerol adsorption by chamotte clay could be adjusted using the pseudo-second order model, which indicates that the rate-limiting step may be chemisorption. Moreover, chamotte clay was used for purifying ethyl biodiesel samples from palm kernel oil by chemical and biochemical catalysis. In the presence of chamotte clay, low glycerol levels (&lt; 0.02 wt%) were found in comparison with crude biodiesel (0.29 ± 0.03 wt%). Chamotte clay was also able to remove residual levels of monoacylglycerols and diacylglycerols and provided samples with properties that are similar to those attained by traditional wet washing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work investigated the degradation of two Indian hardwoods (Pithecellobium dulce and Tamarindus indica) and the activities of lignocellulolytic enzymes by Pseudolagarobasidium acaciicola AGST3 and Tricholoma giganteum AGDR1. Laccase exhibited the highest ligninolytic activity, followed by manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase in both white rot fungi. Accessory enzymes such as aryl alcohol oxidase and cellobiose dehydrogenase showed higher activities till 21 days after incubation and then declined till 30 days. Xylanase and β-glucosidase were also found to be stable in both fungi during the degradation of hardwoods. The cultures, P. acaciicola AGST3 and T. giganteum AGDR1 accumulated high amounts of oxalic acid and produced weddellite (0.2–9 μm) and whewellite (5–21 μm) crystals, respectively. Comparative decay studies revealed that both the fungi were able to degrade lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses of two hardwoods efficiently. During the pyrolysis reaction, decrease in onset temperature and activation energy was observed with the fungal treated wood as compared to the untreated wood. The basidiomycete cultures used in the study are efficient lignin degraders and can be applied as a pretreatment for second generation biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrotreatment(HDT) of algal biocrude produced via a continuous flow reactor system at reaction condition of 380 °C and 0.5 min is conducted over a range of commercially available C and mesoporous gamma Al2O3 supported, 5 wt% loaded Pt, Pd, Ru and NiMo catalysts. Upgraded Biocrude(UBC) yield of over 60 wt% was achieved with the highest yield gained via NiMo/Al2O3 catalysed reaction. The change in elemental composition resulted in the UBC attaining deoxygenation levels similar to crude oil with oxygen level in the region of 6.07–1.60 wt%, and a maximum denitrogenation of 42.7%. The low O content of the UBC increased the Higher Heating Value(HHV) in the range of 38.36–45.40 MJ/kg from a value of 36.54 MJ/kg for the biocrude feedstock. Similarly, combined with the yield, an Energy Recovery (ER) figure in the range of 0.76 and 1.03 was calculated for the Ru/Al2O3 and control HDT reactions, respectively. Simulated Distillation(SIMDIST) of the UBC showed redistribution of gas oil fraction (271–343 °C) to lower and higher boiling point fractions, confirming both cracking and polymerisation reactions, also confirmed via Size Exclusion Chromatography(SEC). Additional analysis via ATR FT-IR showed formation of aromatics and GC-MS shed light on some of the molecular species present in the UBC. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wood-derived bio-oil was investigated as a feedstock for the production of renewable hydrocarbons over commercial hydrotreating CoMoS and NiMoS catalysts. Alumina-supported CoMoS active phase showed better selectivity to diesel-like products than NiMoS phase and higher activity in removal of gaseous intermediates (COx) by hydrogenation. This reaction can play an important role in the reduction of corrosivity at the reactor outlet and determine the process economy. The disadvantage of alumina as a support material was its low stability at high temperatures in presence of water. NiMoS catalyst was found to be more active in decarboxylation and it was possible to reach a steady state production of hydrocarbons having a comparable boiling point distribution with crude oil middle distillates. A test performed with a combination of NiMoS (at the top of the catalyst bed) and CoMoS (at the bottom of the reactor) revealed the key role of the catalyst type and reaction conditions in the first zone of the reactor. The experiments with elevated feeding rates showed the undesirable presence of the not-stabilized reactants behind the first reactor zone. Reaction conditions, catalyst selection and presence of additives (methanol to modify viscosity, DMDS/H2S to stabilize active centers) were combined and optimized to tune the product composition and properties. The catalyst low-temperature activity in the first reactor zone was the limiting factor for the maximum feed rate and reactor capacity. The reaction temperature in this zone strongly affects the boiling point distribution of the product. In case of NiMo catalyst, the reaction temperature above 360 °C in the 3rd zone can reduce molecular weight of the product due to mild cracking. In contrast, temperatures above 400 °C result in fast deactivation preventing thus the establishment of the steady state operating regime. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of both indigenous (mineral components) and external (HZSM-5 zeolite) catalysts on bio-oil production by biomass fast-pyrolysis has being isolated and compared for two herbaceous and two woody biomass samples. Thereby, a variety of lignocellulosic biomasses (in both raw and de-ashed forms) have been subjected to fast-pyrolysis tests. Mineral components present in the raw biomasses were removed by an acid-washing treatment. The results obtained showed that both types of catalysts decreased the bio-oil* yield (water-free basis). However, whereas the indigenous catalysts almost did not affect the bio-oil* oxygen content, this parameter was significantly reduced when using the HZSM-5 zeolite. This finding denotes that mineral components are not really effective for bio-oil deoxygenation since they mainly promote the formation of additional char, which retains about 40% of the chemical energy contained in the raw biomass. In contrast, the external catalyst does favour oxygen removal from the bio-oil. Likewise, the deoxygenation route was strongly dependent on the type of catalyst. In the non-catalytic process dehydration was predominant, the indigenous catalysts favoured decarboxylation, whereas for the external HZSM-5 catalyst decarbonylation became the major deoxygenation pathway. Regarding the bio-oil* composition, both indigenous and external catalysts promoted the conversion of sugars and the formation of carboxylic acids, aldehydes and oxygenated aromatics. However, aromatic hydrocarbons were only produced over the external HZSM-5 catalyst, with a high proportion of alkyl-substituted benzenes and naphthalenes. © 2017

AB  - Farnesene has been identified as suitable jet fuel substitutes and metabolic engineering for microbial production of farnesene is an alternative and attractive route. In this study, due to accumulation of toxic intermediate isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), an engineered Escherichia coli strain harboring heterologous mevalonate pathway produced only 4.11 mg/L β-farnesene. Through higher-level expression of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase to minimize the accumulated IPP, another engineered strain with relatively balanced mevalonate pathway was constructed and had the highest production of β-farnesene to date (8.74 g/L) by Escherichia coli in a lab bioreactor. Furthermore, this is the first report on utilization of biodiesel by-product (simple purification) as substrate for high-production of β-farnesene by the engineered strain optimized and β-farnesene concentration reached 2.83 g/L in a lab bioreactor. Therefore, the engineered strain optimized could be used as a platform host for high-production of other terpenoids using biodiesel by-product as substrate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigates the performance of a mix of two emerging biofuels, butanol and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), in an Iveco Tector diesel engine with no aftertreatment. HVO, a possible drop-in fuel for diesel engines, features excellent combustion and emissions characteristics yet is relatively expensive, while two isomers of butanol, n-butanol and isobutanol, are less expensive oxygenated fuels with a drawback to their use in diesel engines in the form of their increased ignition delay and, on some engines, higher emissions of nitrogen oxides. Blends of 30% of either n-butanol or isobutanol into HVO had, compared to diesel fuel, resulted in a 70–80% decrease in the emissions of elemental carbon and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cPAHs) and a moderate decrease in the emissions of nitrogen oxides, without showing an adverse effect on combustion timing, heat release rates, engine maximum torque, thermal efficiency, and other measured pollutants. Particulate matter from biodiesel, HVO, their blends with diesel fuel, and the above mentioned blends was also analysed for elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrated PAHs, n-alkanes and organic tracer compounds, including hopanes, steranes, and isoprenoids. n-Alkanes were the most abundant class among the analysed particulate organic compounds in emissions of all fuels. All biofuels exhibited, relative to diesel fuel, a decrease in the concentration of particulate PAHs and n-alkanes in emissions, while the concentrations of hopanes and steranes originated from lubricating oil were comparable across all fuels. Cold starts yielded about 15% higher concentrations of both particulate matter and particulate organic compounds in emissions than hot starts. The vast majority of EC and OC, studied organic compounds, and mass of PM2.5was included in the size fraction PM1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolysis characteristics of non-edible Saccharina japonica (S. japonica) obtained from an offshore high-density aquaculture facility were systematically investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer and a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor. As high mineral contents in S. japonica cause ash fouling or agglomeration of char and bed material in fluidized-bed reactor, S. japonica was water-washed as pre-treatment to remove minerals and sticky materials. The pretreated S. japonica samples were mostly decomposed between 200 and 350 °C at heating rates of 5–20 °C/min. The calculated activation energy increased from 36.31 to 393.01 kJ/mol when pyrolysis conversion increased from 5 to 60%. The yields of bio-oil were 25.57–31.27 wt% under the investigated pyrolysis conditions (temperature: 350–450 °C; fluidization velocity: 2.0 × Umf − 4.5 × Umf). The highest bio-oil yield (31.27 wt%) from water-washed S. japonica was obtained at 375 °C and 4.0 × Umf, and the HHVs of the organic and aqueous phases in the bio-oil were 31.47 and 5.41 MJ/kg, respectively. The major compounds in the bio-oil were analyzed by GC-MS and the carbon number distribution of the bio-oils was determined through simulated distillation by TGA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Usually, traditional poly (ionic liquid)s are prepared to nanoparticles with high surface areas for achieving a quasi-homogeneous reaction system. In this work, a novel poly (ionic liquid) P(VB-VS)HSO4, synthesized by simply using ionic liquids immobilized on the 1-vinylimidazole-based crosslinked copolymer microsphere, was used as heterogeneous catalyst for transesterification of a novel non-edible feedstock soapberry oil to biodiesel. The structure, thermal stability and wetting property characteristics of the crosslinked copolymer microsphere particles and poly (ionic liquid) microspheres were investigated. The results indicated that ionic liquids were successfully functionalized on crosslinked copolymer microsphere, and P(VB-VS)HSO4 possessed high surface areas (100.1 m2/g), abundant meso-macropores (with diameter of ∼18.9 nm), good mechanical strength (81 N) and superior thermal stability. Benefiting from the unique structure features, these poly (ionic liquid) microspheres manifested excellent catalytic performance for transesterification of soapberry oil with methanol. A maximum fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) yield of 95.2% could be obtained under the response surface methodology (RSM) optimized conditions of 8.0 h reaction time, 29.1 methanol to oil molar ratio, and 8.7 wt% catalyst amount. Impressively, it was also efficient for the esterification of oleic acid, giving methyl oleate yield of 97.5%. Catalytic tests exhibited that P(VB-VS)HSO4 presented high catalytic activity and good reusability in comparison with traditional acid catalysts. The main physicochemical of the obtained soapberry biodiesel met the biodiesel standard ASTM D6751. Therefore, this work provides a cheap and facile route to the synthesis of size-controlled poly (ionic liquid) microspheres (the diameter of the catalyst was about 500 μm) for catalyzing the production of clean biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In modern lignocellulosic-based biorefineries, carbohydrates can be transformed into biofuels and pulp and paper, whereas lignin is burned to obtain energy. However, a part of lignin could be converted into value-added products including bio-based aromatic chemicals, as well as building blocks for materials. Then, a good knowledge of lignin is necessary to define its valorisation procedure. This study characterized different lignins from side-streams produced from olive tree pruning bioethanol production (lignins collected from steam explosion pretreatment with water or phosphoric acid as catalysts, followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process) and alkaline pulping (lignins recovered from kraft and soda-AQ black liquors). Together with the chemical composition, the structure of lignins was investigated by FTIR, 13C NMR, and 2D NMR. Bioethanol lignins had clearly distinct characteristics compared to pulping lignins; a certain number of side-chain linkages (mostly alkyl–aryl ether and resinol) accompanied with lower phenolic hydroxyls content. Bioethanol lignins also showed a significant amount of carbohydrates, mainly glucose and protein impurities. By contrast, pulping lignins revealed xylose together with a dramatical reduction of side-chains (some resinol linkages survive) and thereby higher phenol content, indicating rather severe lignin degradation during alkaline pulping processes. All lignins showed a predominance of syringyl units. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioethanol production from lignocellulose biomass offers a solution to current environmental challenges caused by fossil fuel energy resources, while satisfying the biorefinery concept. In this study, two-stage fractionation (autohydrolysis (AH) followed by glycerol organosolv delignification (GOD)) of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was studied as a function of temperature, time, glycerol content and liquid-to-solid (LSR) ratio using experimental designs. The effect of three different AH pretreatment severities on delignification extents (DE) of the solid fractions were also evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the changes in the surface of SCB pretreated by AH. Energy balances of four fractionation conditions were estimated, and the use of pure and crude glycerol in GOD was evaluated based on DE and lignin contents. A DE of ∼64% was obtained at 210.3 °C, 40 min, LSR of 6.5 (v/w) and 80% (v/v) pure glycerol for GOD of SCB pretreated by AH at 175.8 °C, 49 min and LSR of 5.3 (v/w), which resulted in an energetic profitability (EP) of 141.48 MJ/kgSCB. The use of crude glycerol at 80% (v/v) under the same process conditions optimized for pure glycerol also proved to be feasible (DE of ∼64% and EP of 142.67 MJ/kgSCB), widening the possibilities for its direct use in GOD of SCB pretreated by AH in a 2G bioethanol integrated plant. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Engineering a methanol tolerant lipase is of great importance in biodiesel production. Here, the first semi-rational method for directed enzyme evolution to enhance methanol tolerance by targeting high B-factor residues for iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) is reported. The best double mutant, TLL-S105C/D27R, retained 71% of its original activity after incubation in methanol, showing 30% greater methanol tolerance than TLL. TLL-S105C/D27R also displayed 27% higher activity over TLL. Structure modelling suggested that the increased stability of TLL-S105C/D27R was caused by the formation of a new hydrogen bond which stabilized the protein structure. E. coli (TLL-S105C/D27R)-catalyzed biotransformation of waste grease produced biodiesel in 81% yield in 8 h, showing improvement over the 67% yield for E. coli (TLL), while retaining 92% productivity after 4 cycles of biotransformation of waste grease. The engineered TLL mutant shows high potential for commercial biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two important problems for the food industry are oil oxidation and oil waste after frying. Sunflower seed oil is one of the vegetable oils most commonly used in the food industry. Two variables were applied to the low oleic sunflower seed oil in this work i.e. heating temperature (180-210-240℃ and time of heating (15-30-60-120 minutes, to study from the edible point of view the variations of its physico-chemical properties. After 120 minutes heating at 240°C the following was found: refractive index (1.476, free acidity (0.35%, K232 (2.87, K270 (3.71, antiradical activity (45.90% inhibition, total phenols (523 mg kg–1, peroxide value (17.00 meq kg–1, p-anisidine value (256.8 and Totox (271.7, all of which showed a constant deterioration. In relation to the use as a feedstock for bio-diesel production, after 120 minutes heating at 240℃ the following was found: acid value 0.70 mg KOH g–1 oil, iodine value 117.83 g I2 100 g–1 oil, oil stability index 0.67 h, kinematic viscosity (at 40℃ 77.85 mm2 s–1, higher heating value 39.86 MJ kg–1, density 933.34 kg/m3 and cetane number 67.04. The parameters studied in this work were influenced, in different ways, by the applied variables. Heating temperature between 180 and 210℃ and 120 min heating duration were found to be the most appropriate conditions for sunflower seed oil both from the deep frying point of view and from a subsequent use as feedstock for bio-diesel production. In light of the vegetable oils’ International standards for an edible use and for a bio-diesel production, findings of this work can be used to set heating temperature and heating duration to preserve as long possible the physico-chemical properties of a low oleic sunflower seed oil for both its edible use as a fat during cooking and for its re-use after frying. © 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Industrial spent coffee grounds (IND-SCG) are a potential non-edible biodiesel feedstock due to their abundant global supply and high oil content. In this study, an in-situ transesterification (in-situ TE) was developed and scaled up for IND-SCG biodiesel production. Several hurdles must be overcome, including the high acid value, and wide range in particle size of IND-SCG. Washing IND-SCG with methanol reduced its high acid value with negligible loss of oil. Size reduction (0.25–1.68 mm) and an increase of the reaction temperatures (30–60 °C) were found to improve the biodiesel yield significantly. The whole deacidified IND-SCG was processed at 50 °C; and a maximum biodiesel yield of 77% was achieved within 3 h. The process was successfully scaled up for processing 4 kg IND-SCG per batch with a yield comparable to the 30-g scale. The IND-SCG biodiesel met the ASTM biodiesel standard in terms of total glycerin, water content, kinematic viscosity and oxidative stability index (OSI), but its acid value exceeded the standard. A simple process modification using acidic water to neutralize alkaline catalyst during refining step, instead of strong acid, enabled the IND-SCG biodiesel to meet the standard for acid value. The oxidative stability index of the in-situ IND-SCG biodiesel was superior to that of the conventional process, probably due to the co-extraction of natural antioxidants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A family of silica-supported, magnetite nanoparticle catalysts was synthesised and investigated for continuous-flow acetic acid ketonisation as a model pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading reaction. The physico-chemical properties of Fe3O4/SiO2 catalysts were characterised by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and porosimetry. The acid site densities were inversely proportional to the Fe3O4 particle size, although the acid strength and Lewis character were size-invariant, and correlated with the specific activity for the vapour-phase acetic ketonisation to acetone. A constant activation energy (∼110 kJ mol−1), turnover frequency (∼13 h−1) and selectivity to acetone of 60 % were observed for ketonisation across the catalyst series, which implies that Fe3O4 is the principal active component of Red Mud waste. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Oxygenated species obtained from the selective chemo-catalytic refunctionalization of lignocellulosic materials and rationally formulated mixtures thereof can be tailored to the needs of advanced internal combustion engine concepts like low temperature compression-ignition or highly boosted spark-ignition combustion. In the present contribution, we present a framework for model-based formulation of biofuel blends with tailored properties by considering the fuel's molecular composition as the fundamental design degree of freedom. To this end, optimization-based reaction pathway screening is combined with mathematical fuel property prediction by means of structural group contribution and quantitative structure-property relationship modeling in order to formulate and solve an integrated product and pathway design problem. The model-based approach is envisioned (i) to guide fundamental experimental investigations of the combustion behavior of blended biofuels toward the most favorable mixtures and (ii) to identify promising conversion pathways for further elaboration by means of reaction engineering and conceptual process design. The latter is ultimately needed to bridge the gap from the mass- and energy-based molecular level analysis presented here to a process level analysis addressing the economics of the involved conversion and separation steps. A case study is dedicated to the identification of promising blends and respective production routes for the spark-ignition (SI) engine. The goal here is to produce a 100% bioderived fuel with tailored properties from hexoses and pentoses of lignocellulosic biomass by utilizing renewable hydrogen from carbon-free energy sources such as wind or solar to boost the energy of fuel produced for a given quantity of biomass supplied. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass produces a complex biocrude, which can be further upgraded to biofuel or chemicals, but there is a need for improved molecular understanding of product composition and reaction pathways. This study extensively characterizes semivolatile compounds in biocrudes from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae (N. gaditana, C. vulgaris), macroalgae (L. hyperborea), residue (dried distillers grains with solubles), and lignocellulosic (M. x giganteus). The biocrudes were analyzed using 2D gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry with in situ silylation. A total of 73 fatty acids were detected of which C18 and C20 compounds were most diverse, while palmitic acid was the single most abundant fatty acid. Multiple fatty acid amides were detected in biocrude from N. gaditana while being almost absent in samples from other lipid- and protein-containing feedstocks. Several alkylated indoles and quinolines were observed in biocrudes from protein-containing feedstocks. Monoglycerides, indanones, and alkylated benzenediols and chromen-2-ones, which are typically not reported, were also detected. These results provide new knowledge of a biocrude fraction, which is difficult to characterize. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of this research was to optimize the energy recovery in the form of biodiesel and biogas from ubiquitous Spirulina platensis microalgae. Investigations were undertaken to select appropriate cell disruption technique, organic solvent for lipid recovery and catalyst for transesterification reaction for biodiesel production from Spirulina platensis. Based on energy considerations, osmotic shock was the most suitable cell disruption technique which recorded highest lipid recovery yield of 8.9% when chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v) was used as solvent. The extracted lipid from Spirulina platensis was esterified into Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (biodiesel) using sulfuric acid as the catalyst with conversion up to 79.5%. Under these conditions, biodiesel yield of 7.1% (based on biomass weight) was obtained. Investigations also brought out that the lipid-extracted residue can be used as feedstock for biogas production with the average methane yield of about 290 ml/gVS. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this present work, the disposal of waste frying oil was explored. The experiment tests were performed under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere at 5 °C/min heating rate from the ambient temperature to 500 °C. In these operating conditions, the obtained pyrolitic liquid fraction was 76 wt% formed by 63.87 wt% of crude bio-oil and 12.13 wt% of aqueous fraction. The chemical characterization using FTIR, GC, and GC/MS has revealed that the bio-oil is a complex chemical mixture of linear saturated, unsaturated, and cyclic hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds such as carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols. Moreover, the produced bio-oil can be considered as promising fuel with high calorific value (∼39 MJ/kg). However, the higher acidity (∼125 mg KOH/g sample) and viscosity (9.53 cSt at 40 °C) limit currently its direct use in engines. Therefore, although several promising results, further investigations are requested to improve the bio-oil quality in order to find an environmentally friendly issue to waste frying oil. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this study, the production of nanostructured biochar from lignocellulosic biomass, sugarcane bagasse, is demonstrated via microwave assisted pyrolysis by using iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) particles as susceptors. The experiments were performed in a bench scale pyrolysis reactor at 600 W microwave power up to a temperature of 500 °C. The effect of bagasse:susceptor composition on the quality of biochar was evaluated using a range of characterization techniques like scanning electron microscopy, porosimetry, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The addition of Fe as the susceptor resulted in the formation of nanoparticles and nanotubes of average diameter in the range of 30–120 nm and 20–50 nm, respectively. The addition of more Fe particles resulted in an increase in size of nanoparticles and nanotubes due to enhanced rate of localized heating, which led to fusion of small particles and tubes. The biochar obtained by the addition of Fe susceptor was rich in carbon content compared to that obtained without the addition of susceptor. The addition of a mixture of Fe and Co as susceptor led to the formation of small graphitic flakes and fine nanotubes. Besides biochar, bio-oil and non-condensable gases were also characterized for their composition. The major organic functionalities in bio-oil included furan derivatives, simple phenols, guaiacol, syringol and their derivatives. Maximum energy recovery of 49% was observed in bio-oil when 20 wt.% Fe and 33.3 wt.% of Fe + Co were used as susceptors. The addition of Fe resulted in high yield of H2 and CH4 gases, besides CO2 and CO. Thus, microwave pyrolysis is shown to be a promising technique to tailor the morphological features of biochar by using metallic susceptors, and simultaneously produce good quality bio-oil and gases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) offers a concise and effective process to achieve an upgraded bio-oil production. In this paper, co-CFP experiments of waste cooking oil (WCO) and tea residual (TR) with HZSM-5 zeolites were carried out. The influences of pyrolysis reaction temperature and H/C ratio on pyrolytic products distribution and selectivities of aromatics were performed. Furthermore, the prevailing synergetic effect of target products during co-CFP process was investigated. Experimental results indicated that H/C ratio played a pivotal role in carbon yields of aromatics and olefins, and with H/C ratio increasing, the synergetic coefficient tended to increase, thus led to a dramatic growth of aromatics and olefins yields. Besides, the pyrolysis temperature made a significant contribution to carbon yields, and the yields of aromatics and olefins increased at first and then decreased at the researched temperature region. Note that 600 °C was an optimum temperature as the maximum yields of aromatics and olefins could be achieved. Concerning the transportation fuel dependence and security on fossil fuels, co-CFP of WCO and TR provides a novel way to improve the quality and quantity of pyrolysis bio-oil, and thus contributes bioenergy accepted as a cost-competitive and promising alternative energy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The best conditions for the kinetic study of the ketalization reaction of glycerol with acetone for the production of solketal using zeolite H-BEA (SAR 19) as a catalyst were found through a fractional experimental design. To simplify the heterogeneous kinetics, by means of a smaller number of kinetic parameters to encompass all the kinetic terms toward the products and reagents, a reversible kinetic model was used. From the comparison between the experimental and calculated conversions, it was possible to analyze the accuracy of the estimations, providing a good way to apply statistical treatments to improve the calculated kinetic properties. Thereby, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium constants for a range of reactions performed across different temperatures (40-80 °C) as well as the forward reaction activation energy (44.77 kJ mol-1) and the reverse reaction activation energy (41.40 kJ mol-1). Moreover, 70-76% glycerol conversion was obtained using the same catalyst for five reactions, without wash or performing any other pretreatments in the catalyst between reactions. The solketal product has been studied as a green industrial solvent additive in gasoline and biofuels. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We report the functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) electrodes by a bifunctional nitroaromatic molecule accomplished via π-π interactions of a pyrene derivative. DTNB (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) has the particularity to possess both electroactivable nitro groups and negatively charged carboxylic groups. The integration of the DTNB-modified MWCNTs was evaluated for different bioelectrocatalytic systems. The immobilized DTNB-based electrodes showed electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) with low overpotential of −0.09 V vs Ag/AgCl at neutral pH. Glucose dehydrogenase was successfully immobilized at the surface of DTNB-based electrodes and, in the presence of NAD+, the resulting bioelectrode achieved efficient glucose oxidation with high current densities of 2.03 mA cm−2. On the other hand, the aromatic structure and the negatively charged nature of the DTNB provoked orientation of both laccase and bilirubin oxidase onto the electrode, which enhanced their ability to undergo a direct electron transfer for oxygen reduction. Due to the proper orientation, low overpotentials were obtained (ca. 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl) and high electrocatalytic currents of about 3.5 mA cm−2 were recorded at neutral pH in O2 saturated conditions for bilirubin oxidase electrodes. The combination of these bioanodes and bilirubin oxidase biocathodes provided glucose/O2 enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFC) exhibiting an open-circuit potential of 0.640 V, with an associated maximum current density of 2.10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the fuel cell delivered a maximum power density of 0.50 mW cm−2 at 0.36 V. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The abundant carbohydrate fructose is converted into two biofuel molecules, namely 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and ethyl levulinate (EL) in a simple cascade flow reactor. With an overall yield of 85% (38.5% of 2,5-dimethylfuran and 47% of ethyl levulinate), the main remainder is unconverted fructose. The two column flow reactor set-up enables the adjustment of temperatures and reaction times in such a way that the reactive intermediate hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is generated in optimal yields and converted into the stable DMF immediately. The process is so simple and fast (<20 min) that economic and sustainable production of these fuels and platform chemicals can be envisioned. A remaining minor char formation is regarded to be the major problem which has to be addressed by catalyst development. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Multi-cyclic hydrocarbons from biomass are sustainable alternative for jet fuel. Here we report an unexpected hydrogenated intramolecular cyclization of diphenylmethane derivatives synthesized by alkylation of bio-derived compounds. With the presence of commonly used zeolite-Pd/C dual catalyst, conventional hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) occurs to produce dicyclohexylmethane. However, when only hydrogenation catalysts like Pd/C or Ni is used, novel intramolecular cyclization takes place to produce perhydrofluorene with the selectivity as high as 96.0%. The two pathways were illustrated by step-by-step controlled reactions in detail and a mechanism was proposed to explain the reason for perhydrofluorene formation. Moreover, this intramolecular cyclization is versatile for diphenylmethane with –OCH3 or –OH group at any position. The synthesized perhydrofluorene shows density of 0.96 g/mL, much higher than any biofuels reported and even higher than the widely used high-density fuel JP-10 derived from petroleum. It is believed that this biofuel can be excellent additive to improve the density of other jet fuels. © 2017

AB  - Three new advanced biofuels have been produced from sesquiterpene feedstocks. Cedarwood oil, which is primarily composed of the sesquiterpenes thujopsene, α-cedrene, and β-cedrene, was hydrogenated to generate a fuel blend (HCWO) with a cetane number of 31 and a volumetric net heat of combustion (NHOC) more than 12% higher than conventional jet fuel. Hydrogenation under pressures ranging from 400 to 440 psi allowed for reduction of the double bond in thujopsene while keeping the cyclopropane ring intact. A single component high density fuel containing only hydrogenated α-cedrene (cedrane) was then prepared by dehydration and hydrogenation of α-cedrol, and found to have an even higher NHOC and lower viscosity than HCWO. Cedrane was then isomerized to 1-ethyl-3,5,7-trimethyladamantane (ETMA) and a mixture of other alkyl adamantanes. The adamantane mixture had a cetane number of 46 and a viscosity suitable for use in a conventional diesel engine. This work shows that sustainable multicyclic sesquiterpenes are versatile feedstocks to ultra-performance fuels that combine high densities with high cetane numbers. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - The activity of a series of impregnated Ni-Cu/Al2O3 catalysts was evaluated for the production of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) from γ-valerolactone using 2-butanol as solvent. These catalysts evidenced that their activities depend more on the metal phase nature then on the metal sites dispersion, achieving three times higher Normalized MTHF Productivity (NMP) the samples with the highest amounts of the Ni-Cu alloy. In addition, the activity of those high Ni-Cu alloy containing samples showed to be limited by their low surface acidity. The promotion of the alloy formation, acidity and metal-acid sites proximity was achieved by a co-precipitation method. This new catalyst, calcined and reduced at 450 °C, allows a MTHF yield of 64% after 5 h. The tested catalysts showed deactivation by carbon deposition which could be overcome by intermediate regeneration between runs. The best catalyst showed stable &gt; 54% MTHF yield for three consecutive runs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Co-liquefaction of spent coffee grounds (SCG) with paper filter (PF), corn stalk (CS) and white pine bark (WPB) respectively, was examined in subcritical water for bio-crude oil production. The optimum reaction temperature was 250 °C, and the mixing biomass ratio was 1:1. SCG and CS was identified to be the best feedstock combination with a significant positive synergetic effect in the co-liquefaction process with 5% NaOH as a catalyst. The yield of bio-crude oil was increased by 20.9% compared to the mass averaged yield from two feedstocks, and the oil quality was also improved in terms of viscosity and relative molecular mass. A negative effect presented in the co-liquefaction of SCG/WPB. The resulting bio-crude oils were characterized by elemental analyzer, GC–MS, GPC and viscometer, indicating that mixing feedstock in the co-liquefaction process also influenced the higher heating value (HHV), viscosity, molecular mass and chemical composition of bio-crude oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, Euglena sp. microalgae with low lipid and high ash contents were successfully converted into bio-oil with/without catalysts through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) at 280 °C and a reaction time of 30 min. The introduction of acidic microporous zeolite catalysts (HZSM-22, HZSM-5, H beta, MCM-22, and SAPO-11) with high hydrothermal stability further improved the bio-oil quality in situ. Various methods, including elemental analysis, high heat value (HHV), and gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS), were used to analyze the physicochemical properties of the obtained bio-oil. Results indicated that catalyst addition could enhance C and H contents, reduce O and N contents, and also improve HHV (the maximum value of 37.08 MJ kg−1 was obtained for the H beta catalyst). GC-MS revealed that the bio-oil obtained by direct HTL contained relatively high amounts of N-containing compounds (30.87%) and acid compounds (16.44%). Meanwhile, the catalysts introduced in situ not only lowered the contents of nitrogen and acids to some extent, but also simultaneously increased the hydrocarbon content. This result was most pronounced over the H beta catalyst, which reduced the nitrogen content to 16.68% and decreased the acid content to 9.50%. The hydrocarbon content increased to 43.43%. Ultimately, a reasonable reaction network for Euglena sp. HTL was proposed and provides a basis for the process's further industrialization. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biofuels have been identified as a mid-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions abatement solution for decarbonising the transport sector. This study examines the techno-economic analysis of biofuel production via biomass fast pyrolysis and subsequent bio-oil upgrading via zeolite cracking. The aim of this study is to compare the techno-economic feasibility of two conceptual catalyst regeneration configurations for the zeolite cracking process: (i) a two-stage regenerator operating sequentially in partial and complete combustion modes (P-2RG) and (ii) a single stage regenerator operating in complete combustion mode coupled with a catalyst cooler (P-1RGC). The designs were implemented in Aspen Plus®based on a hypothetical 72 t/day pine wood fast pyrolysis and zeolite cracking plant and compared in terms of energy efficiency and profitability. The energy efficiencies of P-2RG and P-1RGC were estimated at 54% and 52%, respectively with corresponding minimum fuel selling prices (MFSPs) of 7.48/GGE and 7.20/GGE. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the MFSPs of both designs are mainly sensitive to variations in fuel yield, operating cost and income tax. Furthermore, uncertainty analysis indicated that the likely range of the MFSPs of P-1RGC (5.81/GGE − 11.63/GGE) at 95% probability was more economically favourable compared with P-2RG, along with a penalty of 2% reduction in energy efficiency. The results provide evidence to support the economic viability of biofuel production via zeolite cracking of pyrolysis-derived bio-oil. © 2017

AB  - This paper evaluates the financial viability of renewable jet fuel production, from two oilseed crops Camelina sativa (camelina) and Brassica carinata (carinata) and used cooking oil (UCO), by the hydrodeoxygenation pathway. A Monte Carlo analysis is performed to examine the robustness of the financial performance by taking into consideration key uncertain parameters, including capital cost, oil content of seeds, and prices of feedstocks, gas, electricity, water, meal co-product, and crude oil (indicator of fuel product prices). The Monte Carlo analysis revealed that under the conditions analyzed, the probabilities that the net present value would be positive are 29% for camelina, 18% for carinata and 8% for UCO, indicating that the three projects are risky for investors. Sensitivity analysis determined that the projects’ financial performance is highly sensitive to prices of fuel products and feedstocks. The impacts of two different hypothetical biofuel economic incentives were assessed: Carbon trading and tradable credits similar to the Renewable Identification Number (RIN). Income earned in the form of a RIN would have a large positive impact on the projects’ viabilities. By assuming an incentive of $0.20/L of renewable fuel, the probabilities that the NPV would be positive are 85% for camelina, 75% for carinata and 58% for UCO. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of the present work was to study the applicability of rotating packed bed (RPB) for biodiesel through the biocatalytic method. In this research, the RPB facilitated a more homogeneous mixture of substrates due to its higher mass transfer efficiency and better micromixing environment. This was superior to the traditional continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system. Candida sp. 99-125 lipase was used without any organic solvent or additive, and demonstrated a significant catalyst efficiency. The key factors, such as the high gravity factor (β), pattern of the catalyst and methanol-FFA molar ratio etc. were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the hydrolysis yield of fatty acids was 97.0% after 24 h and the esterification yield of biodiesel was 96.0% 6 h later. The esterifying yield didn't have an obvious decline in the fifth batch. Consequently, the RPB is an attractive and effective reactor for enzymatic synthesis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Innovative catalysts to convert biomass carbohydrates in high value products are of an immense interest for the chemical industry and biorefineries. In this study, modified tin oxide (SnO2) catalysts were synthesised and submitted to H2SO4 treatment (SO4−2/SnO2) and alumina doping (SO4−2/Al2O3-SnO2) using different calcination temperatures. The effect of these modifications on the catalyst performance were investigated by examining the catalysts properties and activity for the conversion of glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. The incorporation of alumina in the sulphated tin oxide catalyst and the use of low calcination temperatures increased the specific surface area and the acidity of the catalyst. This enhanced the chemo-selectivity of the conversion of glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. This catalyst was recovered after reaction by solvent washing and re-calcination; however, the recovery procedures were insufficient to avoid a decay of the catalyst performance during subsequent runs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) refers to a heterogeneous mixture composed of plastics, paper, metal, food and other miscellaneous items. Local authorities commonly dispose of this waste by either landfill or incineration which are both unsustainable practices. Disposing of organic wastes via these routes is also becoming increasingly expensive due to rising landfill taxes and transport costs. The Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR®) process, is a proposed valorisation route to transform organic wastes and residues, such as MSW, into sustainable energy vectors including (H2 rich synthesis gas, liquid bio-oil and solid char). The aim herein, was to investigate the conversion of the organic fraction of MSW into fuels and chemicals utilising the TCR technology in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot scale reactor. Findings show that MSW was successfully processed with the TCR after carrying out a feedstock pre-treatment step. Approximately, 25 wt.% of the feedstock was converted into phase separated liquids, composed of 19 wt.% aqueous phase and 6 wt.% organic phase bio-oil. The analysis of the bio-oil fraction revealed physical and chemical fuel properties, higher heating value (HHV) of 38 MJ/kg, oxygen content &lt;7 wt.% and water content &lt;4 wt.%. Due to the bio-oil's chemical and physical properties, the bio-oil was found to be directly miscible with fossil diesel when blended at a volume ratio of 50:50. The mass balance closure was 44 wt.% synthesis gas, with a H2 content of 36 vol% and HHV of 17.23 MJ/Nm3, and 31 wt.% char with a HHV of 17 MJ/kg. The production of high quantities of H2 gas and highly de-oxygenated organic liquids makes downstream hydrogen separation and subsequent hydro-deoxygenation of the produced bio-oil a promising upgrading step to achieve drop-in transportation fuels from MSW. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermal conversion technologies may be the most efficient means of production of transportation fuels from lignocellulosic biomass. In order to increase the viability and improve the carbon emissions profile of pyrolysis biofuels, improvements must be made to the required catalytic upgrading to increase both hydrogen utilization efficiency and final liquid carbon yields. However, no current single catalytic valorization strategy can be optimized to convert the complex mixture of compounds produced upon fast pyrolysis of biomass. Staged thermal fractionation, which entails a series of sequentially increasing temperature steps to decompose biomass, has been proposed as a simple means to create vapor product streams of enhanced purity as compared to fast pyrolysis. In this work, we use analytical pyrolysis to investigate the effects of time and temperature on a thermal step designed to segregate the lignin and cellulose pyrolysis products of a biomass which has been pre-torrefied to remove hemicellulose. At process conditions of 380 °C and 180 s isothermal hold time, a stream containing less than 20% phenolics (carbon basis) was produced, and upon subsequent fast pyrolysis of the residual solid a stream of 81.5% levoglucosan (carbon basis) was produced. The thermal segregation comes at the expense of vapor product carbon yield, but the improvement in catalytic performance may offset these losses. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This study investigates the costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a commercial-scale, 2000 dry MT/day, red oak biorefinery designed to stabilize and upgrade pyrolysis oil into drop-in fuels. Stabilization improves the compatibility of bio-oil with crude refinery intermediate streams and equipment, but the costs of this process are not known. A discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) analysis is conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility of the bio-oil stabilization biorefinery based on a 30-year plant life and 10% internal rate of return. Four economic scenarios representing different biorefinery configurations and byproducts are analyzed. The installed equipment cost for the standalone hydrocarbons (SH) is estimated as $277 million, and the minimum fuel-selling price (MFSP) for the SH scenario is evaluated as $2.85 per gallon. With mixed alcohols as a byproduct, the MFSP can be lowered to $2.77 per gallon or to $2.33 per gallon by colocating with a refinery. Sensitivity analysis of the system indicates that feedstock cost has the most significant impact on the MFSP followed by fixed capital cost, catalyst life, and product yield. Life-cycle analysis indicates that the GHG emission reduction potential of a bio-oil stabilization biorefinery is up to 66% compared to petroleumderived gasoline. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), millions of Muslims come to perform Pilgrimage every year. Around one million ton of municipal solid waste (MSW) is generated in Makkah city annually. The collected MSW is disposed of in the landfills without any treatment or energy recovery. As a result, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contamination of the soil and water bodies along with leachate and odors are occurring in waste disposal vicinities. The composition of MSW shows that food waste is the largest waste stream (up to 51%) of the total generated MSW. About 13% of the food waste consists of fat content that is equivalent to about 64 thousand tons per year. This study aims to estimate the production potential of biodiesel first time in Makkah city from fat/oil fractions of MSW and highlight its economic and environmental benefits. It has been estimated that 62.53, 117.15 and 6.38 thousand tons of biodiesel, meat and bone meal (MBM) and glycerol respectively could be produced in 2014. A total electricity potential of 852 Gigawatt hour (GWh) from all three sources based on their energy contents, Higher Heating Value (HHV) of 40.17, 18.33 and 19 MJ/kg, was estimated for 2014 that will increase up to 1777 GWh in 2050. The cumulative net savings from landfill waste diversion (256 to 533 million Saudi Riyal (SAR)), carbon credits (46 to 96 million SAR), fuel savings (146 to 303 million SAR) and electricity generation (273 to 569 million SAR) have a potential to add a total net revenue of 611 to 1274 million SAR every year to the Saudi economy, from 2014 to 2050 respectively. However, further studies including real-time data about annual slaughtering activities and the amount of waste generation and its management are critical to decide optimum waste management practices based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodologies. © 2017 Shahzad et al.

AB  - Although hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is proven a promising process for upgrading pyrolysis bio-oil to hydrocarbon biofuel, catalyst efficiency remains a challenge. Integrating heterogeneous catalysts with supercritical liquid in a bio-oil HDO process was investigated in this study. Bifunctional Fe-Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts were firstly used to upgrade bio-oil to hydrocarbon biofuel in supercritical methanol. The loading of Fe and Ni did not change HZSM-5 crystalline structure, but BET surface area and total pore volume of Fe-Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts decreased significantly compared to HZSM-5 support. Physicochemical properties of biofuel produced by Fe and/or Ni loaded HZSM-5 catalysts such as water content, total acid number, viscosity and higher heating value improved in comparison with raw bio-oil. Bimetallic Fe-Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts were more effective for bio-oil HDO compared to monometallic Fe/HZSM-5 or Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst and this was attributed to the synergistic effect of Fe and Ni on HZSM-5 support. Fe-Ni(2)/HZSM-5 catalyst produced biofuel with the highest hydrocarbon content at 28.60%. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the effectiveness of the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of crambe seed oil was evaluated with the aim of biodiesel synthesis by in situ interesterification. An experimental design was applied, using a mixture of n-hexane and methyl acetate as the solvent, to evaluate the effect of the process variables and determine the conditions that maximize the removal of oil from the seeds. The results indicated that the extraction time and temperature have a greater influence on the oil extraction than the solvent:seed ratio (p &lt; 0.05). The extraction carried out at 60 °C using a solvent to seed ratio of 10 (mL g−1) for 90 min provided the maximum oil yield (∼37%), representing ∼92% of the yield obtained by the conventional method and a 20% increase compared with the yield obtained without ultrasound. The fatty acids compositions of oils obtained by UAE and conventional extraction were similar (p &gt; 0.05), showing a predominance of erucic, oleic and linoleic acids, which accounted for ∼86.5% of the oil composition. The water and free fatty acids contents indicate that the oils obtained cannot be processed by the conventional method using alkaline homogeneous catalysis for the production of biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Furfural is a potential platform chemical derived from biomass, which has gained increased attention as a potential substitute for the displacement of petrochemicals and the production of biofuels. The catalytic effect of different metal tri-chlorides (FeCl3, AlCl3 and CrCl3) with formic acid (FA) was investigated for the selective conversion of D-xylose to furfural in aqueous solutions. Reactions were carried out at various temperatures (100–170 °C), FA concentrations (0–65 wt%), and metal chloride concentrations (0.2–0.8 M). Lyxose was identified as primary intermediate of the conversion of xylose at low temperatures and FA concentrations. A mixture containing 0.4 M AlCl3 and 55 wt% FA was the most selective and active system for the production of furfural at low temperatures (130 °C, selectivity ≈70–90%). A simplified kinetic model was developed to describe the overall xylose conversion and furfural formation under the selected conditions, offering a valuable tool for process optimisation and design. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study focuses on investigating the optimized chemical composition of biochar used as porous material for biodiesel synthesis via pseudo-catalytic transesterification. To this end, six biochars from different sources were prepared and biodiesel yield obtained from pseudo-catalytic transesterification of waste cooking oil using six biochars were measured. Biodiesel yield and optimal reaction temperature for pseudo-catalytic transesterification were strongly dependent on the raw material of biochar. For example, biochar generated from maize residue exhibited the best performance, which yield was reached ∼90% at 300 °C; however, the maximum biodiesel yield with pine cone biochar was 43% at 380 °C. The maximum achievable yield of biodiesel was sensitive to the lignin content of biomass source of biochar but not sensitive to the cellulose and hemicellulose content. This study provides an insight for screening the most effective biochar as pseudo-catalytic porous material, thereby helping develop more sustainable and economically viable biodiesel synthesis process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diminishing fuel resources and stringent emission mandates have demanded cleaner combustion and increased fuel efficiency. Three water addition rates, i.e., 2, 4, and 6 wt% in biodiesel-diesel blend (B5) was investigated herein. Combustion characteristics of the emulsified fuel blends were compared in a naturally-aspirated diesel engine at full load and different engine speeds. More specifically, biodiesel was produced from waste cooking oil (WCO) and to further increase waste utilization, recycled biodiesel wastewater was used as additive in B5. The result obtained showed that low-level water addition (i.e., 2 and 4 wt%) in B5 led to different results from those obtained using higher water addition rates (i.e., &gt;5 wt%) reported by the previous studies. In more details, the findings of the present study revealed that low level water addition in B5 could considerably reduce CO, HC, CO2, and NOxemissions. Among water-containing B5 fuel emulsions, the optimal water addition level in terms of engine performance parameters and emissions was found at 4 wt%. In particular, the emitted CO2, HC, and NOxwere decreased by over 8.5%, 28%, and 24%, respectively, at maximum speed of 2500 rpm. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in iron phase, crystal size, surface area, and char structure/reactivity of the char-supported iron catalysts after them being used for bio-oil reforming. The catalysts were prepared under different conditions (varying in temperatures, gasification agents and iron concentrations) and then used to reform bio-oil under a fixed experimental condition at 800 °C. The results show that the catalysts prepared from the steam gasification of Fe-loaded coal were preferred in terms of catalytic performance. The X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the iron phases in the fresh catalysts varied while the used catalysts nearly showed identical iron phase of magnetite (Fe3O4). The crystal iron particle in the catalysts would apparently increase after reforming when the initial iron phase was carbides (γ-Fe and/or α-Fe). The char structure of the catalysts was significantly affected by the ‘volatile-char interactions’ during reforming process. And the catalysts’ surface area and reactivity in air were both reduced mainly due to the coke formation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The renewable phenolic compounds produced by directional liquefaction of biomass are a mixture of complete fragments decomposed from native lignin. These compounds are unstable and difficult to use directly as biofuel. Here, we report an efficient in situ catalytic hydrogenation method that can convert phenolic compounds into saturated cyclohexanes. The process has high potential for production of hydrocarbon transportation fuels. In the in situ catalytic hydrogenation system, phenolic compounds were converted into cyclohexanol derivatives (that can be efficiently converted into cyclohexane-hydrocarbon fuels by acid-catalyzed dehydration) with a conversion yield 98.22 wt% under mild conditions (220 °C for 7 h with Raney Ni). The in situ catalytic hydrogenation of phenolic compounds, using methanol as a liquid hydrogen donor, was found to be superior to traditional hydrogenation using external hydrogen gas. The in situ hydrogenation of phenolic compounds was coupled with aqueous-phase reforming of methanol. The conversion of guaiacol and target product yields were significantly higher than by traditional hydrogenation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study we discuss hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of pinyon juniper (PJ) catalytic pyrolysis oil over Ni/SiO2[sbnd]Al2O3 catalyst in a batch reactor to improve the physicochemical properties of the oil. The influence of temperature (350–500 °C), reaction time (15–90 min), and initial hydrogen pressure (3.5–10 MPa), on hydrodeoxygenation of PJ pyrolysis oil was investigated. After hydrogenation was completed, gas, coke, and a liquid product of two immiscible phases (aqueous and organic), were obtained. Maximum HDO of bio-oil was achieved at 450° C while the initial hydrogen pressure was 7 MPa and the reaction time was 30 min. Under these conditions, the H/C and O/C atomic ratios changed from 1.29 to 0.29 respectively for bio-oil to 2.36 and 0 for HDO oil respectively. The higher heating value increased from 27.64 MJ/kg of bio-oil to 45.58 MJ/kg of upgraded oil. The water content of organic liquid product was less than 0.05 wt% while it was 1.63 wt% in the feed. The viscosity of upgraded oil was 1.26 cP compared to119 cP for the crude bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a promising technique that converts electricity and CO2 to biofuels using microbes as the catalysts. However, most of previous MES are conducted at mesophilic temperatures and challenged by low performances. Here we report a significant electrosynthesis performance enhancement via immobilization of a thermophilic microbe to cathodes. A temperature-dependent electron uptake rate of Moorella thermoautotrophica was observed at a cathode potential of − 0.4 V (vs. SHE), with a maximum current density of 63.47 mA m− 2 at 55 °C. Moreover, electrosynthesis rates of formate and acetate at 55 °C were accelerated by 23.2 and 2.8 fold than those of 25 °C, respectively. Compared with natural biofilms, immobilization of M. thermoautotrophica with carbon nanoparticles to electrodes further enhanced acetate and formate production rates (by 14 and 7.9 fold), reaching 58.2 and 63.2 mmol m− 2 day− 1 at a coulombic efficiency of 65%, respectively. To our best knowledge, these are the highest electrosynthesis rates obtained thus far for pure cultures under the conditions of − 0.4 V (vs. SHE) and 55 °C. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that embedding microbes to electrodes by carbon nanoparticles is a facile and efficient method of improving MES performance. © 2017

AB  - The correlation of feedstock with bio-oil compound distribution was explored with straw, shell, woody, and algae biomasses. The pyrolysis of 20 typical feedstock samples were performed using Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) with a final temperature of 550°C, heating rate of 10 000°C/s, and residence time of 10 s. Biomass samples share a common characteristic, such as high oxygen and low nitrogen and sulfur, which is different from coal. The results revealed that there is a strong positive correlation between ketones and cellulose, furans and holocelluose, and phenols and lignin but a negative correlation between short-chain acids and ash content and hydrocarbons and cellulose. Woody biomass produced higher phenols; straw biomass produced high ketones; shell biomass produced high furans; and algae produced high fatty acids. However, some special points showed that Enteromorpha algae produced high furans and tobacco stems produced high N-containing compounds. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Stable, site-specific immobilization of redox proteins and enzymes is of interest for the development of biosensors and biofuel cells, where the long-term stability of enzymatic electrodes as well as the possibility of controlling the orientation of the biomolecules at the electrode surface have a great importance. Ideally, it would be desirable to immobilize redox proteins and enzymes in a specific orientation, but still with some flexibility to optimize reaction kinetics. In this work, we establish such an approach by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce cysteine residues at specific locations on the protein surface and the reaction between the free thiol group and maleimide groups attached to the electrode surface to immobilize the mutated enzymes. Using cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) as a model system, carbon nanotube electrodes were first covalently modified with maleimide groups following a modular approach based on electrografting of primary amines at the carbon surface and solid-phase synthesis methodology to elaborate the surface-modified electrode. The CDH-modified electrodes were tested for direct electron transfer (DET), showing high catalytic currents as well as excellent long-term storage stability. The key advantage of this method is its great flexibility, as the main components of the modification can be independently varied to change the local environment at the electrode surface and a wide range of redox proteins or enzymes can be specifically engineered to present cysteine residues at their surface for oriented immobilization. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Triglycerides represent a type of sustainable energy source and robust catalysts for triglycerides refining to biofuels are very challenging. Herein, we report supported ruthenium catalysts, optimized from group VIII metal catalysts, for the selective conversion of triglycerides to diesel-range alkanes under mild conditions. The catalyst supports and ruthenium loadings show significant impacts on the performance of ruthenium catalysts, and Ru/TiO2 with ruthenium weight loading of 1.68% is optimized for the reaction. Typically, the platform compound stearic acid could be directly converted, or via 1-octadecanol as an intermediate product, to n-heptadecane and n-octadecane in n-heptane solvent using the optimized Ru/TiO2 catalyst at 473 K and under 3 MPa H2. On the basis of catalytic and spectroscopic characterization results, large ruthenium metal particles are established as the preferred active sites for stearic acid conversion. The complete reaction network of stearic acid deoxygenation on flat Ru (0001) is investigated by theoretical calculations. It is revealed that different pathways run simultaneously during the reaction and the adsorbed acyl species C17H35CO* are the key reaction intermediates for the catalytic deoxygenation on Ru (0001). The removal of adsorbed CO by hydrogenation is the rate-controlling step contributing to the highest energy barrier within the reaction network. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) produced from two different raw materials—palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester—was compared in terms of environmental impacts using the life cycle assessment (LCA) technique with the SimaPro 7.3 software. The energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, and environmental impacts reported in unit points (Pt.) were assessed using the Eco-indicator 95, IPCC 2007, and CML 2 Baseline 2000 methodologies, respectively. The functional unit was 1 kg of biofuel product. The system boundary defined included three main processes in the bio-hydrogenated diesel production phase—catalytic hydroprocessing, separation, and upgrading. The results indicated that the energy consumption of bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate was 1.26 times (or 9.69 × 10−3 MJ higher) that of the bio-hydrogenated diesel production from fatty acid methyl ester. On the other hand, the greenhouse gas emission from bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate was 2.29 times lower than that from fatty acid methyl ester due to the palm trees absorption of CO2 for photosynthesis being greater than the amount released into the atmosphere during the oil palm cultivation stage. The major contributor was crude palm oil as a feedstock to produce either palm oil fatty acid distillate (physical refining) or fatty acid methyl ester (transesterification), which were about 93% and 84% of the total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission, respectively. The results of environmental impacts showed that the bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate was 1.37 times (2.05 × 10−12 Pt) greater than that from fatty acid methyl ester. Consumption of palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester in both processes made the largest contribution to most environmental impacts (99% of the total impact score was from both processes). The main impacts of both bio-hydrogenated diesel production from palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester were the terrestrial ecotoxicity potential, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity potential, and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential. An essential factor which caused these impacts was the use of crude palm oil during the production of palm oil fatty acid distillate and fatty acid methyl ester. Therefore, fatty acid methyl ester was found to be a suitable raw material for bio-hydrogenated diesel production based on the economic evaluation and the lower environmental impacts during the production stage. This present work highlights the benefit of by-products as feedstock for alternative fuel production in order to increase the by-product marketing value. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focused on the development of heterogeneous catalyst for transesterification process by implanting lithium onto TiO2 by wet impregnation process. A series of Li/TiO2 was prepared with different amounts of Li (20, 30, 40 wt %) and at different calcination temperatures (450, 600, 750). The Li/TiO2 catalysts were characterized by several spectroscopic and analytical techniques like XRD, FT-IR, BET, TG-DSC and FESEM. The XRD study revealed that the insertion of Li improved the catalyst efficiency without any alteration in structure of TiO2. Li/TiO2 catalysts with 30%w/w Li and calcined at 600 °C was found to be the most efficient with 98% transesterification yield. The best performance of catalyst was achieved with methanol to oil ratio of 24:1, 5 wt % of catalyst loading, at 55 °C reaction temperatures for 3 h of reaction time. The kinetic studies revealed the transesterification process was compatible with the zero order model. However the reusability decreases after every successive use. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The next generation of alternative fuels is being investigated through advanced chemical and biological production techniques for the purpose of finding suitable replacements for diesel and gasoline while lowering production costs and increasing process yields. Chemical conversion of biomass to fuels provides a plethora of pathways with a variety of fuel molecules, both novel and traditional, which may be targeted. In the search for new fuels, an initial, intuition-driven evaluation of fuel compounds with desired properties is required. Due to the high cost and significant production time needed to synthesize these materials at a scale sufficient for exhaustive testing, a predictive model would allow chemists to preemptively screen fuel properties of potentially desirable fuel candidates. Recent work has shown that predictive models, in this case artificial neural networks (ANN's) analyzing quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR's), can predict the cetane number (CN) of a proposed fuel molecule with relatively small error. A fuel's CN is a measure of its ignition quality, typically defined using prescribed ASTM standards and a cetane testing engine. Alternatively, the analogous derived cetane number (DCN), obtained using an Ignition Quality Tester (IQT), is a direct measurement alternative to the CN that uses an empirical inverse relationship to the ignition delay found in the constant volume combustion chamber apparatus. DCN data points acquired using an IQT were utilized for model validation and expansion of the experimental database used in this study. The present work improves on an existing model by optimizing the model architecture along with the key learning variables of the ANN and by making the model more generalizable to a wider variety of fuel candidate types, specifically the class of furans and furan derivatives, by including specific molecules for the model to incorporate. The new molecules considered include tetrahydrofuran, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 5,5′-(furan-2-ylmethylene)bis(2-methylfuran), 5,5′-((tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methylene)bis(2-methyltetrahydrofuran), tris(5-methylfuran-2-yl)methane, and tris(5-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methane. Model architecture adjustments improved the overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the base database predictions by 5.54%. Additionally, through the targeted database expansion, it is shown that the predicted cetane number of the furan-based molecules improves on average by 49.21% (3.74 CN units) and significantly for a few of the individual molecules. This indicates that a selected subset of representative molecules can be used to extend the model's predictive accuracy to new molecular classes. The approach, bolstered by the improvements presented in this paper, enables chemists to focus on promising molecules by eliminating less favorable candidates in relation to their ignition quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Raw material for biodiesel has been expanded from edible oil to non-edible oil. In this study, biodiesel continuous production for two kinds of microalgae Chrysophyta and Chlorella sp. was conducted. Coupling with the supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, the oil of microalgae was extracted firstly, and then sent to the downstream production of biodiesel. The residue after decompression can be reused as the material for pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. Results showed that the particle size of microalgae, temperature, pressure, molar ration of methanol to oil, flow of CO2 and n-hexane all have effects on the yield of biodiesel. With the optimal operation conditions: 40 mesh algae, extraction temperature 60 °C, flow of n-hexane 0.4 ml/min, reaction temperature: 340 °C, pressure: 18–20 MPa, CO2 flow of 0.5 L/min, molar ration of methanol to oil 84:1, a yield of 56.31% was obtained for Chrysophyta, and 63.78% for Chlorella sp. due to the higher lipid content. © 2017

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) is a biomass-derived intermediate for the sustainable production of monomers and biofuels. However, most of its syntheses are performed under not environmentally and/or economically green conditions. In this work, the dehydration of fructose/inulin to HMF was optimized, employing aqueous medium, high substrate concentrations (10 and 20 wt%), low loading of commercial acid resin (Amberlyst-70) and microwave heating. The influence of substrate/catalyst ratio, time and temperature on the products yields was investigated. Amberlyst-70 resulted a very active and recyclable system: HMF yields up to 46 mol% were ascertained, the best result up to now reached under these reaction conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A high-power mediated electron transfer type formate (HCOO-)/dioxygen (O2) biofuel cell is reported herein. The cell utilizes a Ketjen Black modified waterproof carbon cloth as the electrode material. The bioanode comprises tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase and a viologen-functionalized polymer, whereas the biocathode comprises bilirubin oxidase and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate). In addition, a gas diffusion type system was employed for the biocathode to realize a high-speed O2 supply. These electrodes exhibited a large current density of 20 mA cm-2 in the quiescent steady state for both HCOO- oxidation and O2 reduction. Finally, these electrodes were coupled to construct an HCOO-/O2 biofuel cell without a separator. The cell exhibited a maximum power density of 12 mW cm-2 at a cell voltage of 0.78 V under quiescent conditions and an open-circuit voltage of 1.2 V. We show the great potential of HCOO- for the fuel of biofuel cells. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The electrocatalytic oxidation technology of biomass-derived oxygenates such as glycerol presents a promising method of coproducing renewable chemicals and hydrogen in an electrochemical reactor system that uses oxidation chemistry and existing proton exchange membrane technology to electrocatalytically convert oxygenates into value-added chemicals and hydrogen. In this paper, we first demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation technology with our experimental investigations. Simple and direct conversion of glycerol into glyceraldehyde (GAD), glyceric acid (GLA), and hydroxypyruvic acid (HPA) by anodic oxidation in an electrocatalytic batch reactor over Pt/C catalysts was performed with only water as a stoichiometric chemical oxidant. We also conducted conventional catalytic (non-electrocatalytic) glycerol oxidation using a catalytic batch reactor with pressurized oxygen as the oxidant to compare conventional catalytic performances to that of the electrocatalytic reactor. The electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation process had a yield for GAD, GLA, and HPA production that was ∼1.7 times higher than that of the non-electrocatalytic process. The turnover frequency of the electrocatalytic process is comparable to and even higher than that of a non-electrocatalytic system. On the basis of the experimental results, we develop process simulation models for both the electrocatalytic and non-electrocatalytic processes and then analyze the energy efficiency and economics of the process models. The minimum selling price (MSP) of GLA for the electrocatalytic process was $2.30/kg of GLA compared to $4.91/kg of GLA for the non-electrocatalytic process. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An international round robin study of the production of fast pyrolysis bio-oil was undertaken. A total of 15 institutions in six countries contributed. Three biomass samples were distributed to the laboratories for processing in fast pyrolysis reactors. Samples of the bio-oil produced were transported to a central analytical laboratory for analysis. The round robin was focused on validating the pyrolysis community understanding of production of fast pyrolysis bio-oil by providing a common feedstock for bio-oil preparation. The round robin included: distribution of three feedstock samples, hybrid poplar, wheat straw, and a blend of lignocellulosic biomasses, from a common source to each participating laboratory, preparation of fast pyrolysis bio-oil in each laboratory with the three feedstocks provided, and return of the three bio-oil products (minimum of 500 mL) with operational description to a central analytical laboratory for bio-oil property determination. The analyses of interest were CHN, S, trace element analysis, water, ash, solids, pyrolytic lignin, density, viscosity, carboxylic acid number, and accelerated aging of bio-oil. In addition, an effort was made to compare the bio-oil components to the products of analytical pyrolysis through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. The results showed that clear differences can occur in fast pyrolysis bio-oil properties by applying different process configurations and reactor designs in small scale. The comparison to the analytical pyrolysis method suggested that pyrolysis (Py)-GC/MS could serve as a rapid qualitative screening method for bio-oil composition when produced in small-scale fluid-bed reactors. Gel permeation chromatography was also applied to determine molecular weight information. Furthermore, hot vapor filtration generally resulted in the most favorable bio-oil product, with respect to water, solids, viscosity, and carboxylic acid number. These results can be helpful in understanding the variation in bio-oil production methods and their effects on bio-oil product composition. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Catalyst deactivation is the main reason for low petrochemical yield in catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of biomass. ZSM-5 catalysts modified by chemical liquid deposition (CLD) and acid dealumination (AD) were prepared to improve petrochemical yields for CFP of pinewood. The results showed that CLD by SiO2 led to the coverage of strong acid sites, while AD favored the removal of superficial acid sites. CFP of pinewood showed that the relative area ratio of BTX was boosted by 37.2% and 30.4% over modified ZSM-5 catalysts by CLD and AD, respectively. The yield of indenes and naphthalenes which were important precursors of heavy coke decreased sharply. Considering environmental cost and catalytic performance, CLD seems to be a preferable modification method over ZSM-5 in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass for petrochemicals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to produce esters with potential application as biodiesel via esterification with short-chain alcohols of free fatty acids (FFA) obtained from soybean and palm oils refining. Esterification reactions were catalyzed by dry lipase immobilized in fermented solids (DFS), obtained by Rhizomucor miehei grown on babassu cake by solid-state fermentation (SSF). A final conversion above 80% was attained using palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and soybean fatty acid distillate (SFAD) as raw materials in esterification reactions with ethanol. The biocatalyst could be reused 5 times in repeated 6 h reactions after its washing with 95% (v/v) ethanol or hexane (using SFAD as raw material). Moreover, the properties of the obtained fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE)-enriched products were characterized. Both products were in accordance with several limits established by biodiesel-related standardized tests from Brazilian specifications including ester content (97.3% for the product obtained from SFAD), water content (180 mg Kg−1 for the product obtained from PFAD), density (867.6 kg (m3)−1for the product obtained from SFAD), viscosity kinematic (3.14–4.29 mm2 s−1), flash point (&lt;100 °C), carbon residue (0.01 wt.%), ethanol (0.08–0.083 wt.%), free glycerol (&lt;0.001 wt.%) and total glycerol (0.028–0.10 wt.%), monoglycerides (0.076–0.211 wt.%), diglycerides (0.0196–0.218 wt.%) and triglycerides (0.053–0.114 wt.%). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of weight ratio of plywood manufacturing by-product birch sawdust (BS) to water (1/2–1/8), reaction temperature (200–340 °C), initial H2 pressure (0–10 MPa), residence time (5–90 min), catalysts amount (0.25–7.0 wt.%) and type (FeSO4, ZnSO4, NiSO4, Raney-nickel, Ni65%/SiO2[sbnd]Al2O3, Na2CO3 and NaOH) on hydrothermal liquefaction of BS was investigated. High yield of bio-oil (54.1%) with calorific value (CV) 24.9 MJ/kg under developed optimal experimental conditions in the presence of NaOH (5 wt.%) utilizing weight ratio of BS to water 1/4, residence time 5 min, mixing speed 250 rpm at 300 °C without pressurized particular inert gas or H2 atmosphere was achieved. Compounds in bio-oil analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have suitable chemical structures for conversion into renewable hydrocarbons. Marketable solid residue (SR) with yield 7.1%, high CV (29.8 MJ/kg) and perspective characteristics for industrial application was obtained. Produced gas in process analyzed by gas chromatography-thermal conductivity detector (GC–TCD) contains 60.1 vol.% of CO2. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The performance of two lignocellulosic biomasses was studied in high-pressure carbon dioxide/water pre-treatment. Sugarcane bagasse and elephant grass were used to produce C5-sugars from hemicellulose and, simultaneously, to promote cellulose digestibility for enzymatic saccharification. Different pre-treatment conditions, with combined severity factor ranging from −1.17 to −0.04, were evaluated and maximal total xylan to xylose yields of 59.2 wt.% (34.4 wt.% xylooligomers) and 46.4 wt.% (34.9 wt.% xylooligomers) were attained for sugarcane bagasse and elephant grass, respectively. Furthermore, pre-treated biomasses were highly digestible, with glucan to glucose yields of 77.2 mol% and 72.4 mol% for sugarcane bagasse and elephant grass, respectively. High-pressure carbon dioxide/water pre-treatment provides high total C5-sugars and glucose recovery from both lignocellulosic biomasses; however it is highly influenced by composition and intrinsic features of each biomass. The obtained results confirm this approach as an effective and greener alternative to conventional pre-treatment processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to investigate the coke formation during the hydrotreatment of bio-oil at low temperature. The catalytic hydrotreatment of bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of mallee wood was carried out using pre-sulphided NiMo and CoMo catalysts at a temperature range of 150–300 °C. Our results show that the catalysts play an important role in reducing the coke formation. The transformation of light products during the hydrotreatment was investigated. The role of levoglucosan in the coke formation was investigated by adding additional levoglucosan into the bio-oil prior to the hydrotreatment. In the presence of the catalyst, the hydrotreatment of bio-oil with the added levoglucosan did not yield more coke than that of original bio-oil under identical conditions. However, in the absence of the hydrotreating catalyst, coke formation was intensified. Our data indicate that levoglucosan could cross-link with other compounds in bio-oil in the absence of a hydrotreatment catalyst. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enzymatic fuel cell (EFC)-based self-powered biosensors have attracted considerable attention because of their unique feature of no need for extra power sources during the entire detection process, which endows them with the merits of simplicity, rapidness, low cost, anti-interference, and ease of use. Herein, we proposed, for the first time, an EFC-based self-powered homogeneous immunosensing platform by integrating the target-induced biofuel release and bioconjugate immunoassay for ultrasensitive melamine (ME) detection. In this design, the biofuel, i.e., glucose molecules, was entrapped in the pores of positively charged mesoporous silica nanoparticles and capped by the biogate AuNPs-labeled anti-ME antibody (AuNPs-Ab). The presence of the target ME triggered the entrapped glucose release due to the removal of the biogate via immunoreaction, which resulted in the transfer of electrons produced by glucose oxidation at the bioanode to the biocathode, and thus, the open-circuit voltage of the EFC-based self-powered immunosensor dramatically increased, realizing the ultrasensitive turn-on assay for ME. The limit of detection for ME assay was down to 2.1 pM (S/N = 3), superior to those previously reported in the literature. Notably, real milk samples need no special sample pretreatment for the detection of ME because of the good anti-interference ability of EFC-based self-powered biosensors and the excellent selectivity of the homogeneous immunoassay. Therefore, this appealing self-powered homogeneous immunosensing platform holds great promise as a successful prototype of portable and on-site bioassay in the field of food safety. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Previous studies demonstrate that the high ash contents appeared to inhibit the formation of biocrude oil in the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) processes. In order to investigate the effect of ash contents on the HTL reaction, mixed-culture algal biomass from wastewater systems (AW) was separated into two fractions (AW-41.8 and AW-38.5) and converted into biocrude oil via HTL at 300 °C for a 60 min reaction time (the previously determined optimum condition). Compared to AW biomass before screen pretreatments, the ash contents of AW-41.8 and AW-38.5 were respectively decreased from 53.3 wt% to 41.8 wt% and 38.5 wt%. Moreover, the higher heating value (HHV) of resulting biocrude oil was increased from 27.5 MJ/kg to 32.3 MJ/kg, and the fraction of light oil (boiling point of 110–300°C) was increased from 31 wt% to 49 wt%. The above results indicate that algal biomass with certain amounts of ash contents can be converted into biocrude oil with reasonable quality and quantity. To explore the range of concentrations of ash where it may present a positive effect on the biocrude oil yield or quality, further HTL conversions with pure algal feedstock and representative ash contents were conducted. The HHV and boiling point distribution of the algal biocrude oil was hardly affected when the ash contents in the algal feedstock was below 40 wt%. This fact substantiates the feasibility of using high-ash algae from wastewater treatment systems for HTL feedstocks and diminishes the necessity of multi-step pretreatments and modifications of high-ash algal biomass for biofuel application. © 2017

AB  - This work addresses the development of a compact paper-based enzymatic microfluidic glucose/O2 fuel cell that can operate using a very limited sample volume (≈35 µl) and explores the energy generated by glucose at concentrations typically found in blood samples at physiological conditions (pH 7.4). Carbon paper electrodes combined with a paper sample absorption substrate all contained within a plastic microfluidic casing are used to construct the paper-based fuel cell. The anode catalysts consist of glucose dehydrogenase and [Os(4,4'-dimethoxy-2,2'-bipyridine)2(poly-vinylimidazole)10Cl]+ as mediator, while the cathode catalysts were bilirubin oxidase and [Os(2,2'-bipyridine)2(poly-vinylimidazole)10Cl]+ as mediator. The fuel cell delivered a linear power output response to glucose over the range of 2.5–30 mM, with power densities ranging from 20 to 90 µW cm−2. The quantification of the available electrical power as well as the energy density extracted from small synthetic samples allows planning potential uses of this energy to power different sensors and analysis devices in a wide variety of in-vitro applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Superparamagnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (mMWCNTs) were prepared by filling multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with iron oxide, and further modified by linking polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers (mMWCNTs-PAMAM) on the surface. Then, mMWCNTs-PAMAM was employed as the carrier and successfully immobilized Burkholderia cepacia lipase (BCL) via a covalent method (BCL-mMWCNTs-G3). The maximum activity recovery of the immobilized lipase was 1,716% and the specific activity increased to 77,460 U/g-protein, 17-fold higher than that of the free enzyme. The immobilized lipase displayed significantly enhanced thermostability and pH-resistance, and could efficiently catalyze transesterification to produce biodiesel at a conversion rate of 92.8%. Moreover, it possessed better recycling performance. After 20 cycles of repeated used, it still retained ca. 90% of its original activity, since the carbon nanotube-'enzyme conjugates could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by using a magnet. This study provides a new perspective for biotechnological applications by adding a magnetic property to the unique intrinsic properties of nanotubes. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Background: Cellulose-degrading thermophilic anaerobic bacterium as a suitable host for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) has been proposed as an economically suited platform for the production of second-generation biofuels. To recognize the overall objective of CBP, fermentation using co-culture of different cellulolytic and sugar-fermenting thermophilic anaerobic bacteria has been widely studied as an approach to achieving improved ethanol production. We assessed monoculture and co-culture fermentation of novel thermophilic anaerobic bacterium for ethanol production from real substrates under controlled conditions. Results: In this study, Clostridium sp. DBT-IOC-C19, a cellulose-degrading thermophilic anaerobic bacterium, was isolated from the cellulolytic enrichment cultures obtained from a Himalayan hot spring. Strain DBT-IOC-C19 exhibited a broad substrate spectrum and presented single-step conversion of various cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates to ethanol, acetate, and lactate with ethanol being the major fermentation product. Additionally, the effect of varying cellulose concentrations on the fermentation performance of the strain was studied, indicating a maximum cellulose utilization ability of 10 g L-1 cellulose. Avicel degradation kinetics of the strain DBT-IOC-C19 displayed 94.6% degradation at 5 g L-1 and 82.74% degradation at 10 g L-1 avicel concentration within 96 h of fermentation. In a comparative study with Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1313, the ethanol and total product concentrations were higher by the newly isolated strain on pretreated rice straw at an equivalent substrate loading. Three different co-culture combinations were used on various substrates that presented two-fold yield improvement than the monoculture during batch fermentation. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the direct fermentation ability of the novel thermophilic anaerobic bacteria on various cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates into ethanol without the aid of any exogenous enzymes, representing CBP-based fermentation approach. Here, the broad substrate utilization spectrum of isolated cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobic bacterium was shown to be of potential utility. We demonstrated that the co-culture strategy involving novel strains is efficient in improving ethanol production from real substrate. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Asphalt industry has been looking to reduce their dependence on petroleum-based binders and apply non-petroleum binders as partial or full replacement for asphalt binders. This motivated several attempts by researchers to produce bio-modified asphalts from various materials including woody biomass, waste cooking oil, and bio-oil from animal manure. Accordingly, attempts have been made to incorporate bio-oils/bio-binders (BBs) made from these feedstocks mainly as partial replacements for petroleum-based asphalt. However, this effort has been found to be challenging mainly due to the high variations, in both the feedstock sources and the resulting bioproducts. Accordingly, aforementioned bio-modified asphalts behave differently in terms of their physicochemical and morphological properties, making them to be highly different in terms of their performance as well as their susceptibility to thermal and oxidative ageing. While there have been several studies on the application of various biomass-derived alternative binders, their effects on the physicochemical characteristics of asphalt before and after oxidative ageing have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, this paper investigates the effects of introduction of four different BBs made from Swine Manure, Miscanthus Pellet, Corn Stover, and Wood Pellet on the rheological and chemical properties of a selected asphalt binder (PG64-22) before and after oxidative ageing. To study the effect of oxidative ageing on the chemical structure of bio-modified asphalt binder, Infrared Attenuated Total Reflectance Spectroscopy (Fourier transform infrared) was utilised. In addition, a Drop Shape Analyser, Rotational Viscometer, and Dynamic Shear Rheometer were used to evaluate the surface properties and rheological behaviour of each bio-modified asphalt binder. Overall, bio-modifiers (bio-oil/BBs) were found to be significantly different in terms of their ageing characteristics. Accordingly, their surface and rheological properties were found to be ranked differently before and after ageing when compared to that of control asphalt binder. The results showed that the BB from swine manure is less susceptible to ageing compared to plant-based bio-oils. This can be further attributed to the chemical structure and the high lipid contents of the BB from swine manure, making it less affected by oxidative ageing. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The heating value describes the energy content of any fuel. In this study, this parameter was evaluated for different abundant materials in Morocco (two types of biochar, plastic, synthetic rubber, and cardboard as municipal solid waste (MSW), and various types of biomass). Before the evaluation of their higher heating value (HHV) by a calorimeter device, the thermal behavior of these materials was investigated using thermogravimetric (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. The focus of this work is to evaluate the calorific value of each material alone in a first time, then to compare the experimental and theoretical HHV of their mixtures in a second time. The heating value of lignocellulosic materials was between 12.16 and 20.53 MJ/kg, 27.39 for biochar 1, 32.60 MJ/kg for biochar 2, 37.81 and 38.00 MJ/kg for plastic and synthetic rubber respectively and 13.81 MJ/kg for cardboard. A significant difference was observed between the measured and estimated HHVs of mixtures. Experimentally, results for a large variety of mixture between biomass/biochar and biomass/MSW have shown that the interaction between biomass and other compounds expressed a synergy of 2.37% for biochar 1 and 6.11% for biochar 2, 1.09% for cardboard, 5.09% for plastic and 5.01% for synthetic rubber. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The role of formic acid together with the effect of the solvent type and their synergic interactions with a NiMo catalyst were studied for the conversion of lignin into bio-oil in an alcohol/formic acid media. The replacement of formic acid with H2or isopropanol decreased the oil yield to a considerable degree, increased the solid yield, and altered the nature of the bio-oil. The differences induced by the presence of H2were comparable to those observed in the isopropanol system, which suggests similar lignin conversion mechanisms for both systems. Additional semi-batch experiments confirmed that formic acid does not act merely as an in situ hydrogen source or hydrogen donor molecule. Actually, is seems to react with lignin through a formylation–elimination–hydrogenolysis mechanism that leads to the depolymerization of the biopolymer. This reaction competes with formic acid decomposition, which gives mainly H2and CO2, and forms a complex reaction system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the distinctive role/mechanism of formic acid has been observed in the conversion of real lignin feedstock. In addition, the solvent, especially ethanol, seems also to play a vital role in the stabilization of the depolymerized monomers and in the elimination/deformylation step. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Unlike petroleum diesel, the chemical structure of biodiesel makes it prone to oxidation during long-term storage, thus involving fuel quality deterioration. Therefore, the addition of antioxidants is usually required to meet the quality standards for biodiesel commercialization. Synthetic sterically-hindered phenols have been usually employed for this purpose as free radical scavenging antioxidants. However, naturally occurring phenolics are also available, for example, in the bio-oil produced in the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. In this work, the antioxidant potential of extracted fractions of lignocellulosic bio-oil has been evaluated. Different organic solvents were tested as extraction agents, acetate esters being the best ones for incorporating bio-oil antioxidant compounds into biodiesel. In the best case, the incorporation of a small concentration of bio-oil compounds (< 4 wt.%) led to an improvement of the biodiesel oxidation stability of 475% which, in our case, was enough to meet the European standard requirement. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising sustainable feedstock for the production of biofuels, biomaterials, and biospecialty chemicals. However, efficient utilization of biomass has been limited by our poor understanding of its molecular structure. Here, we report a dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced solid-state (SS)NMR study of the molecular structure of biomass, both pre- and postcatalytic treatment. This technique enables the measurement of 2D homonuclear 13C-13C correlation SSNMR spectra under natural abundance, yielding, for the first time, an atomiclevel picture of the structure of raw and catalytically treated biomass samples. We foresee that further such experiments could be used to determine structure-function relationships and facilitate the development of more efficient, and chemically targeted, biomass-conversion technologies. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A novel metal free acid-base (CC-SO3H-NH2) catalyst was synthesized by introducing acidic -SO3H, -COOH, and silyloxypropylamine (-OSiCH2CH2CH2NH2) functional groups on glucose derived carbocatalyst. The catalyst was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses. Superior catalytic activity was shown by the catalyst toward one-pot synthesis of DFF using molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant. The catalyst was found to be highly selective in synthesis of 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) from hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), fructose, and, more importantly, from glucose with excellent yields. Moreover, the catalyst was easily recycled and reused without any significant loss in its catalytic activity. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Four solid acid catalysts including graphene oxide (GO), sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), sulfonated graphene (SG), and sulfonated active carbon (SAC) were used to convert lipids in wet microalgae into biodiesel. The physiochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized with scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. SGO provided the highest conversion efficiency (84.6% of sulfuric acid) of lipids to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Whereas SAC converted few lipids into FAME. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and elemental analysis revealed that much higher hydrophilic hydroxyl content in SGO catalyst resulted in a considerable higher conversion efficiency of lipids to FAME than that (48.6%) catalyzed by SG, although SO3H groups (0.44 mmol/g) in SGO were less than those (1.69 mmol/g) in SG. Given its higher SO3H group content than GO (0.38 mmol/g), SGO had higher conversion efficiency than GO (73.1%), when they had similar hydrophilic hydroxyl contents. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A torrefaction pre-treatment could enhance the fast pyrolysis process to produce bio-oil by decreasing the required energy for grinding biomass particles and by improving bio-oil characteristics so they resemble more those of fossil fuels. To evaluate this hypothesis, this work compares fast pyrolysis experiments of raw and torrefied woody biomass feedstocks, using a 500 g h−1 entrained down flow reactor. The feedstocks used were hardwood (ash wood), softwood (spruce) and mixed waste wood. These feedstocks were torrefied at various temperatures between 250 °C and 300 °C by means of two torrefaction processes: a directly heated moving bed, and the Torbed® process. The effect of pelletizing was also analyzed for the hardwood feedstock, comparing torrefied chips and torrefied pellets. The obtained bio-oils from experiments with torrefied feedstock had overall improved oxygen and heating value properties compared to bio-oils from raw feedstock. Hardwood pellets torrefied at 265 °C with a residence time of 45 min produced the oils with the highest quality with respect to oxygen mass fraction (decreased from 45.7% to 37.2%) and higher heating value (increased from 19.1 MJ kg−1 to 23.1 MJ kg−1), compared to bio-oil produced from raw hardwood feedstock. However, these properties came at a severe loss of oil yield, decreasing from 44% for raw feedstock to an average of 31% for torrefied feedstock. Nonetheless, a chain analysis shows that a torrefaction pre-treatment could be more attractive on energy basis compared to a conventional fast pyrolysis process with a deoxygenation upgrading step. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Pyrolysis characteristic of hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) was analyzed using TG, TG-FTIR-MS and Py-GC-MS. Bio-fuel oil (BFO) was obtained using catalytic cracking method. The BFO was analyzed by FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, GC-MS and ESI FT-ICR MS to provide complementary and comprehensive adequate information. TG-DTG results showed that the HPO pyrolysis was different with other plant oil. It was clear that HPO pyrolysis was mainly in temperature range of 350 °C–500 °C. The mean activation energy of HPO pyrolysis calculated from KAS and FWO models was 161.10 kJ/mol and 164.28 kJ/mol, respectively. According to TG-FTIR-MS results, little amount of gas components was detected. Py-GC-MS result found heavy compounds, which carbon number exceeds 18. FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and GC-MS results found the BFO mainly contained long-chain alkane and alkene. According to ESI FT-ICR MS, the oxygen containing compounds in BFO were from O2[sbnd]O6 classes, with the O2 being the major class. The RSFTIR was first used to analyze biomass pyrolysis. The results found that in the decarboxylation process, the carbon chain also was cracked to form short carbon chain carboxyl firstly. According to above experiments results, we can confirm HPO pyrolysis path was different with palm oil. The key conclusion was that HPO maybe was a good bio-resource to obtain BFO, and it was mainly contained diesel-like components. Compared to palm oil pyrolysis products, HPO pyrolysis products were mainly contained long-chain alkane and alkene. The recommended pyrolysis path was also proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) converts algal biomass into a crude bio-oil (biocrude) and aqueous-phase products. The effect of temperature, water loading, and added H2 and/or Ru/C catalyst on the properties of the biocrude that spontaneously separates from the aqueous phase post reaction and also the biocrude that is extractable from the aqueous phase by dichloromethane is explored herein. This report is the first to elucidate how the yields, compositions, heating values, and energy recoveries of the two biocrudes vary with the processing conditions above. Increasing temperature from 350 to 400 °C increased the yield of water-insoluble biocrude (38.1–42.5 wt%) and its hexane-soluble subfraction (63.7–85.6 wt%) while decreasing the yield of extractable, water-soluble biocrude (6.6–2.5 wt%). The Ru/C catalyst had the same effect. Reaction temperature and catalysts could be used to manipulate the proportions of water-soluble and water-insoluble biocrude from algae HTL and thereby manipulate biocrude quantity and quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated the impact on persistent organic pollutant (POP) emissions from a diesel engine when deploying a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) combined with an uncatalyzed diesel particulate filter (DPF), as well as fueling with conventional diesel (B2) and waste cooking oil-based (WCO-based) biodiesel blends (B10 and B20). When the engine was fueled with WCO-based biodiesel blends (B10 and B20) in combination with deploying DOC+A-DPF, their levels of the chlorine and potassium contents could not stimulate the formation of chlorinated POPs (PCDD/Fs and PCBs), although previous studies had warned that happened on diesel engines fueled with biodiesel and deployed with iron-catalyzed DPFs. In contrast, the WCO-based biodiesel with a lower aromatic content reduced the precursors for POP formation, and its higher oxygen content compared to diesel promoted more complete combustion, and thus using WCO-based biodiesel could reduce both PM2.5and POP emissions from diesel engines. This study also evaluated the impact of DPF conditions on the POP emissions from a diesel engine; that is, the difference in POP emissions before and just after the regeneration of the DPF. In comparison to the high soot-loaded DPF scenario, the regeneration of the DPF can drastically reduce the formation potential of POPs in the DPFs. An approach was developed to correct the effects of sampling artifacts on the partitioning of gas- and particle-phase POPs in the exhaust. The gas-phase POPs are highly dominant (89.7–100%) in the raw exhausts of diesel engines, indicating that the formation mechanism of POPs in diesel engines is mainly through homogeneous gas-phase formation, rather than de novo synthesis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algal biofuels have caught worldwide attention, due to the success of first and second generation biofuels on combing environmental concerns in spite of many challenges. Microalgae are the potential and sustainable fuel source with carbon neutrality, where selection of promising strain is crucial for effective biofuel generation. Euglena sanguinea one such robust freshwater species with high lipid productivity was explored on laboratory scale as well as in mass scale in raceway pond. The extracted oil's fatty acid value was only 3.8 mg KOH g−1 and had 93% triglycerides. Acid value was reduced to ∼0.3 mg KOH g−1 by esterification and the optimized parameters obtained were: methanol/oil ratio: 0.36, H2SO4: 10 vol.%, time: 42 min. In the subsequent transesterification process natural, recoverable and eco-friendly white mussel shell was used. Maximum yield of ∼98% was obtained at 6 wt.% of calcinated CaO for the reaction time of 80 min at 0.35 methanol/oil ratio. The GC-MS analysis of the algal biodiesel showed the presence of saturated fatty acids: C16:0, C18:0, C22:0, C24:0 and monounsaturated fatty acids C18:1 at appropriate level to provide better oxidation stability and combustion properties to use it for automotive application without any major engine modifications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of transition metal modified ZSM-5 on biomass (rice straw) pyrolysis via microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) for bio-oil production. XRD and TPD was used to analyze differences between the prepared catalysts. In the experiments, the prepared catalysts were used in ex-situ reactor. The yield of bio-oil from MAP of rice straw using transition metal modified catalysts significantly increased compared to the control. GC/MS analysis of the bio-oil further revealed that cobalt, nickel and zinc transition metal modified ZSM-5 catalyst improved bio-oil compound selectivity. Aldehydes/ketones and phenols were the most abundant groups of compounds present; composing more than 50% on average of the bio-oil. The thermal behavior of biomass catalytic pyrolysis was carried out by TGA, and the reaction kinetics of this process was analyzed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new biocatalyst consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx) and polyethylenimine (PEI) immobilized on carbon nanotube (CNT) (CNT/PEI/GOx) was developed, while cyclic voltammogram (CV) behaviors of several related catalysts including the CNT/PEI/GOx were analyzed in terms of charge transfer resistances (Rcts) obtained by measuring Nyquist plots using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A qualitative correlation between the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) redox reactivity measured by the CV and Rct was established. As factors affecting both the FAD reactivity and Rct, concentrations of GOx, glucose, and phosphate buffer solution, electrolyte pH and ambient condition were considered and evaluations of the catalysts using the CV curves and Nyquist plots confirmed that a pattern in the FAD reactivity was closely linked to that in the Rct, implying that FAD reactivities of the catalysts are predicted by the measurements of their Rcts. Even regarding performance of the enzymatic biofeul cells (EBCs) using the reacted catalysts, a pattern of the Rcts is compatible with that in the maximum power densities (MPDs) of the EBCs. © 2017, Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.

AB  - Traditional lignin pyrolysis generates a bio-oil with a complex mixture of alkyl-functionalized guaiacol and syringol monomers that have limited utility to completely replace phenol in resins. In this work, formate assisted fast pyrolysis (FAsP) of lignin yielded a bio-oil consisting of alkylated phenol compounds, due to deoxyhydrogenation, that was used to synthesize phenol/formaldehyde resins. A solvent extraction method was developed to concentrate the phenolics in the extract to yield a phenol rich monomer mixture. Phenolic resins were synthesized using phenol (phenol resin), FAsP bio-oil (oil resin), and an extract mimic (mimic resin) that was prepared to resemble the extract after further purification. All three phenolic sources could synthesize novolac resins with reactive sites remaining for subsequent resin curing. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis of the three resins revealed similar thermal and decomposition behavior of phenol and the mimic resins, while the oil resin was less stable. Resins were cured with hexamethylenetetramine and the mimic resin demonstrated improved curing energies compared to the oil resin. The adhesive strength of the mimic resin was found to be superior to that of the oil resins. These results confirmed that extracting a mixture of substituted aromatics from FAsP bio-oil could synthesize resins with properties similar to those from phenol and improved over the parent bio-oil. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The exploration of highly active and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction is vitally important to facilitate the improvement of metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Herein, super-active catalysts made from an interesting metal-polymer network (MPN) that consist of Fe-Nx-C, B-N and Fe3O4/Fe3C alloys were prepared via facile one-pot carbonization. The achieved catalysts possessed an amazing porous structure that was derived from the MPN with the assistance of a "bubble-template". Remarkably, the content of highly active Fe-Nx-C can be regulated by introducing graphene, and the ORR activity of the catalyst was enhanced dramatically with an increase in the Fe3O4/Fe3C alloy content. The most active BNFe-C-G2 catalyst exhibited superior ORR activity/stability, and was then employed as an air cathode electrocatalyst in a microbial fuel cell. The results showed that the output voltage and power density of BNFe-C-G2 were significantly improved to 575 ± 11 mV and 1046.2 ± 35 mW m-2, respectively. These values are 4.5% and 44.44% higher than those of commercial Pt/C. Thus, due to the synergistic electrocatalysis of the Fe-Nx-C, B-N and Fe3O4/Fe3C alloys, the super-active and low-cost BNFe-C-G2 material should be a promising ORR catalyst for application in biofuel cells, and in many other energy conversion and storage devices. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Used waste cooking oil (WCO) or frying oils are being considered as rich sources of economical feedstock for biodiesel production. To carry out the process of trans-esterification of WCO to methyl esters (biodiesel), zeolite/chitosan/KOH composite was used as solid heterogeneous catalysts. The composite was analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. It was found that the treatment of the natural zeolite (clinoptilolite zeolite) with KOH significantly decreased its silica content by desilication and increased its K+ content by formation of hydroxylpotaslite. Electrolysis method (EM) is used as an applicable technology for recovery of energy and resources during waste treatment. Theoretically, EM can convert any biodegradable waste into H2, O2, biofuels, as well as other by-products such as glycerol. However, the system efficacy can vary significantly under different circumstances. The conversion of biodiesel from WCO was obtained for 1 wt.% catalyst concentration and alcohol/oil ratio of 1:7 at 40 V in the presence of water as 2 wt.% of the whole solution in 3 h, produced 93% yield. The optimum conversion process was achieved as a result of using co-solvent as acetone. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Viscosity characterization were used the assessing techniques for detection of WCO and biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Removal of nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) as struvite from bio-oil aqueous phase generated via hydrothermal liquefaction of algae was evaluated in this study. Effect of process parameters such as pH, temperature and reaction time on struvite formation was studied. More than 99% of phosphorus and 40–100% ammonium nitrogen were removed under all experimental conditions. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of struvite, and the struvite recovered from bio-oil aqueous phase can be used as a slow-release fertilizer. Biogas production from struvite recovered bio-oil aqueous phase showed 3.5 times higher CH4yield (182 ± 39 mL/g COD) as compared to non-struvite recovered aqueous phase. The results from this study indicate that both struvite and methane can be produced from bio-oil aqueous phase. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study is focused on conversion of non-edible Jatropha seeds biomass to biofuels i.e., liquid, solid and gaseous fuels via solar thermochemical pyrolysis process. All the three products namely; (i) bio-oil (liquid) (ii) biochar (solid) and (iii) pyrolytic gas were characterized by means of TG (Thermo-gravimetric), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared), GC–MS (Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy), proximate and ultimate analysis; and assessed their feasibility as fuel candidates. It is explored that 20% maximum bio-oil yield was obtained with the average reactor temperature of 250–320 °C. The pyrolytic zone for the biomass was identified in the range of 203–508 °C. The ultimate analysis of the bio-oil revealed that the oil is rich in carbon (58.3%) and hydrogen (8.7%) with an average chemical composition of CH1.79N0.05O0.40. Relatively lower oxygen content in the bio-oil favors for high heating value. Higher H/C ratio (1.79) and lower O/C ratio (0.4) of the bio-oil indicates its suitability as petroleum fuel for engine applications. The carbon compounds present in the bio-oil are from C7 to C28 which may represent the mixture of diesel and gasoline fuels. Finally, it is emerged from the study that all the three products are exibiting various favorable conditions to be employed as fuel candidates for different applications such as engines and boilers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM]oAc) was employed for the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and extraction of lignin, a potentially valuable by-product of the biofuel industry. Response surface methodology based on central composite design was exploited and thereby an empirical model, exhibiting a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.9890, was established to optimize lignin recovery. In particular, a maximum lignin yield, equal to 90.1%, was calculated at the optimal pretreatment conditions, namely time: 120 min, temperature: 140 °C, and ionic liquid to bagasse ratio equal to 20:1 (wt/wt). The presence of guaiacyl and syringyl rings in lignin was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); whereas UV–Vis spectrophotometry showed that both p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid were contained in the lignin. Thermal analysis indicated a maximum decomposition rate of 2%/°C at 265 °C while Gel permeation chromatography analysis revealed that the molecular weight (Mw) of recovered lignin was equal to 1769 g/mol. Comparison of FTIR spectra of pretreated and untreated bagasse showed a negligible presence of lignin in the pretreated samples. Maximum delignification of bagasse after pretreatment was thus ensured. Thermal stability of the ionic liquid towards recyclability was proven by thermogravimetric analysis. The present study established adequate performance of neat and recycled ([EMIM]oAc) with regard to lignin recovery from SCB. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - An in situ domino process has been developed to be highly efficient for direct and mild conversion of various hexose sugars to the biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran in almost quantitative yields, without separation of unstable intermediates at 120 °C in n-butanol, by using polymethylhydrosiloxane and hydrophobic Pd/C as a H-donor and a bifunctional catalyst, respectively. Among the cascade reactions, the hydrosilylation process was confirmed by deuterium-labeling and kinetic studies to be favorable for sugar dehydration and exclusively acts on deoxygenation of in situ formed intermediates including furanic alcohols and aldehydes to DMF via a hydride transfer process that was facilitated by an alcoholic solvent. The catalytic system is more selective than the H2- participated counterpart, and could be scaled up with only 0.04 mol% catalyst loading, giving DMF in a comparable yield of 85%. Moreover, Pd(0) was demonstrated to be the active species for deoxygenation, and the heterogeneous catalyst exhibited good recyclability with little elemental leaching. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Co-refining of biomass derived pyrolysis liquids (PL) in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit with crude oil fractions is a promising route to produce second generation biofuels. To improve the yield and ensure co-processed fuel quality, a hydrotreating step can be deployed prior to co-processing. In this paper the conversion, yields and naphtha or gasoline composition are analyzed during a 10 wt.% PL/90 wt.% vacuum gasoil (VGO) co-processing step as a function of the PL hydrotreating severity, expressed in terms of hydrogen consumption. The naphtha yield was not impacted by the hydrotreatment procedure and always slightly higher than that of pure VGO cracking. An optimum in the naphtha quality in terms of octane rating was found as a function of the PL upgrading severity. The optimum was achieved with mildly hydrotreated PL's, corresponding to a H2 consumption of 202 NL/kgPL. These mildly hydrotreated PL's led to similar coke formation during co-refining as pure VGO cracking. These results indicate that the upgrading of PL's should be restricted to a hydrogen consumption of less than 200 NL/kgPL. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Production of liquid bio-fuels (biodiesel and bio-oil) as well as activated carbon from one non-edible feedstock, apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) seed kernel was the main objective of the present research work. The oil was extracted from apricot seed kernel with a yield of 49.44% w/w of kernels. Potassium hydroxide-catalyzed transesterification of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) seed kernel oil with methanol and ethanol was then applied to produce methylic and ethylic, respectively. Properties of the obtained biodiesels were evaluated and found conformed to ASTM D 6751 limits. The apricot de-oiled seed kernel was pyrolyzed in a semi-batch reactor for bio-oil production. The effect of the pyrolysis temperatures (350, 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 °C), pyrolysis time (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min) and feed particles size (0.25, 0.40, 0.59 and 0.84 mm) on the bio-oil yield was investigated. The maximum production of bio-oil (43.66% w/w) was achieved at a pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C, 60 min pyrolysis time and a feed particles size of 0.25 mm. The bio-oil obtained under the optimal conditions was characterized by the elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and column chromatography. The FTIR analysis of the produced bio-fuel indicated that it composes mainly of alkanes, alkenes, ketones, carboxylic acids and amines. Properties of the resulting bio-oil were analyzed in terms of calorific value, density, flash point, pH, acid value, pour point and refractive index. The properties were close to those of petroleum fractions and comparable to those of other bio-oils published in literature. Referring to the experimental results, the obtained bio-oil can be utilized as an important source of alternative fuel and chemicals. The chemical activation method by using sodium hydroxide as the activating agent was utilized to convert the bio-char into activated carbon. The effect of the process parameters including the activation temperatures (400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C), activation time (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min) and feed particles size (20, 30, 40 and 60 mesh size) on the yield, iodine adsorption number and surface area of the obtained activated carbons were investigated. The optimal activated carbon sample was obtained at 600 °C activation temperature, 90 min activation time and a feed size of 60 mesh. The resulting activated carbon showed good characteristics to be used as adsorbent in water purification as indicated by scanning electron microscope and FTIR spectroscopy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The dissolution of cellulose is a critical step for the efficient utilization of this renewable resource as a starting material for the synthesis of high value-added functional polymers and chemicals and also for biofuel production. The recalcitrance of semicrystalline cellulose microfibrils presents a major barrier to cellulose dissolution. Despite research efforts, important aspects of cellulose dissolution such as solvent-induced decrystallization and chain disentanglement are not well-understood. Here we address these fundamental issues with the practical goal of gaining insights into the swelling and dissolution of cellulose that cannot be obtained from macroscopic experimental data. To this end, we have used a newly-developed phenomenological model that captures the phenomena governing the dissolution of semicrystalline polymers as well as the thermodynamics and kinetics of dissolution. This model fits well experimental data for swelling and dissolution of cotton fibers in the ionic liquid [bmim]Cl, and allows the quantification of two important aspects, i.e., solvent effectiveness in cellulose (1) decrystallization and (2) chain disentanglement, the balance of which controls the mechanism and kinetics of cellulose dissolution. The activation parameters of cellulose decrystallization, estimated using the obtained decrystallization constant values, reveal that the decrystallization of cellulose in [bmim]Cl is associated with positive enthalpy and entropy and it is also very sensitive to temperature. When the solvent effectiveness in the disruption of cellulose crystals is relatively lower than its ability to disentangle the chains, the kinetics of dissolution are controlled by decrystallization. Furthermore, conditions that facilitate cellulose chain disentanglement, in addition to increasing the rate of dissolution, can result in faster decrystallization. The solvent effectiveness in chain disentanglement is the only factor that determines the decrease of the cellulose fiber radius. In cases where the fiber dissolution rate is lower than the decrystallization rate, the dissolution of cellulose is mostly controlled by the solvent ability to disentangle the chains. The insights obtained from this study improve the understanding of cellulose–solvent interactions underlying decrystallization and disentanglement and their contributions in controlling the kinetics of cellulose swelling and dissolution. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The identification of the influence of the reaction parameters is of paramount importance when defining a process design. In this work, non-edible castor oil was reacted with methanol to produce a possible component for biodiesel blends, using liquid enzymes as the catalyst. Temperature, alcohol-to-oil molar ratio, enzyme and added water contents were the reaction parameters evaluated in the transesterification reactions. The optimal conditions, giving the optimal final FAME yield and FFA content in the methyl ester-phase was identified. At 35 °C, 6.0 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 5 wt% of enzyme and 5 wt% of water contents, 94% of FAME yield and 6.1% of FFA in the final composition were obtained. The investigation was completed with the analysis of the component profiles, showing that at least 8 h are necessary to reach a satisfactory FAME yield together with a minor FFA content. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - NiMo catalysts supported on different sulfated and non-sulfated aluminas and zirconias were studied for the catalytic conversion of lignin in a formic acid/ethanol medium. All the pre-reduced NiMo-support combinations resulted in high conversion of lignin into bio-oil, with over 60% yield (mass%). The NiMo-sulfated alumina catalyst exhibited the highest activity among all the catalysts studied. The overall reaction mechanism of the catalytic lignin conversion was found to be especially complex. The oil yield and its properties are affected by a combination of successive catalytic reactions that are part of the lignin conversion process. Lignin is first de-polymerized into smaller fragments through the cleavage of the aliphatic ether bonds. This reaction can be either catalyzed by Ni0 species and strong Lewis acid sites within the alumina supports. In the presence of both active species, the Ni0 catalyzed ether bond cleavage is the prevailing reaction mechanism. In a second step, the smaller lignin fragments can be stabilized by catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and alkylation reactions that hinder their re-polymerization into char. Mo was found to be especially active for HDO reactions while all the catalysts studied exhibited significant alkylation activity. The final bio-oil yield is strongly dependent on the aliphatic ether bond cleavage rate; the contribution of those monomer stabilization reactions (i.e. HDO and alkylation) being secondary. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, lignocellulose biorefineries annexed to a typical sugar mill were investigated to produce either ethanol (EtOH) or 1,3-butadiene (BD), utilizing bagasse and trash as feedstock. Aspen simulation of the scenarios were developed and evaluated in terms of economic and environmental performance. The minimum selling prices (MSPs) for bio-based BD and EtOH production were 2.9–3.3 and 1.26–1.38-fold higher than market prices, respectively. Based on the sensitivity analysis results, capital investment, Internal Rate of Return and extension of annual operating time had the greatest impact on the MSP. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that EtOH and BD productions could be profitable if the average of ten-year historical price increases by 1.05 and 1.9-fold, respectively. The fossil-based route was found inferior to bio-based pathway across all investigated environmental impact categories, due to burdens associated with oil extraction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The prime objective of this study was to simultaneously enhance the lipid and protein yields from black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) fed with waste coconut endosperm. The waste coconut endosperm impoverished with nutrient content lost during milk extraction was nutritively fortified via self-fermentation process with time period ranging from 2 to 8 weeks before administering to BSFL. The results showed peak nutrient content was attained from week-4 self-fermented waste coconut endosperm. Using this feed medium, the BSFL prepupae could accumulate 58% of its biomass weight with lipid. The low polyunsaturated fatty acid (6%) and high C18:1 (50%) also guaranteed high biodiesel quality derived from BSFL. Nevertheless, the longer BSFL rearing duration when fed with week-6 self-fermented waste coconut endosperm had triggered a slight increase in protein yield (18%) in comparison with week-4 medium (15%). In considering of organic waste treatment advantage of week-4 self-fermented waste coconut endosperm, a total waste reduction of 0.019 g/d was successfully measured using only 20 BSFL. Therefore, week-4 self-fermented period was concluded as an optimum to produce ideal waste coconut endosperm feed medium for BSFL in enhancing the simultaneous lipid and protein yields. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells accumulating more than 700 h of stable operation on dry ethanol with high current output are reported. A highly active ceria-based catalytic layer deposited onto the anode efficiently converts the primary fuel into hydrogen using the electrochemically generated steam. On the other hand, standard fuel cells without the catalytic layer collapse because of carbon deposit formation within the initial 5 h of operation with ethanol. The nanostructured ceria-based catalyst forms a continuous porous layer (∼25 µm thick) over the Ni-based anode support that has no apparent influence on the fuel cell operation and prevents carbon deposit formation. Moreover, the catalytic layer promotes overall steam reforming reactions of ethanol that result in similar current outputs in both hydrogen and ethanol fuels. The stability of single cells, with relatively large active area (8 cm2), confirms the feasibility of a catalytic layer for internal reforming of biofuels in solid oxide fuel cells. The experimental results provide a significant step towards the practical application of direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cells. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, an integrated biomass conversion concept of producing liquid biofuels from brown marine macroalga Padina tetrastromatica was investigated. The algal biomass was collected from the Mandapam coastal region and processed under laboratory. Various parameters were studied to extract crude lipids from the biomass. A kinetic study was conducted for extracting the lipids from the biomass, which follows the first order kinetics and the lipid yield was 8.15 wt.%. The activation energy; Ea = 34.314 kJ mol−1and their thermodynamic parameters were determined. Since the crude algal lipids contain high amount of free fatty acids, a sequential transesterification technique was examined and 7.8% of biodiesel (78 mg/g algal biomass) yield was obtained. The biodiesel was analyzed by1H and13C–NMR spectroscopy and the conversion yield was estimated. Further, the biodiesel fuel properties were investigated and found that all the features fit the required ASTM D6751 specification limits. The residual biomass after lipid extraction was further explored for bioethanol production through the anaerobic fermentation process. The ethanol yield obtained after saccharification and fermentation were estimated and 161 mg/g residue biomass was reported. The theoretical yield of conversion of hydrolysate to bioethanol was estimated and found to be 83.4%. Therefore, this study demonstrates that macroalga P. tetrastromatica biomass has great potential to produce liquid biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The advent of biodiesel, as a viable alternative to replace crude-based diesel as transport fuel, has prompted growing interest worldwide due to the need for low-emission fuels. In this work, two reactive distillation processes using soybean oil as main feedstock along with the corresponding downstream separation units are simulated: the first process involves a homogeneous alkali catalyst; whereas the second involves a heterogeneous catalyst. Both processes yield a high purity biodiesel product. In the present work, ASPEN Plus v8.4 is used as the process simulation tool. The energy requirements of both processes were evaluated based on the optimization of the distillation column duties and performing heat integration on the process streams. The optimization of the column duties was performed by analyzing the Column Grand Composite Curves (CGCC). The process streams were heat integrated, and a Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) was designed to minimize utility consumption. Both processes were compared using profitability indicators such as Return-On-Investment (ROI), payback period and unit production cost. The results show that the heterogeneous-catalyzed process is more profitable than the alkali-catalyzed process for biodiesel production. The ROI, payback period and unit production cost were 486%, 0.2 years and $0.712 per kg of biodiesel respectively. For the analysis, an annual production capacity of 35.4 kilotonnes/year of biodiesel production was assumed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the effect of gasoline fumigation on the energy and exergy balance of a DI diesel engine fueled with waste cooking oil biodiesel and diesel blend (B20) is experimentally investigated and theoretically studied. To have a comprehensive analysis, diesel and B20 were considered as two baseline fuels and gasoline fumigation was induced at two different ratios. The obtained results reveal that gasoline fumigation increases the energy and exergy efficiency at medium and high loads to about 5% for diesel baseline fuel, while the energy and exergy efficiency decreases slightly in case of B20 fuel with gasoline fumigation. For all operating points, the percentage of energy and exergy transfer through the exhaust gases decreases by an average of 2.6% and 6.4%, respectively in case of using gasoline fumigation for both diesel and B20 fuels. Moreover, the destructed exergy of the engine operating on B20 and the fumigated gasoline was higher than that of diesel and B20 by about 2.4% on the average. It could be concluded that the combination of B20 and gasoline fumigation might be used as a substitute for diesel fuel in diesel engines under high loads, with higher exergy efficiency and lower exhaust exergy losses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignin, the second most abundant natural polymer, has emerged as a potential alternative material to petroleum-based chemicals and renewable resource for the production of diverse forms of aromatics, biofuels, and bio-based materials. Thus, it is becoming important to understand its structure and properties to provide key features and insights for better/efficient lignin valorisation. In this work, the physicochemical characterisation of two types of industrial (technical) lignins, namely LignoBoost lignin and alkali-treated lignin was performed. Characterisation has been conducted using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller N2 adsorption, particle size distribution, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that the pretreatment severity considerably influenced the lignin composition and functional properties. The measured physicochemical properties helped in proposing potential valorisation routes for these lignins in the context of a biorefinery, focusing on their depolymerisation and subsequent biological conversion to value-added chemicals and fuels. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - In this work we report a new strategy to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis by using a hybrid support that consists of metal–organic framework (MOF) crystals and partially reduced graphene oxide (PRGO) nanosheets to disperse metal nanoparticle catalysts efficiently. We report the development of a Pd nanocatalyst incorporated within a 3 D hierarchical nanocomposite that consists of a Ce-based MOF wrapped with thin PRGO nanosheets, Pd/PRGO/Ce-MOF, as a heterogeneous tandem catalyst for the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin, a common component in lignin-derived bio-oil, under mild reaction conditions. Our results demonstrate that the PRGO/Ce-MOF hybrid scaffold is an excellent support for Pd nanoparticles for the transformation of vanillin into 2-methoxy-4-methyl phenol, an important high-value phenol compound that can be used directly in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The high catalytic performance of the Pd/PRGO/Ce-MOF catalyst is attributed to the unique characteristics of the incorporation of the PRGO support that leads not only to a stable and uniform dispersion of the Pd nanoparticles but also to the presence of acidic active sites that promote the hydrogenolysis reaction. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biofuels are important alternative for fossil-based fuel but they have either relatively low density or high freezing point and viscosity. Here we reported a simple and efficient route to synthesis biofuel with density comparable to widely used JP-10 fuel as well as good low-temperature properties. Substituted diphenyl methane was synthesized by acid catalytic alkylation of lignin-derived phenols (phenol, anisole, guaiacol) with benzyl ether or benzyl alcohols, and MMT-K10 exhibits better activity than HPW, Amberlyst-15, and Al-MCM-41, due to the modest acid strength and open lamellar structure. High selectivity along with good-to-excellent conversion was obtained under optimized conditions regardless of different reactant used. Then the alkylated product was subjected to hydrogenation with the presence of Pd/C and HZSM-5, and interestingly, intramolecular cyclization reaction occurred to produce a large amount of perhydrofluorene as well as dicyclohexylmethane. Subsequently, biofuel with density as high as 0.93 g/mL and freezing point as low as −40.0 °C was obtained, which surpasses the state-of-art of biofuel reported. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, rice straw as an abundant agricultural waste was subjected to hydrothermal liquefaction for production of bio oil. The series of batch experiments were conducted at different temperatures (200 °C, 230 °C, 260 °C, 280 °C and 300 °C) for reaction time of 120 min with and without NiO nanocatalyst. The resulting bio-oil was categorized into light and heavy oils (LO and HO). In presence of nanocatalyst, the yields of LO and HO were maximized up to 13.2% and 17.2% at 300 °C, respectively. The carbon recovery of bio oil was significantly improved to 52.8% with 46.6% energy recovery in catalyzed reaction. Typical H/C and O/C atomic ratio of catalyzed HO are 1.2 and 0.3 respectively. The highest calorific values of LO and HO are 24.9 MJkg−1 and 31.9 MJkg−1 respectively. The tested nanocatalyst increased the yield of bio oil, but could not incite the elemental compositions and heating values of bio oil. The valuable chemical compounds in bio-oil had been analyzed by GC-MS. The LO samples mainly contained phenols, alcohols and ketones while HO consisted alkanes and organic acids. Additionally, aldehydes and other organic compounds were also found in products. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of co-producing two different biofuels from a lignocellulosic substrate (wheat straw), according to a biorefinery concept, has been investigated. For such a purpose, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) from the hemicellulosic and cellulosic fractions was performed for maximizing bioethanol production. The non-washed water-insoluble solid (WIS) fraction from the pretreated wheat straw totally inhibited the production of ethanol by Kluyveromyces marxianus independently of the inoculum size. In contrast, when using washed-WIS, higher ethanol productivities at 24 h of SSF were attained when increasing the inoculum size from 1 g/L to 3 g/L. The residual lignin from the bioethanol process was transformed by fast-pyrolysis into bio-oil that can be further converted into other biofuels or biochemicals. Thermal fast-pyrolysis of the residual lignin fraction produced 31.9 wt% of bio-oil∗ (water free basis) mostly composed by oxygenated aromatics coming from the lignin monomers (guaiacol-, syringol- and phenol-derived compounds). On the other hand, catalytic fast-pyrolysis of the residual lignin fraction over HZSM-5 zeolite was used as preferentially promoted decarbonylation and cracking of the primary vapours. Coupling both processes significantly enhanced the production of liquid products from lignocellulose, improving the efficiency in the use of the raw material. In this way, compared to a simple process of bioethanol production, this approach allowed to increase the mass and the chemical energy yields 1.9 and 1.7-fold, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three Ni-based catalysts were prepared for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil with three different support materials (active carbon, SBA-15 and Al-SBA-15) and their catalytic effects were tested with crude bio-oil at 300 °C and under 3 MPa H2 pressure for 60 min. After the HDO reaction, gas, liquid phase (light oil and heavy oil) and char were obtained as the primary products. Heavy oil was produced at a yield of 45.8-48.1 wt%, with no significant differences among the three catalysts. Mesoporous silica-supported catalysts (Ni/SBA-15 and Ni/Al-SBA-15) produced large amounts of char (16.3-18.6%), while Ni/C yielded 8.5 wt% char. Active carbon-supported catalysts (Ni/C) yielded more gas (27.7%) than the Ni/SBA-15 and Ni/Al-SBA-15 catalysts (6.6-8.9%), due to high surface area and low char deposition on the active carbon-supported catalysts. The HDO reaction led to improvement in the fuel properties of crude bio-oil. The water content, acidity, viscosity and oxygen content decreased via de-moisturization, i.e., dehydration, as well as dehydroxylation, resulting in an increase in heating value. The heavy oil obtained from HDO with Ni/Al-SBA-15 exhibited a low water content (9.3 wt%), while that of Ni/SBA-15 revealed a high HHV (22.8 MJ kg-1), energy efficiency (62.8%), and degree of deoxygenation (54.9%). A major factor of bio/oil instability is unstable oxygen-containing compounds, such as acetic acid, furfural, vanillin and levoglucosan, which were obviously reduced in the heavy oil in this study. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a plant dry matter that could be considered as a renewable carbon resource for the production of reducing sugar, which is an alternative building block for biofuels and chemicals. However, due to the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic biomass, researchers have focused their efforts on establishing cost-efficient pretreatments to reutilize the lignocellulose components within the biomass effectively. In this study, divalent (CuCl2) and trivalent (FeCl3) inorganic salts were used in the recovery of xylose from the stalks of oil palm fronds (OPF). Additionally, oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide and sodium persulfate were tested for their effectiveness in improving inorganic salt pretreatment. By using inorganic salt alone, FeCl3outperformed CuCl2in terms of xylose recovery, in which 75.5 and 59.3% of xylose could be recovered from OPF using FeCl3and CuCl2, respectively. An incorporation of sodium persulfate with CuCl2enabled a maximum xylose recovery up to 72.0%, with no statistical difference as compared to using FeCl3alone. The synergism between CuCl2and sodium persulfate was attributed to the formation of unstable Cu3+ions, which acted as a trivalent salt. Characterization studies of the solid fraction before and after pretreatment also validated the delignification of OPF. Hence, the combination of CuCl2and sodium persulfate was able to attain sugar yields which were comparable with other conventional pretreatments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production using residual oil from palm oil mill effluent (POME) and crude lipase from oil palm fruit as the substrate and catalyst had a high biodiesel yield (92.07 ± 1.04%) under optimal conditions. POME is considered as an alternative source for oil because it contained high oil and grease content (5569.82 mg/L). Oil was extracted from POME by the soxhlet method using a mixture of hexane, methanol and acetone. Eighty percent of residual oil (4455 mg/L) was recovered from POME. Biodiesel production from crude lipase catalyst is an alternative method that is simple to perform and can be done at a low investment cost. In addition, biodiesel from residual oil using crude lipase catalyst was characterized according to ASTM standards. Most properties of biodiesel from crude lipase are acceptable, according to Thai biodiesel and ASTM standards. Low free fatty acid (0.07%) content was observed in enzymatic biodiesel. A high cloud point (10–13 °C) and cetane number (59.0–60.0) were also illustrated since a high cetane number is an important property used to qualify high quality biodiesel, POME biodiesel may possibly be used as a sole biofuel or blended with fossil fuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of wet biomass such as algae is a promising thermochemical process for the production of bio-oil. Bio-oil aqueous phase generated during liquefaction process is rich in complex organics and can be utilized for biogas production following its pre-treatment with granular activated carbon. In our study, use of 30% activated carbon resulted in higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction (53 ± 0.3%) from aqueous phase. Higher CH4 production (84 ± 12 mL/g COD) was also observed in 30% carbon-treated aqueous phase fed cultures, whereas only 32 ± 6 mL CH4/g COD was observed in control (non-carbon treated) cultures. The results from this study indicate that almost 67 ± 0.3% initial COD of aqueous phase can be reduced using a combination of both carbon treatment and biogas production. This study shows that aqueous phase can be utilized for CH4 production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Selectively cleaving the C=O bond of the aldehyde group in furfural is critical for converting this biomass-derived platform chemical to an important biofuel molecule, 2-methylfuran. This work combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements to investigate the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity of furfural on bimetallic surfaces prepared by modifying Pt(111) with 3d transition metals (Cu, Ni, Fe, and Co). The stronger binding energy of furfural and higher tilted degree of the furan ring on the Co-terminated bimetallic surface resulted in a higher activity for furfural HDO to produce 2-methylfuran in comparison to that on either Pt(111) or Pt-terminated PtCoPt(111). The 3d-terminated bimetallic surfaces with strongly oxophilic 3d metals (Co and Fe) showed higher 2-methylfuran yield in comparison to those surfaces modified with weakly oxophilic 3d metals (Cu and Ni). The effect of oxygen on the HDO selectivity was also investigated on oxygen-modified bimetallic surfaces, revealing that the presence of surface oxygen resulted in a decrease in 2-methylfuran yield. The combined theoretical and experimental results presented here should provide useful guidance for designing Pt-based bimetallic HDO catalysts. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The carbon efficiency of bioenergy systems is of critical importance in discussions pertaining to biomass availability for the displacement of petroleum. Classical carbohydrate fermentations to make simple alcohols are carbon inefficient as they discard 1/3 of biomass holocellulose as CO2. Biomass' lignin is typically burned for heat and power instead of liquid fuel, discarding another sizeable fraction of the biomass carbon. Carbon is the backbone element in hydrocarbon fuels and these losses limit full utilization of the carbon captured by photosynthesis. The DOE Billion-ton Study Update optimistically projects enough biomass carbon to cover 2/3 of the estimated fuel usage in the transportation sector by 2030. Fast pyrolysis combined with electrocatalytic energy upgrading using renewable electricity offers a more carbon-retentive pathway for biomass to renewable fuels. This fast pyrolysis-based sequence offers the added benefit of fixing atmospheric carbon in the form of biochar, which provides a mechanism for long-term carbon storage. An associated challenge is that the liquid "bio-oil" from biomass fast pyrolysis contains functional groups like carboxylic acids, carbonyls, and oxygenated aromatics. Their presence hinders the storage and transportation of bio-oil. We propose a potential solution with localized electrocatalytic hydrogenation as an immediate measure to stabilize bio-oil via oxygen removal and carbonyl saturation. Electrocatalytically stabilized bio-oil can be stored and/or transported to centralized refineries for further upgrading. Compared to microbial bioconversion, the strategy proposed here enables significantly higher yields of renewable hydrocarbon fuels and offers a large-scale mechanism for chemical storage of renewable but intermittently generated electrical energy as transportation fuel. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.

AB  - Particle resolved direct numerical simulation (PR-DNS) has emerged as a promising method to improve gas-particle heat transfer closure models. To date, this method has been applied in random and regular particle assemblies at comparably high void fractions. This paper presents a new methodology for deriving heat transfer correlations from PR-DNS of very dense particle packings relevant for packed bed applications. First particle packings were generated using the discrete element method (DEM). After geometric modifications in regions of close particle-particle proximity, a fine mesh with low cell skewness was created for PR-DNS. Grid independence and the effect of the geometry modification were thoroughly investigated. It was also established that steady state simulations are accurate for PR-DNS in this case. Simulations carried out in different assemblies of ∼100 particles showed significant variation of local transfer rates, implying that it is important to specify a confidence interval when reporting correlations derived from PR-DNS. A newly developed Nusselt number correlation predicts values in the lower range of predictions from literature correlations. This implies that the use of the currently available correlations may over-predict heat transfer in densely packed beds. © 2016

AB  - Municipal sewage sludge (SS) from wastewater treatment plant containing high water content (&gt;85 wt.%), lead to the difficulty of co-combustion with MSW or coal due to the high cost of drying. This study explores an alternative method by supercritical water (SCW) pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) in a high pressure reaction vessel. The effects of temperature and moisture content of SS on yield and composition of the products (bio-oil, bio char and non-condensable gas) were studied. A temperature of 385 °C and moisture content of 85 wt.% were found to be the optimum conditions for the maximum bio-oil production of 37.23 wt.%, with a higher heating value of 31.08 MJ/kg. In the optimum condition, the yields of aliphatic hydrocarbon and phenols were about 29.23 wt.% and 12.51 wt.%, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of bio-char were analyzed by using XRF and BET. Results of GC analyses of NCG showed that it has the maximum HHV of 13.39 MJ/m3 at 445 °C and moisture content of 85 wt.%. The reaction path from SS to bio-oil through SCW pyrolysis was given. Moreover, carbon balance was calculated for the optimal condition, and finding out that 64.27 wt.% of the carbon content was transferred from SS to bio-oil. Finally, this work demonstrates that the SCW pyrolysis is a promising disposal method for SS. © 2016

The samples B20 were prepared for each methyl ester obtained from Botryococcus braunii algal oil separately and then the cerium oxide nanoparticles were added to each B20 blend sample at the dosages of 50, 75, and 100 ppm with the aid of an ultrasonicator. Moreover, in the absence of any engine modifications, the emission characteristics of those blend samples have been investigated from the experimentally measured engine exhaust emissions of CO, CO2, O2, NO, and UHC.

AB  - Vapor-phase m-cresol hydrodeoxygenation rates on oxygenate-modified Mo2C catalysts prepared by pretreating fresh Mo2C catalysts in 1 kPa of O2, H2O, and CO2 at 333 K showed that (i) molecular oxygen has a higher propensity to deposit oxygen (O/Mobulk before HDO = 0.23 ± 0.02) on fresh Mo2C, compared to CO2 and H2O (O/Mobulk before HDO â‰ 0.036), as assessed from temperature-programmed surface reaction with H2, and (ii) oxygen adsorbed in amounts exceeding ∼0.06 ± 0.01 of O/Mobulk poisons the metal-like sites for toluene synthesis as inferred from a 10-fold decrease in toluene synthesis rate per gram on the O2-1 kPa (333 K)-Mo2C compared to that on fresh Mo2C, H2O-1 kPa (333 K)-Mo2C, and CO2-1 kPa (333 K)-Mo2C catalysts. Invariant turnover frequencies of toluene synthesis measured from in situ CO titration among the O2-, H2O-, and CO2-modified samples demonstrate that the effect of adsorbed oxygen is independent of the oxygen source. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydroxyalkylation/alkylation of biomass-derived 2-methylfuran with cyclic ketones (cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone) has great potential in synthesizing high-density biofuel. But the conversion and selectivity are still unsatisfactory because the in-situ formed water decreases the acidity of catalyst and induces side reaction. Herein, hydrophobic mesoporous resins with sulfonic acid group (PS) and fluoride sulfonic acid group (PCS) were synthesized by a simple solvothermal reaction and ion exchange treatment, which have good mesoporous structure with surface area of 300–700 m2/g. Notably, PS and PCS have better hydrophobicity and oleophilicity as compared to widely used sulfonic acid functional amberlyst-15 and fluoride sulfonic acid functional nafion-212.

AB  - The role of catalyst is essential in processes of upgrading biomass pyrolysis bio-oil into hydrocarbon biofuel. While the majority of heterogeneous catalytic processes are conducted in the presence of gas (nearly ideal) or liquid phase, a growing number of processes are utilizing supercritical fluids (SCFs) as reaction media. Although hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is proven a promising process for pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading to hydrocarbon biofuel, catalyst efficiency remains a challenge. Integrating heterogeneous catalysts with SCFs in a bio-oil HDO process was investigated in this study. Bifunctional Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts were firstly used to upgrade bio-oil to biofuel in supercritical methanol. The loading of Co and Zn did not change HZSM-5 crystalline structure. Physicochemical properties of biofuel produced by Co and/or Zn loaded HZSM-5 catalysts such as water content, total acid number, viscosity and higher heating value improved. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts showed enhanced reactions of decarboxylation and decarbonylation that resulted in higher yields of CO and CO2. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts were more effective for bio-oil HDO than monometallic Co/HZSM-5 or Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst which was attributed to the synergistic effect of Co and Zn on HZSM-5 support. Bimetallic Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts increased biofuel yields and hydrocarbons contents in biofuels in comparison with monometallic Co/HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts. 5%Co15%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst generated the highest biofuel yield at 22.13 wt.%, and 15%Co5%Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst produced biofuel with the highest hydrocarbons content at 35.33%. Hydrogenation and esterification are two dominant reactions in bio-oil HDO over Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts in supercritical methanol. The energy efficiency of biofuel product was 30.99–58.80% for Co-Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts. Co-Zn/HZSM-5 is a promising catalyst to produce biofuel with high quality in bio-oil HDO. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Black soldier fly, a high lipids containing insect, can be used as a new and viable biomass feed-stock, using organic matters (animal manure, restaurant waste, and fermentation straw) and increasing the overall biodiesel yield. This study proposed microwave extraction method to extract lipid from the insect for biodiesel production. The factors influencing the extraction yield % (w/w) were discussed in detail. Response surface methodology was used to investigate the effect of extraction conditions on the lipid extraction yield. The results obtained by statistical analysis showed that the quadratic model fits in the cases. Gas chromatography mass spectra of the obtained insect lipid revealed 22.54% oleic, 12.67% linoleic, and 6.45% palmitoleic acid in its composition. These compositional data were qualitatively confirmed with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermal gravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analyses of extracted lipid sample. The comparison of the insect fatty acids profile from the energy insect black soldier fly larvae with common biodiesel feed-stocks showed suitability of the insect for production of biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing energy demands, decreasing fossil fuel resources, instability of crude oil prices and pollution problems have compelled to switch over bio-based fuel for transportation, for example, biodiesel. In present study, waste cooking oil (WCO) was evaluated as feedstock for biodiesel production using free lipase in liquid. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the interaction between four factors: the reaction temperature, methanol-oil molar ratio, dosage of lipase as biocatalyst and rotational speed. Using this method, the model predicted the optimal conditions reaching up to 86% FAME yield with temperature 44.2 °C, methanol-oil molar ratio (3.05:1), amount of lipase 0.782 g and rotation speed of 170 rpm with incubation period of 24 h. The reactions carried out under optimized conditions confirmed the validity of the model. The use of WCO in lipase catalyzed process can diminish the cost of biodiesel production and will allow lowering the direct use of edible oils to produce biodiesel instead. Thus, present study shows great practical potential to replace fossil fuel with renewable fuel (biodiesel). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The utilization of industrial waste streams as input materials for bio-mediated production processes constitutes a current R&D objective not only to reduce process costs at the input side but in parallel, to minimize hazardous environmental emissions. In this context, the EU-funded project ANIMPOL elaborated a process for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers starting from diverse waste streams of the animal processing industry. This article provides a detailed economic analysis of PHA production from this waste biorefinery concept, encompassing the utilization of low-quality biodiesel, offal material and meat and bone meal (MBM). Techno-economic analysis reveals that PHA production cost varies from 1.41 €/kg to 1.64 €/kg when considering offal on the one hand as waste, or, on the other hand, accounting its market price, while calculating with fixed costs for the co-products biodiesel (0.97 €/L) and MBM (350 €/t), respectively. The effect of fluctuating market prices for offal materials, biodiesel, and MBM on the final PHA production cost as well as the investment payback time have been evaluated. Depending on the current market situation, the calculated investment payback time varies from 3.25 to 4.5 years. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The understanding of lignin softening and pyrolysis is important for developing lignocellulosic biorefinery in order to produce carbon fibers, polymers additives, green aromatics, or biofuels. Protobind lignin (produced by soda pulping of a wheat straw) was characterized by thermogravimetry, calorimetry (for glass transition temperature and heat of pyrolysis reactions), in situ 1H NMR (for the analysis of the mobility of protons upon lignin thermal conversion), and solution-state 13C and 31P NMR (determination of functional groups in lignin). In situ rheology reveals the real-time viscoelastic behavior of lignin as a function of temperature. Upon heating, lignin undergoes softening, through glass transition overlapped with depolymerization, and is followed by the solidification of the softened material by cross-linking reactions. The lignin residues were quenched within the rheometer at the midpoint temperatures of softening and solidification regions and were further analyzed by elemental analysis, GPC-UV of acetylated THF soluble fractions, FTIR, solid 13C NMR, and laser desorption ionization (LDI) combined with very high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). We present the first report on lignin biochars analysis by LDI-HRMS. NMR and FTIR analyses provide the evolution of functional moieties in lignin residues. 13C NMR, GPC-UV, and LDI FTICRMS analyses depict the depolymerization mechanism combined with cross-linking and demethoxylation reactions. An overall physical and chemical mechanism for the thermal conversion of alkali lignin is proposed based on these complementary analyses. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising direction. This study characterized the products and investigated the elemental migration during the HTL of cornstalk at seven different operation temperatures (210–375 °C). The biocrude oil yield significantly increased from 7.04% (210 °C) to 23.32% (290 °C) as the temperature increased, and decreased to 21.07% when further increased to 375 °C. A carbon recovery of 11.03–38.69%, and a hydrogen recovery of 7.77–25.61% were achieved in the biocrude oil. Hydrogen (27.87–70.94%) and nitrogen (74.56–81.76%) were effectively recovered in the aqueous phase. GC–MS, HPLC, TGA and FT-IR analysis indicated that major organic compounds in the biocrude oil were interestingly similar between 210 °C and 270 °C. The identified compounds included hydrocarbons, esters and carboxylic acid. The calculative yields of biocrude, hydrogen, methane and biochar reached 7.04–23.32, 0.07–0.29, 7.12–12.08 and 3.01–22.42 t/100 t cornstalks, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Eucalyptus globulus stumps has been used as biofuel for energy production. However, forest biomass presents some disadvantages (high moisture, volatiles and oxygen contents, hydrophilic nature, low calorific value, bulk density and energy density). To overcome this, torrefaction and pelletisation were tested. Based on the assays, 250 °C and 30 min were selected as the best conditions for the torrefaction. The summative chemical analysis has shown that torrefied stumps presented higher total extractives and lignin content and lower monosaccharides in relation to raw stumps. Eucalyptus stumps were also densified to produce pellets of raw and torrefied material. The materials obtained by the different pre-treatments studied were gasified in a fluidised bed reactor. Gasification gas obtained with raw stumps was compared to those obtained with pre-treated stumps by pelletisation (or densification), torrefaction and torrefaction followed by pelletisation. The results obtained showed that bio-syngas was improved when torrefied biomass was used, as there was an increase in gas yield and CGE (Cold Gas Efficiency) and lower tar were produced. The best pre-treatment for eucalyptus stumps was densification after torrefaction, as at 850 °C, gas yield was about 1.22 Nl/g daf and CGE was around 65%. This syngas contained around 38% of H2, 27% of both CO and CO2 and 5% of CH4. © 2017

AB  - Pyrolysis is one of important pathways to convert microalgae to liquid biofuels and key components of microalgae have different chemical composition and structure, which provides a barrier for large-scale microalgae-based liquid biofuel application. Microalgae component pyrolysis mechanism should be researched to optimal pyrolysis process parameters. In this study, single pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of microalgal components (model compounds castor oil, soybean protein and glucose) were conducted to reveal interaction between them by thermogrametric analysis and bio-crude evaluation. Castor oil (model compound of lipid) has higher pyrolysis temperature than other model compounds and has the maximum contribution to bio-crude formation. Bio-crude from soybean protein has higher N-heterocyclic compounds as well as phenols, which could be important aromatic hydrocarbon source during biorefineries and alternative aviation biofuel production. Potential interaction pathways based on model compounds are recommended including further decomposition of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) and surfactant synthesis, which indicate that glucose played an important role on pyrolysis of microalgal protein and lipid components. The results should provide necessary information for microalgae pyrolysis process optimization and large-scale pyrolysis reactor design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study addresses wet in situ transesterification of microalgae for the production of biodiesel by introducing ethyl acetate as both reactant and co-solvent. Ethyl acetate and acid catalyst are mixed with wet microalgae in one pot and the mixture is heated for simultaneous lipid extraction and transesterification. As a single reactant and co-solvent, ethyl acetate can provide higher FAEE yield and more saccharification of carbohydrates than the case of binary ethanol and chloroform as a reactant and a co-solvent. The optimal yield was 97.8 wt% at 114 °C and 4.06 M catalyst with 6.67 ml EtOAC/g dried algae based on experimental results and response surface methodology (RSM). This wet in situ transesterification of microalgae using ethyl acetate doesn't require an additional co-solvent and it also promises more economic benefit as combining extraction and transesterification in a single process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the potentials of pretreated and untreated Carica papayas fruit peels for biogas generation was evaluated alongside its process optimization after employing the combination of mechanical and thermo-alkaline pretreatment methods. The peel was anaerobically digested using a consortium of microorganisms from cattle rumen content as inoculum. A batch system designed by the Central Composite Design (CCD) was employed. The physicochemical and microbial characteristics of the substrates and inoculum as well as the constituent of the generated biogas were evaluated using standard methods and results showed elevated levels of most elements after anaerobic digestion. The most feasible experimental biogas yields were 0.1839 m3/kg VS and 0.1361 m3/kg VS for the pretreated and untreated experiments respectively. Microbiologically, members of the genus Clostridium dominated the microbial flora and their succession patterns were affected by temperature and pH. The methane and carbon dioxide content of biogas from both experiments were 61.5± 2.5%; 24± 1% and 52 ± 2%; 25± 1.5% respectively. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were employed in data optimization. Based on the optimized values, the predicted biogas yield for RSM was 0.1895 m3/kg VS and 0.1839 m3/kg VS for ANNs in the pretreated experiment. For the experiment without pretreatment, the RSM predicted yield was 0.1361 m3/kg VS while that of ANNs was 0.1392 m3/kg VS. In all, there was a 26.5% increase in predicted biogas yield in the pretreated experiment over the untreated. Further usage of pawpaw peels for biofuels generation is advocated. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Current trends in diesel transport anticipate that in the upcoming future a range of renewable fuels will be necessary to comply with emission and sustainability legislations. Exhaust after-treatment devices such as diesel particulate filters –DPFs– will have to operate satisfactorily with this pool of biofuels. In particular, DPF regeneration is crucial to cut the fuel penalty and guarantee an acceptable lifetime for this device. In the present work, an automotive diesel engine was run with fossil fuel and three renewable fuels: a conventional biodiesel, a fuel manufactured through Fischer-Tropsch –FT– process and a HVO biofuel. The DPF was loaded and regenerated through an active process with fuel post-injections. Additionally, soot samples were investigated with thermo-gravimetry (TGA) and calorimetry (DSC) to confirm whether these techniques obtain relevant information for explaining DPF behavior. Both methods proved that biodiesel leads to a more economical regeneration being the biodiesel soot, more reactive than the other samples, the main reason. DPF regenerations with paraffinic fuels (FT-derived and HVO) did not reveal strong differences compared to diesel, though TGA and DSC results suggested that soot from paraffinic biofuels is more reactive than that from diesel. The exhaust gas temperature and composition are behind this apparent discrepancy. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Sono-sulfated zirconia nanocatalyst supported on MCM-41 was prepared by an ultrasound-assisted impregnation/hydrothermal hybrid method. The effect of irradiation power was studied by changing power of the sonication (30, 60 and 90 W) during the synthesis which led to different physiochemical properties of the nanocatalyst. XRD, FESEM, EDX, FTIR and BET analyses exhibited smaller particles with higher surface area and less population of particle aggregates at highly irradiated nanocatalysts. The nanocatalyst irradiated at 90 W for 30 min showed a very narrow particle size distribution. About 59% of nanocatalyst particles were in the range of 1–30 nm. The performance of investigated nanocatalysts in biodiesel production from sunflower oil showed ultrasound-assisted synthesized nanocatalysts had higher conversion in comparison to non-sonicated catalyst. Biodiesel conversion in catalyst with 90 W and 30 min ultrasonic irradiation exceeded 96.9% under constant condition at 60 °C reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1 and 5% catalyst concentration. After five cycles, biodiesel conversion of non-sonicated catalyst was well maintained in a high extend (71.4%) while biodiesel conversion of non-sonicated catalyst barely reached to 43.5%. Among sonicated nanocatalysts, with increasing power of irradiation, the nanocatalyst represented higher conversion and reusability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The formation of nitrogen-containing compounds in bio-oil during microwave pyrolysis of Chlorella and Spirulina microalgae has been investigated in this study. Activated carbon (AC) and magnetite (Fe3O4) were used as microwave receptors during microwave pyrolysis experiments. It has been found that the use of Fe3O4 increased the total yield of bio-oil. The use of different microwave receptors did not seem to have affected the total yield of nitrogen-containing compounds in the bio-oil. However, Fe3O4 promoted the formation of nitrogen-containing aliphatics, thereby reducing the formation of nitrogen-containing aromatics. The use of AC promoted the dehydration reactions during amino acid decomposition, thereby enhancing the formation of nitrogen-containing aromatics during pyrolysis. From the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis results, the major high-value nitrogen-containing compounds in the pyrolysis bio-oil of Chlorella and Spirulina were identified as indole and dodecamide. The formation mechanisms of nitrogen-containing compounds were proposed and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, we address the optimal design of an integrated microalgae-based biorefinery through the formulation of a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for the production of biodiesel and potential high-added value products. Main bioproducts are poly (hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and astaxanthin. A combined heat and power cycle to transform biogas generated by the anaerobic digestion of waste streams is also included in the superstructure. Mass and energy balances are formulated for the biorefinery. Different alternatives for PHB extraction are taken into account. The anaerobic digestion model accounts for detailed composition of the different feed streams. Detailed capital cost models for process equipment are formulated and implemented in GAMS to maximize net present value (NPV). Results show that the production of astaxanthin and PHB provides a way to make biodiesel production economically feasible. Open pond and surfactant-chelate are selected for microalgae cultivation and PHB extraction method, respectively. Biodiesel price can be reduced to $0.48 due to incomes from astaxanthin and PHB sales. Also, an economic sensitivity analysis is performed. Further comparison between domestic and international cost conditions is carried out, showing higher NPV in the domestic case. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production was catalyzed by a novel magnetic carbonaceous acid (Zr-CMC-SO3H@3Fe-C400) with both Brønsted and Lewis sites synthesized by a four-step method: (i) metal (Fe) ion chelation, (ii) calcination, (iii) metal (Zr) ion chelation and embedding, and (iv) sulfonation. It catalyzed the esterification of oleic acid with 97% biodiesel yield, transesterification of high acid value (AV) soybean oil with 95% biodiesel yield, and pretreatment of Jatropha oil with AV reduced from 17.2 to 0.7 mg KOH/g. Biodiesel yields (&gt;90%) at 90 °C for 4 h reaction time were obtained for ten cycles by easy magnetic separation which showed potential practical applications in the field of green production. The synthesized catalyst was characterized with elemental analysis, XRD, ICP-OES, FT-IR, BET, VSM, SEM-EDX, HRTEM, TG-DSC and Boehm titration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One-step and Two-step methods were studied for lipid extraction from wet and unbroken (water content is 65–67%) Chlorella sp. and Chlorococcum sp. (GN38) using deep eutectic solvent (DES) treated microalgae cells. Further we optimized the extraction process and studied on its underlying mechanism. Among all DES, Choline chloride-Acetic acid (Ch-Aa) DES treatment showed optimal conditions at the mass ratio of DES: methanol-H2SO4 (2.00%) mixture: algae biomass was 60:40:3 with reaction time was 60 min, and the optimum temperature was 110 °C (Chlorococcum sp.) and 130 °C (Chlorella sp.) respectively. The total content of FAME by One-step method with DES treatment was improved by 30% compared with Two-step method. This process is effective on wet and unbroken paste of microalgae biomass, so the FAME extracted using one-step with DES process is feasible for microalgae based biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-situ catalytic upgrading of bio-oils derived from the fast pyrolysis of cellulose, lignin or sunflower stalk over Mg-doped Al-MCM-41 was investigated in details. It is found that Mg species with doping amounts ranged between 0.25 and 10 wt.% was well dispersed on Al-MCM-41, and that doping Mg on Al-MCM-41 effectively adjusted the acidity and basicity of the catalysts, resulting in significant improvement of bio-oil quality. Mg/Al-MCM-41 exhibited high selective conversion of bio-oils derived from cellulose, lignin or sunflower stalk to high value-added aromatic hydrocarbons via catalytic cracking, deoxygenation and aromatization. In the upgraded bio-oil, the relative total hydrocarbon amount reached up to approximately ≥80%, which consisted of aromatic hydrocarbon approximately 76% and aliphatic hydrocarbon approximately 4% for all feedstocks. The selectivity to the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) such as benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTXs) increased while the coke formed on the catalyst decreased with the increase in Mg doping amount. 1 wt.% Mg/Al-MCM-41 resulted in the highest relative total hydrocarbon amount in the upgraded bio-oil at lower catalytic deoxygenation temperature, and showed stable reusability for at least 5 cycles. It is expected that Mg/Al-MCM-41 can be widely applied for bio-oil upgrading in a practical process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel solid base catalyst derived from gasified straw slag for producing biodiesel was prepared by simple pulverization and sieving. This catalyst exhibited high stability, low leaching of the catalytic species, and good catalytic activity, caused by high-temperature melting in the biomass gasifier. SiO2, CaO, K2O, MgO, FeO, and Al2O3were the common constituents (calculated as oxides) as per XRF analysis and EA. XRD and TEM-EDS analysis indicated that the catalyst comprises three crystallites: quartz, leucite, and åkermanite. The catalyst was strongly basic with a basic site concentration of 0.3974 mmol⋅g−1, including strongly basic low-coordination oxygen anions, moderately basic OH groups, and metal–oxygen pairs, as identified by CO2-TPD and IR. TGA results indicated that the catalyst is thermally stable up to 400 °C, which is greater than the typical reaction temperature. BET analysis results indicated that the slag exhibits a broad pore distribution with pore diameters of 5–15 and 45–75 nm. The catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity and stability, exhibiting a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) conversion of 95% for transesterification conducted at 200 °C for 8 h with a catalyst dose of 20% and a methanol–oil molar ratio of 12:1. The FAME conversion remained greater than 85% even after reusing the catalyst for 33 reactions without any appreciable loss of catalytic activity. Small amounts of K and Mg (&lt;10 ppm) leached into the product from the catalyst. These results indicated that the gasified straw slag catalyst demonstrates promise for producing biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of dried sewage sludge is regarded as an effective treatment method as well as a promising technology for energy/fuel production. In this work, thermochemical conversion of dried sewage sludge in a continuous reactor at different pyrolysis temperatures (400-800 °C) and solid residence times (6-46 min) was conducted. The pyrolysis products obtained using different pyrolysis conditions were extensively investigated. It is indicated that high pyrolysis temperature (&gt;700 °C) and long solid residence time (&gt;23 min) could enhance secondary reactions and decrease the yield of bio-oil. The maximum yield of bio-oil of 16.69% was achieved at reaction temperature of 700 °C and solid residence time of 23 min. The FTIR and GC-MS analyses of the bio-oil obtained at optimum condition indicated that it contained large amounts of phenols and esters. H2 and CO2 were the main components of pyrolysis gas, with a total amount that exceeded 52.18%. The characteristics of the char, including elemental composition, functional groups, and combustion property were investigated by XRF, FTIR, and TG. FTIR analysis of the char showed that the main functional groups are M-X, C-O, and C-H. The volatile content in the char decreased with an increase of pyrolysis temperature, while it increased with an increase of solid residence time. Heavy metals distribution in pyrolysis products of dried sewage sludge were investigated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The results showed that most of the heavy metals remained in char. In addition, the potential ecological risk assessment of heavy metals was assessed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biocrude from hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass provides a sustainable source from which to produce chemicals and fuels. However, just as for fossil crude, the chemical complexity of the biocrude impedes the characterization and hence identification of market potentials for both biocrude and individual fractions. Here, we reveal how fractional distillation of a biocrude can leverage biocrude characterization beyond state-of-the-art and uncover the full biocrude potential. By distillation combined with detailed individual analysis of the distillate fractions and distillation residue, more than 85% of the total biocrude composition is determined. It is demonstrated that a total mass fraction of 48.2% of the biocrude is volatile below 350 °C, comprising mainly value-added marketable ketones, oxygenated aromatics and prospective liquid fuel candidates, which are easily fractionated according to boiling points. Novel, high resolution pyr-GCxGC-MS analysis of the residue indicates a high molecular weight aromatic structure, valuable for bio-materials production or for further processing into fuels. The distillate fractions are mildly hydrotreated to show the fuel and chemical precursor potential of the volatile components. This results in the formation of mainly hydrocarbons and added-value phenolics. This work takes a significant step by going beyond the biocrude as an intermediate bulk energy product and addressing actual applications and pathways to these. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of biodiesel was carried out from canola oil and methanol catalysed by lipase from Candida rugosa under different ultrasonic experimental conditions using horn (20 kHz) and plate (22, 44, 98 and 300 kHz) transducers. The effects of experimental conditions such as horn tip diameter, ultrasonic power, ultrasonic frequency and enzyme concentrations on biodiesel yield were investigated. The results showed that the application of ultrasound decreased the reaction time from 22-24 h to 1.5 h with the use of 3.5 cm ultrasonic horn, an applied power of 40 W, methanol to oil molar ratio of 5:1 and enzyme concentration of 0.23 wt/wt% of oil. Low intensity ultrasound is efficient and a promising tool for the enzyme catalysed biodiesel synthesis as higher intensities tend to inactivate the enzyme and reduce its efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding of the fundamental chemistry of lignin macromolecules in lignocellulosic biomass will facilitate the further development of renewable biofuel and biomaterial production. In the present study, to thoroughly delineate the detailed structural characteristics of the native lignin in the three major Eucalyptus woods, MWL, CEL, and EHL preparations were sequentially isolated from the diverse Eucalyptus wood. Parallelly, a modified enzyme lignin (DEL) based on double ball-milling and enzymatic hydrolysis was also prepared with superhigh yield (102.5-109.5%) from same Eucalyptus wood. The structural characteristics of all the lignin preparations were elaborately investigated by HPAEC, GPC, and NMR techniques (2D-HSQC and 31P NMR). Results showed that the contents of different substructures (β-O-4, β-β, β-5, and β-1) and S/G ratios of lignin macromolecules varied among these Eucalyptus species. As compared to the β-O-4 content in the extracted lignins (MWLs and CELs, 44.5-60.2/100Ar), the residual lignins (EHLs and DELs) exhibited a higher content of β-O-4 linkages (59.1-64.3/100Ar). DEL preparations can be served as "lignin preparation" to develop a depolymerization strategy of lignin due to the higher content of β-O-4 linkages and abundant syringyl units. Moreover, the sufficient understanding of lignin will facilitate subsequent process of these Eucalyptus species for producing of biochemicals, bioenergy, and biomaterials. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Robust nanoarchitectures based on surfactant-free ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) (2.7–8.2±0.5 nm) have been developed by using the incipient wetness impregnation method with subsequent reduction of PdII species encaged in the 1,3,5-triazine-functionalized nitrogen-rich porous organic polymer (POP) by employing NaBH4, HCHO, and H2 reduction routes. The Pd-POP materials prepared by the three different synthetic methods consist of virtually identical chemical compositions but have different physical and texture properties. Strong metal–support interactions, the nanoconfinement effect of POP, and the homogeneous distribution of Pd NPs have been investigated by performing 13C cross-polarization (CP) solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, FTIR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), along with wide-angle powder XRD, N2 physisorption, high-resolution (HR)-TEM, high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping spectroscopic studies. The resulting Pd-POP based materials exhibit highly efficient catalytic performance with superior stability in promoting biomass refining (hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin, a typical compound of lignin-derived bio-oil). Outstanding catalytic performance (≈98 % conversion of vanillin with exclusive selectivity for hydrogenolysis product 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) has been achieved over the newly designed Pd-POP catalyst under the optimized reaction conditions (140 °C, 10 bar H2 pressure), affording a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 8.51 h−1 and no significant drop in catalytic activity with desired product selectivity has been noticed for ten successive catalytic cycles, demonstrating the excellent stability and reproducibility of this catalyst system. A size- and location-dependent catalytic performance for the Pd NPs with small size (1.31±0.36 and 2.71±0.25 nm) has been investigated in vanillin hydrodeoxygenation reaction with our newly designed Pd-POP catalysts. The presence of well-dispersed electron-rich metallic Pd sites and highly rigid cross-linked amine-functionalized POP framework with high surface area is thought to be responsible for the high catalytic activity and improvement in catalyst stability. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biofuels of the second generation can contribute significantly to the replacement of the currently used fossil energy carriers for transportation fuel production. The lignocellulosic biomass residues used do not compete with food and feed production, but have to be collected from wide-spread areas for industrial large-scale use. The two-stage gasification concept bioliq offers a solution to this problem. It aims at the conversion of low-grade residual biomass from agriculture and forestry into synthetic fuels and chemicals. Central element of the bioliq process development is the 2–5 MW pilot plant along the complete process chain: fast pyrolysis for pretreatment of biomass to obtain an energy dense, liquid intermediate fuel, high-pressure entrained flow gasification providing low methane synthesis gas free of tar, hot synthesis gas cleaning to separate acid gases, and contaminants as well as methanol/dimethyl ether and subsequent following gasoline synthesis. After construction and commissioning of the individual process steps with partners from industry, first production of synthetic fuel was successfully achieved in 2014. In addition to pilot plant operation for technology demonstration, a research and development network has been established providing the scientific basis for optimization and further development of the bioliq process as well as to explore new applications of the technologies and products involved.

AB  - The Jeotgalicoccus sp. peroxygenase cytochrome P450 OleTJE (CYP152L1) is a hydrogen peroxide-driven oxidase that catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of fatty acids, producing terminal alkenes with applications as fine chemicals and biofuels. Understanding mechanisms that favor decarboxylation over fatty acid hydroxylation in OleTJE could enable protein engineering to improve catalysis or to introduce decarboxylation activity into P450s with different substrate preferences. In this manuscript, we have focused on OleTJE active site residues Phe79, His85, and Arg245 to interrogate their roles in substrate binding and catalytic activity. His85 is a potential proton donor to reactive iron-oxo species during substrate decarboxylation. The H85Q mutant substitutes a glutamine found in several peroxygenases that favor fatty acid hydroxylation. H85Q OleTJE still favors alkene production, suggesting alternative protonation mechanisms. However, the mutant undergoes only minor substrate binding-induced heme iron spin state shift toward high spin by comparison with WT OleTJE, indicating the key role of His85 in this process. Phe79 interacts with His85, and Phe79 mutants showed diminished affinity for shorter chain (C10-C16) fatty acids and weak substrate-induced high spin conversion. F79A OleTJE is least affected in substrate oxidation, whereas the F79W/Y mutants exhibit lower stability and cysteine thiolate protonation on reduction. Finally, Arg245 is crucial for binding the substrate carboxylate, and R245E/L mutations severely compromise activity and heme content, although alkene products are formed from some substrates, including stearic acid (C18:0). The results identify crucial roles for the active site amino acid trio in determining OleTJE catalytic efficiency in alkene production and in regulating protein stability, heme iron coordination, and spin state. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - This study investigated the operation of ex-situ biological methanation at two thermophilic temperatures (55 °C and 65 °C). Methane composition of 85–88% was obtained and volumetric productivities of 0.45 and 0.4 L CH4/L reactor were observed at 55 °C and 65 °C after 24 h respectively. It is postulated that at 55 °C the process operated as a mixed culture as the residual organic substrates in the starting inoculum were still available. These were consumed prior to the assessment at 65 °C; thus the methanogens were now dependent on gaseous substrates CO2 and H2. The experiment was repeated at 65 °C with fresh inoculum (a mixed culture); methane composition and volumetric productivity of 92% and 0.46 L CH4/L reactor were achieved in 24 h. Methanothermobacter species represent likely and resilient candidates for thermophilic biogas upgrading. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents first optimization report on pyrolysis oil derived from Napier grass. Effects of temperature, heating rate and nitrogen flow rate on the intermediate pyrolysis of Napier grass biomass in a vertical fixed-bed tubular reactor were investigated collectively. Response surface methodology with central composite design was used for modelling the process and optimization of the process variables. Individual second order polynomial model was found to be adequate in predicting bio-oil, bio-char and non-condensable gas yield. The optimum bio-oil yield of 50.57 wt% was recorded at 600 °C, 50 °C/min and 5 L/min nitrogen flow. The bio-oil obtained throughout this study was two-phase liquid, organic and aqueous phase. The bio-oil, bio-char and non-condensable gas were characterized using standard analytical techniques. The results revealed that the organic phase consists of hydrocarbons and various benzene derivatives, which can be further processed into fuels and valuable chemicals. The aqueous phase was predominantly water, acids, ketones, aldehydes and some phenolics and other water-soluble organics. The non-condensable gas was made up high hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio suitable for liquid fuel synthesis via Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis. The bio-char was a porous carbonaceous material with high energy content, which can be applied as a solid fuel, adsorbent or source of biofertilizer. This study demonstrated that Napier grass biomass is a viable feedstock for production of high-value bioenergy precursors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main problems of the conventional biodiesel production technology are high production costs and energy consumption, long residence time, and low efficiency. In order to overcome those problems and to improve the biodiesel production process from the ecological and economical points of view, intensive research activities on the development of new, sustainable technologies are undergone. Microreactors are known to increase the dispersion of two phases considerably as needed for the biodiesel reactants (alcohol and oil). This provides much higher interface area that by elimination of mass-transfer hindrance has shown to lead to shorter reaction time. On this background, this study gives (a) an overview of today's industrial biodiesel production, (b) the vision of small-scaled, intensified (micro) flow reactors as integral element in translatable biodiesel factories, (c) the advantages and disadvantages of the lipase catalysed transesterification process in microreactors as chosen case of study, and (d) cost analysis of biodiesel production for the showcase estimating the performance of industrial-scale in enzyme packed-bed microreactors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

A bio-oil yield of 66.3 wt% with an average molecular weight of 822 g/mol and an aromatic monomer content of 6.1 wt% was achieved at 350 °C and a FA-to-lignin mass ratio of 3 after a reaction time of 60 min. The combination of Ru/C and FA also resulted in a significant reduction in the oxygen content of the bio-oil by ∼60% and a corresponding increase in the higher heating value (HHV) to 32.7 MJ/kg due to the enhanced hydrodeoxygenation activity. An examination of the FA decomposition characteristics revealed that Ru/C provides a greater increase in the rate of hydrogen production from FA, explaining the efficient depolymerization of lignin in a combined system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work demonstrated that triglycerides based vegetable oils were directly converted into cycloparaffinic and aromatic components in jet fuel by a three-step process. This process involved the catalytic cracking of vegetable oils into light aromatics over the zeolite catalyst (HZSM-5(80)), followed by the aromatic alkylation of light aromatics using the ionic liquid of [bmim]Cl-2AlCl3 and the hydrogenation of aromatics over the Pd/AC catalyst. The production of C8–C15 aromatics with an 86.2 wt% in the aromatic biofuel was achieved by the room temperature alkylation at 25 °C for 30 min. The carbon number distribution in the resulting biofuels was readily adjustable to the desired range by varying the reaction time. The aromatic and cycloparaffinic biofuels obtained basically meet the requirements of jet fuels based on the combustion heat, the H/C mol ratio and the average molecular formulation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the current study, palm kernel oil was used as a renewable feedstock for production of jet fuel-like hydrocarbons via the deoxygenation over the Ni-MoS2/γ-Al2O3catalyst. The dominant C12 fatty acid content in palm kernel oil makes it promising for jet fuel application. Synthesized by a liquid processing method with thiourea organosulfur agent, the catalyst revealed MoS2structure with low stacking, while Ni substitution in the MoS2structure and interaction with the Al2O3support were determined based on the Ni K-edge XANES and EXAFS results. A high hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity, which as the major pathway in the deoxygenation, was observed upon application of a H2pressure of 30–50 bar over Ni-MoS2/γ-Al2O3. The optimum product yield of approximately 92% was obtained mainly from the HDO pathway (∼60%) with 58% selectivity to C10–C12 jet fuel hydrocarbons. The flow property of the jet fuel-like hydrocarbons was more desirable than those obtained from palm olein oil-derived fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hierarchical ZSM-5 and Beta zeolites, loaded with MgO and ZnO, have been explored for the catalytic fast-pyrolysis of eucalyptus woodchips. These materials exhibit a high dispersion of the MgO or ZnO phases, which is probably due to the presence of a hierarchical porosity with both micro- and mesopores in the zeolitic supports. The incorporation of these metal oxides led to a significant reduction in the textural properties and to changes in the acidic properties of the parent zeolites. Thus, a decrease in the concentration of Brønsted acid sites was observed, which was accompanied by the generation of additional Lewis acid sites with medium strength. In addition, the incorporation of metal oxide promotes the formation of significant amount of basic sites, especially for the samples loaded with MgO. Catalytic fast pyrolysis experiments of eucalyptus woodchips were performed in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C and atmospheric pressure under a nitrogen flow. In comparison with non-catalytic fast pyrolysis, the use of zeolitic catalysts caused a decrease in the bio-oil* (water free basis bio-oil) production due to enhanced formation of gases, as well as coke deposition on the catalyst. However, the quality of the bio-oil* was enhanced since the catalysts were able to decrease its oxygen content. In this way, h-ZSM-5-based catalysts showed a clearly deeper deoxygenation degree compared to those having h-Beta as support, with very low content of anhydro sugars and the formation of a significant amount of aromatics. Regarding the effect of the metal oxide phase, MgO-loaded samples provided bio-oil* with enhanced energy yields and lower oxygen content, probably due to the adequate balance of Lewis acid and basic sites. Likewise, significant differences were observed among the catalysts regarding the deoxygenation pathways and the compounds families present in the bio-oil*. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The present study is aimed to investigate the upgrading of beech sawdust pyrolysis bio-oil through catalytic cracking of its vapors over Fe-modified ZSM-5 zeolite in a fixed bed tubular reactor. The zeolite supported iron catalyst was successfully prepared with varying metal loading ratios (1, 5, 10 wt%) via dry impregnation method and further characterized by BET, XRD, and SEM-EDX techniques. TG/FT-IR/MS analysis was used for the detection of biomass thermal degradation. Product yields of non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis experiments were determined and the obtained results show that bio-oil yields decreased in the presence of catalysts. Besides, the bio-oil composition is characterized by GC/MS. It was indicated that the entity of the ZSM-5 and Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst reveal a significant enhancement quality of the pyrolysis products in comparison with non-catalytic experiment. The catalyst increased oxygen removal from the organic phase of bio-oil and further developed the production of desirable products such as phenolics and aromatic compounds. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Catalytic steam gasification of palm kernel shell is investigated to optimize operating parameters for hydrogen and syngas production using TGA-MS setup. RSM is used for experimental design and evaluating the effect of temperature, particle size, CaO/biomass ratio, and coal bottom ash wt% on hydrogen and syngas. Hydrogen production appears highly sensitive to all factors, especially temperature and coal bottom ash wt%. In case of syngas, the order of parametric influence is: CaO/biomass &gt; coal bottom ash wt% &gt; temperature &gt; particle size. The significant catalytic effect of coal bottom ash is due to the presence of Fe2O3, MgO, Al2O3, and CaO. A temperature of 692 °C, coal bottom ash wt% of 0.07, CaO/biomass of 1.42, and particle size of 0.75 mm are the optimum conditions for augmented yield of hydrogen and syngas. The production of hydrogen and syngas is 1.5% higher in the pilot scale gasifier as compared to TGA-MS setup. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of nickel-alumina co-precipitated catalysts with varying nickel loading in the range (0–100 wt% nickel) was prepared under close control of the preparation parameters. The catalysts were characterized using nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, NH3-TPD, XRD, XPS, SEM and HRTEM. They were tested for the selective deoxygenation (SDO) of sunflower oil into hydrocarbons in the diesel range under solvent-free conditions at 310 °C and hydrogen pressure of 40 bar for various reaction times up to 9 h using a semi-batch reactor and a “volume of oil (ml)/mass of catalyst (g)” ratio equal to 100. The products were analyzed using GS and GC–MS. The preparative procedure resulted to high specific surface area mesoporous materials with nanocrystals of nickel phases in close contact with alumina nanograins, thus providing high nickel surface area. Normal-alkanes in the diesel range were produced whereas intermediate stearic acid and esters of fatty acids have been also detected. Considerable amounts of high molecular weight esters (intermediate products) are formed during SDO under solvent free conditions. Propane, ethane, methane, CO, and CO2have been also detected in the gas phase. The conversion of sunflower oil and the total yield to hydrocarbons increases with the nickel content up to the sample containing 60 wt% nickel (yield to hydrocarbons equal to 61 wt%) and then it decreases. The nickel active surface correlates very well with the total yield to hydrocarbons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this research work, liquid bio-fuels and activated carbons were produced from one non-edible feedstock, fish waste. First, the fish oil was extracted from fish waste and transesterified with methanol and ethanol to produce methylic and ethylic biodiesels, respectively using potassium hydroxide as base catalyst. The fuel properties of the obtained biodiesels met the specifications stipulated by ASTM D 6751. Therefore, waste fish oil can be utilized as a potential non-edible feedstock for biodiesel production. The de-oiled fish was pyrolyzed in a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor to produce bio-oil and bio-char. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time and particle size of the precursor on the bio-oil yield was investigated. The maximum bio-oil yield of 57.13% w/w was produced at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, 60 min pyrolysis time and particle size of 0.25 mm. The chemical composition of the bio-oil was studied using the elemental analysis, column chromatography, FTIR spectroscopy and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The physical and chemical properties of the bio-fuel obtained were determined and found close to those of bio-oils published in literature. It was concluded that de-oiled fish waste bio-oil can be potentially utilized as a fuel and chemical feedstock. The bio-char obtained as a result of the pyrolysis of de-oiled fish waste at 500 °C was used in the preparation of the activated carbon via steam activation method. The influence of the activation temperature, activation time and particles size on the yield, iodine adsorption number and surface area of the produced activated carbons were investigated. The optimal conditions which gave the best activated carbon sample were 500 °C activation temperature, 60 min activation time and 60 mesh particle size. The produced activated carbon was also analyzed for its morphology using scanning electron microscope, which indicated that the produced activated carbon has various pore size distribution. © 2016

AB  - In this work, 1,4-sultone and benzimidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) with four different anions were synthesized, and their structures were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis (CHNS). The acidity of the synthesized ILs was studied using Hammett acidity function and COSMO-RS. The waste cooking oil was used as a raw material for biodiesel production and their different fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). These four ILs, as catalysts, were screened and comparatively IL 3-methyl-1-(4-sulfo-butyl)-benzimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [BSMBIM][CF3SO3] was selected for further detailed optimization study. This IL experimental efficiency results supported the Hammett acidity function and COSMO-RS study. The catalyst performance was studied and optimised the different parameters. The catalyst efficiency was studied in one and two-step reactions. [BSMBIM][CF3SO3] as a catalyst showed the esterification of waste cooking oil up to 78.13% in a single step reaction. Potassium hydroxide was used in the second step to trans-esterify the waste cooking oil up to 94.52%. The catalyst was reused for seven times with high-yield production. The obtained biodiesel was characterized by GC, NMR, FTIR, thermogravimetric (TGA) and their physicochemical properties were compared with the already established standards. The kinetic study of this transesterification reaction was evaluated and followed the first-order reaction mechanism. © 2017

AB  - Straws of cereal grains represent the major fraction of lignocellulosic agricultural wastes generated worldwide. Cereal straws (CSs) hold great potential for implementation as candidate feedstocks for fermentative production of second generation (2G) biofuels. Among the different varieties of CSs, rice and wheat straw are clearly the best available options for development of a reliable feedstock base from all aspects. Feasible alternatives of costly, energy intensive and non-ecofriendly physical and chemical pretreatments are needed to facilitate full scale utilization of the CSs in the 2G biofuel platforms. Biochemical pretreatments of CSs using potential lignocellulolytic microorganisms can become the alternative technology upon proper exploration and exploitation. In the present review article, efficiency of the microorganism mediated biochemical processes has been assessed as promising pretreatment methods for CSs. Ligninolytic action of different fungi, bacteria and microbial consortia on different CSs (mostly wheat and rice straw) has been evaluated on the basis of extent of lignin degradation, selectivity of degradation and sugar recovery from pretreated CSs. Utilization of microbial consortia has been recommended as better pretreatment agents in comparison to their mono-culture counterparts. The review also attempts to predict the economic viability of biochemical pretreatments on the basis of associated cost factor correlation with the physical and chemical processes. Construction of synergistically operating lignocellulolytic microbial consortia for application in biochemical pretreatments of CSs has been demonstrated in the article and advocated as a promising process amelioration strategy. Overall, the review affirms the biochemical processes as the most suitable pretreatment technique from techno-economic and environmental aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil derived from white oak wood using non-sulfided catalysts was studied in a two zone continuous flow trickle bed reactor system. The major organic components of the pyrolysis oil were pyrolytic lignin (large phenolic polymers), xylose, levoglucosan, organic acids (primarily acetic acid), and hydroxyacetaldehyde. The first zone was a low temperature zone (130 °C) that contained a Ru/C catalyst. In this zone, carbonyl groups were hydrogenated, producing propylene glycol (from hydroxyacetone), ethylene glycol (from hydroxyacetaldehyde), and sorbitol (from levoglucosan). A more severe hydrotreatment was performed in a second zone containing a bifunctional Pt/ZrP catalyst at a temperature between 300 and 400 °C. In the two-stage HDO, an organic phase was produced that consisted of a distribution of hydrocarbons that were primarily cyclic alkanes (naphthenes) ranging from C7 to C24. The organic phase carbon yield decreased with increasing reaction temperature in the second zone. Catalyst deactivation and reactor plugging by coking occurred under all reaction conditions after 55–72 h time on stream (TOS). After ≈55 h TOS, more than 25 % of the carbon in the original bio-oil was accumulated as coke, with increasing amounts for higher temperatures in the second zone. Hydrotreatment gave rise to &gt;C5 hydrocarbon (gasoline and distillate-range fuel) overall yields between ≈30 and 47 carbon % for all experiments compared to the 79.5 % theoretical yield calculated for the bio-oil feedstock. Coke formation and undesired cracking to C1–C4 hydrocarbon gases were the main causes of lower fuel carbon yields. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In this study, production of bio-oil and biochar from soapstock via microwave-assisted co-catalytic fast pyrolysis combining the advantages of in-situ and ex-situ catalysis was performed. The effects of catalyst and pyrolysis temperature on product fractional yields and bio-oil chemical compositions were investigated. From the perspective of bio-oil yield, the optimal pyrolysis temperature was 550 °C. The use of catalysts reduced the water content, and the addition of bentonite increased the bio-oil yield. Up to 84.16 wt.% selectivity of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil was obtained in the co-catalytic process. In addition, the co-catalytic process can reduce the proportion of oxygenates in the bio-oil to 15.84 wt.% and eliminate the N-containing compounds completely. The addition of bentonite enhanced the BET surface area of bio-char. In addition, the bio-char removal efficiency of Cd2+ from soapstock pyrolysis in presence of bentonite was 27.4 wt.% higher than without bentonite. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The surface and interface could be designed to enhance properties of electrocatalysts, and they are regarded as the key characteristics. This report describes surface modification of a bifunctional rht-type metal-organic framework (MOF, Cu-TDPAT) with nanosized electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (n-ERGO). The hybrid strategy results in a Cu-TDPAT-n-ERGO sensor with sensitive and selective response toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Compared with Cu-TDPAT, Cu-TDPAT-n-ERGO exhibits significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activities, highlighting the importance of n-ERGO in boosting their electrocatalytic activity. The sensor shows a wide linear detection range (4-12 000 μM), and the detection limit is 0.17 μM (S/N = 3) which is even lower than horseradish peroxidase or recently published noble metal nanomaterial based biosensors. Moreover, the sensor displays decent stability, excellent anti-interference performance, and applicability in human serum and urine samples. Such good sensing performance can be explained by the synergetic effect of bifunctional Cu-TDPAT (open metal sites and Lewis basic sites) and n-ERGO (excellent conductive property). It is expected that rht-type MOF-based composites can provide wider application potential for the construction of bioelectronics devices, biofuel cells, and biosensors. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of nine algae species were performed at two reaction temperatures (280 and 320 °C) to compare the effect of their biomass composition on product yields and properties. Results obtained after HTL indicate large variations in terms of bio-oil yields and its properties. The maximum bio-oil yield (66 wt%) was obtained at 320 °C with a high lipid containing algae Nannochloropsis. The higher heating value of bio-oils ranged from 31 to 36 MJ/kg and around 50% of the bio-oils was in the vacuum gas oil range while high lipid containing algae Nannochloropsis contained a significant portion (33–42%) in the diesel range. A predictive relationship between bio-oil yields and biochemical compositions was developed and showed a broad agreement between predictive and experimental yields. The aqueous phases obtained had high amount of TOC (12–43 g/L), COD (35–160 g/L), TN (1–18 g/L), ammonium (0.34–12 g/L) and phosphate (0.7–12 g/L). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biodiesel production from non-edible oils has high potential as renewable and ecological fuel. Few researches have been conducted to date on the production of biodiesel from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) seed oil. The aim of this study was to optimize the biodiesel production from this crude oil by non-catalytic supercritical methanolysis using response surface methodology (RSM). Triglyceride conversion, total and individual FAME yield, monoglyceride and diglyceride yield, and thermal decomposition degree of biodiesel were determined in the temperature and reaction time ranges of 250–350 °C (12–43 MPa) and 15–90 min, respectively, at a fixed methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 43:1. According to the RSM, the optimal conditions were 303.4 °C and 90 min, reaching a predicted maximum FAME yield of 91.1 ± 3.2 mol%. This maximum was very close to that obtained experimentally (92.8 ± 2.1 mol%) at 300 °C and 90 min. Decomposition of biodiesel became evident at 325 °C and 60 min of reaction due to the thermal instability of unsaturated methyl esters (methyl linoleate and oleate). The biodiesel obtained in the best experimental reaction conditions (300 °C and 90 min), where no thermal decomposition of FAMEs was observed, contained most of the byproduct glycerol generated, which was degraded and incorporated to the product. This biodiesel basically failed to meet the content of FAMEs as required by the standard EN 14214, the content of monoglycerides and total glycerol, and the acid value, being a little above the required upper limits. However, this biodiesel can be blended with other biodiesels of complementary features to produce a biofuel meeting the requirements of the standard EN 14214. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbohydrates are the prevailing biomass components available for bio-based production. The most direct way to convert carbohydrates into commodity chemicals is by one-step conversion at maximum theoretical yield, such as by anaerobic fermentation without side product formation. Considering these hypothetical yields and petrochemical prices in Europe in 2010–2014, a ranking of 58 commodity chemicals was made using a simple model with ethanol as a base case. It was concluded that base chemicals such as lower olefins and benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX) are too cheap and require too much carbohydrate to be produced competitively compared to bioethanol. However, more oxidized products that require multiple conversion steps in petrochemical production, such as adipic acid, acrylic acid, acrylate esters, and 1,4-butanediol, can be produced competitively from carbohydrates if theoretical yields are approached and if processing is efficient. Instead of carbohydrate fermentation, hypothetical photochemical production from CO2 was also considered. Using again a simple model, the same commodity chemicals remained the most attractive ones. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Hydrogen-rich gas production from the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil model compounds was carried out in a fixed bed reactor. Bio-char, which was obtained from biomass gasification process and contained many alkali and alkaline metallic (AAEM) species, was used as a catalyst. The results showed that bio-char was effective in enhancing catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil model compounds and producing hydrogen rich gas. Temperature, S/B and WHSV were the operating variables which affected to a great extent of hydrogen production. The yield and concentration of hydrogen reached high values of 89.13% and 75.97%, respectively, under the condition of 900 °C, S/B of 3 and WHSV = 1. Acid treatment of bio-char was conducted to investigate the effect of inherent AAEM species on the catalytic activity of bio-char. It was found that the inherent AAEM species appear to have significant effect on the catalytic activity of bio-char especially the water-gas shift reaction under the current experimental conditions. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Olive tree biomass (OTB) can be used for producing second generation bioethanol. In this work, extracted OTB was subjected to fractionation using a sequential acid/alkaline oxidative pretreatment. In the first acid stage, the effects of sulfuric acid concentration and reaction times at 130 °C were investigated. Up to 71% solubilization of hemicellulosic sugars was achieved under optimized conditions (2.4% H2SO4, 84 min). In the second stage, the influence of hydrogen peroxide concentration and process time were evaluated at 80 °C. Approximately 80% delignification was achieved under the best operational conditions (7% H2O2, 90 min) within the experimental range studied. This pretreatment produced a substrate with 72% cellulose that was highly accessible to enzymatic attack, yielding 82 g glucose/100 g glucose in delignified OTB. Ethanol production from both hemicellulosic sugars solubilized in the acid pretreatment and glucose from enzymatic hydrolysis of delignified OTB yielded 15 g ethanol/100 g OTB. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of various biomass derived inhibitors (i.e. furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), vanillin, 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde (4-HB) and acetate) was investigated for fatty acid accumulation in Rhodococcus sp. YHY 01. Rhodococcus sp. YHY01 was able to utilize acetate, vanillin, and 4-HB for biomass production and fatty acid accumulation. The IC50value for furfural (3.1 mM), HMF (3.2 mM), vanillin (2.0 mM), 4-HB (2.7 mM) and acetate (3.7 mM) was calculated. HMF and vanillin affect fatty acid composition and increase saturated fatty acid content. Rhodococcus sp. YHY 01 cultured with empty fruit bunch hydrolysate (EFBH) as the main carbon source resulted in enhanced biomass (20%) and fatty acid productivity (37%), in compression to glucose as a carbon source. Overall, this study showed the beneficial effects of inhibitory molecules on growth and fatty acid production, and support the idea of biomass hydrolysate utilization for biodiesel production by avoiding complex efforts to remove inhibitory compounds. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOx)-catalase co-immobilized catalyst (CNT/PEI/(GOx-Cat)) was synthesized, and its catalytic activity and electrical performance were investigated and compared, whereas the amount of immobilized catalase was optochemically inspected by chemiluminescence (CL) assay. With the characterizations, it was confirmed that the catalase was well immobilized on the CNT/PEI surface, whereas both the GOx and catalase play their roles well in the catalyst. According to the measurements of the current density peak of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) redox reaction, electron transfer rate, Michaelis-Menten constants and sensitivity, CNT/PEI/(GOx-Cat) shows the best values, and this is attributed to the excellent catalytic activity of GOx and the H2O2 decomposition capability of the catalase. To evaluate the electrical performance, a membraneless glucose biofuel cell (GBFC) adopting the catalyst was operated under physiological conditions and produced a maximum power density (MPD) of 180.8 ± 22.3 μW cm-2, which is the highest value compared to MPDs obtained by adoption of other catalysts. With such results, it was clarified that the CNT/PEI/(GOx-Cat) manufactured by co-immobilization of GOx and catalase leads to enhancements in the catalytic activity and GBFC performance due to the synergetic effects of (i) effective removal of harmful H2O2 moiety by catalase and (ii) superior activation of desirable reactions by GOx. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of two dilute acid flowthrough pretreated softwood lignin samples, including residual lignin in pretreated solid residues (ReL) and recovered insoluble lignin in pretreated liquid (RISL), with apparent different physical and chemical structures, was comprehensively studied. A combination of catalysts (HY zeolite and Ru/Al2O3) was employed to investigate the effects of lignin structures, especially condensed structures, on the HDO upgrading process. Results indicated that the condensed structure and short side chains in lignin hindered its HDO conversion under different reaction conditions, including catalyst loading and composition, hydrogen pressure, and reaction time. In addition to lignin structure, HY zeolite was found crucial for lignin depolymerization, while Ru/Al2O3 and relatively high hydrogen pressure (4 MPa) were necessary for upgrading unstable oxy-compounds to cyclohexanes at high selectivity (&gt;95 wt %). Since the lignin structure essentially affects its reactivity during HDO conversion, the yield and selectivity of HDO products can be predicted by detailed characterization of the lignin structure. The insights gained from this study in the fundamental reaction mechanisms based on the lignin structure will facilitate upgrading of lignin to high-value products for applications in the production of both fuels and chemicals. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Effect of metal oxide catalysts such as CaO, MgO, MnO, ZnO, NiO, SnO, CeO2, Al2O3 and La2O3 on supercritical hydrothermal liquefaction of empty fruit bunch (EFB) derived from oil palm residues to bio-oil were studied in terms of product yields and characteristics. EFB, water and 1.0 wt% metal oxide were loaded into an Inconel batch reactor, heated to 390 °C to reach 25 MPa at reaction time of 1 h. Among the tested catalysts, four most active metal oxides with lower electronegativity such as CaO, MnO, La2O3 and CeO2 were selected, and gave maximum relative yield of bio-oil at about 1.40 times that without catalyst. Based on GC–MS and FT-IR analyses, the presence of phenol and its derivatives, ketone, other aromatic compounds and carboxylic acid in bio-oils obtained were confirmed. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of obtained bio-oils showed three stages of thermal degradation behaviour. Modified Reverchon-Sesti Osseo model provides good fit for the experimental yield of bio-oil formed with the four most active metal oxide catalysts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfate ionic liquid as co-solvent and as homogeneous catalyst in ethanol solvent allows efficient conversion of fructose into 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (5-EMF) directly at mild conditions. Ionic liquids [A][B] ([A]+ = 1-methylimidazolium, [C1im]+; 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, [C2mim]+; or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, [C4mim]+, [B]− = hydrogen sulfate, [HSO4]−; acetate, [AC]−; diethylphosphate, [DEP]−); dimethylphosphate, [DMP]−) or chloride, [Cl]−were studied. In the [C4mim][HSO4]-ethanol system, 83% 5-EMF yields were obtained from fructose at 130 °C in 20 min reaction time that can be attributed to the anion acidity and to a stabilizing hydrogen bond that forms between the ionic liquid and 5-HMF. The ionic liquid was demonstrated to be reusable for five times with minimal loss in catalytic activity (ca. 3% loss in 5-EMF yield). Hydrogen sulfate ionic liquids as co-solvent and catalyst in ethanol allow efficient conversion of biomass-related mixtures that contain fructose or a 5-HMF intermediate into biofuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pinecone is a lignocellulosic forest residue with value-added industrial importance in terms of energy and materials production. Although promising, pinecone has received inadequate attention as a biofuel feedstock for thermochemical conversion. Water above its critical temperature (TC ≥ 374 °C) and critical pressure (PC ≥ 22.1 MPa), termed as supercritical water, has high kinetic energy and densities similar to that of gases and liquids, respectively. When employed in gasification, supercritical water has an ability to completely dissolve organics and gases. Therefore, this study identifies the candidacy of pinecone as a precursor for conversion to hydrogen through hydrothermal gasification. Pinecone was gasified in subcritical water (300 and 350 °C; 21 MPa), near-critical water (370 °C; 22 MPa) and supercritical water (450 and 550 °C; 23 MPa) to investigate the impacts of temperature (300–550 °C), feed concentration (10–25 wt%) and residence time (15–60 min). The impacts of alkali catalysts (e.g., Na2CO3, NaOH and KOH) at a loading of 30 wt% were examined to maximize hydrogen yields. The hydrochar generated from gasification in subcritical water, near-critical water and supercritical water were physico-chemically characterized through proximate and ultimate analysis (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur-oxygen), thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the non-catalytic gasification of pinecone, highest hydrogen (1.42 mmol/g) and total gas yields (6.6 mmol/g) with lower heating value (488 kJ/Nm3) of the gas products were obtained in supercritical water at 550 °C with 10 wt% feed concentration for 60 min. Moreover, at 30 wt% catalyst loading, highest hydrogen yield was obtained from KOH (3.26 mmol/g) followed by NaOH (2.71 mmol/g) and Na2CO3 (1.96 mmol/g). Hydrochars generated in supercritical water at 550 °C had a greater content of aromatic carbon and were thermally stable. The findings reveal, for the first time, the potential of pinecone for hydrogen production through subcritical, near-critical and supercritical water gasification, as well as the prospective of its hydrochar for environmental and material applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Potassium, due to its strong catalytic effects on biomass pyrolysis vapors, has great influence on the components of the obtained bio-oil. In this work, fast pyrolysis of acid washed and potassium salts impregnated feedstocks (camphor branch, corn cob and walnut shell) were carried out in a fluidized bed. The effects of potassium and the ash in biomass on yields and selectivities of bio-oil compounds were studied. The results showed that the walnut shells yielded the greatest amount of phenol and acids. Potassium promoted the conversion of large molecular compounds (such as levoglucosan) to furans. The existence of potassium reduced the yield of aldehydes and enhanced that of furfural. With the assistance of potassium, the selectivity of monophenols (phenol, methyl phenol, dimethyl phenol, etc.) decreased significantly to around half, while that of polyphenols (ethyl phenol, 2-allylphenol, 4-(2-propenyl)-phenol, 2-allyl-4-methylphenol, etc.) increased obviously. Finally, a possible reaction pathway indicating potassium influences on biomass pyrolysis was proposed according to the experimental results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a viable thermochemical process for converting wet solid wastes into biocrude that can be hydroprocessed to liquid transportation fuel blendstocks and specialty chemicals. The aqueous byproduct from HTL contains significant amounts (20-50%) of the biogenic feed carbon, which must be valorized to enhance economic sustainability of the process on an industrial scale. In this study, aqueous fractions produced from HTL of food industry wastes, municipal wastes, and biomass cultivated on wastewater were characterized using a wide variety of analytical approaches. Organic species present in these aqueous fractions were identified using two-dimensional gas chromatography equipped with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Identified compounds include organic acids, nitrogen compounds, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. Conventional gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection and liquid chromatography utilizing refractive index detection were employed to quantify the identified compounds. Inorganic species in the aqueous streams were also were quantified using ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The concentrations of organic compounds and inorganic species are reported, and the significance of these results are discussed in detail. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The use of sulfonic acid-functionalized heterogeneous catalysts in conjunction with the use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as co-solvent in the catalytic transformation of fructose in ethanol to produce 5-ethoxymethyl furfural (EMF) is shown as an interesting alternative route for the production of this advanced biofuel. Arenesulfonic acid-modified SBA-15 mesostructured silica (Ar-SO3H-SBA-15) has been the most active catalyst, ascribing its higher catalytic performance to the combination of excellent textural properties, acid sites surface concentration and acid strength. Noticeably, DMSO promotes the formation of EMF and HMF, reducing the extent of side reactions. Reaction conditions (temperature, catalyst loading and DMSO concentration) where optimized for Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 via response surface methodology leading to a maximum EMF yield of 63.4% at 116 °C, 13.5 mol% catalyst loading based on starting fructose and 8.3 vol.% of DMSO in ethanol after 4 h of reaction. Catalyst was reused up to 4 consecutive times, without regeneration treatment, showing a slight gradual decay in activity attributed to the formation of organic deposits on the catalyst's surface. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The environmental degradation and the health hazards caused by the petroleum fuels needs a compelling research for the alternate energy source. This paper analysis the pongamia methyl ester (PME) as an alternate source of fuel for CI engines without making much changes in the existing engine technology and without causing much difficulties for the scientists and engineers. The study reveals the use of PME as either an alternate fuel or substitute for the diesel may definitely reduces the green house gases at the same time the employability in the agricultural field will be increased by retaining the migration of the farmer community towards cities or towns for search of employment. It was observed that the use of PME as fuel reduces carbon monoxide to an extent of 8.2% compared to diesel at the same time HC reduced by 8.9% also there is considerable reduction in oxides of nitrogen. There was increase in BSFC of 4.2% and the thermal efficiency reduced by 2.4%. But the environmental sustainability and the employability for local community and promotion of agriculture prefers the PME as an alternate fuel for the transport, agricultural and power sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of azolla, sargassum tenerrimum and water hyacinth were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at different temperatures in the range of 300–450 °C in the presence of nitrogen (inert atmosphere). The objective of this study is to understand the effect of compositional changes of various aquatic biomass samples on product distribution and nature of products during slow pyrolysis. The maximum liquid product yield of azolla, sargassum tenerrimum and water hyacinth (38.5, 43.4 and 24.6 wt.% respectively) obtained at 400, 450 and 400 °C. Detailed analysis of the bio-oil and bio-char was investigated using 1H NMR, FT-IR, and XRD. The characterization of bio-oil showed a high percentage of aliphatic functional groups and presence of phenolic, ketones and nitrogen-containing group. The characterization results showed that the bio-oil obtained from azolla, sargassum tenerrimum and water hyacinth can be potentially valuable as a fuel and chemicals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Selective hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has potential application in high quality biofuels. Herein, the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of HMF to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) was investigated using bi-functional Ru-MoOx/C catalyst prepared by initial wetness impregnation. The high dispersion and electronic transfer between Ru and MoOx were demonstrated by a series of characterization techniques. During this HDO process, the synergy effect between metallic Ru and acidic MoOx species in the Ru-MoOx/C catalyst plays an essential role in obtaining maximized target product DMF (79.4%) via effective aldehyde group hydrogenation by Ru followed by dehydration over MoOx. This work also elucidated that DMF production proceeded through two distinct pathways: the 2,5-hydroxymethyl furan intermediate was preferable by the aldehyde group hydrogenation of HMF over the Ru-MoOx/C catalyst. Over MoOx/C catalyst, comparatively, 5-methyl furfural was the key intermediate by direct hydrogenolysis of the hydroxyl group in HMF. This kind of catalyst is stable for the first two runs by maintaining the target product yield. After the third run, the catalyst showed deactivation gradually but could be almost completely recovered after regeneration by H2 reduction. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Pyrolysis of corn stalk biomass briquettes was carried out in a developed microwave (MW) reactor supplied with 2.45 GHz frequency using 3 kW power generator. MW power and biomass loading were the key parameters investigated in this study. Highest bio-oil, biochar, and gas yield of 19.6%, 41.1%, and 54.0% was achieved at different process condition. In terms of quality, biochar exhibited good heating value (32 MJ/kg) than bio-oil (2.47 MJ/kg). Bio-oil was also characterised chemically using FTIR and GC–MS method. This work may open new dimension towards development of large-scale MW pyrolysis technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For the purpose of producing biocrude from pretreated and washed sweet sorghum bagasse, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was conducted with six different catalysts at two temperatures. The six catalysts were: K2CO3, KOH, formic acid, Ni/Si[sbnd]Al, Ni2P and zeolite. The two temperatures were 300 and 350 °C. Based on two selection criteria, high yield of biocrude and low yield of biochar, K2CO3, KOH, and Ni/Si[sbnd]Al were identified as the best catalysts which led to biocrude yields of 61.8%, 42.3% and 45.0% at 300 °C, respectively. As the best catalyst, K2CO3led to biocrude samples with higher heating values (HHVs) of 33.1 MJ/kg. This biocrude had high carbon content and low contents of nitrogen and sulfur based on elemental analysis. However, the relatively high content of oxygen around 15% requires the biocrudes to be upgraded before refinery ready. Key compounds identified in these biocrudes will assist future effort in upgrading. Overall, this study proved that the pretreated bagasse is a suitable feedstock for HTL for generating biocrude. Through a simple dilute acid pretreatment step and HTL of the resulting solid, every component of sorghum bagasse can be used for producing biofuels. © 2016

AB  - This report presents a method for producing large quantities of biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCO). Preliminary studies on optimization of the WCO transesterification process in a continuous-flow microwave reactor are carried out using commercial SrO as a catalyst. The SrO catalyst can be separated and reused for five reaction cycles without loss in activity. Challenges like mass flow and pressure drop constraints need to be surmounted. SrO nanoparticles deposited on millimeter-sized (3–6 mm) silica beads (41 wt% SrO/SiO2) are prepared and evaluated as a substitute for the SrO catalyst. A WCO conversion value to biodiesel as high as 99.2 wt% was achieved with the reactor packed with 15 g of 41 wt% SrO/SiO2 catalyst in 8.2 min with 820 mL of feed. Excellent performance of the fixed-bed catalyst without loss in activity for a lifetime of 24.6 min converting a feed of 2.46 L to FAME was observed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a response to the global requirement for renewable transportation fuels that are economically viable and fungible with existing petroleum infrastructure, Steeper Energy is commercializing its proprietary hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technology as a potential path to sustainable lignocellulosic-derived transport fuels. Hydrofaction™ utilizes high-density, supercritical water chemistry at distinctly higher pressures and temperatures than most literature on HTL. The paper presents a direct relation between density and the chemical properties that make near-critical water an appealing HTL reaction medium. Further, the fundamentals of Hydrofaction™ and how these are carefully chosen to favor certain chemical reaction paths are explained, including the use of high-density supercritical water, homogenous alkaline metal catalysts at alkaline conditions and recycling of aqueous and oil products. Steady state operational data from a campaign producing 1 barrel (&gt;150 kg) of oil at a dedicated pilot plant is presented, including closure of mass, energy, and three elemental balances. A detailed oil assay specifying the oil quality as well as mass and energy recoveries from wood to oil of 45.3 wt.% and 85.6%, respectively, reflect that Hydrofaction™ is an energy-efficient technology for sourcing renewable biofuels in tangible volumes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper summarizes the research activities done at Politecnico di Milano in the field of the detailed kinetic modeling of fast pyrolysis of biomass to produce bio-oil. Note I of this work already discussed biomass characterization and the multistep pyrolysis mechanisms of reference species. The model is able to provide a detailed composition of pyrolysis products and char residue. Different critical steps are involved in this multicomponent, multiphase and multiscale problem. The first complexity relies in biomass characterization. Then, fast pyrolysis process involves detailed kinetic mechanisms, first in the solid phase for the biomass pyrolysis, then in the gas-phase for the secondary reactions of released products. The complexity of these kinetic mechanisms requires strong simplifications, thus chemical lumping procedures are extensively applied. Successive or secondary gas phase reactions of gas and tar components released during the pyrolysis process complement the kinetic model, together with the heterogeneous reactions of residual char. The modeling of fast pyrolysis process requires a comprehensive description of the coupled transport and kinetic processes, both at the particle and the reactor scale. A few examples and comparisons with experimental data validate the reliability of the overall model. Finally, the composition and physical properties of the pyrolysis bio-oil are also discussed, with emphasis on combustion and pollutant emissions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Thermochemical and biological processes represent promising technologies for converting wet biomasses, such as animal manure, organic waste, or algae, to energy. To convert biomass to energy and bio-chemicals in an economical manner, internal energy recovery should be maximized to reduce the use of external heat and power. In this study, two conversion pathways that couple hydrothermal liquefaction with anaerobic digestion or catalytic hydrothermal gasification were compared. Each of these platforms is followed by two alternative processes for gas utilization: 1) combined heat and power; and 2) combustion in a boiler. Pinch analysis was applied to integrate thermal streams among unit processes and improve the overall system efficiency. A techno-economic analysis was conducted to compare the feasibility of the four modeled scenarios under different market conditions. Our results show that a systems approach designed to recover internal heat and power can reduce external energy demands and increase the overall process sustainability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper examines the co-conversion of waste activated sludge and birchwood sawdust to bio-oil via hydrothermal liquefaction. The purpose of using the sawdust with sludge was to increase the solids concentration using another waste material for possible resource recovery. The operating conditions including reaction temperature, reaction time and solids concentration were optimized based on the response surface methodology for the maximum bio-oil production. A maximum of 33.7 wt% bio-oil yield was obtained at optimum operating conditions of 310 °C, 10 min, and 10 wt% concentration. Comparison of this oil with the oil produced from only sawdust showed a significant improvement in the molecular weight of the bio-oil by having lower molecular weight (hence less viscosity), indicating the presence of lighter components, with a slight decrease in bio-oil yield. The optimized operating condition could be used to effectively co-liquefy waste activated sludge and sawdust with the advantage of producing higher quality bio-oil with respect to molecular weight. The water-soluble product which is the largest fraction of by-products from the co-conversion was tested as a feedstock for biogas production through anaerobic digestion and resulted in 800 ml bio-methane production per 0.816 g of TOC or 2.09 g of COD of this waste stream. © 2017

AB  - Microwave-assisted fast co-pyrolysis of lignin and polypropylene for bio-oil production was conducted using the ex-situ catalysis technology. Effects of catalytic temperature, feedstock/catalyst ratio, and lignin/polypropylene ratio on product distribution and chemical components of bio-oil were investigated. The catalytic temperature of 250 °C was the most conducive to bio-oil production in terms of the yield. The bio-oil yield decreased with the addition of catalyst during ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis. When the feedstock/catalyst ratio was 2:1, the minimum char and coke values were 21.22% and 1.54%, respectively. The proportion of cycloalkanes decreased and the aromatics increased with the increasing catalyst loading. A positive synergistic effect was observed between lignin and polypropylene. The char yield dramatically deceased and the bio-oil yield improved during co-pyrolysis compared with those during lignin pyrolysis alone. The proportion of oxygenates dramatically and the minimum value of 6.74% was obtained when the lignin/polypropylene ratio was 1:1. © 2017

AB  - Sugarcane straw is a lignocellulosic residue accumulated during the harvest of sugarcane and is a potential feedstock for second generation biofuel. This work covers the optimization of pretreatment step in the ethanol production using a complete factorial design (23), where the analyzed factors were temperature, acid concentration and time in the Dilute Acid pretreatment. Desirability function was applied in this stage to maximize sugar yields and minimize inhibitor concentrations, resulting in overall sugars yield ∼60% and furfural concentration of 0.5 g/L. An enzymatic hydrolysis stage was done to increase sugar release. The fermentation stage was studied through three different configurations, such as Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF), Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) and Presaccharification and Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (PSSF). The most promising alternative turned out to be PSSF due its higher ethanol concentration, with a value of 14.8 g/100 g dry weight (DW) biomass, equivalent to 187 L/tonne DW using C6-sugars. The economic analysis revealed that the integration between enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation in the ethanol production affected the total capital cost. The cost of raw materials (sugarcane straw and enzymes) had the most significant impact on the total production cost and accounted between 35.66 and 25.88% of the total cost of the ethanol plant from sugarcane straw. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The synergistic atomic ratio, NiNi+Mo, of the NiMo/γ-Al2O3 reduced catalysts was investigated for the transformation of natural triglycerides into green diesel. A series of catalysts with different atomic ratios 0 ≤ NiNi+Mo ≤ 1 and constant atomic surface density (Mo + Ni) = 4 atoms/nm2 was prepared and characterized using adsorption–desorption isotherms, XRD, SEM-EDS, XPS and H2-TPR. The catalysts were evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil performed by hydrotreatment using a semi-batch reactor. For comparison, two additional NiMo/γ-Al2O3 sulphided catalysts were synthesized and tested. The most active reduced catalyst was also tested in the selective deoxygenation of waste cooking oil. MoO3/MoOx (Mo oxidation number between 5 and 4) and Ni0, NiO, NiAl2O4 phases very well dispersed on the support surface and uniformly distributed on the catalysts extrudates have been detected in all cases. The high dispersion of these phases does not practically disturb the texture of the support which exhibits a single peak pore volume distribution centered at about 8–9 nm. The Ni, Mo composition of the catalysts somehow affects the relative amounts of these phases of the same element. It was found that the aforementioned NiNi+Mo ratio is located at about 0.8. This is very different to that of the sulphided catalysts which is located at about 0.3 for both the hydrodesulphurization of petroleum fractions and the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil. An impressive increase of the% yield to hydrocarbons in the diesel range by a factor of 4.77 was achieved by a simple change of the NiNi+Mo atomic ratio in the NiMo/γ-Al2O3 reduced catalysts from 0.3 to 0.8. A complete transformation of both sunflower oil and waste cooking oil into hydrocarbons in the diesel range was obtained over the most active catalyst at 310 °C, hydrogen pressure 40 bar, reactant volume to catalyst mass ratio equal to 10 ml/g and reaction time equal to 5 h. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The chemical complexity of bio-oil aqueous phase limits its efficient utilization. To improve the efficiency of the bio-oil biorefinery, this study focused on the separation of chemical groups from the bio-oil water-extract via sequential organic solvent extractions. Due to their high recoverability and low solubility in water, four solvents (hexane, petroleum ether, chloroform, and ethyl acetate) with different polarities were evaluated, and the optimum process conditions for chemical extraction were determined. Chloroform had high extraction efficiency for furans, phenolics, and ketones. In addition to these classes of chemical, ethyl acetate had a high extraction efficiency for organic acids. The sequential extraction using chloroform followed by ethyl acetate resulted in 62.2 wt.% of original furans, ketones, alcohols, and phenolics being extracted into chloroform, while 62 wt.% acetic acid was extracted into ethyl acetate, leaving behind a high concentration of levoglucosan (∼53.0 wt.%) in the final aqueous phase. Chemicals separated via the sequential extraction could be used as feedstocks in a biorefinery using processes such as catalytic upgrading of furans and phenolics to hydrocarbons, fermentation of levoglucosan to produce alcohols and diols, and hydrogen production from organic acids via microbial electrolysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is an effective route to upgrade bio-oil to hydrocarbon bio-oil, but the development of efficient catalysts for bio-oil HDO still remains a challenge. In this study, non-sulfided Fe-Co/SiO2 catalysts were used to upgrade bio-oil using HDO. A series of Fe-Co/SiO2 catalysts with different Fe/Co mole ratios were prepared, characterized and evaluated. The Fe and/or Co loading did not change SiO2 crystalline structure. The Fe and/or Co metals increased the amount and strength of Fe-Co/SiO2 catalyst acidity. Physicochemical properties of upgraded bio-oils produced using Fe-Co/SiO2 catalysts such as water content, total acid number, viscosity and higher heating values improved in comparison to raw bio-oil. Bimetallic Fe-Co/SiO2 catalysts resulted in better HDO performance than monometallic Fe/SiO2 or Co/SiO2 catalysts. This was due to the synergistic effect of Fe and Co occurring on the SiO2 support. Fe-Co/SiO2 catalyst having medium amount of acidity was more effective for bio-oil upgrading. The highest hydrocarbons content produced using Fe-Co(1)/SiO2 catalyst was 22.44%. The mechanism of bio-oil HDO on Fe-Co/SiO2 catalysts is proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae as a candidate for production of biodiesel, possesses a hard cell wall that prevents intracellular lipids leaving out from the cells. Direct or in situ supercritical transesterification has the potential for destruction of microalgae hard cell wall and conversion of extracted lipids to biodiesel that consequently reduces the total energy consumption. Response surface methodology combined with central composite design was applied to investigate process parameters including: Temperature, Time, Methanol-to-dry algae, Hexane-to-dry algae, and Moisture content. Thirty-two experiments were designed and performed in a batch reactor, and biodiesel efficiency between 0.44% and 99.32% was obtained. According to fatty acid methyl ester yields, a quadratic experimental model was adjusted and the significance of parameters was evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Effects of single and interaction parameters were also interpreted. In addition, the effect of supercritical process on the ultrastructure of microalgae cell wall using scanning electron spectrometry (SEM) was surveyed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic steam reforming of coconut shell pyrolysis bio-oil over Fe/olivine catalyst was conducted in a fixed-bed quartz reactor. The effects of calcination temperature, iron loading, reaction temperature, steam to carbon ratio (S/C), bio-oil weight hourly space velocity (WbHSV) on gas composition and carbon conversion were investigated. The results indicate that Fe/olivine has good activity for steam reforming of bio-oil, the couple Fe2+/3+/Fe2+ may be sufficiently efficient for C–C, C–O and C–H breaking. After steam reforming, most of the phenolics in pyrolysis oil are converted into light molecular compounds such as H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. The H2 concentration and carbon conversion were enhanced by increasing reaction temperature from 750 to 800 °C and the S/C from 1.5 to 2, but decreased with increasing calcination temperature. In the WbHSV range of 0.5–0.6, the hydrogen concentration decreased obviously, whereas it decreased slightly by further increasing WbHSV. The highest hydrogen concentration of 47.6 vol% was obtained among the catalysts tested, and the best carbon conversion was 97.2% over 10% Fe/olivine catalyst under the reforming conditions of temperature = 800 °C, WbHSV = 0.5, S/C = 2. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The application of solid acid catalyst in biodiesel production eliminates the tedious pretreatment of feedstock and eradicates generation of high volume of wastewater. A novel acid catalyst was prepared via sulfonation of incompletely carbonized coconut shell using concentrated sulfuric acid. The design of experiments were performed using four factor-three-level central composite design coupled with response surface methodology to evaluate the interaction between two factors in order to determine the optimum process conditions. A quadratic model was suggested for the prediction of biodiesel yield. The F-value and p-value of the model were 4.02 and 0.0129, respectively, indicate that the model was statistically significant at 95 per cent confidence interval. In addition, R2 value of the model was 0.8364, which indicates the acceptable accuracy of the model. From the optimization study, it was found that the carbonization temperature, carbonization time, sulfonation temperature and sulfonation time were 422 °C, 4 h, 100 °C and 15 h, respectively. At these optimum conditions the predicted and observed biodiesel yield were 88.15 per cent and 88.03 per cent, respectively, which experimentally verified the accuracy of the model. The use of coconut shell-derived solid acid catalyst in biodiesel production promotes the sustainable and green way of operations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The selective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is an important step in cellulosic biomass upgrading to biofuels, where bimetallic oxophilic catalysts have shown promising performance. Well controlled bimetallic NiCu and NiCu3 nanocrystals supported on carbon are shown to give high yields and selectivities to DMF. To shed light on the active phase, near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) was used to characterize the surface composition of these highly selective base-metal catalysts under reducing conditions relevant to the HDO reaction. Reactions were performed in a continuous flow reactor under reasonable conditions of 33 bar and 180°C. The Ni alloys were significantly more selective for DMF compared to monometallic Ni or Cu catalysts. With a well-controlled surface composition, the nanocrystal NiCu3/C catalyst exhibited a maximum DMF yield of 98.7%. NAP-XPS characterization showed that the Ni-Cu nanocrystals were completely reduced below 250°C in H2; this, together with bulk thermodynamic calculations, implies that the catalysts were completely reduced under the reaction conditions. NAP-XPS also indicated that the NiCu3 nanocrystal structure consisted of a Cu-rich core and a 1:1 molar Ni:Cu shell. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - The performance of different Ni/Mg-Al catalysts modified with Ce was evaluated in the catalytic steam reforming of aqueous fractions of bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis. The effects of several preparation methods for incorporating Ce as a modifier (co-precipitation, impregnation and direct thermal decomposition of the salt precursors), the Ce content (0–5 wt.%) and the feed streams (three different aqueous fractions from bio-oil) on the catalyst performance were examined, and it was found that the stability and activity of the catalysts were significantly influenced by all these factors. In general, the addition of Ce to a reference Ni/Mg-Al catalyst improved the overall carbon conversion to gas and the yield to H2 as well as enhancing the catalyst stability in the steam reforming of aqueous fractions of bio-oils. The best preparation method was impregnation and the optimal Ce content was found to be 0.5 wt.%. Much higher initial carbon conversion to gas and initial H2 yields was obtained using bio-oils derived from pine than those derived from poplar. A very low coke formation, 103 mg C/(g of catalyst · g of organics in the aqueous fraction reacted), was achieved using the optimized catalyst, 0.5 wt.% Ce prepared by impregnation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydrothermal conversions of three model compounds—starch, bovine serum albumin and linoleic acid—and their binary and ternary mixtures were evaluated. Batch experiments were operated at 250–350 °C, 5–20 MPa for 10–60 min. Bio-oil produced from sugars, proteins and their mixtures contained ∼70% carbon and ∼15% oxygen (w/w) with higher heating values than those of the substrates. When treated individually, bio-oil yields showed the following behavior: lipids > sugars > proteins. Dehydration and condensation reactions among intermediates were hypothesized to enhance the production of bio-oil via the hydrothermal conversion of sugar and lipid mixtures. The ternary mixtures (sugar + oil + protein) exhibit the best performance for bio-oil production, likely due to similar chemical reactions, catalyzed by alkalinity from protein degradation. Results of this study demonstrate that the bio-oil yields for hydrothermal liquefaction of sugars, proteins and lipids may be maximized by selective design of feedstock composition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mixed microalgae cultures are considered as an attractive research area compared to traditional pure culture to dominate cultivation contamination risk and enhance economic feasibility of large-scale biofuel production. However, pre-treatment and bioethanol production from mixed microalgae culture has not been reported yet. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of different pre-treatment strategies including acidic, alkaline, and enzymatic hydrolysis on the sugar extraction from mixed microalgae. Besides, the effects of MgSO4 and CaCl2 as lewis acids in acidic pre-treatment on reducing sugar yield were studied. Results showed that the mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and MgSO4 exhibited a higher sugar yield than dilute acid. Among all pre-treatments used, the enzymatic treatment with thermostable enzymes showed the highest recovery of 0.951 g extracted glucose/g total sugar. Moreover, the enzymatic pre-treatment of wet microalgae was compared with dried ones at identical operational conditions and dried biomass concentration of 50 g/l, similar sugar yields were achieved which would be advantageous to reduce the need for drying of the microalgae biomass. Fermentation of the acidic and enzymatic treated samples to ethanol using Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed yield of 0.38 and 0.46 g/g glucose, corresponding to 76% and 92% of the theoretical values, respectively. The obtained results revealed that bioethanol yield after enzymatic hydrolysis of mixed microalgae culture are higher than those of acid hydrolysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper describes catalytic consequence of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Dunaliella tertiolecta (D. tertiolecta) over carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported metals catalysts to produce bio-oil. When Co/CNTs is used as catalysts, the conversion and bio-oil yield increase to 95.78 and 40.25 wt.%, respectively. Chemical analysis results showed that the introduction of catalyst significantly affected the chemical composition of bio-oil with a higher percentage of hydrocarbons and a lower content of fatty acid. The introduction of metal into CNTs had no change in the basic CNT skeleton and the loaded metal nanoparticles encapsulated within the CNT enhances the disorder and defects in CNTs. Based on our results and the literature, the plausible general reaction and catalytic HTL pathways of D. tertiolecta are proposed. © 2016

AB  - Algae are organisms that grow in marine environments and use carbon dioxide and light to create bio-mass. There are two groupings of algae: microalgae and macroalgae. Macroalgae are the large, multi-cellular algae often seen growing in ponds. Microalgae, on the other hand, are tiny, unicellular algae that normally grow in suspension within a body of water. Algae oil from microalgae has the possible to become a sustainable fuel source as biodiesel. Microalgae are produced through photosynthesis by utilizing sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and other nutrients. The Botryococcus braunii algal oil was extracted by mechanical extraction method. The transesterification reaction of Botryococcus braunii algal oil with methanol and base catalyst was used for the production of biodiesel. The samples B20 were prepared for each methyl ester obtained from Botryococcus braunii algal oil separately and then the doping of TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles were added to the each B20 blend samples at a dosage of 50 ppm and 100 ppm with an aid of ultrasonicator. Moreover, in the absence of any engine modifications, the performance and emission characteristics of those blend samples have been investigated from the experimentally measured values such as density, viscosity, calorific value, etc. while the engine performance was also analyzed through the parameters like BSFC, BTH, exhaust emission of CO, HC, NOx and CO2. The experimental results reveal that the use of biodiesel blend with nano additives in diesel engine has exhibited good improvement in performance characteristic and reduction in exhaust emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the direct liquefaction (DL) of low-lipid microalgae Spirulina was investigated in a 50 ml autoclave reactor with ethanol and water as co-solvent. The objective of this research was carried out to examine the effect of operating conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction time, solvent/microalgae (S/M) ratio and ethanol-water co-solvent (EWCS) composition on product distribution and bio-oil characterization. The results revealed that the optimal operating conditions for bio-oil yield and conversion rate were reaction temperature of 300 °C, reaction time of 45 min, ethanol content of 50 vol.% and S/M ratio of 40/4 ml/g, which gave the bio-oil yield of 59.5% and conversion rate of 94.73%. Conversion rate in EWCS was significantly higher than that in pure water or ethanol, suggesting the synergistic effect between ethanol and water during microalgae DL. Distinct difference in composition and relative content of compound among bio-oils in different solvents were observed by GC–MS and FT-IR. Compared with hydrothermal liquefaction, the most abundant compounds in bio-oil from both EWCS and pure ethanol were esters. The presence of ethanol could enhance the bio-oil yield and improve bio-oil quality by promoting the formation of esters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bio-crude oil produced from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of a high-protein microalgae useful for wastewater treatment, Galdieria sulphuraria, was comprehensively characterized, and compared to that of a high-lipid microalgae useful for biofuel production, Nannochloropsis salina. HTL was conducted in a batch reactor at temperatures of 310–350 °C and reaction times of 5–60 min. Characterization methods included high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy (FT-ICR MS), fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Milder reaction conditions favored bio-crude oil yield and quality for N. salina, while more severe conditions (350 °C) were needed for G. sulphuraria. N. salina-derived bio-crude oil contained mainly C14-C18 fatty acid amides, while G. sulphuraria-derived bio-crude-oil had many N1-3O0-2 hetero-atom compounds. FT-ICR MS showed that the aromaticity of hetero-compounds in N. salina bio-crude oil was higher due to N. salina's higher carbohydrate content and the tendency of carbohydrate-derived molecules to condense at HTL conditions. FAME-GC/MS and 1H-NMR results showed that stable fatty acid amides increased in G. sulphuraria bio-crude oil at higher temperatures as more protein-derived compounds combined with lipid-derived compounds. While N-containing and high molecular weight compounds are a concern for the upgrading of bio-crude oils obtained from high-protein algal biomass, removal of carbohydrates rather than removal of proteins as a pretreatment to HTL is recommended since carbohydrate-derived compounds are more likely to create highly aromatic hetero-compounds that are much more difficult to upgrade. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyanobacteria were catalytically pyrolyzed over Mg-Al layered double oxide/ZSM-5 composites (MgAl-LDO/ZSM-5) to produce bio-oil. MgAl-LDO/ZSM-5 with a Mg/Al molar ratio of four was proved to be the best catalyst. Under the optima condition that the final temperature was 823 K, heating rate was 10 K/min and catalyst/algae mass ratio was 0.75, a maximum yield of liquid (41.1%) was achieved at 823 K with a heating rate of 10 K/min and a catalyst/algae mass ratio of 0.75, which was much higher than the one obtained without catalyst. The element analysis results proved that this bio-oil had much lower O/C molar ratio and higher HHV. The GC–MS results showed that the bio-oil had less nitrogenous compounds. MgAl4-LDO/ZSM-5 was proved to be an applicable and effective catalyst to obtain bio-oil from catalytic pyrolysis of water-blooming algae. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wet torrefaction in the temperature range from 150 to 240 °C for 60 min was applied on rice husk sample prior to pyrolysis process in this work. Its effects on the physicochemical properties and pyrolysis product properties were evaluated. The analysis results of physicochemical properties of raw and pretreated samples indicated that wet torrefaction not only improved the fuel characteristics but also removed a large amount of alkali and alkaline earth metal species with the dual advantages of dry torrefaction and demineralisation. On the basis of pyrolysis experiment results, it was found that wet torrefaction at the mild reaction condition had a positive impact on bio-oil production, but more severe wet torrefaction condition was not reasonable. The highest relative content of levoglucosan (57.2%) was obtained from pyrolysis of rice husk sample after wet torrefaction at 210 °C, which was about 6.2 times higher than that of raw rice husk. The results of biochar analysis suggested that biochar produced from sample after wet torrefaction and pyrolysis seems not a desirable solid fuel, it can be used as the feedstock for preparation of nanosilica. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of H2/CO ratio in syngas from a biomass gasifier, the type of a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalyst, addition of a reformer in a recycle mode, efficiency of CO2 removal, and co-feeding of biomass and natural gas on the overall thermal efficiency and costs for the production of FT liquid fuels from the biomass-derived syngas were analyzed using an Aspen Plus®-based process model. The overall thermal efficiency for biomass-fed processes was in a range of 41.3–45.5%. A cobalt catalyst-based FT process achieved slightly higher efficiency than an iron-based FT process mainly owing to the absence of water-gas shift activity on a cobalt FT catalyst. A proper amount of CO2 in the syngas can inhibit the amount of CO2 generated via the water-gas shift reaction in a FT reactor with an iron-based catalyst which yields a similar efficiency to a cobalt-based FT process. The lowest production costs were around $28.8 per GJ of FT liquids for the biomass fed processes with a reformer. However, the addition of a reformer in the gas recycle loop can improve the economics only when the operation of the plant is optimized for maximum fuel production rather than co-generation of fuels and power. A process with co-feeding of natural gas into the reformer can achieve more attractive economics than a solely biomass fed process. Co-feeding of biomass and natural gas each at 200 MWth for a total feedstock thermal energy input of 400 MWth reduced the costs of FT liquid production by about 30% to $19–$20 per GJ of FT liquids. However, production of FT biofuels would be economically viable only at very high oil price or if some premiums are considered for the production of green fuels and power. At an oil price of $60/barrel, production of FT biofuels in the process configurations considered in this study wouldn't be economically feasible. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A biomimetic nickel bis-diphosphine complex incorporating the amino acid arginine in the outer coordination sphere was immobilized on modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through electrostatic interactions. The functionalized redox nanomaterial exhibits reversible electrocatalytic activity for the H2/2 H+interconversion from pH 0 to 9, with catalytic preference for H2oxidation at all pH values. The high activity of the complex over a wide pH range allows us to integrate this bio-inspired nanomaterial either in an enzymatic fuel cell together with a multicopper oxidase at the cathode, or in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) using Pt/C at the cathode. The Ni-based PEMFC reaches 14 mW cm−2, only six-times-less as compared to full-Pt conventional PEMFC. The Pt-free enzyme-based fuel cell delivers ≈2 mW cm−2, a new efficiency record for a hydrogen biofuel cell with base metal catalysts. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In this study, Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) after treatment systems integrated 3L diesel engine fueled with BDF20, BDF50, BDF100 biodiesel fuels and JIS#2 diesel fuel are experimentally analyzed at 100 Nm, 200 Nm and full load (294 Nm); while the engine speed and cooling water temperature are constant at 1800 rpm and 80 °C, respectively. The advanced thermodynamic analyses, such as environmental and enviroeconomic analyses with energy, exergy, sustainability, thermoeconomic and exergoeconomic analyses, are applied. It is found that; (i) Utilization of the DOC is effective to reduce the fuel consumption of the BDF50 fuel; while the DOC and DOC + DPF are effective for the BDF100 fuel. (ii) DOC + DPF is more effective for biodiesel fuels. (iii) DOC + DPF decreases the soot concentration of all fuels. (iv) The maximum efficiency is found for the BDF100 fuel. (v) DOC + DPF is generally good option to reduce the CO2 of the fuels, especially for the BDF20 and BDF50. (vi) DOC + DPF is more effective for the BDF20 and BDF50 biodiesel blends; while both of the DOC and DOC + DPF are effective for the BDF50 fuel for reducing the prices of the released CO2. (vii) All fuels are more sustainable at full load. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A sequential two-step fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis (fMAP) for high quality bio-oil production was investigated. In the process, fMAP was followed by catalytic cracking and upgrading using a packed bed catalyst reactor with HZSM-5 as the catalyst. Effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalyst loading, and catalyst bed temperature on the product distribution were investigated. Results showed that maximum bio-oil and aromatic hydrocarbons yields were obtained when pyrolysis temperature reached 550 °C With the increase in the catalyst loading, the bio-oil yield decreased linearly while the aromatic hydrocarbons yield increased. The catalyst bed temperature also has a significant effect on the product chemical profiles. The aromatic hydrocarbons proportion of the bio-oil was found to increase with increasing catalyst bed temperature and reached its maximum of 26.20% at 425 °C. In addition, coke yield increased with increasing catalyst to biomass ratio and decreasing catalyst bed temperature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Heterogeneous solid acid catalyzed conversion of microalgal lipids to biodiesel is a scarcely studied area. In this study chromium-aluminum mixed oxide catalyst was investigated for catalytic conversion of microalgal lipids to biodiesel. Lipids from Scenedesmus obliquus grown in an open raceway pond (3000L) was used as feedstock. Reaction variables such as temperature, methanol to oil molar ratio and catalyst amount were optimized using response surface methodology. FAME conversion of 98.28% was achieved using chromium-aluminum catalyst at 80 °C, with methanol to oil molar ratio of 20:1 and catalyst amount of 15%. Catalytic efficiency of this heterogeneous solid acid catalyst was compared to a homogeneous acid catalyst (sulfuric acid). Chromium-aluminum mixed oxide catalyst can be effectively used for 4 batches of conversion reactions without significant loss in its activity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present experimental work is focused on improving the performance and emission characteristics of biofuel blend (diesel (40 %)-biodiesel (40 %)-ethanol (20 %)) (denoted as BE). Comparative analysis was done for addition of Diethyl ether (DEE) and alumina nanoparticle (Al2O3) at various concentrations. The test fuels used are BE, BE with 25 ppm Al2O3 (denoted as BN-1), BE with 50 ppm Al2O3 (denoted as BN-2), BE with 5 % DEE (denoted as BE-1) and BE with 10 % DEE (denoted as BE-2). Experimental results indicate that, DEE addition in BE results in increased HC (Hydrocarbon), CO (Carbon monoxide), CO2 (Carbon dioxide) and BSFC (Brake specific fuel consumption) with lowered NOx (Oxides of nitrogen) and smoke emission. This is attributed to high latent heat evaporation of mixture and Low temperature combustion (LTC). Al2O3addition in BE resulted in increase in NOx and smoke with lowered HC, CO, CO2 and BSFC. This could be attributed to enhanced surface area to volume ratio of mixture during rapid combustion process, higher catalytic combustion and reduced evaporation. At higher engine loads, the peak pressure of BE-1 is highest and that of BE-2 is lowest. Peak heat release rate of BE is highest and BN-1 is lowest. BE blends with additives (Al2O3 and DEE) resulted in higher Particulate matter (PM) formation, however BN-1 blend showed lowered PM at engine loads of 75 % and 100 %. Overall, BE-1 and BN-1 reflects better engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Thermal and in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of lignin were carried out in a bench-scale pyrolyzer. The yield and composition of the bio-oil produced were influenced largely by the type of lignin samples, pyrolysis temperature, and nitrogen carrier gas flow rate. The highest bio-oil yield of 35.95 wt.% was achieved using kraft lignin at 500 °C and a carrier gas flow rate of 600 ml/min. In-situ catalytic pyrolysis resulted in a decrease of the bio-oil yield, but the aromatic product distribution was altered greatly depending on the types of catalysts. In-situ catalytic pyrolysis also showed enhanced selectivity to valuable aromatic hydrocarbons. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - A fully resolved direct numerical simulation of flow and heat transfer is presented for slender randomly packed bed reactors. The flow and temperature field are solved over a non-body fitted, non-conformal Cartesian computational domain. The coupling between fluid and solid (both spherical particles and cylindrical wall) is enforced by a second order accurate, sharp interface immersed boundary method (IBM). The present numerical technique neither requires any challenging volumetric mesh generation process nor demands manipulation of the geometry near the particle-particle and particle-wall contact points. Conjugate heat transfer has been considered where the temperature field is calculated both inside the solid particles and in the fluid. A discrete element method (DEM) is used to generate the random packings of spherical particles in the cylindrical column, and a methodology is proposed to calculate the radial porosity profile of the bed. The column-to-particle diameter ratio (N) is varied from 4 to 8, and two separate cases have been considered where N→∞. The particle Reynolds number (Red) is varied from 1 to 500. The numerically obtained pressure drop and overall wall-to-bed heat transfer coefficient for different simulation cases are critically compared with empirical correlations and a good agreement is reported. Moreover, based on the current numerical results, correlations are proposed for the pressure drop and the wall-to-bed heat transfer coefficient. The effect of the column-to-particle diameter ratio (N) on both the flow and heat transfer, as-well-as the effect of the solid to fluid thermal conductivity ratio on the conjugate heat transfer are discussed. Furthermore, the fully resolved accurate numerical simulations have helped to elucidate the detailed pore-scale flow and heat transfer feature in the packed beds. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research present an alternative raw material of rubber seed which is non-edible crops as a source to produce oil for biodiesel production in Thailand. The rubber seed powder was extracted with hexane at room temperature to give rubber seed oil with the yield of 24 wt%. The composition and key properties of the extracted oil were analyzed including fatty acid compositions, density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, water content and acid value. This high FFAs oil (5.20 wt%) was successfully transesterified by various heterogeneous catalysts such as CaO-based waste coral fragment, sodium metasilicate and CaO-based eggshell to biodiesel in high yield and high %FAME of >97% in single step. Thermal stability of biodiesel obtained from rubber seed oil was evaluated by using thermogravimetric analysis and compared with petrol-diesel fuels. The biodiesel obtained from rubber seed oil was examined and found to meet the EN 14214 standard for bio-auto fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of gaseous carbon dioxide to methanol is an important reduction reaction in chemical process engineering, renewable energy industry and emerging green chemistry, as it provides means to harness surplus electrical energy and convert a pollutant and emitted greenhouse gas into a useful building block and biofuel. On industrial operating scale, multifunctional copper/zinc catalysts on various supporting substrates (e.g. CZA with alumina) are most commonly used due to their high selectivity and conversion. In this work, post-Hartree–Fock and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to assess the thermodynamics and to elucidate the pathway leading to the formation of methanol from CO2on realistic spinel-type tri-metallic materials. Firstly, a commercial-like Cu/ZnO/Al2O3was synthesised via co-precipitation and characterised to obtain the active sites’ structure for modelling. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement, scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed. Subsequently, the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy and chemical equilibrium constants of the direct methanol synthesis and the competing reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction at the temperatures of 25, 150, 200, 250 and 300 °C, and the pressures of 1, 20, 40, 60 and 100 bar were evaluated using ab initio quantum chemistry method CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ. To investigate kinetics, a mechanistic pathway scheme with all established intermediates was constructed, whereas physical/chemical adsorption/desorption energies, geometries, barriers and rates for adsorbate elementary steps were calculated using plane-wave DFT. Results demonstrate that the formate precursor route predominates as the respective transition state activation energies are lower and, thus CH3OH is proposed to form through HCOO, H2COO, H2COOH, CH2O and CH3O species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production process encourages use of heterogeneous catalyst over homogeneous catalysts. The major problems associated with the use of homogeneous catalysts are its non-renewable nature, separation and washing which can be overcome by the use of heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, in this work use of Musa balbisiana Colla peels, a waste biomass material has been used for preparing eco-friendly and highly effective heterogeneous base catalyst for sustainable biodiesel production. The peels of Musa balbisiana Colla have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffractograms (XRD), Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-ray (EDAX), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The conversion of the waste cooking oil into biodiesel was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) techniques. The peels of Musa balbisiana Colla furnished 100% conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. Low cost, renewable heterogeneous catalyst from banana (Musa balbisiana Colla) peels can be developed for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production providing a new route for sustainability of fuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A promising workflow for computational generation and meshing of resolved-particle randomly packed beds of arbitrary-shaped particles is described. The workflow is based on an automated package that is developed for the Bullet Physics Library for packed bed generation, and on the shrink-wrap method for handling the meshing challenges of the particle contact areas. Packed bed properties such as radial voidage and particle angle distributions are validated against existing experimental data and theoretical methods in the literature. Furthermore, the accuracy of the generated mesh using the shrink-wrap technique is evaluated by calculating the bulk and radial voidage distribution, the pressure drop, and by velocity profile and heat transfer analysis using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. It is shown that the proposed workflow can speed up the process of the geometry and mesh generation while it maintains the structural features of the bed. Finally, applications of such geometries to fixed bed reaction engineering problems are presented to illustrate simulations that can be achieved using the new workflow. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this research we assess the feasibility of using palm oil agricultural refinery waste as a carbon source for the production of rhamnolipid biosurfactant through fermentation. The production and characterization of rhamnolipid produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 grown on palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) under batch fermentation were investigated. Results show that P. aeruginosa PAO1 can grow and produce 0.43 g L−1 of rhamnolipid using PFAD as the sole carbon source. Identification of the biosurfactant product using mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of monorhamnolipid and dirhamnolipid. The rhamnolipid produced from PFAD were able to reduce surface tension to 29 mN m−1 with a critical micelle concentration (CMC) 420 mg L−1 and emulsify kerosene and sunflower oil, with an emulsion index up to 30%. Results demonstrate that PFAD could be used as a low-cost substrate for rhamnolipid production, utilizing and transforming it into a value added biosurfactant product. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, kernel-based extreme learning machine (K-ELM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed in order to predict the conditions of an alkaline-catalysed transesterification process. The reliability of these models was assessed and compared based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RSME), mean average percent error (MAPE) and relative percent deviation (RPD). The K-ELM model had higher R2 (0.991) and lower RSME, MAPE and RPD (0.688, 0.388 and 0.380) compared to the ANN model (0.984, 0.913, 0.640 and 0.634). Based on these results, the K-ELM model is a more reliable prediction model and it was integrated with ant colony optimization (ACO) in order to achieve the highest Ceiba pentandra methyl ester yield. The optimum molar ratio of methanol to oil, KOH catalyst weight, reaction temperature, reaction time and agitation speed predicted by the K-ELM model integrated with ACO was 10:1, 1 %wt, 60 °C, 108 min and 1100 rpm, respectively. The Ceiba pentandra methyl ester yield attained under these optimum conditions was 99.80%. This novel integrated model provides insight on the effect of parameters investigated on the methyl ester yield, which may be useful for industries involved in biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the aqueous phase obtained from catalytic/non-catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Chlorella vulgaris was recycled as the reaction medium with an aim to reduce water consumption and increase bio-crude oil yield. Although both Na2CO3 and HCOOH catalysts have been proven to be effective for promoting biomass conversion, the bio-crude oil yield obtained from HTL with Na2CO3 (11.5 wt%) was lower than that obtained from the non-catalytic HTL in pure water at 275 °C for 50 min. While, the HCOOH led to almost the same bio-crude yield from HTL (29.4 wt%). Interestingly, bio-crude oil yield obtained from non-catalytic or catalytic HTL in recycled aqueous phase was much higher than that obtained from HTL in pure water. Recycling aqueous phase obtained from catalytic HTL experiments resulted in a sharp increase in the bio-crude oil yield by 32.6 wt% (Na2CO3-HTL) and 16.1 wt% (HCOOH-HTL), respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of a sulfonated soaked palm seed cake (SPSC-SO3H) derived catalyst for the production of biodiesel from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) (the byproduct obtained during palm oil production) has been demonstrated. The activated carbon material from the soaked palm seed cake (SPSC) was sulfonated and then used for the esterification of PFAD (containing 85% of free fatty acid (FFA), 10% of triglycerides, 3% of diglycerides, 0.3% of monoglycerides and some traces of impurities). The synthesized SPSC-SO3H catalyst was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), N2 physisorption and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The SPSC-SO3H catalyst showed higher acid density (12.08 mmol g−1) and surface area (483.07 m2 g−1). The optimized reaction conditions, i.e. 9:1 methanol/PFAD molar ratio; 60 °C reaction temperature; 2.5 wt.% of the SPSC-SO3H catalyst and 2 h of reaction time was employed to achieve FFA conversion (98.2%) and FAME yield (97.8%). The SPSC-SO3H catalyst underwent eight reaction cycles and catalytic activity was dropped by 24% during recyclability study. The SPSC-SO3H catalyst demonstrates a promising and effective application for biodiesel synthesis especially for feedstocks containing high free fatty acid content. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study reported a novel immobilized MAS1 lipase from marine Streptomyces sp. strain W007 for synthesizing high-yield biodiesel from waste cooking oils (WCO) with one-step addition of methanol in a solvent-free system. Immobilized MAS1 lipase was selected for the transesterification reactions with one-step addition of methanol due to its much more higher biodiesel yield (89.50%) when compared with the other three commercial immobilized lipases (&lt;10%). The highest biodiesel yield (95.45%) was acquired with one-step addition of methanol under the optimized conditions. Moreover, it was observed that immobilized MAS1 lipase retained approximately 70% of its initial activity after being used for four batch cycles. Finally, the obtained biodiesel was further characterized using FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. These findings indicated that immobilized MAS1 lipase is a promising catalyst for biodiesel production from WCO with one-step addition of methanol under high methanol concentration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using FeCl3-modified resin as heterogeneous catalyst were investigated. Under optimised conditions of methanol/oil molar ratio of 10:1, catalyst content of 8%, reaction time of 90 °C and reaction time of 120 min, a high transesterification rate of about 92% was achieved. A comprehensive kinetic model was established for the transesterification reaction, the result illustrated that the transesterification of waste cooking oil and methanol catalysed by FeCl3-modified resin was confirmed for Rideal model, and the transesterification reaction was verified for the first order reaction controlled by the interfacial chemical reaction diffusion. The main physical–chemical properties of biodiesel met the ASTM D-6751 (American Society for Testing and Materials D-6751) standard. Compared with concentrated sulfuric acid catalyst, the eminent characteristics of reusability and operational stability made the resin catalyst more ascendant for biodiesel production. The results of present research showed that transesterification process catalysed by FeCl3-modified resin was an effective and low cost technology for biodiesel industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The techno-economics for producing liquid fuels from Maine forest residues were determined from a combination of: (1) laboratory experiments at USDA-ARS's Eastern Regional Research Center using hog fuel (a secondary woody residue produced from mill byproducts such as sawdust, bark and shavings) as a feedstock for pyrolysis to establish product yields and composition, and (2) Aspen Plus® process simulation for a feed rate of 2000 dry metric tons per day to estimate energy requirements and equipment sizes. The simulated plant includes feedstock sizing and drying, pyrolysis, hydrogen production and hydrotreatment of pyrolysis oils. The biomass is converted into bio-oil (61% yield), char (24%) and gases (15%) in the pyrolysis reactor, with an energy demand of 17%. The bio-oil is then hydrotreated to remove oxygen, thereby producing hydrocarbon fuels. The final mass yield of gasoline/diesel hydrocarbons is 16% with a 40% energy yield based on the dry biomass fed, this yield represents a fuel production of 51.9 gallons per dry metric ton of feedstock. A unique aspect of the process simulated herein is that pyrolysis char and gases are used as sources for both thermal energy and hydrogen, greatly decreasing the need to input fossil energy. The total capital investment for a grass-roots plant was estimated to be US$427 million with an annual operational cost of US$154 million. With a 30 year project life, a minimum fuel selling price was determined to be US$6.25 per gallon. The economic concerns are related to high capital costs, high feedstock costs and short hydrotreating catalyst lifetimes. © 2016

AB  - The production of biodiesel has rapid development in the recent years due to the benefits associated with its ability to minimize environmental pollution. Heterogeneous catalyst for production of biodiesel is a preferred route for its easier recovery and no demand for aqueous treatment. Transesterification of fatty acids into biodiesel using transition metal oxide gives higher conversion into their corresponding methyl esters in a short time. In the present work, manganese doped zinc oxide is used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the production of biodiesel from Mahua oil. The synthesized manganese doped zinc oxide nanocatalyst was characterized by XRD and SEM. The SEM and XRD results confirmed the hexagonal structure of the catalyst with the particle size of 24.18 nm. The 8% (w/v) catalyst concentration, 1:7% (v/v) of oil to methanol ratio, 50 min of reaction time and 50 °C of reaction temperature were found to be the optimum process condition for the maximum biodiesel yield of 97%. The presence of methyl esters in biodiesel was confirmed by FT-IR and GC-MS analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Researchers all around the world are making strenuous efforts to find alternative fuel to ameliorate the problem of depletion of fossil fuel. we have identified a novel plant based biofuel, namely Cymbopogon flexuous biofuel. It has excellent fuel properties and is widely available in India and it seems to have the potential to make India self-sufficient in energy production. Cerium oxide nanoparticles were synthesized using sol–gel combustion methods. Their structural, morphological and elemental properties were studied with the help of XRD, SEM, TEM and EDS respectively. On volume basis, 20% raw Cymbopogon flexuous biofuel was blended with diesel fuel, and various proportions of Cerium oxide nanoparticles, namely C20-D80 + 10 ppm, C20-D80 + 20 ppm andC20-D80 + 30 ppm were prepared. The properties like density, kinematic viscosity, calorific value of the test fuel were measured as per ASTM standards and compared with those of diesel fuel. An experimental study of its performance, emission, and combustion behavior was conducted at varied load conditions at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. NOx and smoke emission was simultaneously reduced by 3% and 6.6% respectively as compared with biofuel blend. Due to higher thermal stability and oxygen buffer of Cerium oxide nanoparticle the brake thermal efficiency was higher by 4.76% and cylinder pressure and heat release rate was also higher. © 2016 Energy Institute

AB  - In the present study, Trichoderma reesei cellulase was covalently immobilized on chitosan-coated magnetic nanoparticles using glutaraldehyde as a coupling agent. The average diameter of magnetic nanoparticles before and after enzyme immobilization was about 8 and 10 nm, respectively. The immobilized enzyme retained about 37 % of its initial activity, and also showed better thermal and storage stability than free enzyme. Immobilized cellulase retained about 80 % of its activity after 15 cycles of carboxymethylcellulose hydrolysis and was easily separated with the application of an external magnetic field. However, in this reaction, Kmwas increased eight times. The immobilized enzyme was able to hydrolyze lignocellulosic material from Agave atrovirens leaves with yield close to the amount detected with free enzyme and it was re-used in vegetal material conversion up to four cycles with 50 % of activity decrease. This provides an opportunity to reduce the enzyme consumption during lignocellulosic material saccharification for bioethanol production. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The influence of various solvents (H2O, CH3OH, and C2H5OH) on product distribution and nature of products during hydrothermal liquefaction of sargassum tenerrimum algae has been examined. Hydrothermal liquefaction was performed using H2O (260, 280 and 300 °C) and organic solvents CH3OH and C2H5OH (280 °C) for 15 min. The use of organic solvents significantly increased the yield of bio-oil. In the case of liquefaction with CH3OH and C2H5OH, the bio-oil yield was 22.8 and 23.8 wt.% respectively whereas the bio-oil yield was 16.33 wt.% with H2O. GC–MS analysis of the liquid products indicated the presence of various organic compounds including aromatics, nitrogenated and oxygenated compounds and higher selectivity amount of ester compounds were observed in the presence of alcoholic solvents. NMR and FT-IR showed that present of solvents have an effect on the decomposition of sargassum tenerrimum algae. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of biomass has a potential to change the quality of pyrolytic bio-oil. In this work, co-pyrolysis of bamboo, a typical lignocellulosic biomass, and Nannochloropsis sp. (NS), a microalgae, was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at a range of mixing ratio of NS and bamboo, to find out whether the quality of pyrolytic bio-oil was improved. A significant improvement on bio-oil after co-pyrolysis of bamboo and NS was observed that bio-oil yield increased up to 66.63 wt% (at 1:1) and the content of long-chain fatty acids in bio-oil also dramatically increased (the maximum up to 50.92% (13.57 wt%) at 1:1) whereas acetic acid, O-containing species, and N-containing compounds decreased greatly. Nitrogen transformation mechanism during co-pyrolysis also was explored. Results showed that nitrogen in microalgae preferred to transform into solid char and gas phase during co-pyrolysis, while more pyrrolic-N and quaternary-N generated with diminishing protein-N and pyridinic-N in char. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper shows a detailed analysis of a biomass HTL process by considering changes in three main reaction variables (i.e. catalysts (water, Na2CO3(aq.), and Fe(aq.)), temperature (280–340 °C), and catalysts/biomass mass ratio (0–0.33 kg catalysts/kg biomass)), and by assessing their influence on the techno-economic and GHG emissions performance. This analysis is based on Aspen Plus® simulations, process economics and life-cycle GHG assessment on SimaPro (using Ecoinvent 2.2). Results showed that the lowest production cost for biocrude oil is achieved when HTL is performed at 340 °C with Fe as catalyst (450 €/tbiocrude-oil or 13.6 €/GJbiocrude-oil). At these conditions, the biocrude oil produced has an oxygen content of 16.6 wt% and a LHV of 33.1 MJ/kgbiocrude-oil. When the hydrotreatment and hydrogen generation units are included, the total production costs was 1040 €/tupgraded-oil or 0.8 €/Lupgraded-oil. After fractionation, the estimated production cost was 1086 €/tbiojet-fuel or 25.1 €/GJbiojet-fuel. This value is twice the commercial price of fossil jet fuel. However, the allocated life cycle GHG emissions for renewable jet fuel were estimated at 13.1 kgCO2-eq./GJbiojet-fuel, representing only 15% the GHG emission of fossil jet fuel and therefore, indicating a significant potential on GHG emission reduction. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This study investigated the influence of waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel on the combustion, unregulated gaseous emissions and particulate emissions of a diesel engine. Experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine fueled with diesel, B20 (20% biodiesel on volume basis), B50, B75 and biodiesel, under the Japanese 13-mode test cycle. Biodiesel increases the in-cylinder pressure, shortens the ignition delay and combustion duration, and lowers the maximum heat release rate. An increase of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is also observed when using biodiesel. For brake thermal efficiency (BTE), no significant changes are found in most of the tested modes. Biodiesel increases the weighted brake specific emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, propene, ethene, benzene, but reduces the weighted brake specific emissions of toluene and xylene. No significant changes are observed for the ozone formation potential of these unregulated gaseous emissions among the tested fuels. Biodiesel reduces the weighted particle mass concentration (PMC) and the weighted geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles, however, significant reductions in the weighted total number concentration (TNC) are only observed when using B75 or biodiesel. Overall, the influence of biodiesel on the investigated emissions is proportional to the biodiesel content in the tested fuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The optimization of bio-oil produced from sewage sludge using fast pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor was investigated. Effects of temperature, sludge particle size and vapor residence time on bio-oil properties, such as yield, high heating value (HHV) and moisture content were evaluated through experimental and statistical analyses. Characterization of the pyrolysis products (bio-oil and biogas) was also done. Optimum conditions produced a bio-oil product with an HHV that is nearly twice as much as lignocellulosic-derived bio-oil, and with properties comparable to heavy fuel oil. Contrary to generally acidic bio-oil, the sludge-derived bio-oil has almost neutral pH which could minimize the pipeline and engine corrosions. The Fourier Transform Infrared and gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses of bio-oil showed a dominant presence of gasoline-like compounds. These results demonstrate that fast pyrolysis of sewage sludge from domestic wastewater treatment plant is a favorable technology to produce biofuels for various applications. © 2016 Chinese Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taiwan

AB  - Solar pyrolysis of biomass is a smart way to upgrade biomass and, thus, store intermittent solar energy as solar fuels (gas, bio-char and bio-oil). Distribution and energy content of gas, char and oil depend on experimental conditions. In order to determine these characteristics, experiments have been performed at temperatures of 600, 900, 1200 and 2000 °C, heating rate of 50 °C/s and argon flow rate of 6 NL/min. The gas product was analyzed by micro-GC. The char product was characterized by CHNS, whereas the oil product was subjected to CHNS, Karl-Fischer titration and GC–MS analysis. The LHVs (lower heating values) for gas, char and oil were determined from empirical equations. The gas product yield and LHV significantly increase with temperature, which is mainly due to more H2 and CO formation by the enhanced secondary tar reactions. The char and oil characteristics highly depend on the temperature. Their high energy contents show that the obtained char and oil can be utilized as valuable solid and liquid fuels. The biomass energy upgrading due to solar processing is discussed. At optimum temperature 900 °C, it ranges from 38% to 53% accounting for the uncertainty of bio-oil water content. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present experimental study, CI engine is made to run on 100% Calophyllum Inophyllum Methly Ester (CIME) biodiesel and the same dozed with fuel additives. The study mainly focuses on the influence of two types of fuel additives namely Zinc oxide (ZnO) which is a metal oxide nanoparticle and Ethanox which is an antioxidant. ZnO was added to CIME in the form of nanofluid at different constituent levels of 50 ppm and 10 ppm while Ethanox was added at concentration levels of 200 ppm and 500 ppm. Addition of 100 ppm of ZnO improves the efficiency by 4.7% and 12.6% reduction of NOx at full load. These improvements arise due to the catalytic effect of nanoparticle and micro explosion of water molecules present in the fuel. Antioxidants inhibit the formation of free radicals, Ethanox was found to be better fuel additives in terms of NOx reduction and 500 ppm of Ethanox results in maximum decrease of 17.8%. But this improvement was found to be achieved at the expense of HC and CO. A slight improvement achieved in efficiency for fuel samples containing antioxidant can be attributed to the volumetric effect which arises due to unmodified injection rate and increase in density of the fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Improvisation of the biodiesel production by employing heterogeneous catalyst and its optimization is the best way to mitigate the growing concern with the traditional feedstocks and their prices. The present study is aimed at optimizing the biodiesel production process and identifying significant parameters affecting the biodiesel yield. The biodiesel is synthesized from rubber seed oil (RSO) using indigenously prepared iron doped catalyst (Fe/C). The optimized condition obtained by maximizing the RSME (Rubber seed oil methyl ester) yield at 97.5% are catalyst loading 4.5 wt%, Methanol/Oil (M/O) 9:1, temperature 60 °C and agitation speed 1250 RPM. The physicochemical properties of RSME produced at optimized condition are found to be within the prescribed limits suggested by ASTM. The contribution factor estimated for individual parameters revealed that temperature, agitation speed, and M/O ratio have a more significant effect on the RSME yield. The reusability of the Fe/C catalyst was also studied to check its activity in the reuse and found to be effective after three cycles with appreciable catalytic activity. Hence, the study reveals RSO could be effective feedstock for the production of biodiesel using novel Fe/C catalyst to produce energy efficient and cost effective RSME towards the production of sustainable energy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil is a condensable liquid produced from the pyrolysis of biomass, which can be upgraded to biofuels. Bio-oil is corrosive as it contains significant amounts of carboxylic acids, creating difficulties in handling of bio-oil and applications of bio-oil. Acid-treatment of bio-oil in alcohols is an upgrading method to transform the carboxylic acids in bio-oil into neutral esters. This study reviewed the recent progress in the research about the acid-catalyzed conversion of bio-oil in alcohols. The various catalytic processes for the acid treatment of bio-oil and the reaction network of some individual components of bio-oil during the upgrading were focused. The interactions among the main components of bio-oil during the acid-treatments were also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, renewable energy resources have become more important due to the limited number of regions for production of petroleum-based fuels, which are continuously depleting. The aviation sector in terms of commercial and cargo transportation has an increasing need for conventional, as well as, alternative fuels. Derivatives of petroleum fuels used in aviation have negative impacts on air quality. Factors causing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the aviation sector must be reduced. However, such fuels used in the aviation sector are not sustainable. Biofuels which have the potential to replace petroleum fuels and help with emissions are heavily investigated in developed countries for independency, creating a better environment and sustainability. Biofuels which are already used for ground vehicles could also be implemented in the aviation sector to reduce fuel cost and emissions. Overall, aviation fuels made of sustainable resources would also support social and economic development. Numerous industrial initiatives have emerged to find alternative ways to attain bio-aviation fuels. Therefore, there is an increasing level of research with regards to alternative aviation fuels made of biomass in recent years. It is important to obtain basic feedstocks and to develop biofuel production processes in a cost-effective way. This study examines the necessity and the types of biofuels in the aviation sector. By designing unique fuel systems for air vehicles, it is possible to formulate biofuels which can be used for both air and ground vehicle applications. This type of consensus would help with sustainability and a better environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The synthesis of high-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of waste lignin to advanced biofuels is crucial for enhancing current biorefinery processes. Inexpensive transition metals, including Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn, were severally co-loaded with Ru on HY zeolite to form bimetallic and bifunctional catalysts. These catalysts were subsequently tested for HDO conversion of softwood lignin and several lignin model compounds. Results indicated that the inexpensive earth-abundant metals could modulate the hydrogenolysis activity of Ru and decrease the yield of low-molecular-weight gaseous products. Among these catalysts, Ru-Cu/HY showed the best HDO performance, affording the highest selectivity to hydrocarbon products. The improved catalytic performance of Ru-Cu/HY was probably a result of the following three factors: (1) high total and strong acid sites, (2) good dispersion of metal species and limited segregation, and (3) high adsorption capacity for polar fractions, including hydroxyl groups and ether bonds. Moreover, all bifunctional catalysts proved to be superior over the combination catalysts of Ru/Al2O3 and HY zeolite. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Used frying oil (UFO), a waste produced in large volume each year worldwide, represents a potential resource for biofuel production rather than a disposal problem for modern society. Pyrolysis technique using microwave heating offers a promising approach for the conversion of UFO into biofuel products with improved properties. In this study, pyrolysis of UFO was performed by contacting with a bed of microwave absorbents heated by microwave radiation. The pyrolysis approach was examined using different materials as the reaction bed, comprising particulate carbon, activated carbon and mesoporous aluminosilicate (MCM-41). The use of particulate and activated carbon as the reaction bed provided a fast heating rate and extensive cracking capacity to pyrolyze the used oil, thus showing favorable features that could lead to short process time and less energy usage. This resulted in a production of a high yield of a biofuel product (up to 73 wt%) in a process taking less than 35 min. The biofuel showed a composition dominated by light C5-C20 aliphatic hydrocarbons with low amounts of oxygenated compounds (≤11%). In particular, the oil product obtained from activated carbon bed showed a low nitrogen content and was free of carboxylic acid and sulphur. The absence of carboxylic acids with low amounts of oxygenated compounds could reduce the formation of oxygenated by-products that could generate undesirable acidic tar or potentially hazardous sludge in the biofuel during storage. Combined with the detection of a high calorific value (46 MJ/kg) nearly comparable to diesel fuel, the biofuel shows great promise to be upgraded for use as a ‘cleaner’ fuel source with potentially reduced oxygenated by-products plus low or zero emissions of NOx and SOx during the use of the fuel in combustion process. This study also revealed that the use of activated carbon bed results in the highest energy recovery (88–90%) from the used frying oil. Our results demonstrated that the use of a microwave-heated reaction bed of activated carbon shows great potential as an improved and sustainable pyrolysis approach that is energy-efficient and timesaving for the recycling of used frying oil into a biofuel product with desirable properties. This pyrolysis approach provides an alternative to transesterification that avoids the use of solvents and catalysts, and thus could be developed further as a promising route to recycle various types of waste and biomass materials. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Furfural is an important fuel precursor which can be converted to hydrocarbon fuels and fuel intermediates. In this work, the production of furfural by dehydration of process-relevant pentose rich corn stover hydrolyzate using a biphasic batch reaction system has been investigated. Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and toluene have been used to extract furfural and enhance overall furfural yield by limiting its degradation to humins. The effects of reaction time, temperature, and acid concentration (H2SO4) on pentose conversion and furfural yield were investigated. For the dehydration of 8 wt % pentose-rich corn stover hydrolyzate under optimum reaction conditions, 0.05 M H2SO4, 170 °C for 20 min with MIBK as the solvent, complete conversion of xylose (98-100%) and a furfural yield of 80% were obtained. Under these same conditions, except with toluene as the solvent, the furfural yield was 77%. Additionally, dehydration of process-relevant pentose rich corn stover hydrolyzate using solid acid ion-exchange resins under optimum reaction conditions has shown that Purolite CT275 is as effective as H2SO4 for obtaining furfural yields approaching 80% using a biphasic batch reaction system. This work has demonstrated that a biphasic reaction system can be used to process biomass-derived pentose rich sugar hydrolyzates to furfural in yields approaching 80%. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The performance (activity, selectivity and stability) of a Pt-Pd catalyst supported on a phosphorus-containing activated carbon (ACP) has been studied in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of raw bio-oil, and compared with another bifunctional catalyst prepared with a FCC (Fluid Catalytic Cracking) catalyst as acid support. Experiments have been carried out in a fixed bed reactor under the following conditions: 400–450 °C; 65 bar; space time, 0.18 gcat h g−1 bio-oil; H2:bio-oil ratio, 20 cm3 H2 (STP) cm−3 bio-oil; time on stream, 0–10 h. The catalyst reaches a pseudo-steady state at 450 °C after 6 h of time on stream, preserving a constant activity as a consequence of the simultaneous formation and hydrocracking of the deposited coke. In these conditions, the yield of C5+ hydrocarbons is 20 wt%. This organic liquid fraction mainly contains aromatics, and thus, it may require an additional mild hydrocracking treatment for its valorization as fuel. On the other hand, the gas fraction obtained can be used directly as fuel, and the aqueous liquid fraction (with a high concentration of methanol, 58 wt%) is interesting as co-feedstock with methanol in a methanol to olefins (MTO) unit. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The major drawbacks of using biodiesel as a neat fuel are low oxidation stability, high viscosity, lower thermal efficiency and higher NOx emission. Many studies have been attempted to reduce the drawbacks of biodiesel and to use it as a conventional fuel. The present work aims to reduce the problems associated with neat biodiesel using addition of non-polluting additives. Mahua oil has been chosen as a biodiesel due to its non-edible nature and properties similar to diesel. Mahua oil methyl ester (MOME) was prepared by conventional transesterification. Ferrofluid, comprising of magnetite of 14 nm size was added to the base fuel and is referred to as MOMEF (Mahua Oil Methyl Ester with the addition of Ferrofluid). The advantage of ferrofluid is that, unlike other additives, it can be extracted from the exhaust gas. Ferrofluid releases additional heat during the course of the combustion process which reduces its conventional drawbacks. Furthermore, it can be easily diluted to biodiesel and as a result it can collect the benefits of water-biodiesel emulsions. This fuel modification is expected to improve the properties of mahua oil methyl-ester and to eliminate problems associated with it. Performance, combustion and emission tests were carried out in a 21 kW power, four-stroke, twin-cylinder, direct-injection, compression-ignition engine. Experimentally, it was observed that methyl esters of mahua oil can be combusted in an IC engine like other biofuels without any major modifications. Experiments were conducted with MOME and MOMEF and are compared with conventional diesel. The experimental analysis revealed an increase in brake thermal efficiency of about 5.27% and a decrease in brake specific fuel consumption of about 5.37%. In addition the HC, CO and NOx emissions were reduced by 10.8%, 6.44% and 9.49% respectively. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - We describe a study to identify potential biofuels that enable advanced spark ignition (SI) engine efficiency strategies to be pursued more aggressively. A list of potential biomass-derived blendstocks was developed. An online database of properties and characteristics of these bioblendstocks was created and populated. Fuel properties were determined by measurement, model prediction, or literature review. Screening criteria were developed to determine if a bioblendstock met the requirements for advanced SI engines. Criteria included melting point (or cloud point) < -10°C and boiling point (or T90) <165°C. Compounds insoluble or poorly soluble in hydrocarbon were eliminated from consideration, as were those known to cause corrosion (carboxylic acids or high acid number mixtures) and those with hazard classification as known or suspected carcinogens or reproductive toxins. Compounds predicted to be less anaerobically biodegradable than methyl-tert-butyl ether with water solubility greater than 10,000 mg/L were also eliminated. A minimum Research octane number (RON) of 98 was applied. These criteria produced a list of 40 bioblendstocks with promising properties. Additional property data, including Motor octane number (MON), heat of vaporization, and lower heating value, were acquired for these bioblendstocks. A subset of the bioblendstocks representing all functional groups were blended into gasoline or a gasoline surrogate to measure their effect on vapor pressure, distillation curve, oxidation stability, RON, and MON. For blending into a conventional or reformulated blendstock for E10 blending, ethanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, and diisobutylene have the most desirable properties for blending of a high-octane advanced SI engine fuel. © 2017, SAE International.

AB  - The concept of an integrated biorefinery has increasing importance regarding sustainability aspects. However, the typical concepts have techno-economic issues: limited replacement in co-processing with fossil sources and high investment costs in integration to a specific plant. These issues have directed the current investigations to supply-chain network systems. On the other hand, these studies have the scope of a specific product and/or a feedstock type. This paper proposes a novel biorefinery concept for lignocellulosic biomass: sectoral integration network and a new hydrothermal process for biomass conversion. The sectoral integration concept has the potential for sustainable production from biomass: pre-treatment at the biomass sites, regional distributed conversion of biomass from various sectors (e.g. black liquor, sawdust, straw) and centralized upgrading/separation of crude biofuels. On the other hand, the conversion processes compose the vital part of such a concept. The new conversion involves partial wet oxidation - or simultaneous dissolution with partial wet oxidation for solid biomass- followed by lignin recovery with acidification and a reactor that can perform either hydrothermal liquefaction or supercritical water gasification. The process can intake both liquid and solid biomass to produce lignin as biomaterial and syngas or bio-oil. The new concept can contribute social development of rural areas by utilizing waste as valuable raw material for the production of multiple products and reduce the net greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil-based production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study we report on sulfonated graphene, obtained by chemical exfoliation of inexpensive graphite and functionalization of the resulting graphene sheets with benzene sulfonic acid, as a new active catalyst for the transesterification of palm oil with methanol into biodiesel. The experimental conditions for obtaining fatty acid methyl esters were carefully optimized through the evaluation of several parameters including the catalyst loading, temperature, reaction time and methanol-to-oil molar ratio. Of particular relevance, we noticed that an excess of methanol was required to allow high transesterification yield, but an excessive dilution proved to be deleterious for the reaction yield due to lower interactions between the reactants and the catalyst. The heterogeneous catalyst showed a high thermal robustness and was successfully recycled without significant erosion of the reaction yield. Our catalytic system yields biodiesel with a high purity (>98%) after a single filtration and do not produce aqueous waste. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel approach of the immobilization of a highly selective and stable glucose biosensor based on direct electrochemistry was fabricated by a self-assembly of glucose oxidase (GOD) on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) covalently conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) modified on a magnetic screen-printed electrode (MSPE). The RGO-Fe3O4 nanocomposite has remarkable enhancement in large surface areas, is favorable environment for enzyme immobilization, facilitates electron transfer between enzymes and electrode surfaces and possesses superparamagnetism property. The morphology and electrochemical properties of RGO-Fe3O4/GOD were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometry. The modified electrode was a fast, direct electron transfer with an apparent electron transfer rate constant (ks) of 13.78 s− 1. The proposed biosensor showed fast amperometric response (3 s) to glucose with a wide linear range from 0.05 to 1 mM, a low detection limit of 0.1 μM at a signal to noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3) and good sensitivity (5.9 μA/mM). The resulting biosensor has high stability, good reproducibility, excellent selectivity and successfully applied detection potential at − 0.45 V. This mediatorless glucose sensing used the advantages of covalent bonding and self-assembly as a new approach for immobilizing enzymes without any binder. It would be worth noting that it opens a new avenue for fabricating excellent electrochemical biosensors. Novelty statement This is a new approach that reporting the immobilization of glucose oxidase on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) covalently conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) by electrostatic interaction and modified screen printed electrode. We propose the reagentless with fabrication method without binder and adhesive agents for immobilized enzyme. Fe3O4 NPs increasing surface area to enhance the immobilization and prevent the leaching of enzymes at electrode surfaces by magnetic stickers which is improve the stability of the biosensor. Based on this synthesis technique, it is a good new strategy and simple used to fabrication of third-generation glucose biosensor and this nanocomposite could be used as a platform for disposable biosensor and biofuel cell applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Deactivation of zeolite catalysts due to coke deposition is a pronounced challenge in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil. This paper reports on the mechanism of coke formation and catalyst regeneration for two catalysts (Ni/HZSM-5, Ni-Cu/HZSM-5). FT-IR, XPS and Raman spectroscopy characterizations indicate that catalyst deactivation can be divided into three main stages: (1) Lewis acid sites in HZSM-5 support are rapidly covered by oxygenated hydrocarbons. The Brønsted acid sites of HZSM-5 donate protons to oxygenates, leading to the formation of carbocations - precursors of soluble coke on the catalyst surfaces. (2) Soluble coke is then stacked to form disordered filament-like carbon strands that are similar to carbon nanotubes or graphite-like structures. (3) Filament-like carbon evolves into graphite carbon. At the same HDO temperature, more graphite particles are found on the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst than on the Ni-Cu/HZSM-5 catalyst, indicating higher resistance for the coke formation for Ni-Cu/HZSM-5 catalyst. © 2016

AB  - This paper discusses the research activities done at Politecnico di Milano in the field of the detailed kinetic modeling of pyrolysis and combustion of biomass and bio-oil formation. Different critical steps are involved in this multicomponent, multiphase and multiscale problem. The first complexity relies on biomass characterization with the selection of reference species: cellulose, hemicellulose, lignins, and extractives. Fast pyrolysis involves kinetic mechanisms, first in the solid phase for biomass pyrolysis, then in gas-phase for secondary reactions of released products. These mechanisms involve large number of species and reactions, which make computations expensive. They need to be simplified, while still maintaining their description capability. Lumping procedures are extensively applied to allow the development of the overall model. Multistep pyrolysis mechanisms of reference species are discussed in this Note, with several comparisons with experimental data. A peculiarity of the model is its ability to provide detailed compositions of pyrolysis products and solid residue. Catalytic effect of ash on pyrolysis products is also discussed. A companion paper will discuss the successive or secondary gas phase reactions of pyrolysis products, together with the heterogeneous reactions of residual char. Finally, the modeling of bio-oil formation requires a comprehensive description of the coupling of kinetic and transport processes, both at the particle and the reactor scale. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - ConspectusGrowing concern with the environmental impact of CO2 emissions produced by combustion of fuels derived from fossil-based carbon resources has stimulated the search for renewable sources of carbon. Much of this focus has been on the development of methods for producing transportation fuels, the major source of CO2 emissions today, and to a lesser extent on the production of lubricants and chemicals. First-generation biofuels such as bioethanol, produced by the fermentation of sugar cane- or corn-based sugars, and biodiesel, produced by the transesterification reaction of triglycerides with alcohols to form a mixture of long-chain fatty esters, can be blended with traditional fuels in limited amounts and also arise in food versus fuel debates. Producing molecules that can be drop-in solutions for fossil-derived products used in the transportation sector allows for efficient use of the existing infrastructure and is therefore particularly interesting. In this context, the most viable source of renewable carbon is abundantly available lignocellulosic biomass, a complex mixture of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. Conversion of the carbohydrate portion of biomass (hemicellulose and cellulose) to fuels requires considerable chemical restructuring of the component sugars in order to achieve the energy density and combustion properties required for transportation fuels - gasoline, diesel, and jet. A different set of constraints must be met for the conversion of biomass-sourced sugars to lubricants and chemicals. This Account describes strategies developed by us to utilize aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, furfurals, and carboxylic acids derived from C5 and C6 sugars, acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixtures, and various biomass-derived carboxylic acids and fatty acids to produce fuels, lubricants, and chemicals. Oxygen removal from these synthons is achieved by dehydration, decarboxylation, hydrogenolysis, and hydrodeoxygenation, whereas reactions such as aldol condensation, etherification, alkylation, and ketonization are used to build up the number of carbon atoms in the final product. We show that our strategies lead to high-octane components that can be blended into gasoline, C9-C22 compounds that possess energy densities and properties required for diesel and jet fuels, and lubricants that are equivalent or superior to current synthetic lubricants. Replacing a fraction of the crude-oil-derived products with such renewable sources can mitigate the negative impact of the transportation sector on overall anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change potential. While ethanol is a well-known fuel additive, there is significant interest in using ethanol as a platform molecule to manufacture a variety of valuable chemicals. We show that bioethanol can be converted with high selectivity to butanol or 1,3-butadiene, providing interesting alternatives to the current production from petroleum. Finally, we report that several of the strategies developed have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 55-80% relative to those for petroleum-based processes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was produced from safflower seeds by converting the raw oil obtained through dampening them via the rolling process, roasting at 90 °C and pressing into Safflower Oil Methyl Esther (Safflower Biodiesel) using the trans-esterification method. Experimental fuels were obtained in the forms of D100, B2.5M2.5D95, B5M5D90, B5M2.5D92.5and B2.5M5D92.5by mixing the biodiesel fuel obtained from safflower with diesel fuel, adding bio-ethanol at the rates of 2.5% and 5%, and volumetrically in inverse ratio. Tests were conducted to determine the fuel properties of the mixed fuels obtained and the diesel fuel, their kinematic viscosity, density, water content, pH level, caloric value, flash point, clouding, pour and freezing points, copper bar corrosion test, iodine number, CFPP (Cold Filter Plugging Point) test and cetane number. Moreover, the mixtures obtained and the diesel fuel were tried and examined in a water-cooled, four-stroke, single cylinder diesel engine that had a direct injection fuel system. As a result of the experiments, performance characteristics of the test engine were obtained. Exhaust emission values (CO, CO2, HC, O2, SO2, NOx) were obtained from the exhaust stack of the test engine using the probe of the gas analysis device. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Torrefaction of energy sorghum and sweet sorghum bagasse was investigated at three different temperatures (250, 275 &amp; 300 °C) for 30 min to determine product yields and its compositions. The torrefied solid yield ranged from 43% to 65% for sweet sorghum bagasse and 51–70% for energy sorghum. The energy density of both torrefied sorghums increased between 1.6 and 1.4 folds. Besides water, the acetic acid, with a maximum yield of 101.90 g L−1was the dominant compound in the aqueous fraction of liquid products. The aqueous fraction from sweet sorghum bagasse contained furfural and furan carboxyl aldehydes, while ketones and alcohols were dominant from energy sorghum as other key compounds. Phenolic type chemicals and furan derivatives were the major compounds in the oil fraction of the liquid product, accounted up to 58 wt%. The condensable liquid products can be further upgraded into high-value platform chemicals. © 2017

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable resource and can be efficiently converted into bio-energy by a bio-refinery. From the various techniques available for biomass thermo-chemical conversion; microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) seems to be the very promising. The principles of microwave technology were reviewed and the parameters for the efficient production of bio-oil using microwave technology were summarized. Microwave technology by itself cannot efficiently produce high quality bio-oil products, catalysts are used to improve the reaction conditions and selectivity for valued products during MAP. The catalysts used to optimize MAP are revised in the development of this article. The origins for bio-oils that are phenol rich or hydrocarbon rich are reviewed and their experimental results were summarized. The kinetics of MAP is discussed briefly in the development of the article. Future prospects and scientific development of MAP are also considered in the development of this article. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biochar is a carbon-rich by-product of the thermal conversion of organic feedstocks and is primarily used as a soil amendment. Identification and quantification of biochar properties are important to ensure optimal outcomes for agricultural or environmental applications. Advanced spectroscopic techniques have recently been adopted in biochar characterization. However, biochar characterization approaches rely entirely on the user's choice and accessibility to the new technology. The selection of proper methods is vital to accurately and consistently assess biochar properties. This review critically evaluates current biochar characterization methods of proximate, ultimate, physicochemical, surface and structural analyses, and important biochar properties for various applications. © 2017, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Raw bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis of pine woodchips was co-processed with standard Brazilian vacuum gasoil (VGO) and tested in a 200 kg⋅h−1 fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) demonstration-scale unit using a commercial FCC equilibrium catalyst. Two different bio-oil/VGO weight ratios were used: 5/95 and 10/90. Co-processing of raw bio-oil in FCC was shown to be technically feasible. Bio-oil could be directly co-processed with a regular gasoil FCC feed up to 10 wt%. The bio-oil and the conventional gasoil were cracked into valuable liquid products such as gasoline and diesel range products. Most of the oxygen present in the bio-oil was eliminated as water and carbon monoxide as these yields were always higher than that of carbon dioxide. Product quality analysis shows that trace oxygenates, primarily alkyl phenols, in FCC gasoline and diesel products are present with or without co-processing oxygenated intermediates. The oxygenate concentrations increase with co-processing, but have not resulted in increased concerns with quality of fuel properties. The presence of renewable carbon was confirmed in gasoline and diesel cuts through 14C isotopic analysis, showing that renewable carbon is not only being converted into coke, CO, and CO2, but also into valuable refining liquid products. Thus, gasoline and diesel could be produced from lignocellulosic raw materials through a conventional refining scheme, which uses the catalytic cracking process. The bio-oil renewable carbon conversion into liquid products (carbon efficiency) was approximately 30%, well above the efficiency found in literature for FCC bio-oil upgrading. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - A successful pilot-scale process for biodiesel production from microbial oil (Biooil) produced by Rhodosporidium toruloides DEBB 5533 is presented. Using fed-batch strategy (1000 L working volume), a lipid productivity of 0.44 g/L.h was obtained using a low-cost medium composed by sugarcane juice and urea. The microbial oil was used for biodiesel production and its performance was evaluated in diesel engine tests, showing very good performance, especially for the blend B20 SCO, when operating at 2500 rpm with lower pollutant emissions (CO2 – 220% less; CO – 7-fold less; NOX 50% less and no detectable HC emissions (&lt;0.11 ppm)) when compared with the blends of standard biofuel from soybean oil. A preliminary analysis showed that microbial biodiesel is economically competitive (US$ 0.76/L) when compared to the vegetable biodiesel (US$ 0.81/L). Besides, the yield of biodiesel from microbial oil is higher (4172 L/ha of cultivated sugarcane) that represents 6.3-fold the yield of standard biodiesel (661 L/ha of cultivated soybean). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) and furfural (FF) have been identified as valuable biomass-derived fuel precursors suitable for catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) to produce high octane fuel additives such dimethyl furan (DMF) and methyl furan (MF), respectively. In order to realize economically viable production of DMF and MF from biomass, catalytic processes with high yields, low catalyst costs, and process simplicity are needed. Here, we demonstrate simultaneous coprocessing of HMF and FF over Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalysts, achieving 87.5% yield of DMF from HMF and 88.5% yield of MF from FF in a one pot reaction. The Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalyst exhibited improved stability and regeneration compared to Cu/TiO2 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts for FF HDO, with a ∼7% loss in FF conversion over four sequential recycles, compared to a ∼50% loss in FF conversion for Cu/Al2O3 and a ∼30% loss in conversion for Cu/TiO2. Characterization of the Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalyst by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and H2-temperature-programmed reduction and comparison to monometallic Cu and Ni on Al2O3 and TiO2 and bimetallic Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts suggest that the unique reactivity and stability of Cu-Ni/TiO2 derives from support-induced metal segregation in which Cu is selectively enriched at the catalyst surface, while Ni is enriched at the TiO2 interface. These results demonstrate that Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalysts promise to be a system capable of integrating directly with a combined HMF and FF product stream from biomass processing to realize lower cost production of liquid fuels from biomass. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Driven by a range of sustainability challenges, e.g. climate change, resource depletion and expanding populations, a circular bioeconomy is emerging and expected to evolve progressively in the coming decades. South Africa along with other BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) represents the emerging bioeconomy and contributes significantly to global sugar market. In our research, South Africa is used as a case study to demonstrate the sustainable design for the future biorefineries annexed to existing sugar industry. Detailed techno-economic evaluation and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were applied to model alternative routes for converting sugarcane residues (bagasse and trash) to selected biofuel and/or biochemicals (ethanol, ethanol and lactic acid, ethanol and furfural, butanol, methanol and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, with co-production of surplus electricity) in an energy self-sufficient biorefinery system. Results: Economic assessment indicated that methanol synthesis with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 16.7% and ethanol-lactic acid co-production (20.5%) met the minimum investment criteria of 15%, while the latter had the lowest sensitivity to market price amongst all the scenarios. LCA results demonstrated that sugarcane cultivation was the most significant contributor to environmental impacts in all of the scenarios, other than the furfural production scenario in which a key step, a biphasic process with tetrahydrofuran solvent, had the most significant contribution. Conclusion: Overall, the thermochemical routes presented environmental advantages over biochemical pathways on most of the impact categories, except for acidification and eutrophication. Of the investigated scenarios, furfural production delivered the inferior environmental performance, while methanol production performed best due to its low reagent consumption. The combined techno-economic and environmental assessments identified the performance-limiting steps in the 2G biorefinery design for sugarcane industry and highlighted the technology development opportunities under circular bioeconomy context. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The main objective of this work was to study aromatics production via the catalytic pyrolysis upgrading of biomass using metal-loaded modified H-ZSM-5. M-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared through the impregnation method with Zn, Ga, Ni, Co, Mg and Cu. The prepared M-ZSM-5 catalysts were evaluated by x-ray diffraction, thermal desorption spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The properties, composition and product distribution of bio-oil were also analysed. Results showed that the M-ZSM-5 catalysts yielded a higher amount of non-condensable gas at the expense of the liquid yields. The Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts produced the highest yields of bio-oil (25.76 wt%), but the lowest amount of coke (22.08 wt%) compared with the unmodified ZSM-5 catalyst (33.38 wt%). The content of the single-ring aromatics prepared by using the Zn-ZSM-5 catalysts was the highest at 90.28 wt%, whereas that of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon prepared by the Ni-ZSM-5 catalysts was the highest at 31.36 wt%. Moreover, the selectivity of the single-ring aromatic hydrocarbons, such as C7 and C8, were significantly affected by the use of the M-ZSM-5 catalysts. The Zn-ZSM-5 catalysts were the most selective for toluene and xylenes with contents of 36.52 wt% and 35.32 wt%, respectively, whereas the Co-based catalysts were the most selective for indene. The Ni-based catalysts can obviously improve the selectivities of benzene production and C10+ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Zn-ZSM-5 was the most effective catalyst that can be used in the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A series of metal-zeolite hybrids was prepared by impregnation and deposition-precipitation methods and charaterized with different techniques. Catalytic performance of these catalysts on microwave-assisted conversion of selected carbohydrates to the fuel component methyl levulinate (ML) in methanol was studied. It was demonstrated that metal oxide content/type and acid-base bifunctionality were closely correlated with substrate conversion and ML yield, respectively. Among various as-prepared catalysts, zirconia-zeolite hybrid ZrY6(0.5) with moderate acid-base site content (0.97 &amp; 0.08 mmol g−1), high stability and porosity (average mesopore diameter: 6.2 nm) exhibited superior catalytic activity. At 180 °C, around 67–73%, 78%, 53% and 27% yields of ML could be achieved from monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, mannose and galactose), sucrose, starch and cellulose, respectively. The Zr-Y6(0.5) hybrid exhibited good stability, and could be reused for five times with ML yields of ≥63% from glucose. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fast microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignin and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with HZSM-5 and MgO was investigated. Effects of pyrolysis temperature, lignin to LDPE ratio, MgO to HZSM-5 ratio, and feedstock to catalyst ratio on the products yields and chemical profiles were examined. 500 °C was the optimal co-pyrolysis temperature in terms of the maximum bio-oil yield. The proportion of aromatics increased with increasing LDPE content. In addition, with the addition of LDPE (lignin/LDPE = 1/2), methoxyl group in the phenols was completely removed. A synergistic effect was found between lignin and LDPE. The proportion of aromatics increased and alkylated phenols decreased with increasing HZSM-5 to MgO ratio. The bio-oil yield increased with the addition of appropriate amount of catalyst and the proportion of alkylated phenols increased with increasing catalyst to feedstock ratio. © 2016

AB  - Worldwide consumption of hen eggs results in availability of large amount of discarded egg waste particularly egg shells. In the present study, the waste shells were utilized for the synthesis of highly active heterogeneous calcium oxide (CaO) nanocatalyst to transesterify dry biomass into methyl esters (biodiesel). The CaO nanocatalyst was synthesied by calcination-hydration–dehydration technique and fully characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), brunauer−emmett−teller (BET) elemental and thermogravimetric analysis. TEM image showed that the nano catalyst had spherical shape with average particle size of 75 nm. BET analysis indicated that the catalyst specific surface area was 16.4 m2 g-1 with average pore diameter of 5.07 nm. The effect of nano CaO catalyst was investigated by direct transesterification of dry biomass into biodiesel along with other reaction parameters such as catalyst ratio, reaction time and stirring rate. The impact of the transesterification reaction parameters and microalgal biodiesel yield were analyzed by response surface methodology based on a full factorial, central composite design. The significance of the predicted mode was verified and 86.41% microalgal biodiesel yield was reported at optimal parameter conditions 1.7% (w/w), catalyst ratio, 3.6 h reaction time and stirring rate of 140.6 rpm. The biodiesel conversion was determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The fuel properties of prepared biodiesel were found to be highly comply with the biodiesel standard ASTMD6751 and EN14214. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, pure petroleum diesel fuel, blends of canola-safflower biodiesel and oxygenated fuel additives such as solketal and ethanol were tested in a common rail diesel engine under three engine speeds (1500 rpm, 2000 rpm and 2500 rpm) and the medium engine load (100 Nm) test conditions. Detailed and comparative injection, combustion and emission analysis of the test fuels were performed. The results showed that brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of biodiesel and its blends (15% ethanol-85% biodiesel and 15% solketal-85% biodiesel) with oxygenated fuels were higher than those of petroleum diesel fuel. Solketal and ethanol additions to biodiesel increased BSFC. Maximum cylinder pressures were close to each other for all test fuels. Main and pilot injection characteristics of the test engine changed significantly when diesel fuel and biodiesel were used. According to the emission results, biodiesel emitted higher NOxand CO2emissions while lower CO and THC emissions compared with diesel fuel. In addition, solketal and ethanol fuel blends caused an increase in NOxemissions and provided lower CO2, CO and THC emissions on average compared to biodiesel. Ethanol-biodiesel and solketal-biodiesel blends gave similar results to each other. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Identifying and addressing critical improvements in biomass, bioproduct and biofuel productivity is a priority for the nascent algae-based bioeconomy. Economic and sustainability principles should guide these developing improvements and help to unravel the contentious water-food-energy-environment nexus that algae inhabit. Understanding the biochemistry of the storage carbon metabolism of algae to produce biofuels and bioproducts can bring to light the key barriers that currently limit the overall carbon efficiency and the photosynthetic efficiency, and ultimately guide productivity and commercial viability in the context of limiting resources. In the analysis reported here, we present different potential pathways for a conceptual algae biorefinery framework, with each pathway addressing one of the main identified barriers to future deployment. We highlight the molecular identification, in the form of an extensive literature review, of potential bioproducts that may be derived directly from both biomass and fractions produced through a conversion pathway, for three important commercially-relevant genera of algae, Scenedesmus, Chlorella and Nannochloropsis. We establish a relationship between each of the potential bioproducts, describe relevant conversion and extraction processes, and discuss market opportunities with values and sizes as they relate to commercial development of the products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - In this study, Waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel with Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and n-butanol additive was used in a diesel engine and its effects on engine performance and exhaust emissions were studied. The biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil by transesterification process, Methanol, sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) catalyst were used in the reaction. Engine performance test were conducted with blends (B0, B20, B30, B40, and B100) and the results showed that, B30 is the superior blend among other biodiesel blends. Further to improve the performance characteristics of B30, antioxidants of BHT 2000 ppm and n-butanol 20% by volume was added in the B30 blend. The results of BSFC for the B30 + BHT is 7.3% higher whereas the BTE is 4.6% lower than diesel due to the lower heating value of biodiesel. The heat release rate of B20, B40 and B30 + BHT are almost synchronous to diesel fuel, alongside at higher loads B30+n-butanol shows 37.5% less CO emission and 9% higher NOxemission was observed when compared to diesel fuel. WCO bio diesel and its blends with BHT and n-butanol can be used as a fuel in diesel engine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nano magnetite biochar composite (nFe3O4/biochar) was synthesized and used to activate persulfate for the degradation of 1,4-dioxane. Analytical techniques using X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that nFe3O4 was spherical and successfully loaded onto the surface of biochar. The results of batch-scale experiments illustrated that the 1,4-dioxane degradation efficiency in aqueous phase was 98.0% after 120 min reaction with the composite mass ratio of 1:1 between nFe3O4 and the pine needle biochar pyrolyzed at 400 °C (P400) under the initial neutral pH. An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study, free radical quenching experiment and XPS analysis were undertaken to illustrate the mechanism of persulfate activation by nFe3O4/biochar. Under acidic and neutral conditions, the predominant free radical was SO4[rad]− whereas [rad]OH and SO4[rad]− predominated when the initial pH was 9.0. The XPS analysis indicated that Fe(II) and oxygenated functional groups activated persulfate. In addition, carbon-carbon double bonds would be transformed into ketone and quinone which could activate persulfate during the reaction. © 2017

AB  - Transformation and evolution mechanisms of nitrogen during algae pyrolysis were investigated in depth with exploration of N-containing products under variant temperature. Results indicated nitrogen in algae is mainly in the form of protein-N (∼90%) with some inorganic-N. At 400-600 °C, protein-N in algae cracked first with algae pyrolysis and formed pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and quaternary-N in char. The content of protein-N decreased significantly, while that of pyrrolic-N and quaternary-N increased gradually with temperature increasing. Pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N formation was due to deamination or dehydrogenation of amino acids; subsequently, some pyridinic-N converted to quaternary-N. Increasing temperature decreased amides content greatly while increased that of nitriles and N-heterocyclic compounds (pyridines, pyrroles, and indoles) in bio-oil. Amides were formed through NH3 reacting with fatty acids, that underwent dehydration to form nitriles. Besides, NH3 and HCN yields increased gradually. NH3 resulted from ammonia-N, labile amino acids and amides decomposition, while HCN came from nitrile decomposition. At 700-800 °C, evolution trend of N-containing products was similar to that at 400-600 °C. While N-heterocyclic compounds in bio-oil mainly came from pyrifinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and quaternary-N decomposition. Moreover, cracking of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N produced HCN and NH3. A mechanism of nitrogen transformation during algae pyrolysis is proposed based on amino acids decomposition. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) is one of the most important biomass-derived platform molecules and can be produced from both C5 and C6 carbohydrates via tandem dehydration and hydrolysis reactions. Since LA has different functional groups, it would be converted into various compounds by catalyzed reactions. During the past few decades, it has been proved that the conversion of biomass materials into biofuels and chemicals with LA as intermediate is feasible. Alkyl levulinates derived from LA have similar chemical properties to LA and are also used for the synthesis of LA derived molecules. Herein, this review focuses on the transformation of levulinic acid and alkyl levulinate into biofuels and high-valued chemicals, such as γ-valerolactone, 2-methyltetrahydrofurnan, valeric acid/alkyl valerates, 1,4-pentanediol and N-substituted pyrrolidinones. Different homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are reviewed and compared. The ligands and additives exhibit a remarkable impact on the distribution of products in homogeneous catalytic systems. Moreover, the catalytic performances of heterogeneous catalytic systems are influenced by numerous factors, such as the size of the metal particles, surface morphology and acid density. In addition, in order to make this review more complete, the production of LA and alkyl levulinates is also included in the manuscript. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to characterize the elemental composition, chemical compounds, oxidative aging and the compatibility of bio-asphalt modified with bio-oil. A petroleum asphalt was modified with treated and untreated bio-oil at 2%, 5% and 10% by weight to prepare bio-asphalt, respectively. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to characterize the chemical compounds in the bio-oil. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was utilized to explore the influence of bio-oil on the aging performance of asphalt. The compatibility of bio-oil with petroleum asphalt was investigated using automated flocculation titrimetry (AFT) based on flocculation stability. The elemental composition analysis revealed a higher amount of oxygen in the bio-oil. The GC-MS results showed the presence of chemical compounds with low boiling temperatures, which have potential environmental impacts and health concerns if used in hot mix asphalt. The FTIR results indicated the presence of aromatic and nitrogenous compounds, alcohols, ethers, ketones, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, esters, acyls, alkanes, polymeric O[sbnd]H, NH2 and water. The AFT results implied a stable and compatible mixture of 2% bio-asphalt. The study also suggested that with an increase in the fraction of bio-oil, the compatibility with petroleum asphalt would decrease. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) utilization/recycling for the production of chemicals and gaseous/liquid energy-carriers is a way to moderate the rising CO2 in the atmosphere. One of the possible solutions for the CO2 sequestration is the electrochemical reduction of this stable molecule to useful fuel/products. Nevertheless, the surface chemistry of CO2 reduction is a challenge due to the presence of large energy barriers, requiring noticeable catalysis. The recent approach of microbial electrocatalysis of CO2 reduction has promising prospects to reduce the carbon level sustainably, taking full advantage of CO2-derived chemical commodities. We review the currently investigated bioelectrochemical approaches that could possibly be implemented to enable the handling of CO2 emissions. This review covers the most recent advances in the bioelectrochemical approaches of CO2 transformations in terms of biocatalysts development and process design. Furthermore, the extensive research on carbon fixation and conversion to different value added chemicals is reviewed. The review concludes by detailing the key challenges and future prospects that could enable economically feasible microbial electrosynthesis technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cu-Co bimetallic nanoparticles coated with carbon layers have been developed through direct heating treatment of bimetallic oxide precursors incipiently deposited with polyethene glycol. The as-synthesized nanocatalyst performs excellently in chemoselective hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-dimethylfuran. The Co-based catalysts exhibit higher performance than Cu-based catalysts. Cu-Co@C (Cu: Co = 1:3) shows the highest yield of 2,5-dimethylfuran (99.4%). Bimetallic nanocatalysts are detailedly characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The bimetallic nanoparticles are entrapped by carbon shells that can protect them from oxidation and deactivation. The catalytic activity and selectivity are kept constant in a six-run recycling test. The synergistic effect between two metal components is helpful to enhance catalytic performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The world demand for fuel as energy sources have arisen the need for generating alternatives such as biofuel. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel used particularly in diesel engines. Currently, biodiesel is mainly produced through transesterification reactions catalyzed by chemical catalysts, which produces higher fatty acid alkyl esters in shorter reaction time. Although extensive investigations on enzymatic transesterification by downstream processing were carried out, enzymatic transesterification has yet to be used in scale-up since commercial lipases are chiefly limited to the cost as well as long reaction time. While numerous lipases were studied and proven to have the high catalytic capacity, still enzymatic reaction requires more investigation. To fill this gap, finding optimal conditions for the reaction such as alcohol and oil choice, water content, reaction time and temperature through proper reaction modelling and simulations as well as the appropriate design and use of reactors for large scale production are crucial issues that need to be accurately addressed. Furthermore, lipase concentration, alternative lipase resources through whole cell technology and genetic engineering, recent immobilizing materials including nanoparticles, and the capacity of enzyme to be reused are important criteria to be neatly investigated. The present work reviews the current biodiesel feedstock, catalysis, general and novel immobilizing materials, bioreactors for enzymatic transesterification, potential lipase resources, intensification technics, and process modelling for enzymatic transesterification. © 2016

AB  - Biomass-derived ethanol is an important renewable feedstock. Its conversion into high-quality biofuels is a promising route to replace fossil resources. Herein, an efficient manganese-catalyzed Guerbet-type condensation reaction of ethanol to form 1-butanol was explored. This is the first example of upgrading ethanol into higher alcohols using a homogeneous non-noble-metal catalyst. This process proceeded selectively in the presence of a well-defined manganese pincer complex at the parts per million (ppm) level. The developed reaction represents a sustainable synthesis of 1-butanol with excellent turnover number (&gt;110 000) and turnover frequency (&gt;3000 h-1). Moreover, mechanistic studies including control experiments, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography identified the essential role of the "N-H moiety" of the manganese catalysts and the major reaction intermediates related to the catalytic cycle. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study is focused on the investigation of animal bones modified with potassium hydroxide (KOH) as heterogeneous solid base catalyst for transesterification of non-edible Jatropha oil. The prepared catalyst was characterized by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). The prepared catalyst had a high catalytic activity for transesterification. In addition, the catalyst had excellent stability, there by having potential use as a heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production from Jatropha oil with a high free fatty acid (FFA) yield. The experimental results revealed the optimal parametric conditions viz. methanol/oil molar ratio, 9:1, calcination temperature, 900 °C and catalyst concentration, 6.0 wt % of oil corresponding to a maximum fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield of 96.1% at temperature of 70 ± 3 °C in reaction time of 3 h. Reusability results of the prepared catalyst confirmed that it could be reutilized up to 4 times without losing much activity, thus giving birth to a potentially applicable possibility in biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advanced Biofuels steadily developed during recent year, with several highly innovative processes and technologies explored at various scales: among these, lignocellulosic ethanol and CTO (Crude Tall Oil)-biofuel technologies already achieved early-commercial status, while hydrotreating of vegetable oils is today fully commercial, with almost 3.5 Mt/y installed capacity worldwide. In this context, microalgae grown in salt-water and arid areas represent a promising sustainable chain for advanced biofuel production but, at the same time, they also represent a considerable challenge. Processing microalgae in an economic way into a viable and sustainable liquid biofuel (a low-cost mass-product) is not trivial. So far, the most studied microalgae-based biofuel chain is composed by microorganism cultivation, lipid accumulation, oil extraction, co-product valorization, and algae oil conversion through conventional esterification into Fatty Acids Methyl Esters (FAME), i.e. Biodiesel, or Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), the latter representing a very high quality drop-in biofuel (suitable either for road transport or for aviation). However, extracting the algae oil at low cost and industrial scale is not yet a mature process, and there is not yet industrial production of algae-biofuel from these two lipid-based chains. Another option can however be considered: processing the algae through dedicated thermochemical reactors into advanced biofuels, thus approaching the downstream processing of algae in a completely different way than separation. The present work examines the possible routes for thermochemical conversion of microalgae into liquid biofuels, distinguishing between dry-processes (namely Pyrolysis, PO) and wet-processes (near critical-water HydroThermal Liquefaction, HTL). A literature review on algae-HTL was carried out, distinguishing between batch and continuous experiments, and compared to original results from algae pyrolysis. In particular, pyrolysis was carried out on both starved (lipid-accumulated) and non-starved microalgae. Typical composition of major products is given for both PO and HTL, comparing the main characteristic of the products. Major engineering advantages and challenges in thermochemical conversion of algae into liquid biofuels were identified and discussed for both processes, in view of the production of a transport biofuel and the full exploitation of this renewable feedstock in energy and biorefinery complexes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of renewable chemicals and biofuels must be cost-and performance-competitive with petroleumderived equivalents to be widely accepted by markets and society. We propose a biomass conversion strategy that maximizes the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass (up to 80% of the biomass to useful products) into high-value products that can be commercialized, providing the opportunity for successful translation to an economically viable commercial process. Our fractionation method preserves the value of all three primary components: (i) cellulose, which is converted into dissolving pulp for fibers and chemicals production; (ii) hemicellulose, which is converted into furfural (a building block chemical); and (iii) lignin, which is converted into carbon products (carbon foam, fibers, or battery anodes), together producing revenues of more than $500 per dry metric ton of biomass. Once de-risked, our technology can be extended to produce other renewable chemicals and biofuels. © The Authors, some rights reserved;.
