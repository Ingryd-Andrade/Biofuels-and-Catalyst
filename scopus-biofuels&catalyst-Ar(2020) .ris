AB  - This study proposes an integrated biorefinery of brewer's spent grain (BSG) based on the application of a microwave pretreatment to obtain bioproducts, such as arabinoxylans (AX) and an advanced biofuel, such as biobutanol. A prehydrolysate with 17 g/L AX was obtained at 172 °C and 0.38 M NaOH, which were subsequently precipitated using an organosolvent process, recovering 133 kg AX/t BSG. The subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis with endo-xylanases significantly increased the concentration of oligomers with 2–6 units of xylose. The presence of oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization (DP) from 3 to 27 was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. On the other hand, the pretreated solid residue obtained in the microwave assisted alkaline pretreatment was enzymatically hydrolyzed with cellulases and fermented by Clostridium beijerinckii, producing 9.9 g/L butanol (28 kg butanol/t BSG and 37 kg ABE/t BSG). Thus, the potential for the efficient use of BSG in an integrated biorefinery was demonstrated. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large production of liquid phase of digestate (LPD) characterised by low dry matter content increases the costs of LPD storage and transportation. Additionally, significant nitrogen losses result from LPD handling. The operation of biogas plants also requires large amounts of technological water, a scarce resource. The method of LPD nitrification and subsequent thermal thickening as a promising alternative treatment able to overcome those problems was investigated. The properties of thermally thickened nitrified LPD and of the distillate derived from vacuum evaporation of nitrified LPD were examined. The results show that over 99.9% of nitrogen was accumulated in thickened nitrified LPD. Total nitrogen (TN) concentration in thickened LPD ranged from 12 to 18 g/L depending on the distillate/thickened LPD volume ratio applied. The thickened LPD was also richer in other nutrients, which indicates its possible use as a concentrated complex fertiliser. TN concentration and conductivity in the distillate did not exceed 6 mg/L and 0.03 mS/m respectively, suggesting that the distillate may be useful as alternative source of technological water. It was concluded that the system consisting of nitrification and subsequent thermal thickening of nitrified LPD yields final products exhibiting significantly superior properties compared to thermal thickening of raw LPD, without requiring any additional chemical agents. The quality of these products is comparable to those obtained through advanced membrane processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to utilize of waste cooking oil (WCO) as a vital energy source as an alternative source of power in operating agricultural machinery. In the current study, an alternative fuel was made of WCO and its suitability to apply in power farm machinery as mixture fuel blends with diesel fuel (D). The obtained biodiesel (BD) was blended with D based on the volumetric ratio and compared with D as a control treatment. The parameters in this study were biodiesel mixing ratios namely BD5 (5% BD + 95% D), BD20 (20% BD + 80% D) and D besides, throttle fuel position i.e., Idle, Half throttle fuel (H.L.) and Full throttle fuel (F.L.). The engine performance of reaper binder machine has been evaluated in terms of exhaust gases emissions and noise test. The value of Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentration decreased from 1005 to 893 ppm for D at H.L. and F.L. throttle fuel position compared with the value of CO concentration decreased also from 734 to 631 ppm for BD20 under above throttle fuel position. The Biofuel BD20 produced low exhaust emission values compared to D. The results revealed that using BD20 instead of D reduced the values of the noise level in case of the operator by percentages of 8.2, 9 and 5.4% respectively for Idle, H.L. and F.L. throttle fuel position, whereas, in case of bystanders, the corresponding values decreased by percentages of 9.4, 4 and 3.8%. © by PSP

AB  - The non-esculent soap stock oil was employed for producing some rare chemicals, along with certain fractions of biofuels akin to those engendered from petroleum sources. This inexpensive feed stock was hydrotreated using NiMo/Al2O3 in the sulfided form as a catalyst. The applied process was accomplished in a continuous micro-reactor, under high pressure of hydrogen. The hydroprocessed oil was treated chemically for separating its liquid hydrocarbons from the fatty acid constituents. The fatty acids were esterified to be transformed to the corresponding methyl ester. The products were identified via the gas chromatographic technique. The results reflect that the acquired hydrocarbons are clean and free from oxygenated compounds, in addition to sulfur, which has an adverse impact on the environment and on the performance of engines, so it can be used as a high - grade biofuel and also as pure chemicals. Furthermore, the prepared fatty acids are characterized by their low molecular weight, with carbon numbers in the range of C5 to C22, including those with odd carbon numbers that regarded as very rare components in nature. Hence this work offers the ability for obtainment precious products from a cheap material. ©2020 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).

AB  - Rapid depletion of fossil fuels and escalating crude oil prices led the researchers to ascertain alternative feedstock as a substitute for mineral diesel. Biodiesel produced from non-edible sources was one among them. In the present investigation, palm stearin wax, a residue of palm oil extraction was used as a value-added feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Palm stearin biodiesel (PSBD) was derived from this feedstock using single stage transesterification process involving methanol and sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. PSBD was blended with mineral diesel at 20% (D80PSBD20) and 50% (D50PSBD50) in volume basis. The effect of variable compression ratios on the performance and emission phenomena of direct injection CI engine was analysed for test fuel blends. The tests were carried out for compression ratios 17:1, 17.5:1 and 18:1. Among all the fuel blends, D80PSBD20 blend showcased better performance characteristics along with reduced exhaust emissions at compression ratio of 18:1. © 2020 Technoscience Publications.

AB  - Bio-oil produced from biomass fast pyrolysis process is an organic liquid that can be transformed into high quality biofuel through upgrading process. Bio-oil comprises a large amount of carboxylic acids, which cause its corrosiveness, hence, difficulty for storage and utilization. Esterification may be considered as an intermediate upgrading method to convert the acids in bio-oil into esters by reacting with alcohol. This work presents kinetic studies of the esterification of a bio-oil model compound in ethanol catalyzed by 12-tungstosilicic acid. Oleic acid was used to represent the main component of bio-oil derived from agro-residues. Conditions considered were the molar ratio of ethanol to oleic acid of 9.11:1, catalyst loading of 10 wt%, and reaction temperatures in the range of 35-75 °C. It was found that the pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model was suitable to represent the esterification of the bio-oil model compound. Average reaction order n = 1.9, activation energy Ea=50.1 kJ/mol, and pre-exponential factor A = 11.11×103 min−1 were obtained by fitting the kinetic model with experimental results. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Meeting the transport needs of a growing world population makes it imperative to develop renewable and sustainable routes to production of liquid fuels. With a market-driven economic structure and pressing environmental issues, it is essential that these new routes provide environmental benefits while being economically viable. Conversion of second-generation lignocellulosic biomass resources to fuels via pyrolysis represents an important technological route. In this article, we report comparative assessment of the economic and lifecycle environmental aspects for catalytic and thermal pyrolysis. The goal of this assessment is two-fold: one is to understand the potential of this conversion route via the catalytic and thermal processes and second is to provide feedback for further development of catalysts for various stages of this conversion. The complete assessment is interdisciplinary in nature and connects the laboratory experiments with contextual sustainability assessment. Three catalytic and one thermal pyrolysis processes are analyzed using this assessment approach. Subject to the model choices and data inputs, the results, which consider quality of the oil product, show that biofuels produced using catalytic and thermal routes are rather expensive compared to gasoline. But at the same time, they provide significant greenhouse gas emission savings and can lead to lower CO2 abatement costs compared to the first-generation ethanol that is used currently. With one of the product scenarios of hydrotreated (HT) oil, the abatements costs are estimated to be 51% of those associated with first-generation ethanol. Additional product scenarios with developments in catalysts show potential to further reduce abatement costs significantly to below 100 EUR per metric tonne of CO2 equivalents. Using scenario analysis, the results help us to understand specific areas for development of novel catalysts. At the same time, the results demonstrate the trade-offs associated with the variety and complexity of technical factors associated with the pyrolysis routes. The study highlights the challenges and the promises of catalytic and thermal pyrolysis for production of high-quality biofuels produced via a sustainable production route. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Capture and storage of the energy carrier hydrogen as well as of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide are two major problems that mankind faces currently. Chemical catalysts have been developed, but only recently a group of anaerobic bacteria that convert hydrogen and carbon dioxide to acetate, formate, or biofuels such as ethanol has come into focus, the acetogenic bacteria. These biocatalysts produce the liquid organic hydrogen carrier formic acid from H2 + CO2 or even carbon monoxide with highest rates ever reported. The autotrophic, hydrogen-oxidizing, and CO2-reducing acetogens have in common a specialized metabolism to catalyze CO2 reduction, the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP). The WLP does not yield net ATP, but is hooked up to a membrane-bound respiratory chain that enables ATP synthesis coupled to CO2 fixation. The nature of the respiratory enzyme has been an enigma since the discovery of these bacteria and has been unraveled in this study. Results: We have produced a His-tagged variant of the ferredoxin:NAD oxidoreductase (Rnf complex) from the model acetogen Acetobacterium woodii, solubilized the enzyme from the cytoplasmic membrane, and purified it by Ni2+–NTA affinity chromatography. The enzyme was incorporated into artificial liposomes and catalyzed Na+ transport coupled to ferredoxin-dependent NAD reduction. Our results using the purified enzyme do not only verify that the Rnf complex from A. woodii is Na+-dependent, they also demonstrate for the first time that this membrane-embedded molecular engine creates a Na+ gradient across the membrane of A. woodii which can be used for ATP synthesis. Discussion: We present a protocol for homologous production and purification for an Rnf complex. The enzyme catalyzed electron-transfer driven Na+ export and, thus, our studies provided the long-awaited biochemical proof that the Rnf complex is a respiratory enzyme. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Converting wastewater sludge to lipid is considered as one of the best strategies of sludge management. The current problem of lipid production from wastewater sludge is the low yield (0.10–0.16 g lipid/g dry sludge) due to the low availability of easily uptaken materials (such as soluble monosaccharide and oligosaccharide) in sludge to oleaginous microorganism (Rhodotorula glutinis, Trichosporon oleaginosus, Lipomyces starkeyi). Pretreatments are efficient methods to improve sludge bioavailability. This study is aimed to achieve high lipid production from sludge and high sludge reduction. Results: In this study, it was observed that the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) had significantly increased after different pretreatment. The SCOD in the supernatant was increased from 32.64 to 180.25 mg/L, 924.16 mg/L, 1029.89 mg/L and 3708.31 mg/L after acidic (pH 2 for 2 h), alkaline (pH 12 for 2 h), microwave irradiation (15 min with 5 min interval), and ultrasonication (30 min at 450 W and 20 kHz frequency with 5 s on and 2 s off mode) pretreatment, respectively. Pretreatments have also increased the release of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) from solids. The sludge after different pretreatments were used as a medium for lipid production, and the highest lipid content (36.67% g/g) was obtained in the fermentation with ultrasonication pretreatment sludge, and the sludge reduction was 63.10%. For other pretreatments, the lipid content and sludge reduction were 18.42% and 32.63% in acid pretreatment case, 21.08% and 36.44% in alkaline pretreatment case, and 26.31% and 43.03% in microwave pretreatment case, respectively. Conclusion: It was found that ultrasonication pretreatment was the most efficient way to increase the sludge biodegradability (SCOD) and to release TN and TP from solid phase to liquid phase. Pretreated sludge for lipid production achieved significant improvement in lipid yield and sludge reduction. Lipids produced from pretreated sludge were transesterified to biodiesel and the analysis showed that biodiesel had a similar composition as commercial biodiesel. The study reveals that pretreatment on sludge is a promising method for enhancing biological sludge management efficiency.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is considered as the largest potential candidate to develop alternative energy, such as biofuel, biomaterial. However, the efficient conversion of cellulose and practical utilization of lignin are great challenges for sustainable biorefinery. In this study, high reducing sugar yield and different size of lignin colloid particles (LCPs) were obtained via tetrahydrofuran–water (THF–H2O) pretreatment of corn stover (CS). THF–H2O as a co-solvent, could efficiently dissolve lignin and retain cellulose. After the pretreatment, 640.87 mg/g of reducing sugar was produced, that was 6.66-fold higher than that of the untreated CS. Meanwhile, the pretreatment liquor could form spherical LCPs with different sizes ranged from 202 to 732 nm through self-assembly. We studied the optimal pretreatment condition to simultaneously realize the high reducing sugar yield (588.4 mg/g) and excellent LCPs preparation with average size of 243 nm was under TH22 (THF–H2O pretreatment at 120 °C for 2 h). To further explore the formation of LCPs with different sizes. We studied the lignin structure changes of various conditions, concluded the size of LCPs was related to the lignin concentration and syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio. As the increase of the lignin concentration and S/G, the sizes of LCPs were increased. G-type lignin was easier to dissolve in the mild pretreatment supernatant, contributing to form smaller LCPs with a good dispersibility. In the severe condition, both of S and G-type lignin were dissolved due to the lignin depolymerization, formed the larger sphere particles. This work provides a novel perspective for the technical design of lignocellulosic biomass conversion. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel, as one of the alternative biofuels replacing the common fossil fuels, is prepared by transesterification of oils and fats. Commonly, the reaction is catalysed by either acidic or basic catalysts. The availability of the active sites to large triglyceride molecules is the key factor of the heterogeneous catalysts. The use of carbon fibres during the synthesis of Mg/Fe layered double hydroxides results in the formation of macropores during the calcination. The amount of carbon fibres showed an important effect on the textural properties of the resulting mixed oxides. The texture was determined by N2-adsorption and Hg-porosity. The catalyst activity in the studied reaction was examined by determination of ester amount by gas chromatography and the activity was compared with unmodified mixed oxides. The highest ester yield (40 wt.%) was achieved by adding 1 wt.% of carbon fibres to the catalyst with the largest size of macropores. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Planktonic cultures, of a rationally designed consortium, demonstrated emergent properties that exceeded the sums of monoculture properties, including a &gt;200% increase in cellobiose catabolism, a &gt;100% increase in glycerol catabolism, a &gt;800% increase in ethanol production, and a &gt;120% increase in biomass productivity. The consortium was designed to have a primary and secondary-resource specialist that used crossfeeding with a positive feedback mechanism, division of labor, and nutrient and energy transfer via necromass catabolism. The primary resource specialist was Clostridium phytofermentans (a.k.a. Lachnoclostridium phytofermentans), a cellulolytic, obligate anaerobe. The secondary-resource specialist was Escherichia coli, a versatile, facultative anaerobe, which can ferment glycerol and byproducts of cellobiose catabolism. The consortium also demonstrated emergent properties of enhanced biomass accumulation when grown as biofilms, which created high cell density communities with gradients of species along the vertical axis. Consortium biofilms were robust to oxic perturbations with E. coli consuming O2, creating an anoxic environment for C. phytofermentans. Anoxic/oxic cycling further enhanced biomass productivity of the biofilm consortium, increasing biomass accumulation ~250% over the sum of the monoculture biofilms. Consortium emergent properties were credited to several synergistic mechanisms. E. coli consumed inhibitory byproducts from cellobiose catabolism, driving higher C. phytofermentans growth and higher cellulolytic enzyme production, which in turn provided more substrate for E. coli. E. coli necromass enhanced C. phytofermentans growth while C. phytofermentans necromass aided E. coli growth via the release of peptides and amino acids, respectively. In aggregate, temporal cycling of necromass constituents increased flux of cellulose-derived resources through the consortium. The study establishes a consortia-based, bioprocessing strategy built on naturally occurring interactions for improved conversion of cellulose-derived sugars into bioproducts. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Organotin compounds are applied in several industrial reactions and can present antifungal and antibacterial activities. Incorrect handling and storage practices of biodiesel and diesel–biodiesel blends can lead to microbial development, impacting its final quality. Concerning this problem, this work investigated the antimicrobial action of two organotin catalysts used in biodiesel production with four isolated microroorganisms (Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudallescheria boydii, and Aureobasidium pullulans) and a pool of microorganisms (ASTM E1259 standard practice). Samples of soybean biodiesel with different concentrations of dibutyl tin dilaurate (catalyst 1) and di-n-butyl-oxo-stannane (catalyst 2) were prepared and added of mineral medium. The pool of microorganisms was inoculated and incubated at 30 °C and final biomass was weighted after 14 days. Thereafter, soybean biodiesel with catalyst 2 was used. Fungal biomass was weighted, and plate count was used to assess bacterial growth. Results show that catalysts 1 and 2 presented no inhibitory activity on the pool of microorganisms evaluated. A slight inhibitory activity was observed for B. pumilus and A. pullulans growth, but not for P. boydii, P. aeruginosa, or the pool of microorganisms. All experiment exhibited acidification higher than sterile control. Infrared analysis show less microbiological degradation products in the tin-protected fuel with ASTM inoculum. These results suggest that these tin-based catalysts show no toxic effect on native microbial population and a slight effect on some isolated microbial population in laboratory scale and for the first time shows that these organotin compounds can be employed safely as biodiesel catalyst.

AB  - Feedstock price and availability remain a barrier to adoption of cellulosic biofuels. Eucalyptus spp., can produce an energy-dense terpene suitable for high-density synthetic hydrocarbon-type fuel (grade JP-10) production in addition to cellulosic-based feedstock for traditional jet fuels (e.g., grade Jet A) and gasoline. This study modeled economic potential for Eucalyptus to fulfill US fuel markets. Cold-tolerant Eucalyptus was simulated in an annual coppice system for maximized leaf production. Results of the lowest simulated price ($110 t−1) show that within 10 years, there is potential to produce 204 million L yr−1 of fuel, including 51 million L yr−1 of JP-10-type fuel, 75 million L yr−1 of Jet A type fuel, and 77 million L yr−1 of gasoline. These quantities of fuel could be valued at approximately $500 million (USD), with feedstock costs totaling approximately $100 million (USD). Longer-term markets (to 20 years) or higher priced (to $220 t−1) scenarios show potential for more production. Research to determine potential for genetic improvement, delivered fuel costs, and biorefinery siting near existing infrastructure is recommended. © 2020

AB  - Energies based on biomaterials attract a lot of interest as next-generation energy because biomaterials are environmentally friendly materials and abundant in nature. Fuel cells are also known as the clean and important next-generation source of energy. In the present study, to develop the fuel cell based on biomaterials, a novel biofuel cell, which consists of collagen electrolyte and the hydrogen fuel generated from photochemical system II (PSII) in photosynthesis, has been fabricated, and its property has been investigated. It was found that the PSII solution, in which PSII was extracted from the thylakoid membrane using a surfactant, generates hydrogen by the irradiation of light. The typical hydrogen-generating rate is approximately 7.41 × 1014molecules/s for the light intensity of 0.5 mW/cm2 for the PSII solution of 5 mL. The biofuel cell using the PSII solution as the fuel exhibited approximately 0.12 mW/cm2. This result indicates that the fuel cell using the collagen electrolyte and the hydrogen fuel generated from PSII solution becomes the new type of biofuel cell and will lead to the development of the next-generation energy. © 2020 MDPI AG.

AB  - Abstract: A dynamic, plug-flow, one-dimensional, and heterogeneous mathematical model for a trickle-bed reactor is described and used to simulate the catalytic hydrocracking of non-edible vegetable oil with countercurrent operation mode. The reactor model considers the hydrocracking reaction of triglycerides towards renewable fuels, which is present in the hydrotreatment process of vegetable oils. The dynamic model was first validated using experimental data reported in the literature, which were obtained in an isothermal micro-scale reactor with cocurrent downflow during hydrocracking of Jatropha oil over a commercial CoMo catalyst. Then, the three-phase reactor model was applied to predict the dynamic behavior of an industrial hydrocracking reactor in order to gain some insight into the transient behavior of the liquid molar concentration, partial pressure, and temperature profiles, which were obtained and discussed as a function of time and axial position of the catalytic bed. The simulations obtained with the proposed dynamic model showed good agreement with the experimental data and trends previously reported for the operation variables profiles at steady-state and relevant findings at industrial scale were obtained. Graphic abstract: One of the main challenges to produce biofuels by vegetable oils hydroprocessing is to control the high-temperature gradients along the catalyst bed because of the high reaction heat released; therefore, the development of dynamic trickle-bed reactor models, as shown in this work, can be used as a tool to predict the operational behavior of the unit under different reaction conditions and layouts to found the best scheme to control the effects by high-temperature rise.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Cold flow properties are the primary drawback to the common usage of biodiesel as an alternative fuel to diesel. Biodiesel's cold flow behaviour is discovered for the main reasons of presence of precipitant or crystal initiate by minor components such as monoglycerides and steryl glycosides. The ASTM test for this precipitant is ‘The Standard Test Method for Determination of Fuel Filter Blocking Potential of Biodiesel (B100) Blend Stock by Cold Soak Filtration Test (CSFT)’. Therefore, in this study, the performance of commercial activated carbon, silica and beach sand as adsorbent is studied in improving the filterability of two different level of refined biodiesel. The adsorbents were used to treat the biodiesel by removing the impurities present in the biodiesel such as the monoglycerides and steryl glycosides compound from biodiesel using adsorption technique. The efficiency of the adsorbent is determined by performing the cold soak filtration test. Based on the cold soak filtration test, precipitate is not visible and the CSTF is within the 360 s limit for the both refined level of biodiesel. However, treatment of these biodiesel with commercial activated carbon, silica and beach sand resulted in further reduce in CSFT. Commercial activated carbon found to be the most effective adsorbent, followed by silica. This is because both adsorbents possessed high surface area of 657.0420 m2/g and 320.2724 m2/g respectively and high pore volume of 0.379097 cm3/g and 0.952320 cm3/g respectively which further enhance its potential as an excellent adsorbent to improve the filterability of biodiesel compared to beach sand which possessed lowest surface area and lowest pore volume of only 1.2630 m2/g and 0.001751 cm3/g respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Plants with high biomass can be manipulated for their reducing sugar content which ultimately upon fermentation produces ethanol. This concept was used to enhance the production of reducing sugar from cattail (Typha latifolia) by oxalic acid (OAA) pre-treatment followed by enzymatic saccharification. Result: The optimum condition of total reducing sugar released from OAA pre-treatment was found to be 22.32 mg/ml (OAA—1.2%; substrate concentration (SC)—6%; reaction time (RT)—20 min) using one variable at a time (OVAT). Enzymatic saccharification yielded 45.21 mg/ml of reducing sugar (substrate concentration (SC)—2.4%; enzymatic dosage—50 IU/g; pH 7.0; temp—50 °C) using response surface methodology (RSM). Conclusion: We conclude that Typha can be used as a potential substrate for large-scale biofuel production, employing economical bioprocessing strategies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Converting renewable cellulose into glucose via cellulase catalysis for further production of biofuel has been recognized as one of the most promising ways for solving energy crisis. However, the hydrolysis performance of immobilized cellulase was not satisfactory for practical application due to the reduced catalytic efficiency and lack of β-glucosidase (BG) component in cellulase. Here, a facile method was developed to sequentially co-immobilize BG and cellulase by polymeric microparticles with hierarchical structure. In this strategy, BG was firstly entrapped into the cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) microparticles via inverse emulsion polymerization initiated by isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX) under the irradiation of visible light, leaving the formed ITX semi-pinacol (ITXSP) dormant groups on surface of BG-loaded microparticles, which could be further activated by visible light irradiation and initiated a graft polymerization to introduce poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brush on the PEG core. After that, cellulase was covalently bonded on the PAA chains via carbodiimide reaction. The synergic effect of BG and cellulase was verified in the dual enzyme immobilization system, which led to a better stability at a wide range of temperature and pH than free enzymes. The dual enzymes system exhibited excellent reusability, which could retain 75% and 57% of the initial activity after 10 cycles of hydrolysis of carboxyl methyl cellulose and 5 cycles of hydrolysis of filter paper, respectively, indicative of the potential in biofuel areas in a cost-effective manner. © 2020, Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mechanocatalysis is a promising method for depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass. Microbial utilization of the resulting oligosaccharides is one potential route of adding value to the depolymerized biomass. However, it is unclear how readily these oligosaccharides are utilized by standard cell factories. Here, we investigate utilization of cellulose subjected to mechanocatalytic depolymerization, using ethanologenic Escherichia coli as a model fermentation organism. The mechanocatalytic oligosaccharides supported ethanol titers similar to those observed when glucose was provided at comparable concentrations. Tracking of the various oligomers, using maltose (alpha-1,4) and cellobiose (beta-1,4) oligomers as representative standards of the orientation, but not linkage, of the glycosidic bond, suggests that the malto-like-oligomers are more readily utilized than cello-like-oligomers, consistent with poor growth with cellotetraose or cellopentaose as sole carbon source. Thus, mechanocatalytic oligosaccharides are a promising substrate for cell factories, and microbial utilization of these sugars could possibly be improved by addressing utilization of cello-like oligomers. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Increasing renewable carbon incorporation into conventional fuels through coprocessing with vacuum gas oil (VGO, a petroleum refining feedstock) is a critical step in biofuel development, scaling-up, adoption, and associated GHG reduction. Optimization of the coprocessing parameters maximizes incorporation of the renewable carbon in the fuel products. Quantitative determination of the renewable carbon content in the coprocessed products provides direct evaluation of these parameters. The coprocessing bio-oil with VGO through hydrocracking (HC) or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) system resulted in carbon isotopic fractionation that prevented the direct use of the isotope-mixing model for quantifying the renewable carbon. Here, we report an algorithm of using a stable carbon isotope approach to quantify the renewable carbon content in coprocessing biofuel products through high-precision δ13C analysis. A controlled experiment carried out by blending a fossil diesel (-29.013‰) with a biodiesel (-30.099‰) at various blending levels up to 98.0/2.0 wt % is presented and has demonstrated the applicability of this approach. The carbon isotope fractionation factors for the bio-oil coprocessing were obtained by using a 14C-derived isotope-mixing model. The δ13C method was tested by coprocessing 13C-labeled biocrude and natural woody biomass-derived fast pyrolysis (FP) and catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) bio-oils with VGO. The results were verified by 14C accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) method (ASTM-D6866) and compared with the yield mass balance method. Strong agreement between δ13C and 14C AMS methods demonstrated the applicability of the δ13C method to quantify renewable carbon content in coprocessing fuel products and guide the coprocessing optimization. ©

AB  - The worldwide dependence of population on fossil fuels continues to have several harmful implications for the environment. Bioethanol is an excellent option for renewable fuel to replace the current greenhouse gas emitters. In addition, its production by enzymatic route has gained space among the industrial processes because it replaces the traditional acid treatment. Due to its high versatility, the xylanase family is used in this process as an accessory enzyme for degrading the lignocellulosic substrate of biomass. A chimera built by a xylanolytic domain (Xyl) and a xylose-binding protein (XBP) showed an experimentally improved catalytic efficiency and interdomain allosteric modulation after xylose binding. In this context, we performed a quantum biochemistry characterization of the interactions between these domains and dynamic cross-correlation (DCC) analysis after performing molecular dynamics (DM) simulations of the systems in the presence and absence of xylose in the XBP active site. We used the density functional theory (DFT) within the molecular fractionation with the conjugated caps (MFCC) approach to describe the pair energies, and the corresponding energy difference between the chimera domains responsible for the allosteric effect and amino acid DCC to evaluate the interdomain coupling differences between the energy states. The detailed energetic investigation together with the related structural and dynamics counterparts revealed the molecular mechanisms of chimeric improvement of the xylanase activity observed experimentally. This mechanism was correlated with greater stability and high connectivity at the interdomain interface in the xylose bound relative to the free chimera. We identify the contributions of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and water-mediated interactions in the interdomain region responsible for stability together with the structural and dynamical elements related to the allosteric effect. Taken together, these observations led to a comprehensive understanding of the chimera's modulatory action that occurs through the formation of a highly connected interface that makes the essential movements related to xylanolytic activity in xylanase correlated to those of the xylose-binding protein.

AB  - Filamentous microalga Tribonema sp. has the advantages of highly resistance to zooplankton-predation, easy harvesting, and high cellular lipid content, in particular large amounts of palmitoleic acid (PA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Therefore, Tribonema sp. is considered as a promising biomass feedstock to produce biodiesel and high-value products. In this work, we studied the effect of different concentrations of nitrogen (NaNO3: 255-3 060 mg/L), phosphorus (K2HPO4: 4-240 mg/L), iron ((NH4)3FeC12H10O14: 0.6-12 mg/L) and magnesium (MgSO4: 7.5-450 mg/L) on the biomass, lipid content, and fatty acid composition of Tribonema sp. FACHB-1786, aiming at enhancing cell lipid productivity. The growth of Tribonema sp. had a positive correlation with the concentration of magnesium, and the maximum biomass of Tribonema sp. (under the condition of 450 mg/L MgSO4) was 8.09 g/L, much greater than those reported in previous studies using the same and other Tribonema species under autotrophic conditions. Different nitrogen concentrations exerted no significant effect on algal growth (P &gt; 0.05), but a higher nitrogen concentration resulted in a greater amount of lipid in the cells. The maximum volumetric productivities of total lipids (319. 6 mg/(L•d)), palmitoleic acid (135.7 mg/(L•d)), and eicosapentaenoic acid (24.2 mg/(L•d)) of Tribonema sp. were obtained when the concentrations of NaNO3, K2HPO4, (NH4)3FeC12H10O14, and MgSO4 were 765 mg/L, 80 mg/L, 6 mg/L, and 75 mg/L, respectively. This study will provide a reference for substrate optimization for Tribonema sp. growth and lipid production. © 2020, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Petroleum-derived fuels such as diesel, natural gas and coal have been the main sources of energy for the global energy matrix. Due to this, there is a necessity to implement new technologies to increase biofuel production from renewable sources, such as the use of soybean oil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the profile of the companies that were established to produce B100 biodiesel in Brazil from 2005 to 2015. The research was developed using data from scientific articles, master's dissertations and PhD theses, statistical yearbooks, laws and decrees in force. It also used data collections published by the government agencies and representative entities from the biodiesel sector for the elaboration of a correlation matrix for average prices of biodiesel, diesel oil and soybean oil. The average B100 biodiesel prices between 2011 and 2015 have been lower than the average selling prices from soybean oil. Currently, the biodiesel unit comprises 71.14% large production units, 20.31% medium production units and 8.55% small production units of B100 biodiesel. The participation of transnational companies in the biodiesel market is responsible for a significant portion of the installed production capacity in Brazil. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - To reach its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, Norway needs a shift away from the use of fossil fuels in the transport sector. The production potential and efficiency of Fischer-Tropsch biofuels and hydrogen from gasified wet organic municipal solid waste has been investigated. The carbon capture potential was estimated for both production processes and the number of road vehicles compared, which can be supplied with the fuel. Gibbs free energy minimisation is used to predict the synthesis gas composition. A detailed analysis of the different gas treatment processes that lead to either gasoline and diesel production, along with energy recovery as electricity, or hydrogen in either compressed or liquefied form is conducted. Both processes can utilise all available waste heat and the Fischer-Tropsch biofuel process is even self-sufficient with electrical power. The production of hydrogen has both higher first and second law efficiencies and a greater number of vehicles can be supplied with fuel. Either 2367 tonne H2 or 1497 tonne gasoline, 1279 tonne diesel, and 1.33 MW of net electric power can be produced at 1073 K gasification temperature, where both yield and efficiencies are highest. Hydrogen production also has the larger carbon capture potential during fuel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an important renewable fuel industrially produced by transesterification of fats and oils. Conventional process productivity is limited by high residence time in the reaction and separation stages. Liquid-Liquid Film Reactor (LLFR) is a new technology able to overcome this limitation. This work presents the scale-up, cost analysis and process feasibility for the LLFR. The study was made using a complete mathematical model which includes fluid dynamics, kinetics, mass transfer resistance, liquid-liquid equilibria, and cost evaluation. This study recommended the construction of plants with capacities over 5 t/h (about 40,000 t/year) in order to avoid over costs in the process and also recommended the employ of multiple reaction stages to reduce until 32% the global methanol consumption. Results also shows that to get a profit in this biodiesel production, the vegetable oil price must be less than 830 US$/t. Finally, it was found that the use of LLFR technology permit a reduction up to 60% in the required volume when two LLFR stages are employed in comparison to the traditional use of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR), this reduction promotes a final cost reduction up to 0.6% per kg of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel emulsion fuel is reported as one of the most feasible options capable of generating lower NOx emission than that from fossil fuels. However, oil and water in the emulsion fuel are easily separated and unstable. The aim of the present study is to consider the production and stability of biodiesel emulsion fuel by using tetraglycerin ester (CR-310), i.e., one of lipophilic surfactant, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and biodiesel, i.e., Waste cooking Oil Methyl Ester (WOME) produced based on waste cooking oil. The corresponding heat rate, water content, and viscosity are measured. Emphasis is placed on the effects of water content and surfactant on biodiesel emulsions. It is found that: (i) stable emulsion fuel is obtained by adding at least 2.0% of CR-310 and is maintained over 1 month, (ii) there is no effect of water content on stable emulsion fuel if CR-310 is used over 2.0%, and (iii) the viscosity of emulsion fuels is higher than that of the biodiesel fuel and is gradually increased with an increase in the water content. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Synergistic saccharification ability of hemicellulases (endo-xylanase and β-xylosidase) was evaluated in this study for the bioethanol production from plant biomass. Endo-xylanase and β-xylosidase genes from Bacillus licheniformis were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Maximum endo-xylanase production was obtained at 200 rpm agitation speed, air supply rate 2.0 vvm, 70% volume of the medium, 20% dissolved oxygen level and with 3% inoculum size. The optimal conditions for maximum production of recombinant β-xylosidase enzyme at pilot scale were 200 rpm agitation speed, 25% dissolved oxygen level, 2.5 vvm aeration rate, 70% volume of the medium with 2% inoculum size. Furthermore, the saccharification potential of these recombinant enzymes was checked for the production of xylose sugar by bioconversion of plant biomass by optimizing individually as well as synergistically by optimizing various parameters. Maximum saccharification (93%) of plant biomass was observed when both enzymes were used at a time with 8% sugarcane bagasse as a substrate and 200 units of each enzyme after incubation of 6 hr at 50 °C and 120 rpm. The results obtained in this study suggested these recombinant hemicellulases as potential candidates for the conversion of complex agricultural residues into simple sugars for ultimate use in the biofuel industry. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The demand for alternative sources of clean, sustainable, and renewable energy has been a focus of research around the world for the past few decades. Microbial/enzymatic biofuel cells are one of the popular technologies for generating electricity from organic substrates. Currently, one of the promising fuel options is based on glucose due to its multiple advantages: high energy intensity, environmental friendliness, low cost, etc. The effectiveness of biofuel cells is largely determined by the activity of biocatalytic systems applied to accelerate electrode reactions. For this work with aerobic granular sludge as a basis, a nitrogen-fixing community of microorganisms has been selected. The microorganisms were immobilized on a carbon material (graphite foam, carbon nanotubes). The bioanode was developed from a selected biological material. A membraneless biofuel cell glucose/oxygen, with abiotic metal catalysts and biocatalysts based on a microorganism community and enzymes, has been developed. Using methods of laboratory electrochemical studies and mathematical modeling, the physicochemical phenomena and processes occurring in the cell has been studied. The mathematical model includes equations for the kinetics of electrochemical reactions and the growth of microbiological population, thematerial balance of the components, and charge balance. The results of calculations of the distribution of component concentrations over the thickness of the active layer and over time are presented. The data obtained from the model calculations correspond to the experimental ones. Optimization for fuel concentration has been carried out. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Energy cane is an attractive lignocellulosic feedstock for processing into biofuels and bioproducts. A low-severity two-step hydrothermal pretreatment was investigated on energy cane for the production of monomeric sugar. Pretreatment temperature and time, in addition to the effect of disk milling, were observed for the glucose and xylose yields during hydrolysis. At residence times above 5 min in case of pretreatment at 200◦C, all of the hemicellulose was observed to be solubilized. The pretreatment condition of 200◦C for 10 min with disk milling was observed to provide the highest glucose concentration of 5.4%, and 200◦C for 5 min with disk milling provided the highest xylose concentration of 2.15%. The effect of disk milling in improving the sugar concentrations during hydrolysis was significant, especially at lower pretreatment temperatures and times. Low xylose yields at higher temperatures were attributed to the formation of degradation products at increased severity. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The increasing number of studies on the usage of egg-shell-derived Calcium Oxide (CaO) as a catalyst for biodiesel production highlights the need to investigate the effects of temperature on the calcination of egg shells. To this end, the present study investigates the calcination of chicken and duck egg shells exposed to different temperatures of 800°C, 900°C, and 1000°C for one hour. The synthesized CaO was characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). This study showed that there were changes in the distribution and formation of calcium, oxides, and the naturally occurring substance carbon during calcination of the samples. It was observed in both chicken and duck egg shells that 800°C was a decent temperature for calcinating egg shells to produce calcium oxide catalyst. © 2020 Sharif University of Technology.

AB  - The Chlorella sp. biodiesel was produced from the microalgae oil via transesterification process. Three combinations were studied. Blend of biodiesel (20%) with diesel (80%) was prepared and denoted as B20. Then the TiO2 nanoparticles were added to each B20 blend samples in a quantity of 50 and 100 ppm using an ultrasonicator. In compliance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) fuel requirements, the biodiesel blends have been characterized. In an unaltered four-stroke diesel engine using various loads, the biodiesel blends were studied. The experimental outcomes show a decrease in exhaust emissions in terms of CO, HC, NOx, and Smoke. © 2020 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rice husk is counted as an agricultural waste that results in environmental problems during its handling. In this work, rice husk was used as raw material for producing liquid biofuel (pyrolysis oil) via pyrolysis. The pyrolysis reaction was carried out at temperatures of 450, 500, and 550 °C for 1 hour. The pyrolysis oil was collected and weighted for every 10 minutes. The results showed that the increase in pyrolysis temperature caused the yield of pyrolysis oil to increase. The properties in the term of heating value also increased while viscosity and density of pyrolysis oil decreased. These properties were almost similar to diesel oil with a slightly lower heating value. The proposed model using the single reaction model and two stages model were fit to represent the mechanism of rice husk pyrolysis reaction in this study. However, the results of two stages model gave a lower error than those of the single reaction model. Furthermore, the rate of pyrolysis reaction at various temperatures could be determined using the kinetic data obtained from the developed model. This information would be useful for designing the pyrolysis reactor especially for producing biofuel (pyrolysis oil) from the rice husk. © 2020, Iranian Institute of Research and Development in Chemical Industries.

AB  - Abstract: The kinetics of bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose by protein extracts—supersonic-destruction products of Escherichia coli BB cells—is studied in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3– as the mediator system. The effect of the concentration of mediator, glucose, and protein extract is studied by electrochemical methods. The results are used in determination of effective parameters: the rate constant of glucose biooxidation, the constant of substrate-induced inhibition, and the activation energy. It is shown that the activation energy of this reaction falls into the interval of activation energies of dehydrogenase reactions. The voltammetric characteristics of a model asymmetrical biofuel cell which employs the protein extract as the anodic catalyst are determined. The maximum specific power of such model biofuel cell is found to be 400 µW/cm2 (4 W/m2). © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - In order to excavate thermo-alkaline lipases from bacterial living in extreme conditions, we try to express new gene from Thermosyntropha lipolytica DSM 11003, an anaerobic, thermophilic, alkali-tolerant bacterium which grows in alkaline hot springs Lake Bogoria in Kenya and explore its application in biodiesel production. The lipase gene (tll1) of 1434 bp were ligated at the Nco I / EcoR I sites of the expression vectors pET28a to yield the construct of pET28a-TLL1. The strain harboring pET28a-TLL1 was cultivated for expression at 25℃, the specific activity of 1.99 U/mg protein were detected in disrupted cells. The recombinant lipase TlLipA was purified by a simple two-step procedure involving heat treatment and Ni-chelating affinity chromatography. The subunit of purified TlLipA showed a molecular mass of 53×103 on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The purified TlLipA exhibited optimal activity at 65℃ and pH 8.0 and it was stable from 55℃ to 65℃. The enzyme remained above 80% of its original activity at pH ranging from 7.0 to 11.0 and at room temperature for 1 h. The activity of TlLipA was little unaffected by Co2+, K+, Na+, and Ni2+, and a little activated by Mg2+ and Mn2+, but were significantly inhibited by Zn2+, Fe3+, and SDS, and Tween 80 under the assay conditions. The purified recombinant TlLipA had a specific activity of 22.11 U/mg protein using p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) as substrate. Determined by Sigma-Plot of reaction rate on p-NPP, the Km was 0.23 mmol/L, the Vmax was 33.50 mmol/(L•min), and the kcat was 22.83 s-1. The enzyme was also active towards p-NPP, p-nitrophenyl laurate (p-NPL), p-nitrophenyl myristate (p-NPM) and p-nitrophenyl caproate (p-NPC), moreover TlLipA exhibited a strong preference for p-nitrophenol decanoate (p-NPD) and p-nitrophenyl octoate (p-NPO). Using recombinant lipase as a catalyst to prepare biodiesel in a solvent-free system, with a water content of 20%, an enzyme dosage of 200 U/g oil, and an alcohol-to-oil ratio of 4:1, catalyzed soybean oil reaction at 55℃ for 48 h, the yield can reach 91.75%. © 2020, Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd.

AB  - Hydrochars of cotton stalk (CS) at the hydrothermal temperature of 180−280 °C and the retention time of 0−120 min were used for the purpose of developing fuel pellets. Subsequently, the physical properties and combustion characteristics of the hydrochar pellets were evaluated to assess the solid biofuel production potential. Then, the hydrochar samples were analyzed by FTIR, TGA, XRD, and SEM, aiming to investigate the evolution mechanism of the chemical compositions (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) with the increasing hydrothermal temperatures and their effects on the compressive strength of the hydrochar pellets. The results indicated that the hydrochar pellets exhibited higher fixed carbon contents, elevated heating values, enhanced physical properties, and more stable combustion characteristics than the raw biomass pellets. Moreover, the skeleton structure of the crystalline cellulose was the critical factor affecting the compressive strength of the hydrochar pellets. In parallel, lignin was observed to be beneficial for fabricating solid bridges and also exhibited a substantial influence on the bonding performance. However, the crystalline cellulose completely decomposed into amorphous carbon, and the high carbonization degree of the lignin caused it to lose its bonding capacity, which led to a sharp decrease in the compressive strength of the hydrochar pellets pretreated at 280 °C to 2.9 MPa, lower than the CS pellets (4.2 MPa). Finally, the pictorial depiction of the chemical components’ structural characteristics exhibited in the hydrothermal carbonization process was displayed along with their influences on the hydrochar densification process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Green chemistry and sustainability are important concepts to incorporate into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Through the development of innovative undergraduate chemistry research projects in these areas, retention of students in the physical sciences can be improved. This paper describes two projects in undergraduate catalysis research: hydrogenation of furfural and the esterification of biooil from pyrolyzed wood. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of furfural with Pd/C led to the production of furfuryl alcohol, furfuryl isopropyl ether, 2-methylfuran, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. The metal chloride additives improved selectivity for furfuryl alcohol and furfuryl isopropyl ether. Catalytic conversion of pyrolyzed wood biooil in ethanol with a solid acid catalyst yielded ethyl esters, including ethyl acetate and ethyl propionate, as characterized by GC/MS These projects are described in the context of engaging undergraduate students in hands-on research for the purpose of improving retention and persistence, as well as preparing young scientists to enter graduate programs and the STEM workforce. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - Fungi accumulate intracellular lipids in excess of their biomass. In the present study, endophytic fungi associated with plants that are used to produce biodiesel, namely, Jatropha curcas, Pongamia pinnata, Sapindus mukorossi, Mesua ferrea, Terminalia bellerica, Cascabela thevetia, and Ricinus communis were screened for total lipid production. The lipid content in the endophytic fungi Lasiodiplodia exigua SPSRJ27, Phomopsis sp. SPSRJ28, Pestalotiopsis microspora SPSRJL35, and Phomopsis sp. SPSRJL36, were found to be more than 20% of their dry biomass, an indicator of being oleaginous. Saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene (SARA) analysis showed that L. exigua had the lowest amount of asphaltene weight percent, while Phomopsis sp. SPSRJL36 had the highest asphaltene stability. P. microspora contained the lowest sulfur content, higher heating value was found to be more than 35 MJ/kg in L. exigua, P. microspora, and Phomopsis sp. SPSRJL36, while Phomopsis sp. SPSRJ28 had a value less than 35 MJ/kg. L. exigua, Phomopsis spp., and P. microspora, when optimized for growth, showed a high amount of biomass and lipid content under static conditions. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in lipid content were observed among the fungal isolates L. exigua, P. microspora and Phomopsis spp. Genes of biomass-deconstructing carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZys) showed variable banding patterns among the isolates. The present study revealed that the growth manipulation of oleaginous fungal endophytes opens up avenues for their larger exploration as biofuel minifactories. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: The expansion of biofuels produced from cooking oils and vegetal oils is expected to increase, together with the production of exhausted clay used in the refinery process. Clay produced in the process is considered waste as it is not intended for further applications. This study has assessed a sample of clay produced by a vegetal oil refinery plant and tested it for environmental applications with two types of vegetal species. In the experiment, the oily clay was added to a sandy loam soil in different percentages in order to modify the soil texture and assess the effect on the hydrological and chemical properties. The results demonstrated that on the one hand, oily clay does not change the pH in the soil mixture and it enriches the elemental composition (in terms of Mg, Cu and Zn), but, on the other hand, there are counteracting effects. Even if oily clay did not have toxic effects on seed germination, when applied to the soil, the presence of Ni did affect the plants’ growth. The results thus suggest the need for phytoremediation prior to any application of such clay in soil.

AB  - Abstract: The objective of this work was to concentrate, through a membrane separation process, the fatty acids from oil/solvent mixture. The oil was obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction from freeze-dried cells of Mortierella isabellina. The concentration of the fatty acids was investigated using flat-sheet polymer membranes of ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. The effects of temperature and pressure were evaluated by the retention of the fatty acids. Oil retentions between 45.23 and 58.20% to ultrafiltration membrane and 43.50 and 56.00% to nanofiltration membrane were observed. The best condition for the ultrafiltration membrane was 4 bar and 40 °C and for nanofiltration membrane was 12 bar and 50 °C. The oil contains a high concentration of oleic acid and palmitic acid that is a desirable property for the biodiesel production. The results showed the applicability of this technology in the solvent recovery step whereas the oil recovered contains a high concentration of fatty acids.

AB  - Abstract: The preparation, characterisation and application of two catalysts active in selective hydrogenation (Pt/TiO2) and esterification (mesoporous SiO2 material modified with tethered sulfonic acid groups) reactions is described. The catalysts are characterised using a range of spectroscopic, microscopic and adsorption techniques. Pt/TiO2 catalysts promote valeric acid (a cellulose derived platform molecule) hydrogenation to pentanol, while –SO3H modified mesoporous SiO2 catalysts convert valeric acid/pentanol mixtures to pentyl valerate (a 10-C molecule which can be used as a diesel fuel substitute). Admixtures of the two catalysts catalyse the tandem conversion of valeric acid/hydrogen mixtures to form pentyl valerate in a single reaction. A rationale for the observed reactivity, selectivity and carbon balance is proposed.

AB  - The preparation of biofuels by catalytic hydrogenation from the pyrolysis products of Swida wilsoniana oil was studied. The catalytic hydrogenation process was investigated and optimized by single factor test and response surface experiments. The optimum parameters obtained by single factor test were catalyst dosage 1.0%, reaction temperature 170℃, reaction pressure 2.0 MPa, reaction time 150 min and the maximum conversion was 96.3%. The optimal parameters obtained by response surface experiments were catalyst dosage 1.05%, reaction temperature 173℃, reaction pressure 2.0 MPa, and the highest catalytic conversion rate was 98.1%. It was found by GC-MS, elemental analysis and FT-IR that after hydrogenation, alkanes increased by 8.15 percentage points, oxygen content decreased from 10.502% to 2.392%, and biological hydrocarbon compounds increased significantly, with the mass fraction of 95.12%. At the same time, the carbon chain C3-C7 in biofuels increased by 4.31 percentage point and C8-C19 increased by 18 percentage point compared with that of pyrolysis products. The product structure was closer to the existing fossil fuels. © 2020, Editorial Board of «Chemistry and Industry of Forest Products». All right reserved.

AB  - 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), an important precursor for biofuel production, can be prepared via dehydration of carbonhydrates such as cellulose. In this study, titanium tetraisopropanolate and zirconium n-butoxide with different molar proportion were used as the precursor to prepare binary oxides (TiZrO). Phosphorus was introduced to enhance the acidity of catalyst and to obtain TiZrPO. TiZrPO-1, TiZrPO-2 and TiZrPO-3 catalysts were prepared, when n(Ti): n(Zr) was 7: 3, 1: 1 and 3: 7, respectively. The structures of these catalysts were characterized by XRF, STEM, FT-IR and NH3-TPD, and the catalytic performance for the conversion of fructose and glucose to HMF was tested. The characterization results suggested that Ti, Zr and P distributed evenly in the catalysts. Moreover, the distribution of Br∅nsted acid and Lewis acid could be controlled by adjusting the value of n(Ti): n(Zr). When n(Ti): n(Zr) was 1: 1, the amount of Br∅nsted acid reached the maximum (2.55 μmol/g) in TiZrPO-2, and the corresponding Br∅nsted acid to Lewis acid ratio (0.49) was also the highest. The catalytic performance of TiZrPO on the conversion of fructose and glucose showed that, among the three catalysts, TiZrPO-2 had the best catalytic performance with 98.5% conversion of fructose and 76.5% yield of HMF at 40 min, and 72.2% conversion of glucose and 38.1% yield of HMF at 180 min; when TiZrPO-2 was recycled and reused for 4 times, the conversions of fructose and glucose still reached as high as 92.7% and 65.8%, respectirely. While the corresponding HMF yields were 72.6% and 30.4%, respectively, which indicated that TiZrPO-2 had satisfying reusability. According to the product analysis for fructose, levoglucosan, etc., it was found that Lewis acid could promote the conversion of glucose to fructose, while side reactions involving fructose was also favored. Br∅nsted acid could accelerate the dehydration of glucose to levoglucosan, and it also catalyzed the direct dehydration of fructose and glucose to HMF. © 2020, Editorial Board of «Chemistry and Industry of Forest Products».

AB  - The present study describes the isolation of the novel strain Candida intermedia CBS 141442 and investigates the potential of this microorganism for the conversion of lignocellulosic streams. Different C. intermedia clones were isolated during an adaptive laboratory evolution experiment under the selection pressure of lignocellulosic hydrolysate and in strong competition with industrial, xylose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Isolates showed different but stable colony and cell morphologies when growing in a solid agar medium (smooth, intermediate and complex morphology) and liquid medium (unicellular, aggregates and pseudohyphal morphology). Clones of the same morphology showed similar fermentation patterns, and the C. intermedia clone I5 (CBS 141442) was selected for further testing due to its superior capacity for xylose consumption (90% of the initial xylose concentration within 72 h) and the highest ethanol yields (0.25 ± 0.02 g ethanol/g sugars consumed). Compared to the well-known yeast Scheffersomyces stipitis, the selected strain showed slightly higher tolerance to the lignocellulosic-derived inhibitors when fermenting a wheat straw hydrolysate. Furthermore, its higher glucose consumption rates (compared to S. stipitis) and its capacity for glucose and xylose co-fermentation makes C. intermedia CBS 141442 an attractive microorganism for the conversion of lignocellulosic substrates, as demonstrated in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation processes. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Large quantities of enzymolysis lignin (EL) is produced with the development of cellulosic bioethanol. Valorization of EL is of important significance for the sustainable development of the plants. In this work, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of EL to bio-oil was proposed aided by the in situ hydrogen production via aluminum-water reactions. Results showed that reaction temperature had remarkable effect on the reactivity of aluminum powder in subcritical water, and most of the aluminum was oxidized to boehmite at temperatures over 340 °C with high hydrogen yield. In situ HDO of EL over NiMoS/Al2O3 catalyst decreased the yield of phenolics and ketones, but increased the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. In addition, the properties of the bio-oil were also improved via in situ HDO process. The feasibility of aluminum-water reactions as in situ hydrogen source was proved with EL as a promising feedstock for aromatic biofuels production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enzymes are biocatalysts responsible for driving all biochemical reactions in the cells. The enzymes determine the physiology of a cell and together regu-late the growth and proliferation of cells in response to various environmental signals. The ability of cells to adapt and respond to environmental conditions can be utilized for industrial applications. Hydrolases and oxidoreductases are the most common classes of enzymes used in various industries such as pharmaceutical, food and beverages, bioremediation and biofuels, among oth-ers. Oxidoreductases are the EC1 class enzymes that catalyze the biological oxidation and reduction reactions. They transfer electrons from one molecule (reductant that donates electron) to other molecules (oxidants those accept electron). Usually, the enzymes of this class are NAD+ (Nicotinamide Ade-nine Dinucleotide) or NADP (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate)-dependent. The oxidoreductases are a diverse class of enzymes responsible for catalyzing highly stereo selective and regioselective reactions, because of which they are the enzymes of choice for synthesis of optically-active com-pounds. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is one of the most studied oxidoreduc-tases. Generally, ADHs have narrow specificity towards their substrates. Here we are looking for ADH having high/ broad specificity towards the substrate. This review discusses the enzyme oxidoreductase, synthetic transformation with oxidoreductase and application of oxidoreductase in bioremediation. © 2020 International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

AB  - Grass represents a major renewable feedstock in temperate climate zones, but its efficient utilization is challenging in biorefineries and advanced biofuels due to its structural recalcitrance. Here hydrothermal hydrolysis (100–180°C, for up to 40 min duration) was investigated to improve sugar yields from grass silage. The optimal conditions (140°C for 20 min duration) showed the highest sugar yield of 0.29 g/g volatile solid (VS) of grass silage. Further increasing the temperature to 180°C favored degradation of sugars (such as glucose, xylose) to by-products (such as furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural). A first-order reaction model confirmed a two-step reaction with the first step hydrolysis and the second step degradation. An energy balance calculation indicated that pre-treatment at 140°C required an energy input of 16.5 kJ/g VS, which could be significantly reduced to 5.1 kJ/g VS through efficient heat recovery. This research assists in understanding of the hydrolysis mechanism and provides a practical solution to produce grass-based sugars for further advanced biofuel and biorefinery applications. © Copyright © 2020 Lin, Deng, Rajendran, Bose, Kang and Murphy.

AB  - Biofuel production becomes a sustainable developmental strategy, when wastelands are reprocessed as prospective mass culture sites (PMCS) for microalgae feedstock. Remote Sensing (RS) data and field visits were used to delineate eutrophic water bodies for PMCS. The floodplains of the Brahmaputra River Valley of Assam, India, were selected as PMCS and were defined using RS data. A green alga of the genus Parachlorella was isolated from an algal bloom present in the drainage system, of Tezpur University, Assam, India. The species was cultured in representative water samples from the PMCS and growth was monitored in open laboratory conditions against the control. The microalgal biomass was characterized and subjected to in situ transesterification. The fuel properties such as viscosity, density, calorific value and cetane number (CN) were determined to assess the fuel quality. The results showed the biodiesel fuel properties were within the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) purview. Additionally, the thermo-chemical conversion and subsequent characterization underscored the feasibility of bio-oil production from open laboratory culture of microalgae. This study highlights the practicability of combining RS data and experimental appraisal for cost effective, environment friendly and sustainable biofuel production, from microalgae cultured in wasteland PMCS. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of microalgae Spirulina platensis to the production of nitrogenous compounds in liquid fraction via slow pyrolysis was evaluated. Aiming to identify the best condition which maximized liquid yield, the effects of operational conditions mass load, temperature, and heating rate were evaluated using Experimental Design and Response Surface Methodology techniques and optimized with Differential Evolution methodology. The composition of liquid fraction was analyzed by GC–MS and the effect of the same operational conditions in nitrogenous compounds formation was analyzed. The separation of nitrogenous compounds was evaluated by extraction and adsorption techniques. The results indicated that the heating rate significantly impacted both the liquid yield and the formation of the nitrogenous compounds. At optimal conditions, a maximum liquid yield of 64.59% was obtained. The extraction and adsorption processes showed to be promising routes for the purification of nitrogenous compounds, however, extraction was more selective to separate them. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In situ transesterification of oleaginous microbes with short chain alcohol has been developed as a renewable process for the production of biodiesel. Dry biomass is often a requisite for the process to avoid the adverse effect of water on the productivity. As a consequence, large amount of energy consumption is required for prior biomass drying. In this study, the wet biomass of Rhodotorula glutinis, an oleaginous yeast, was used directly in in situ transesterification without biomass drying. The reaction conditions were optimized for the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and the effects of adding different surfactants were also studied. The highest FAME yield of 110% was achieved with a methanol loading of 1:100 at 90°C for 8 h as catalyzed by 0.36 M H2SO4, and the FAME content was 97%, which meets the 96.5% specified in both European biodiesel standards and Taiwanese biodiesel standards. The addition of 50 mM 3-(N,N-dimethylmyristylammonio)propanesulfonate (3-DMAPS, a zwitterionic surfactant) improved the FAME yield from 69% to 83%, which was obtained with a low methanol loading of 1:10 at 90°C for 10 h. Hence, the production of FAME with wet biomass under optimized reaction conditions was as effective as that with the dry form. This clearly indicates that using wet R. glutinis as the feedstock is feasible for the production of biodiesel by in situ transesterification. © 2020 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Without oxygen, there would be no combustion. Yet the crucial role of oxygen in energy systems has been largely underrepresented. The oxygen-dependence of fuel caloricity is used to derive energy-based metrics that challenge the prime facie objective of maximising biofuel mass yields—an objective that currently dominates the biofuel industry. Application of two energy metrics, namely the change in energy quality (ΔEQ) and the energy yield (ΔEη), demonstrates that any improvement in energy quality of combustibles must accompany increases in combusted oxygen (mO2), as ΔEQ=[Formula presented]−1, and that ΔEη is a function mass yield, η, and mO2: ΔEη=η([Formula presented]). Literature data produced mostly positive ΔEQ values: biocrude achieved the highest (126.3%), followed by bioethanol (107.7%), and catalytic pyrolysis (78.3%). Most data produced similar changes in energy yield per mass yield, ΔEη/Δmη ranging from 0.7 for biodiesel to 1.6 for bioethanol. Carbon yields and overall mass yields are demonstrated to be poor metrics for biofuel synthesis, and could undermine biofuel quality, hampering progress for conversion technologies aimed at producing biofuels. Biodiesel mass yields in particular were found to be inflated by as much as 73%. As such, ΔEQ and ΔEη are useful for cross-field comparison of biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The binary system of metal oxides is significantly considered due to improving the weakness of each metal cation by supporting other metal cations. Although SiO2–TiO2 is a conventional binary system which usually fabricated by the sol–gel method, the comprehensive study requires on their structure to achieve the suitable properties. Therefore, a series of SO42−/SiO2–TiO2 was synthesized by combining sol–gel and impregnation methods. The effects of Si/Ti molar ratio (0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1), and nitric acid concentration as complex agent (2, 4, and 6 M) in the sol–gel method, and sulfate concentration (0.5, 1, and 2 M) in the impregnation method were evaluated. The results revealed that Si‒O‒Ti bands were fully formed and the high amount of nitric acid concentration has an insignificant effect on the silica–titania framework structure. After loading a sulfate group, TiOSO4 was formed as a highly active structure, leading to increasing the acidity of the sample. However, this structure was transformed to form Ti2(SO4)3 at higher sulfate concentration that has an insignificant influence on the activity of the catalyst. The optimum sample (Si/Ti ratio of 0.8, the nitric acid concentration of 4 M, and sulfate concentration of 1 M) presented a high activity in the esterification reaction. 94.1% of oleic acid was converted at the conditions of 120 °C, 3 wt% of catalyst, methanol/FFA molar ratio of 9, and 4 h of reaction time. Although the catalytic activity was dropped around 9% for the second use, the catalyst preserved its activity for the next five times (i.e., 10% reduction in conversion) that can prove its ability for industrial application. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Diesel engine generators are one of the major methods for off-grid and on-demand electricity generation, particularly in the remote areas of some developing countries. However, access to fossil diesel is often limited by supply or price. In many regions, biomass is an abundant source of energy, but many types are not suitable for producing traditional liquid biofuels such as biodiesel. This paper explores the use of so called ‘slurry fuels’ produced by the blending of micron sized particles of carbonaceous material in diesel and assesses whether these ‘slurry fuels’ can be used in a standard diesel engine generator with minimal modification. Two types of micronized carbon chars were added to diesel, produced by either pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization of biomass. The results indicated that at high engine power, the micronized carbon slurry fuels can be run at a similar efficiency as pure diesel. The major issues identified included high engine wear and the blockage of the fuel injector. Hydrothermal carbonization was found to be the best thermal conversion route for producing micronized carbon in terms of emissions when blended with diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - White-rot fungi is capable of producing extracellular enzymes that degrade lignin structure and facilitate biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass wastes. However, fungal monocultures are constrained by low activities of the lignin-degrading enzyme system, leading to poor treatment efficiency and a long duration, which are not advantageous for large-scale applications. To improve enzyme production and enhance lignin degradation, a novel coculture system was proposed using the white-rot fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Irpex lacteus CD2. The degradation efficiency of the alkali lignin by the fungal coculture was 26.4%, which was higher than that of the fungal monocultures. It was due to the production of lignin degrading enzymes was promoted in the liquid medium. Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric and mercury porosimeter analyses results revealed that the alkali lignin treated with the fungal coculture had the largest porosity, and the degree of destruction of the alkali lignin structure by the fungal coculture was higher than that of the fungal monocultures. Meanwhile, the nonproductive adsorption of enzymes on alkali lignin was significantly reduced by 61.0% when the biomass was treated with the fungal coculture. As a result, the nonproductive adsorption was remarkably reduced, while it significantly improved the cellulase catalysis efficiency. These results demonstrated the synergistic effects of the fungal coculture for biomass treatment and provided a new approach for increasing lignin degradation while improving enzymatic catalysis and biofuel production through fungal coculture. © Copyright © 2020 Luo, Liao, Xia, Deng, Huang, Zhu and Zhu.

AB  - Higher alcohols like 1-butanol are considered important biofuels with superior properties compared to the more readily available bio-ethanol. An attractive route to prepare 1-butanol from ethanol is the Guerbet reaction. We here report the use of hydrotalcite-derived mono-(Cu-PMO or Ni-PMO) and bi-metallic (CuNi-PMO) porous metal oxide catalysts for the Guerbet coupling of ethanol to 1-butanol in a continuous flow reactor (320◦ C, 0.1 MPa, LHSV = 15 mL g−1 h−1) at extended times on stream (~160 h). Two distinct regimes with different product distributions were observed for the Cu-PMO and CuNi-PMO catalyst with time on stream. At the start of the run, the initial conversion of ethanol dropped from about 85% to less than 20% after 60 h and acetaldehyde was the main product (regime 1). At prolonged times on stream (60–160 h), fairly constant low conversions of ethanol (14%) were observed and 1-butanol was the main product (regime 2). Performance of the monometallic Cu-PMO catalyst in terms of 1-butanol yield and stability was lower compared to the bi-metallic CuNi-PMO. Detailed catalyst characterization studies (XRD, H2-TPR, sorption of acrylic acid, TGA, TEM, HAADF-STEM, and EDS mapping) on both fresh and spent CuNi-PMO taken at various times on stream was performed to determine the changes in catalyst morphology and composition during a run, and particularly to obtain information on changes in catalyst structure operating in regime 1 or 2. The change in chemoselectivity is in line with an increase in basicity of the catalyst at extended runtimes. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this study mesoporous SBA-15 was synthesized under acidic conditions using triblock copolymer Pluronic P123 as template and tetraethyl orthosilicate as a silica source. SBA-15 was modified by different iron loading (1.8 %, 5 % and 10 %) via post-synthesis impregnation with Fe(NO3)3∙9H2O. The obtained catalysts were characterized using XRD analysis, WDXRF spectroscopy and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. Pyrolysis of cellulose with and without the catalyst was investigated using TG-FTIR. It was found that the presence of the synthesized catalysts affects formation of solid residue and significantly alters the composition of the other pyrolysis products. All catalysts considerably reduced the fraction of compounds containing hydroxyl group. Fe (10 %)/SBA-15 exhibited the highest deoxygenation ability. SBA-15 showed the highest catalytic selectivity for synthesis of olefins, while Fe (1.8 %)/SBA-15 showed the highest catalytic selectivity for synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons. © 2020 Agija Stanke, Valdis Kampars, Kristine Lazdovica.

AB  - As the current advanced society, there is a precipitous increase in the application of computational modeling in almost every industry. Given the depletion of fossil fuels and the negative effects its burning has on the environment, one area of research gaining significant traction is bio-fuels. Computational modeling has the potential to be a cost-effective tool that enhances both productivity and economics for biofuel processes. Advances in artificial intelligence and its subclasses are making it possible to predict several items including process yields, substrate medium components and optimal process conditions among others. It has been employed in many bioprocesses such as pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass and various biofuel production processes. Further implementation of this computer-based tool may potentially mitigate the need for preliminary experiments and in some cases, lab-scale experiments. This review highlights the application of computational modeling in biofuel production and also discusses future trends. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

AB  - Large-scale production of biofuels and chemicals will require cost-effective, sustainable, and rapid deconstruction of woody biomass into its constituent sugars. Here, we introduce a novel two-step liquefaction process for producing fermentable sugars from red oak using a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF), water and dilute sulfuric acid. THF promotes acid-catalyzed solubilization of lignin and hemicellulose in biomass achieving 61% lignin extraction and 64% xylose recovery in a mild pretreatment step. The pretreatment opens the structure of biomass through delignification and produces a cellulose-rich biomass, which is readily solubilized at low temperature giving 65% total sugar yields in a subsequent liquefaction process employing the same solvent mixture. This process achieves competitive sugar yields at high volumetric productivity compared to conventional saccharification methods. THF, which can be derived from renewable resources, has several benefits as solvent including ease of recovery from the sugar solution and relatively low toxicity and cost.

AB  - In this research work, the characterization of the palm stearin biodiesel was made using Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR) and GC/MS methods. Analysis of the composition of fatty acids was done using the GCMS apparatus based on the retention time. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer was used for the spectrum analysis of the various functional groups and bands located in it. The properties of the palm stearin biodiesel were predicted adopting the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. Measured values of the properties were the density at 18°C as 0.88 g/m3, kinematic viscosity at 35°C as 3.4 mm2/s, the calorific value of the palm stearin as 37121 kJ/kg and the flash and fire points of the biodiesel as 130°C and 160oC respectively. The rapid and correct characterization of the palm stearin biodiesel was made by the NMR. © 2020 Technoscience Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The partial replacement of fossil fuels by biofuels contributes to a reduction of CO2 emissions, alleviating the greenhouse effect and climate changes. Furthermore, fuels produced from waste biomass materials have no impact on agricultural land use and reduce deposition of such wastes in landfills. In this paper we evaluate the addition of pyrolysis biogasoline (pyrogasoline) as an additive for fossil gasoline. Pyrogasoline was produced from used cooking oils unfit to produce biodiesel. This study was based on a set of engine tests using binary and ternary mixtures of gasoline with 0, 2.5, and 5% pyrogasoline and ethanol. The use of ternary blends of gasoline and two different biofuels was tested with the purpose of achieving optimal combustion conditions and lower emissions, taking advantage of synergistic effects due to the different properties and chemical compositions of those biofuels. The tests were performed on a spark-ignition engine, operated at full load (100% throttle, or WOT-wide open throttle) between 2000 and 6000 rpm, while recording engine performance and exhaust gases pollutants data. Binary mixtures with pyrogasoline did not improve or worsen the engine's performance, but the ternary mixtures (gasoline + pyrogasoline + ethanol) positively improved the engine's performance with torque gains between 0.8 and 3.1% compared to gasoline. All fuels presented CO and unburned hydrocarbons emissions below those produced by this type of engine operated under normal (fossil) gasoline. On the other hand, NOx emissions from oxygenated fuels had contradictory behaviour compared to gasoline. If we consider the gains achieved by the torque with the ternary mixtures and reductions in polluting emissions obtained by mixtures with pyrogasoline, a future for this fuel can be foreseen as a partial replacement of fossil gasoline. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The microbes present in bioethanol production processes have been previously studied in laboratory-scale experiments, but there is a lack of information on full-scale industrial processes. In this study, the microbial communities of three industrial bioethanol production processes were characterized using several methods. The samples originated from second-generation bioethanol plants that produce fuel ethanol from biowaste, food industry side streams, or sawdust. Amplicon sequencing targeting bacteria, archaea, and fungi was used to explore the microbes present in biofuel production and anaerobic digestion of wastewater and sludge. Biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria and wild yeasts were identified in fermentation samples of a full-scale plant that uses biowaste as feedstock. During the 20-month monitoring period, the anaerobic digester adapted to the bioethanol process waste with a shift in methanogen profile indicating acclimatization to high concentrations of ammonia. Amplicon sequencing does not specifically target living microbes. The same is true for indirect parameters, such as low pH, metabolites, or genes of lactic acid bacteria. Since rapid identification of living microbes would be indispensable for process management, a commercial method was tested that detects them by measuring the rRNA of selected microbial groups. Small-scale testing indicated that the method gives results comparable with plate counts and microscopic counting, especially for bacterial quantification. The applicability of the method was verified in an industrial bioethanol plant, inspecting the clean-in-place process quality and detecting viability during yeast separation. The results supported it as a fast and promising tool for monitoring microbes throughout industrial bioethanol processes. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Clostridium autoethanogenum is an autotrophic acetogen also able to utilize xylose as a carbon source. Here, we evaluated this organism's industrially relevant capability since the transformation of sugars derived from lignocellulosic materials to biofuels is of great interest. Initially, the organism was challenged with different initial xylose levels to determine xylose utilization and maximum inhibitory concentrations for C. autoethanogenum when grown in batch cultures. A critical factor that could limit xylose utilization is culture pH, and this factor was separately examined as a means to provide C. autoethanogenum with more suitable environmental conditions. Finally, optimum pH conditions for growth were tested to assess how efficiently initial xylose concentrations could be fully utilized. C. autoethanogenum specific growth rate was not impacted when cells were exposed to initial xylose concentrations up to 30 g L−1, while cultures amended with concentrations as high as 45 g L−1 showed a delay in growth and in formation of final fermentation product concentrations. Intermittent adjustment of the culture pH to 5.8 allowed for complete substrate utilization when step-wise fed-batch xylose additions were performed. Under these conditions the cultures showed a unique biphasic growth which enhanced biomass and end product formation. In C. autoethanogenum cultures exposed to an initial xylose concentration as high as 30 g L−1, pH adjustment to 5.8 supported full utilization of all available xylose and generation of up to 2.4 g L−1 ethanol and 9.5 g L−1 acetate. This work demonstrated that C. autoethanogenum can effectively biotransform xylose at concentrations typically present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate streams. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Eupatorium adenophorum, global exotic weed, is used as feedstock in the presence of two catalysts to produce renewable biofuels and green chemicals combining with the advantage of microwave heating and catalytic pyrolysis. The effect of catalyst on yield of pyrolysis products is studied. And the pyrolysis product produced from with and without catalytic pyrolysis is analyzed for performance comparisons. The results show that catalytic pyrolysis tends to produce more bio-oil and less bio-gas. The bio-oil from catalytic pyrolysis has more alkane and ketone, and less carboxylic acid compound compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis, indicates that catalytic pyrolysis could upgrade the quality of bio-oil. Compared to bio-gas of non-catalytic pyrolysis, the catalytic pyrolysis has larger CO and less CO2 content, particularly for Sodium chloride (NaCl) catalyst pyrolysis. The bio-char of NaCl catalytic pyrolysis has higher Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume. The above analysis indicates that catalysts pyrolysis makes the properties of pyrolysis product tend to good tendency. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Biodiesels produced from various feedstocks have been considered as alternative fuels used in internal combustion engines without major modifications. This research focuses on producing biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCOSD) by the catalytic cracking method using MgO as the catalyst and comparing the engine operating characteristics of the test engine when using WCOSD and traditional diesel (CD) as test fuels. As a result, the brake power of the test engine fueled WCOSD, and traditional diesel is similar. However, the engine fuel consumption in the case of using WCOSD is slight increases in some operating conditions. Also, the nitrogen oxides emissions of the test engine fueled WCOSD are higher than those of CD at all tested conditions. The trend is opposite for hydrocarbon emission as the HC emission of the engine fueled by WCOSD reduces 26.3% on average. The smoke emission of the test engine in case of using WCOSD is lower 17% on average than that of CD. However, the carbon monoxide emissions are lower at the low and medium loads and higher at the full loads. These results show that the new biodiesel has the same characteristics as those of commercial biodiesel and can be used as fuel for diesel engines. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Mechanism and kinetics of the thermal pyrolysis of ethyl 2-furoate were studied in a wide range of conditions (ie, 500-1500 K and 1-7600 Torr) using the accurate dual-level theory CCSD(T)&amp;MP2(FC)//B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ and state-of-the-art Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus based master equation rate model including hindered internal rotation and tunneling treatments. The predicted rate coefficients are found to be in accordance with the experimental data. The mechanism details are revealed as (i) the major decomposition channel occurs via a six-center transition state with the barrier energy of 48.3 kcal/mol at 0 K, leading to the formation of C2H4 and 2-furoic acid and (ii) pressure has a slightly positive effect on the rate constant, particularly at the high temperature. Also, the reactivity of ethyl 2-furoate toward OH radicals was discussed in the first place. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered a platform chemical used for producing industrial purpose carbon-based compounds. During HMF synthesis, the compound furfural (FF) is formed as a byproduct. Using spectrophotometric UV is not feasible because HMF and FF overlap around 280 nm, demanding separation techniques as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This work aimed at applying a synthetic route for HMF production by using wastes such as sugarcane bagasse and peanut hull, and developing a quantification method of HMF and FF compounds using UV spectra and pseudo-univariate calibration based on multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares. HMF synthesis was studied using inorganic acids in a closed reflux system followed by a biphasic extraction with n-butanol as an organic solvent. When comparing their respective biomass, sugarcane bagasse provides a higher amount of HMF, reaching levels of 1.65 × 10−2 mol L−1 after the synthesis with HCl at 0.50 mol L−1. Regarding yield, each ton of peanut hull produces 572.6 g of HMF, while each ton of sugarcane bagasse produces 10 kg of HMF. The calibration study using pseudo-univariate calibration models was validated by using the HPLC with relative errors lower than 15%, showing that it is possible quantify HMF and FF in the medium by using UV spectrophotometer. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Forty-one bioethanol real samples and related fractions, together with a biobutanol sample, have been analyzed with gas chromatography coupled to either mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Bioethanol with different water contents, samples originated from several sources of biomass, first- as well as second-generation specimens, distillation fractions, samples stocked in containers made of four different materials, and, finally, a biobutanol sample have been analyzed. The number of the compounds found through GC-MS has been 130, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, nitrogen compounds, organic acids, furane derivates as well as other species (e.g., limonene). Afterward, a quantitative determination of major components of bioethanol has been carried out. The achieved results have revealed that, besides ethanol and, in some cases, water, species such as acetaldehyde, methanol, and higher alcohols, as well as 1,1-diethoxyethane, may be present at concentrations above 500 mg L-1. While the source of bioethanol (nature of the raw material, ethanol generation, or water content) has a direct impact on its volatile organic compound (VOC) profile, the material of the container where the biofuel has been stored does not play a significant role. Finally, the results have demonstrated that, for a given production process, different distillation fractions contain unequal VOC profiles. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The furanic chemical 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is an attractive biobased fuel and feedstock. High-yield biphasic processes for DMF synthesis from sugars employ higher alcohols such as n-butanol (BuOH) as solvents. This leads to a product containing <8 wt % DMF and byproducts in the BuOH solvent along with water. DMF process economics are dominated by separation costs for DMF purification and recycle of BuOH and water. We previously demonstrated efficient adsorptive separation of DMF with a stable ZIF-8 metal-organic framework adsorbent. Here, we present a detailed, comparative technoeconomic analysis and sustainability indicators of adsorptive versus conventional distillation separation processes to produce 98 wt % pure DMF at 100 metric tons/day. The novel adsorptive process integrates a simulated moving bed (SMB) unit with water removal and desorbent recovery systems, whereas the distillation process relies on multiple columns operating at different pressures to handle the strongly nonideal multicomponent thermodynamics. Rigorous process modeling is conducted by a combination of the Aspen Plus flowsheet simulation package and our in-house SMB modeling and optimization package, with realistic multicomponent adsorption and vapor-liquid equilibrium models parametrized by experimental data. This is followed by detailed calculations and sensitivity analysis of bare-module, utility, and material costs. The net present values (NPVs) of the process alternatives show a clear long-term economic advantage of the adsorptive process, mainly due to large reduction in utility costs. For a 100 MTD DMF plant, the ΔNPV for adsorptive separation is strongly positive (>$6M at a 10% discount rate and 15-year operation) and remains competitive over a large range of sensitivity factors. When translated to a large potential DMF biofuel market size similar to that of bioethanol, the SMB-based adsorptive process would save >$8B/yr. globally in separation costs. Furthermore, the novel adsorptive process has much better sustainability indicators, including 41% lower process energy intensity and 37% lower process CO2 emissions, as well as a number of qualitatively determined environmental and safety advantages.

AB  - Background: While keeping in view various aspects of energy demand, quest for the renewable energy sources is utmost. Biomass has shown great potential as green energy source with supply of approximately 14% of world total energy demand, and great source of carbon capture. It is abundant in various forms including agricultural, forestry residues, and unwanted plants (weeds). The rapid growth of weeds not only affects the yield of the crop, but also has strong consequences on the environment. These weeds can grow with minimum nutrient input requirements, have strong ability to grow at various soil and climate environments with high value of cellulose, thus can be valuable source of energy production. Results: Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Cannabis sativa L. have been employed for the production of biofuels (biogas, biodiesel and biochar) through nano-catalytic gasification by employing Co and Ni as nanocatalysts. Nanocatalysts were synthesized through well-established sol-gel method. SEM study confirms the spherical morphology of the nanocatalysts with size distribution of 20-50 nm. XRD measurements reveal that fabricated nanocatalysts have pure standard crystal structure without impurity. During gasification of Cannabis sativa L., we have extracted the 53.33% of oil, 34.66% of biochar and 12% gas whereas in the case of Parthenium hysterophorus L. 44% oil, 38.36% biochar and 17.66% of gas was measured. Electrical conductivity in biochar of Cannabis sativa L. and Parthenium hysterophorus L. was observed 0.4 dSm-1 and 0.39 dSm-1, respectively. Conclusion: Present study presents the conversion of unwanted plants Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Cannabis sativa L. weeds to biofuels. Nanocatalysts help to enhance the conversion of biomass to biofuel due to large surface reactivity. Our findings suggest potential utilization of unwanted plants for biofuel production, which can help to share the burden of energy demand. Biochar produced during gasification can replace chemical fertilizers for soil remediation and to enhance the crop productivity. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The current challenge of drop-in jet fuel should couple the reduction of GHGs emission in whole life cycle with economic competitiveness and achieving performance as same as traditional jet fuel without reducing safe service life in engine and aircraft. From the insight of GHGs reduction, the whole life cycle, including sustainable feedstock, refining process integration and low emission in combustion are optimized for reduction in energy input and emission output. From the insight of airworthiness in aero-engine and aircraft, a certification process is achieved by extracting safety criteria from the “history experience” of petroleum-based jet fuel as the source and to predict the aero-engine safety implications of alternative aviation fuels as the target by “similar analogy”. The critical key parameters have been extracted by fundamental process related with safety and performance on achieving the duty of engine in the whole flight envelop. Alternative jet fuel can be qualified for certifying drop-in jet fuel and accordingly confirm with identical safe service life in engine and aircraft by analogizing the boundaries of critical key parameters with petroleum-based jet fuel. The critical parameters thereof, including carbon distribution and classification as well as C/H ratio, can conduct directly for feedstock choice and refining process modification. Accordingly, a process of refining algae-based jet fuel was modified coupling the requirement of GHGs reduction in life cycle with airworthiness in aero-engine and aircraft. Based on process integration to connect upstream feedstock to downstream combustion outcomes of alternative jet biofuel and co-product, GHGs in fuel stage deduced further by co-product and nutrient recovery in spite of additional separation process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present paper, an integrated continuous process of biodiesel manufacturing is proposed using Aspen Plus simulator for different feedstocks. Majority of the reported simulation models in literature are design models for new processes by fixing some level of equipment performance such as the conversion in reactor. Most models assume the feed oil as pure triglycerides or some fatty acids and the biofuel as pure ester. In order to optimize the production of biodiesel, similarity with reality is necessary. For this purpose, this work uses thermophysical property estimation of glycerides, rigorous reaction kinetics, phase equilibrium for separation and purification units, and prediction of essential biodiesel fuel qualities. Detailed operating conditions, equipment designs, and properties of feed and products were obtained. The reactions and parameters kinetics were applied to represent both methanolic and ethanolic transesterification of the biodiesel production. An evaluation of optimal operating conditions (time, temperature, alcohol: oil ratio) for a CSTR reactor was determined. The optimal conversion was achieved at a temperature of 60 °C, 6.00 mol/mol alcohol-oil ratio and 2.0 h residence time when used methanol transesterification reaction as 88.19, 93.77, 89.43, and 89.25%, respectively for sunflower, soybean, palm and macauba oil, on the other hand 86.09, 80.26, 76.54, and 76.39% for transesterification ethanolic. Most of the biodiesel obtained from the simulations presented adequate according to the specifications of the D6751, ANP 45, and EN 14214 standards. Finally, the model proposed can be used for improving operations conditions, new products design and help economic analysis in continuous processes of biodiesel production. © 2020 De Gruyter.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Full demonstrations of the production of microalgal biodiesel from conversion to purification have been reported only rarely in the literature. This study was aimed at developing a mini production line consisting of sequential conversion, extraction and purification of biodiesel from Scenedesmus acuminatus S4 grown in domestic wastewater. RESULTS: The data showed that the separated conversion-extraction (SCE) produced biodiesel with high yield (99.9%) and purity (87.5%) at 200 g L–1 biomass loading, 5% H2SO4/methanol (v/v) catalyst loading, 100 °C reaction temperature and 200 rpm stirring rate, in a 1 h conversion reaction, followed by extraction with hexane (10 mL:1 g dry cell weight) by mixing for 10 min (200 rpm) at 25 °C. The integrated conversion-extraction (ICE) performed by simultaneous addition of hexane to the biomass and the catalytic solution mixture under the optimized conditions, achieved biodiesel yield and purity of 91.9% and 81.4%, respectively. Crude biodiesel was purified by 40% (w/v) adsorbents [Magnesol and D-sol® (D60)]/crude biodiesel achieving &gt;95% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) purity, which is superior to the results in the literature and equivalent to fuel grade standard. CONCLUSIONS: Fuel grade biodiesel was successfully produced from S. acuminatus S4 via sequential steps of direct conversion, extraction and purification. The conversion step can be performed via SCE or ICE followed by extraction to obtain crude biodiesel (99% yield and 87.5% purity), whereas the purification step was implemented by dry-washing with Magnesol or D-sol® (D60) to &gt;95% FAME. The current production line has technical merits that need to be further optimized for large-scale application. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Owing to their efficient photosynthesis, microalgae tend to possess superior growth rates and high lipid production, hence their significance to the biofuel sector. The bulk harvesting of microalgae from cultures is a substantial stage in advancing the production of biomass-based fuels. However, a reliable and cost-effective harvesting technology is not yet available. Foam flotation, which is a subcategory of the adsorptive bubble separation process, shows considerable promise for the harvesting and enrichment of microalgae biomass. The available literature indicates that virtually no data has been reported on the flotation kinetics of microalgae. Therefore, to better describe the recovery of microalgae by the flotation process, this work studied the flotation kinetics of the freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. The recovery of microalgae cells in a batch foam flotation column over time at different operating conditions was fitted to nine flotation kinetic models, including first, fractional, and second order kinetic models; a first order kinetic model with rectangular, exponential, gamma, and sinusoidal distributions of floatabilities; a second order kinetic model with rectangular distribution of floatabilities; a fully mixed reactor; and modified Kelsall flotation kinetic models. Evaluation of the kinetic models showed that the discrete rate constant model (i.e. modified Kelsall kinetic model) fitted the experimental data best. The modified Kelsall model shows the highest values of adjusted R2 (&gt;0.995) and the lowest values of mean squared error (&lt;2.63). Apart from the modified Kelsall model, which has discrete rate constants, no single kinetic model, with or without a continuous distribution, was sufficient to represent the flotation data, and the optimal model may vary under different conditions. More work is recommended using different freshwater and marine microalgae species. © 2020, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) is one of important biomass-derived platform compounds which can be used to prepare biofuel precursors by aldol self-condensation reaction. Two kinds of sulfonic acid functionalized ionic liquids and two kinds of carboxylic acid functionalized ionic liquids were prepared for levulinic acid (LA) self-condensation. Their structures, acid amount and acid strength were analyzed by means of IR spectrum analysis, acid-base titration, Hammett method combined with UV-vis spectroscopy analysis, respectively. Then the catalytic performance of the prepared ionic liquids for LA self-condensation was evaluated. The results show that the acid strength of ionic liquids had positive correlation with LA conversion and had negative correlation with the yield of C9-C16 products. The carboxylic acid functionalized ionic liquid [c-m-N(Et)3]BF4 exhibited a better catalytic performance for the formation of C9-C16 products. The effects of different solvents and reaction conditions on LA self-condensation catalyzed by [c-m-N(Et)3]BF4 were investigated. The suitable reaction conditions were determined as follows: LA of 3 g, diethyl ether solvent amount of 27 mL, a catalyst amount of 10%, a reaction temperature of 130 ℃ and a reaction time of 6 h. Under these conditions, the conversion of LA was 49.1%, and the yields of C5-C8, C9-C16 and C17-C21 products were 7.4%, 16.8% and 24.7%, respectively. Furthermore, [c-m-N(Et)3]BF4 could be reused at least four times without a significant change in its structure and catalytic performance.

AB  - Due to thegrowing awareness of fossil fuel depletion and environmental issues, biodiesel alternative fuel is currently of substantial interest. This research assessed herbal industry wastes as a potential resource for biodiesel production for the first time. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), obtained in the transesterification reaction, were extracted from the herbal samples by ultrasound-assisted extraction and identified withgas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode. The presence of at least 20 (e.g., in chamomile and chicory) FAMEs, up to 31 in nettle and senna, was reported. The unsaturated FAMEs were found in higher amounts than saturated. Linoleic acidwas the major polyunsaturated FAME in herbal wastes, while palmitic acid was the major saturated FAME. The highest content of FAMEs was identified in rye bran, Figure tea, and chicory. According to the cetane number prediction, BS EN 14214:2012+A2:2019, and hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC)wastes from, e.g., nettle, sage, and senna, are the most suitable in biodiesel production with fuel properties acceptable by the EuropeanStandards.Principal component analysis and HCPC allowed to classify and groupsimilar plants according to their FAMEs content; however, additional studies of herbal biofuel properties are needed. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The rate of Indonesian oil imports has increased from 1980 to the present, despite fluctuations. The transportation sector is the largest oil consumption above the industrial and household sectors. The availability, price, and environment factors also make a reason to think about cleaner fuels. Therefore, we conducted a review of the experience of implementing alternative fuels. At present, LPG, CNG, ethanol and biodiesel are good candidates to replace conventional fuels for land transportation in Indonesia. For gas-based fuels, LPG is relatively easy to implement because it only requires a slight modification to the engine but it is not suitable for the future because it is a refinery product. CNG provides advantages over LPG. The lower carbon content and high octane number provide better environmental effects and can be applied to machines with a higher compression ratio. For biofuels, ethanol has almost all the main characteristics for cleaner SI engine fuels. Indonesia has abundant biodiversity to produce ethanol. However, large-scale production will conflict with the availability of land for food crop production. Biodiesel has been produced on a large scale in Indonesia. Palm oil, Jatropha curcas, sunflowers and all seeds containing oil can be planted on all islands in Indonesia. One feature of biodiesel is that it can be applied independently or mixed with diesel oil. With improved quality, biodiesel can be applied to diesel engines without engine modification. This makes biodiesel more feasible for diesel engines than ethanol for gasoline engines. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fabrication of sensitive and convenient methods for the detection of heavy metal ions is an important task due to their high toxicity to environment and human health. Divalent mercury ions (Hg2+) are a kind of significant public health hazard, which generate harmful toxic effects. In this work, a novel self-powered biosensor for the quantification of Hg2+ in aqueous solutions is developed. Porous magnetic nanoparticles are synthesized to load electrochemical species and a Hg2+ responsive single-stranded DNA probe is used to seal them. After specific interaction with target ions, the DNA probe forms a rigid duplex, which can no longer block the pores of the magnetic nanoparticles. The leakage of electrochemical species can then increase the electrochemical response, which is used to indicate the initial concentration of Hg2+. This method shows high sensitivity and selectivity, and can be applied in real water samples with excellent recoveries. Therefore, a novel approach is provided for ultrasensitive and reliable detection of Hg2+ in practical applications. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Waste cooking oil was used to dry sewage sludge by fry-drying technology. The obtained oil-fried sludge, which contained waste cooking oil and sewage sludge, was converted into biofuel simultaneously via pyrolysis process in a fixed bed. The synergistic effects of sewage sludge and waste cooking oil on the pyrolysis products were also investigated. Comparing to pyrolysis of sludge, pyrolysis of oil-fried sludge can obtain 51.9% higher gas products, where H2 and CH4 yields were increased by 37.4% (up to 211 ml/g) and 163% (up to 155 ml/g), respectively. The lower heating value (LHV) of gas product from oil-fried sludge was 41.2% higher than that from sludge. The higher LHV of gaseous products can be beneficial to use for power generation and heating. This indicates that oil-fried sludge shows a potential feedstock can be converted into high valuable biofuel. Nevertheless, the experimental gas and tar yield values of oil-fried sludge were lower than calculated values, indicating that there is an anergy effect of interactions between SS and oil on gas and tar formations. This was because the oily materials layer inhibited the heat and mass transfer in the sludge pyrolysis process, and then hindering the conversion of sludge into gas and tar formation. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Algal biorefinery process utilizes every component of algal biomass to produce multiple useful fuel products. In this technique, acid pretreatment of algal biomass hydrolyzes microalgal carbohydrates into fermentable sugars, makes lipids more extractable and a protein part accessible for additional products. In the present study, Chlorella sorkiniana produced higher quantity of biodiesel than Botryococcus braunii and biomass in Botryococcus braunii was higher than the Chlorella sorkiniana. Botryococcus braunii produces 11% more lipid content than Chlorella sorkiniana which was consistent with biomass content. The total sugar (oligomeric and monomeric) yield attained by Combined Algal Processing (CAP) was 89.9%. 29 g/L ethanol was produced during the fermentation in the Pretreated Algal Slurry. The recovery of lipids from CAP was reported as 84–89% after fermentation and ethanol removal. CAP preserves the PUFA (Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids) and utilizes these high-value PUFAs to further reduce the cost of biofuel production and replace petroleum products. © 2020 University of Tehran.

AB  - In this study, waste cooking oil (WCO) was used to successfully manufacture catalyst cracking biodiesel in the laboratory. This study aims to evaluate and compare the influence of waste cooking oil synthetic diesel (WCOSD) with that of commercial diesel (CD) fuel on an engine’s operating characteristics. The second goal of this study is to compare the engine performance and temperature characteristics of cooling water and lubricant oil under various engine operating conditions of a test engine fueled by waste cooking oil and CD. The results indicated that the engine torque of the engine running with WCOSD dropped from 1.9 Nm to 5.4 Nm at all speeds, and its brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) dropped at almost every speed. Thus, the thermal brake efficiency (BTE) of the engine fueled by WCOSD was higher at all engine speeds. Also, the engine torque of the WCOSD-fueled engine was lower than the engine torque of the CD-fueled engine at all engine speeds. The engine’s power dropped sequentially through 0.3 kW, 0.4 kW, 0.6 kW, 0.9 kW, 0.8 kW, 0.9 kW, 1.0 kW and 1.9 kW. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Industrialization and energy demand increase are highlighted as consequences of world population growth for decades. Thereby, aiming to contribute to sustainable processes capable of mitigating the effects resulting from this process, biofuels have been intensively researched, produced and used in recent years. Among the possibilities, dimethyl ether (DME) stands out with great prospects replacing liquefied petroleum gas and diesel due to its potential as clean fuel. This work aims to conjoin the production of DME, a biofuel with great prospects for technical performance, safety, and economy, with a favorable destination for vinasse, the most worrying residue of ethanol production, due to its high polluting potential and large production volume in several countries. A rigorous and robust simulation of direct synthesis of DME from vinasse-derived syngas is performed using Aspen Hysys and its supplements, evaluating the technical and economic aspects of its production in ethanol distilleries. Results of the proposed scenario point that the process is technically feasible, reaching a purity of 99.9%, respecting the minimum required by standard norms. In addition, the designed process achieved yields of 1 kg of DME for each 1.6 kg of syngas. The simulated process presented a total capital cost of 47.1 millions of dollars, operating costs of 14.1 millions of dollars per year, and utilities cost of 11.2 millions of dollars per year. Considering energy cogeneration, an economy of 9.2% was reached, resulting in a production cost of simulated stage of 98.36 US$/tonne of DME and, considering a complete scenario, an accumulated cost of 233.48 US$/tonne of DME. It demonstrates an economic competitiveness for the DME price and ensures a considerable profit margin for the process. Consequently, the investigated DME production scenario emerges as a promising diesel substitute in a realistic scenario.

AB  - A non-edible waste, from biodiesel processing industry is being turned to carbonaceous material (biochar) using slow pyrolysis. The material was found to be amorphous with hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups onto the surface. The influencing parameters, namely adsorbate concentration (0.05-5 mg/l), biochar loading (0.02-0.4 g), pH(3–12) and particle sizes (0.03-0.13 mm) were studied to observe the effect on the sorption of simazine using biochar. A multivariate optimization using central composite design in response surface methodology was performed employing desirability function. The optimized biosorption efficiency (B%) and capacity qe was found to be 91.98 % and 0.83 mg/g respectively with the optimized parameters as 3.76 mg/l of adsorbate concentration, 0.12 g of biochar loading, pH of 5.26 and 0.0535 mm of particle size. The simazine adsorption phenomena were found to be multilayer heterogeneous sorption based on Langmuir and Freundlich models. The kinetics investigation shows that chemisorption was involved for the transfer of simazaine to the surface of biochar with three distinct intra particulate diffusional zones. An adsorption process requires activation energy of 11.27 kJ/mol and the negative magnitude of ΔH* indicates the exothermicity involved in the process. © 2019

AB  - As a potential energy source that can partially replace fossil fuels, biofuels have the advantages of green, renewable, and sulfur-free, but their production costs are generally higher. The co-processing of bio-oil and vacuum gas oil in a fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) can effectively reduce the investment cost of a bio-refinery and the production cost of bio-fuels by utilizing the existing equipment in a refinery. To obtain the optimal biomass raw material and bio-oil production technology, Eco-indicator 99 was used to quantify the environmental impacts of the co-processing process, and a multi-objective optimization model was proposed to simultaneously reduce the economic costs and the environmental impacts. The results showed that catalytic pyrolysis was superior to fast pyrolysis in both reducing economic costs and environmental impacts; the different optimal biomasses were obtained under different objectives; biomass cost accounted for the largest proportion of costs and environmental impacts. Therefore, when optimizing the co-processing process, the environmental impact of the process should be considered. Reducing the biomass consumption is the most effective way to reduce both the costs and environmental impacts of the co-processing process. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - Microalgae are recognized as a promising source for biofuel production, which is known as a renewable source of energy. This study was conducted to optimize the biodiesel production quantitatively and qualitatively by the microalga, Nannochloropsis oculata upon culturing on two different culture media (F/2 and Boussiba media) as a comparative study through stress in the main culture compositions by 1) Treating with different salinity concentrations (20, 40 and 60psu), 2) Depleting from phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) sources for the two media. After different treatments, the growth rate, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and fatty acids contents were determined. The algal analysis cleared that increasing salinity to 60psu in F/2 medium and 40psu on the Boussiba medium led to increasing the number of N. oculata cells with the maximum protein and carbohydrate contents at late exponential phase. At lower salinity, there were no significant differences in total protein content while carbohydrate contents showed slight variations, and its minimum values were obtained at (N) starved medium. Total lipid and total fatty acids content were higher in N. oculata cultured on F/2 medium than on Boussiba medium at different treatments and achieved its maximum when cultured on N-starved > P-depleted > Salt-stressed 60psu, respectively. The highest physical properties of the produced biodiesel represented in the degree of unsaturation (SD), iodine values (IV), Cetane number (CN), and oxidation stability were recorded in N. oculata cultured on higher salinities and Ndepleted conditions in the two media. Using higher salinities up to 40psu (available in the natural seawater), N-depletion or P-depletion in F/2 medium for achieving highly economical results in the production of N. oculata microalga. Biodiesel produced from N. oculata oil can be considered as a potential candidate for commercial sources. © 2020, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

AB  - Currently, there are several studies using calcium oxide, calcium alkoxide, and calcium hydroxide for biodiesel production. However, there is still a lack of studies highlighting the use of calcium diglyceroxide (calcium oxide enriched with glycerin in the presence of methanol) as a catalyst in the transesterification process. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the catalytic efficiency and reutilization of the eggshell calcined and enriched with glycerin and methanol (ECEG), in the synthesis of methylic esters from frying residual oil. As a result, thermochemically modified eggshells showed catalytic efficiency during methylic transesterification of residual oils in mass concentrations of 15%, 5%, 3%, and 1% due to the presence of a high level of esters (97.39, 96.97, 97.75, and 92.96%, respectively). The initial concentration of the enriched eggshell used in methanolysis had a direct effect on the final ester mixture. A 15% increase in the water content of the frying oil contributed to an increase in the ester content. The ECEG was reactive and efficient for four reaction cycles (without reactivation of the catalytic sites) due to the evidence of a high ester content (97.85%, 98.67%, 98.89%, 98.46%), reaching the standard quality of worldwide biodiesel regulations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to obtain an effective solid base with high surface area and hierarchical distribution of pore size, CaO(O) was synthesized via an exotemplating method, using radish as template and calcium acetate as precursor. RESULTS: The CaO(O) obtained by calcination of the impregnated biomorphic template demonstrated effective catalytic activity for the coupling transesterification of vegetable oil to produce biodiesel under mild reaction conditions using tri-components (methanol, oil and methyl acetate) as resources. High yield of biodiesel, 98.6%, was obtained with a molar rapeseed oil/methyl acetate/methanol ratio of 1:1:8 under 65 °C at 2 h, which is greatly shorter than 6 h over commercial calcium oxide (CaO). CONCLUSION: Various techniques including nitrogen physical adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric (TG), carbon dioxide-chemical adsorption and morphology have been employed to characterize the samples. These results demonstrated that the synthesized CaO derived from plant template has a large surface area and various pore diameter distribution which cause hierarchical basic sites over the solid base. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Herein Handal oil extraction from waste biomass is investigated for biodiesel production via esterification and transesterification processes. Furthermore, the physicochemical characteristics of Handal biodiesel (density, kinematic viscosity, specific gravity, pour point, flash point, and cloud point) was performed along with testing the fuel quality used in internal combustion engines. The flash point of the obtained Handal biodiesel (49.5 °C) was lower than that of petroleum diesel (68.3 °C). While at 40 °C, the kinematic viscosity of used Handal oil (4.476 cSt), which was higher than that of diesel fuel (2.6 cSt) and fossil diesel (2.27 cSt). Pourpoint of the used Handal oil was −9 and lower than that of Handal biodiesel, which is +3. The sulfur content of Handal oils was 193 mg/kg, which was higher than the Handal biodiesel value of 62 mg/kg, but significantly lower than that of diesel fuels (≤100 ppm). Similar engine performance regarding thermal efficiency between pure diesel and biodiesel at different engine speeds and loads was detected. The utilisation of such waste stream (Handal wild plant) in the production of biodiesel fuel will aid upcycling an otherwise waste and problematic thermochemical conversion feedstock by adding value for the application in the energy sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel (Greek, bio = life + diesel = from Rudolf Diesel) refers to diesel equivalent, processed from biological sources. Biodiesel is otherwise referred as “neat” fuel. It is a fuel derived from a chemical reaction of alcohol (methyl, ethyl, butyl, propyl, isopropyl) and vegetable or animal oils, fats, or greases. These oils or fats are chemically altered in order to use in any diesel engine, with little or no modification. A process called transesterification removes the glycerin component of the oil (which is a triglyceride molecule), resulting in a much thinner, or less viscous product, which stays down to much lower temperatures. It significantly reduces harmful pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide gas and reduces our vehicles contribution to climate change. Current oil and gas reserves are sufficing to last only a few more decades. The scarcity of known petroleum reserves will make renewable energy sources more attractive. To meet the rising energy demand and replace petroleum reserves, fuels, natural gas etc., Biodiesel is in the forefront of alternative technologies. The first record of Biodiesel usage was in 31st August 1937, by the University of Brussels, Belgium who conducted transesterification of vegetable oil using ethanol in order to separate the fatty acids from glycerol by replacing the glycerol with short liner alcohols. More recently Renault and Peugeot have approved the use of biodiesel in some of their own truck engines. In 1991, the European Community (EC) proposed a 90% tax deduction for the use of biofuels, including biodiesel. Now a days each of the plant are producing up to &gt;1.5 billion gallons of fuel per year. The European Union accounted for nearly 89% of all biodiesel production worldwide in 2005.

AB  - In this work, nine different biodiesels were obtained by transesterification reaction with three types of vegetable oils and three variant alcohols. The objective was to analyze them physicochemically before and after they went to the engine, to know if they had the necessary properties to act as lubricants. Subsequently, the same biodiesels were analyzed in the engine in order to observe the behavior of their dynamic viscosities, to evaluate if they were similar or superior to commercial lubricants. It was possible to note that all biodiesel produced are within the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) legislation and presented as potential lubricants, due to the kinematic viscosity behavior when compared before and after the engine. These results made them possible replacements for commercial lubricants, besides having greater advantages for the engine and the environment. However, although coconut oil-derived biodiesel has good yields, it is not promising because, at temperatures below 25 °C tends to solidify, causing short, medium- A nd long-term engine parts wear. © 2020 Atlantis Livros Ltda..

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional transesterification of vegetable oil with methanol for biodiesel production leads to the separation of glycerol and relatively low reaction efficiency. Methyl acetate is a more common solvent being less toxic and less soluble in water. In the presence of bases the transesterification of methyl acetate with glycerol can easily proceed at refluxing temperature. RESULTS: A yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) of 98.0% can be obtained with oil/methyl acetate/methanol molar ratio of 1:1:8 and 10% dosage of KCl/CaO at 65 °C after reaction for 1 h. Furthermore, results of water resistance experiments indicated that trace water gave a promoting effect on FAME yield. Recycling experiments were conducted for four cycles and a greater than 90% yield of FAME indicated the high stability of KCl/CaO. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient biodiesel production with no glycerol byproduct has been developed using a tri-component (canola oil, methyl acetate and methanol) coupling chemical reaction with calcium oxide-supported chloride as catalyst. Various characterization techniques revealed that the unique catalytic activity of KCl/CaO was related to its high degree of crystallinity, relatively high surface basicity and large pore size. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Strain engineering has proven to be a powerful method in tailoring the surface electronic structure and the catalytic properties of nanomaterials. Here, we develope a green and effective strategy for synthesis of Au icosahedron and report systematic studies Au nanocrystals (including cubes, octahedrons, and icosahedrons) with similar nanosizes as efficient electrocatalyst for glucose-based biofuel cells. Our results demonstrate that the penta-twinned Au icosahedron catalyst shows a maximum specific activity in glucose electrooxidation with 2.5 mA cm−2 current density, which is over 3 times higher than the Au octahedron catalyst. The microstructures of Au icosahedron confirm that such enhanced electrocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the intrinsic surface strain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Production of value-added chemicals will ultimately enable commercialization of biofuels. While bio-oils contain phenolic compounds, their separation has generally been difficult due to very wide product distributions. Advances in pyrolysis have produced oils with low oxygen and narrow product distributions that have made separation processes possible. We have demonstrated the continuous extraction of phenolic compounds from fast pyrolysis oils from switchgrass, produced using catalytic and/or tail-gas reactive pyrolysis, which enables distillation due to the absence of unstable oxygenated compounds. Having successfully distilled the bio-oil, the distillate was first subjected to batch extraction with 10 M KOH in varying ratios, and the yields of phenol and cresols were measured. Extraction yields of 15–20 wt% produced extracts where the proportion of measured phenolics consisted of > 50% phenol (i.e. “phenol selectivity”), an increase from 36% in the starting distillates. Washing the distillates with sodium bicarbonate before phenolic extraction helped to reduce excessive acid contamination. Countercurrent continuous extraction experiments using a Vigreux column attained steady-state after only a few minutes, although the phenol selectivity continued to increase for the duration of most experiments. Extraction yields ranged from 15 to 40 wt%. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Biofuel cells are an attractive alternative to conventional fuel cells, because they use biological catalysts. We report in this article the construction of an ethanol/O2 enzymatic biofuel cell. In the first time, the performance comparison with different methods for ethanol/O2 biofuel cell has been study. Alcohol dehydrogenase, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent enzyme, is immobilized with NAD+, diaphorase, and vitamin K3 (VK3) on the electrode. The oxygen is reduced at the cathode with laccase and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS). The performances of the electrodes are improved thanks to addition of carbon powder (KS6 and Super P® carbon). The benefit of the carbon particles with higher surface porosity was explained by the high-porous structure that offered a closer proximity to the reactive species and improved diffusion of ethanol and oxygen within the enzyme films. Efficiency of immobilization of NAD+ cofactor has been also demonstrated. We have shown the effect of multi-enzymatic reaction at the anode on the storage and operational stability. A high open-circuit potential has been recorded 1.02 V, demonstrating the benefit of NAD+ immobilization with maximal power density of 300 μW cm−2. Chronoamperometric measurements show a current density of 90 μA cm−2 during 20 h demonstrating the operational stability of the ethanol biofuel cell based on NAD+ cofactor immobilization. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The use of biodiesel has increased in the last decade and so has the obtainment of the main by-product from its manufacturing, glycerol; however, the direct use of it has not been possible due to the residual components that are present from the biodiesel production itself and the high-cost purification methods necessary for its reuse. Since this molecule presents a high potential for the development of a large variety of products, it is of great importance that this resource is harnessed. We present the results obtained from the use of a simple pH-based precipitation technique from which we obtained glycerol with 50% wt. purity and its assessment as a germination additive in two varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) obtaining a competitive behavior when compared with a commercial organic fertilizer within the germination and first stage of plant development suggesting a new use as an added value product for the biofuels industry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To improve the utilization of lignin, much effort has been devoted to lignin depolymerization with the aim to decrease waste and enhance profitability. Here, a dual property (acid and base) catalyst, namely S2O82--K2O/TiO2, was carefully researched. Upon loading S2O82- and K2O onto TiO2, acid and base sites emerged, and S2O82- and K2O mutually enhanced the acid and base strengths of the catalyst enormously; this indeed facilitated lignin depolymerization. Under appropriate conditions, the yields of liquid product, petroleum ether soluble (PE-soluble) product and total monomer products were 83.76%, 50.4% and 28.96%, respectively. The constituents of the PE-soluble fraction, which are mainly monomers and dimers, can be used as liquid fuels or additives. In addition, after the catalyst was modified by Ni, better results were obtained. Surprisingly, it was found that the Ni enhanced not only the hydrogenation capacity but also the acidity. The highest high heating value (HHV) of the liquid product (33.6 MJ kg-1) was obtained, and the yield of PE-soluble product increased from 50.4 to 56.4%. The product can be utilized as a fuel additive or be converted to bio-fuel. This catalysis system has significant potential in the conversion of lignin to bio-fuel. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A co-production strategy to improve economics of cellulosic biofuels is presented in this study, which produces biofuel (jet fuel range alkenes (JFA)) and biochemicals (1,2-pentanediol and 1,5-pentanediol (PeDs)) from cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of lignocellulosic biomass, respectively. Based on the laboratory scale experimental data, a large-scale process is developed to identify the economic feasibility. The minimum JFA selling price (MJSP) for the JFA and PeDs co-production strategy (JFA + PeDs) is US$ 2.90 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE), which is below the average biofuel price (US$ 3.29/GGE). Significant revenues of PeD lead the improvement of economics in JFA + PeDs compared to the JFA-only production strategy. The sensitivity analysis shows that JFA + PeDs is mostly economic feasible regardless of the varying key cost parameters (corn stover, catalyst, steam and H2) while the revenue parameters (the prices of 1,2-PeD, and 1,5-PeD) have large impact on the economic feasibility. This study shows that co-production of biochemicals with biofuels improves overall process economics and facilitates the sustainable production of bioproducts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolysis of frying palm oil was studied in continuous stationary process, in a micropilot plant. The main factors affecting the products yields are temperature and residence time. For the studied parameters range (temperature: 475°C-630°C and residence time: 120 s-240 s), the gas yield varied between 7.9% (w/w) and 63.3% (w/w), related to feed. Unsaturated hydrocarbon yields (olefins) can reach 24-29% (w/w) related to feed, at the right processing parameters, the main products having good yields: Up to 10% w/w for ethylene and 10.5% (w/w) for propylene. Also, the liquid fractions produced in the experiment were characterized having in view the use as fuel oils. The low viscosity (4.4-8.3 cSt at 20°C) and high heat of combustion value (9225-9260 kcal/kg) demonstrated that liquids are fit for use as fuel oil. These results are encouraging for industrial applications consideration. For this reason, mathematical modeling for the prediction of products yields was performed. The individual models for the main compounds (ethylene, propylene, methane, ethane, propane, carbon oxides) are in form of second degree polynomial equations; they are accurate as the statistical analysis proved. © 2020 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

AB  - Wet impregnating methods have been developed to produce advanced hydroxyapatite binary SrO-Ag2O3/ HA Catalyst with improved physiochemical properties, modified surface morphology and chemistry. A catalyst (SrO-Ag2O3/ HA) for decarboxylation / decarboxylation was used to turn palm oil into green diesel. FTIR, FESEM, XRD, TGA, BET, TPD-CO2 and TPD-NH3 have all been characteristics of the new catalyst. High catalytic activity depended largely on the hydroxyapatite and binary metallic systems' high and simple density of active sites that led to a greater synergy between the cycle of simultaneous decarbonization and decarboxylation of palm oil. The result showed a maximum range of 96% hydrocarbons and selection n-(C15+C17) of about 80% under optimal condition at 3% of the catalyst at 330°C, 3wt.% within 180min. The catalyst is robust with a high degree of reusability around 6 runs. © 2020 the Author(s). All rights reserved.

AB  - A conceptual biodiesel production homogeneous process was developed, considering the typical reaction conditions, appropriate thermodynamic models as well as the kinetics of a representative reaction for vegetable oils, under assumption to be mass-produced and provide a continuous way the raw material for the production of the biofuel. Reasonable assumptions and the use of a rigorous simulator of processes were employed; the process was simulated for the treatment of 1000 mol/h of oil operating continuously, at 45 and 55 °C, 1.0 wt% catalyst and 6 mol methanol by mol of oil. The processes of catalyst preparation, raw material pumping, heating, isothermal reaction, separation of byproducts by density and distillation were considered, and also auxiliary services of heating and cooling during the process. The convergence of each device was achieved by properly choosing the specifications of the unit operation models. Material and energy balances were obtained at each point in the process and in a global manner. For space-time of 30 min in single and series reactors global efficiencies from ~ 80 to 85% biodiesel was calculated for all explored alternatives. The ratio of energy production of biodiesel to the energy consumed by the process, within the battery limits used in this study, was found to be more than 6 times, thus ensuring the sustainability of the process from energetic point of view. It was found that, for the highest purity and better ratio of energy produced/consumed, the global efficiency process was the lowest. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - A one-step direct alkylation method for synthesizing butyl levulinate from butyl alcohol and furfuryl alcohol has been explored. This process is carried out under reflux, at ~ 120 °C for 2 h and utilizes a catalyst. Catalysts are based on phosphotungstic acid; the catalysts are modified via cation exchange, producing several cesium, copper and silver based phosphotungstates. Of these, the greatest activity and selectivity towards butyl levulinate was achieved over the Cu0.5H2[PW12O40] catalyst, with 100% conversion and a butyl levulinate selectivity of 69%. Various side reactions are also observed, with products that may also be suitable for biofuel applications. A detailed product analysis has been performed, and likely reaction schemes for these products have been determined. Overall, these results demonstrate an efficient method for butyl levulinate production from biomass-derived sources. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Biomass, the feedstock for biocrude and ultimately renewable diesel is a low energy density feedstock. The transport of this feedstock over long distance has been proven to be a major burden on the commercialisation of biorefining. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that biomass should be upgraded to biocrude (a relatively high energy density liquid) in close proximity to the biomass sources. The biocrude liquid would then be transported to a biorefinery. Biocrude contains large amounts of oxygen (generally up to 38 wt%) that is removed from the crude in the refining process. In this study, we have synthesised a range of spinel oxide based catalysts to remove oxygen from the biocrude during the catalytic fast pyrolysis. The activity of spinel oxide (MgB2O4 where B = Fe, Al, Cr, Ga, La, Y, In) catalysts were screened for the pyrolysis reaction. While all the tested spinel oxides deoxygenated the pyrolysis vapour, MgCr2O4 was found to be effective in terms of oxygen removal efficiency relative to the quantity of bio oil produced. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Softwood lignocellulose is a potential feedstock for the production of biofuels and bioproducts. However, the highly cross-linked nature of softwood lignocellulose restricts enzyme access to its sugars. Thus, harsh pretreatment conditions (180-280 °C) and/or high enzyme loading are required to unlock sugars. These requirements negatively affect the economic viability of softwoods in biorefineries. Here we show that H3PO4 pretreatment of pine and Douglas fir under a mild reaction temperature (50 °C) and atmospheric pressure enabled a high (â 80%) glucan digestibility with low enzyme loading (5 filter paper units (FPU)/g glucan). The dissolution and regeneration of softwoods disrupted the hydrogen bonding between cellulose chains, thereby increasing the cellulose accessibility to cellulase (CAC) values by â 38-fold (from â 0.4 to 15 m2/g biomass). Examination of H3PO4-pretreated softwoods by cross-polarization/magic angle spin (CP/MAS), 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that breaking of the orderly hydrogen bonding of crystalline cellulose caused the increase in CAC (higher than 11 m2/g biomass), which, in turn, was responsible for the high glucan digestibility of pretreated softwoods. The H3PO4 pretreatment process was feedstock independent. Lastly, 2D 13C-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR showed that the lignin was depolymerized but not condensed; thus, the lignin can be available for producing high-value products.

AB  - We evaluated a hybrid catalytic power source for less invasive internal electroporation with better tissue reach than the widely used and more invasive external electroporation. We modelled how open-circuit voltage optimizes platinum-loading in catalysts to improve the electrochemical activity (ECA) possible from bioelectrogenesis through these systems and address the high costs of nano-drug delivery systems. The effects of the catalysts' convective flux and proton concentration were modelled for an enzyme (glucose oxidase) biofuel cell that was fed glucose substrate at a current rate under isothermal physiological conditions. Glucose concentrations were varied relative to anode catalyst loading models with 0.1-0.5 mg cm-2 platinum and alloyed (Pt-Ru-Ni) with a narrowparticle size distribution. Using the free (solvation) electron model, bioelectrochemical activity (BECA) and a high open circuit voltage were generated by 5.5, 10 and 20mMglucose with 20kUL-1 glucose oxidase at 37°C.BECA(glucose oxidase), on its own, produced pulses of various intensities for nano-microsecond durations whereas the hybrid BECA-ECA (glucose oxidase and platinum) anode catalyst provided sustainable pulses of microseconds-minute durations. Enhanced catalysis with the hybrid BECA-ECA's open circuit voltage favours compatibility of a hybrid-powered nano-drug delivery system for internal electroporation. © 2020 South African Chemical Institute.

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel has been receiving attention as the most promising renewable and environmentally friendly alternative biofuel to diesel fuel. It has many advantages including oxygen content in the molecular structure and higher cetane number. On the other hand, the main lacks of biodiesel are the high viscosity (causing poor atomization and a decrease in engine performance), and high production cost. To handle both shortcomings, the combined influences of transesterification parameters (potassium methoxide amount, reaction temperature, methyl alcohol/oil molar ratio, and reaction time) on viscosities of biodiesels were experimentally examined as a full matrix experimental design. The transesterification parameters, which provided the possible minimum viscosity, were researched using the cubic spline interpolation method. According to results, the minimum biodiesel viscosity of 3.545 mm2/s was reached at the optimal reaction parameters (catalyst amount of 1.00%, methyl alcohol/oil molar ratio of 8: 1, reaction temperature of 55°C and reaction time of 53 min). The fuel characteristics of the final waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) produced under optimal parameters were also determined to be within limits in EN 14214 standard. © 2020 SAE International.

AB  - The study was performed to produce bioenergy through extraction of highquality biofuel from one of the novel fresh water in-vitro propagated microalgae Euglena gracilis. The biofuel was extracted from wet biomass of algae using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technique where 10% slurry of microalgae was catalytically (CoAlMo2O3 as catalyst) oxidized for 1 h under 350 °C temperature and 200 bar pressure. About 32% yield of biocrude was achieved from HTL of E. gracilis with 95% and 82% of deoxygenation (deO) and denitrogenation (deN), respectively. The lipid contents from biocrude were separated by phase separation and esterified for the evaluation of physicochemical parameters: Cetane number, density, aniline point, and moisture contents and viscosity were recorded as 50.86, 0.90 gcm-3, 101, 13%, 0.84 kgm-1s-1, respectively, which are in agreement with the international standards of biodiesel quality. Finally, the quality of obtained biodiesel was enhanced by blending with petrodiesel, where B5 (5% biodiesel + 95% petrodiesel), B20 (20% biodiesel + 95% petrodiesel), B50 (50% biodiesel + 50% petrodiesel) and B100 (100% biodiesel) were prepared and analyzed. B5 and B20 blends proved qualitatively better than B50 and B100 blends and could be used commercially. © 2020 Academic Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a well-known process with potential applications in the energy sector and waste management. The generation of digestate material during the AD process is considered a waste material. Although agriculture is a significant end-user of digestate, the surplus nutrient content, agricultural crop requirements, escalating transport costs, regulatory demands, and market acceptance constitute significant hurdles for utilizing digestate in agriculture alone. Many new innovative technologies are being developed as alternative approaches for digestate management and related options. Anaerobic digestate incorporates versatile characteristics including essential plant nutrients, enzymes, extracellular polysaccharides and trace elements. These properties give the AD digestate much application potential when combined with the appropriate treatments and valorization process. Microbial bioconversion, fermentation, hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis, Vacuum thermal stripping, Nijhuis Ammonium Recovery, Electrodialysis, Trans Membrane Chemi Sorption, Osmotic membrane bioreactor, chemical precipitation, Catalytic decomposition are the important processes commonly used to valorize the AD digestate. The AD digestate can be used as an organic amendment in agriculture, a substrate for algae cultivation, nitrogen and phosphorus extraction, energy production, synthesis of hydrochar and pyrochar for pollutants adsorption, energy storage and conversion, synthesis of various carbon and doped metal nanoparticles for photocatalytic activity and production of high-value chemicals. Among the multiple avenues open to applied research, some are entirely new. Hence, this review aims to incorporate recent research trends in AD digestate valorization, and subsequently generate knowledge on the preparation of novel products applicable to various sectors. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sound wave exposure in different photoperiods on Synechococcus HS-9 cell density and lipid content using tubular photobioreactors (PBRs). In this study, nine PBRs were used: three PBRs were exposed to a sine wave of 279.9 Hz for three hours during the day (A), three PBRs were exposed to a sine wave of 279.9 Hz for three hours during the night (B), and three PBRs remained unexposed to any sound wave to serve as a control (K). All PBRs were studied for 18 days. The results showed that the highest average cell densities of Synechococcus HS-9 in PBR A, B, and K respectively were 8.883×105 cells/mL, 7.242×105 cells/mL, and 6.175×105 cells/mL. The highest lipid percentage, which was 17%, was observed in PBR A; the percentage in PBR B was 16%, and in PBR K, 7%. However, Synechococcus HS-9 in PBR B showed a higher growth rate compared to PBR A and PBR K. Sound waves could have increased cell activity and metabolism which led to the increase in cell densities and lipid percentages in Synechococcus HS-9. The photoperiodic differences might have resulted in a lower photosynthetic rate and cell metabolism, but the sound wave could have helped promote the growth of Synechococcus HS-9 despite the lower photosynthetic rate. © 2020, International Journal of Technology.

AB  - For present time, declining petroleum resources, accompanied by an increasing demand for oil and chemicals by emerging economies, as well as environmental and political concerns about fossil fuels, it has become essential to develop energy-efficient processes for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals using alternative resources. In this respect, biomass (including vegetal waste from different industries and agriculture) is considered the renewable energy source with the highest potential regarding energy needs of modern society, for both the developed and developing economies. It represents a sustainable source of organic carbon and biofuels, which generate significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels, and can even be neutral in CO2 production balance, when efficient methods are developed. Regarding the technologies for vegetable biomass valorization, fast pyrolysis is one of the most viable perspectives, if the quality of the products (gas, liquid and char) is improved. Pyrolysis and gasification as well as the product upgrading can be performed by conventional heating or microwave heating. Both processes require the use of catalysts to improve the yields or quality of reaction products. The purpose of present paper was to establish the catalytic ability of montmorillonite (MMT) after doping with different transitional metals (Me = Ni, Mo, Co, Fe2+, Fe3+), following a procedure developed in a previous paper [1]. There were performed X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy before and after pyrolysis process upon the Me-MM catalysts to verify composition and to establish their structural and morphological characteristics. Morphological characteristics were determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) together with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) for elemental distribution and analysis. The results have shown the preservation of structural features even after use, confirming their good stability after calcination at 600OC, the simulated temperature of pyrolysis and were considered satisfactory and the initial tests on both thermochemical and microwave assisted pyrolysis seem to be promising. © 2020, Fundatia Serban Solacolu.

AB  - The emission of gases from the fleet of vehicles is one of the main sources of the environmental impact of the planet. Reversing this scenario, environmental awareness and a search for alternative sources of energy has been growing exponentially in recent years. In this context, the production of biofuels presents itself as an alternative for the lowest environmental impact, energy, and economy, with emphasis on biodiesel. The scale of production of this biofuel, the options related to the raw materials and their conditions are intertwined with the energy and exergetic efficiencies of the process. Therefore, no work was constructed as an analysis of the biodiesel production processes of soybeans and babassu, in which they were conducted on a laboratory scale. According to the results, the production of soybean biodiesel arose in exergetic efficiency of 73.25% and the production of biodiesel from babassu of 74.72%. © 2020, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - Energy plays a key role in each sector of life ranging from basic needs to better standards of life. The world is concerned about 3 ps (population, poverty, and pollution). The increase of these three factors has led the search of the best alternative sources of energies to fulfill all needs of a modern way of life. Biodiesel is a sustainable energy source that has proved to be the best alternate of mineral diesel that possesses similar properties as found in mineral diesel. The recent trend in biodiesel research is towards the use of very cheap feedstock to make this substitute more economical. Following this similar trend, the attempt is made to produce biodiesel from less expensive feedstock namely; residual oil of spent bleaching clay (SBC). In the first step, the quantity of the residual oil that can be recovered followed by assessing its quality was investigated. Afterward, a two-step method of the transesterification process was employed to enhance the yield of methyl ester. The highest yield of 85% was obtained. Key fuel properties were measured and found in good agreement with ASTMD 6751 standards limits. The study also concerned with the practical availability of biodiesel in terms of its stability. For this purpose, produced biodiesel was evaluated for its oxidation stability during 90 days of storage by FT-IR and rancimat methods. © 2020, Japan Oil Chemists Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is produced from the refined/edible type oils using methanol and an alkaline catalyst which is one of the environmentally friendly alternative liquid biofuels that has proven itself commercially, with international standards all around the world. In present investigation, mixture of two biodiesels in equal weight ratio namely Cucurbita pepo.L (pumpkin) and Tectona grandis (teak) seed oil was used for the synthesis of biodiesel with 5-ml Diethyl ether as additive. Performance test was made with the biodiesel blend using water-cooled, constant speed, CI engine, and emission characteristics were analyzed using a five-gas analyzer. It was observed that there was 35.5% increment in Brake Thermal efficiency and 25.8% reduction in Brake Specific Fuel consumption at maximum load for 200-ml pumpkin and teak biodiesel blend mixed to the diesel with additive. For this blend, it was observed at maximum load, the emission of Carbon monoxide reduced by 26.67% of diesel; Carbon di-oxide reduced by 12.96% and Nitrous oxide reduced by 26.57%. The emission gets increased in over load condition. Unburned Hydro Carbon emission and smoke opacity increased by 67.16 and 9.84%. The combustion characteristics of blended biodiesel with additive closely followed the diesel fuel operation. Hence, this blend was used as fuel in CI engine without engine modification. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the view of fossil fuel degradation and environmental aspects, biofuels always remain focused in the research field. In the present research work, the investigation was done on waste cooking oil because of its sustainability, low cost, and waste management. Here, the transesterification process of the waste cooking oil was optimized according to the central composite design of response surface methodology concerning the reaction temperature, catalyst amount, reaction time, and molar ratio (methanol to oil) at five levels. In the Analysis of Variance model, the R2 value is found to be 83% which shows the model is significant and adequate. The 92% maximum methyl ester yield was obtained at the reaction temperature 60°C, catalyst amount 0.75 weight %, time 80 min, and methanol to oil molar ratio 5:1. Also, the economic assessment showed the net cost of waste cooking oil-based biodiesel estimated 32.99 INR per liter. The result could serve as an essential data for upscaling and/or the future investigations in the usefulness of the waste cooking oil as a source of biodiesel. The biodiesel characteristics such as acid value, free fatty acid, kinematic viscosity, saponification value, calorific value, flash point, and cloud point were determined.

AB  - The present study envisages the use of diesel blended with plant based oils in conventional engine and their evaluation for engine performance and other emission parameters. Here, individual Pine (P20D80) and Eucalyptus oil (E20D80), and their same (1:1) proportion where ratio mixed (P10E10D80) as a 20% blend with the diesel was used. The selection of mentioned oils was made on the basis of their low viscosity and similarities to fossil diesel. The results revealed that when the engine was operated with P10E10D80, the brake thermal efficiency (5.5%) and lower fuel energy consumption was improved as compared to other blended fuels at full load. Also, the physicochemical characteristics such as viscosity, boiling point lower and calorific value of P10E10D80 were found to be comparable with conventional diesel. The cetane index of P10E10D80 was observed to be lower than E20D80 and conventional diesel, but higher than P20D80. The results revealed that P10E10D80 blend provide a maximum heat release rate of 71.94 J/CA at in-cylinder pressure of 79.63 bar and the ignition delay of the P10E10D80 blend was lower. Moreover, the EGT, HC, and CO smoke opacity emission of the P10E10D80 blend was lower as compared to diesel at full load. Interestingly, the atomization and evaporation rates of P10E10D80 were superior to other blends as well as conventional diesel. The results demonstrated reduction of 15.82%, 23%, 48%, and 26.79% in EGT, HC, CO, and smoke opacity, respectively, with the use of plant based oil blend with diesel. However, NOX emission was increased by 8.60% and observed a 13.50% higher heat release rate compare with blend and conventional diesel at full load. Moreover, an attempt to correlate the constituents of the oils with their performance has also been made. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Production of soluble cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) mutant proteins previously evolved on the surface of S. cerevisiae yeast cells was established for use in biosensors and biofuel cells. For this purpose, mutant cdh genes tm (D20N, A64T, V592M), H5 (D20N, V22A, A64T, V592M) and H9 (D20N, A64T, T84A, A261P, V592M, E674G, N715S) were cloned to pPICZa plasmid and transformed into Pichia pastoris KM71H strain for high expression in a soluble form and kinetic characterization. After 6 days of expression under methanol induction, the CDHs were purified by ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis confirmed the purity and presence of a single protein band at a molecular weight of 100 kDa. Kinetic characterization showed that the H5 mutant had the highest catalytic constant of 43.5 s-1for lactose, while the mutant H9 showed the highest specificity constant for lactose of 132 mM-1s-1. All three mutant proteins did not change the pH optimum that was between 4.5 and 5.5. Compared to the previously obtained wild types and mutants of CDH from Phanerochaete chrysosporium, the variants reported in this article had higher activity and specificity that together with high protein expression rate in P. pastoris, makes them good candidates for use in biotechnology for lactobionic acid production and biosensor manufacture. © 2020 Serbian Chemical Society.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most promising methods of the production of renewable fuels. However, an optimization of the conditions of bio-oil production is not possible without comprehensive analysis of the composition of formed products. There are several methods for the determination of distribution of products formed during thermal decomposition of biomass with chromatography being the most versatile among them. Although, due to the complex structure of bio-oil (presence of hundreds chemical compounds with different chemical character), an interpretation of the obtained chromatograms is not an easy task. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present an application of different chromatographic methods to the analysis of the composition of the mixture of products formed in high temperature decomposition of lignocellulosic feedstock. It includes pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), two dimensional gas (GC x GC) or liquid chromatography (LC x LC) and initial fractionation of bio-oil components. Moreover, the problems connected with the analysis of bio-oils formed with the use of various fast pyrolysis reactors and capabilities of multivariate analysis are discussed. © 2020 Jacek Grams, published by De Gruyter.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is considered an attractive and most abundant renewable carbon feedstock. Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is one of the platform molecules obtained from biomass. HMF transformation in the reductive atmosphere allows to obtain numerous value-added molecules with applications in several recently emerged sectors, e.g. biofuels and biopolymers. This process is still intensively investigated, and more efficient, stable and sustainable solutions are envisaged. Therefore, the choice of efficient analytical methods is of great importance. This review covers the methodologies used for the analysis of HMF hydrodeoxygenation, including chromatographic and spectrometric methods. Techniques such as gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry are mentioned as well in this review. © 2020 A.

AB  - Isolation and screening of microalgal species from natural habitats should be a continues work to discover effective species for biofuel generation and wastewater treatment. In the current study, microalgal species namely Tetradesmus dimorphus GEEL-04 and Desmodesmus asymmetricus GEEL-05 were isolated, identified, and assessed for growth kinetics, nutrients removal efficiency, and whole biomass composition. T. dimorphus showed higher growth (1.46 OD680nm) compared with D. asymmetricus (1.16 OD680nm), and both showed 99% total nitrogen and total phosphorous removal. T. dimorphus and D. asymmetricus accumulated higher protein content (40.02 and 45.10%), carbohydrate (31.91 and 24.64%), and lipid (15.41 and 24.16%), respectively. The FTIR spectra absorbance revealed different function groups in microalgal biomass available for biofuel generation. Elemental analysis of microalgal biomass showed high carbon content 50.13% and 43.01% for T. dimorphus and D. asymmetricus, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated ≥ 80% volatile content in both isolates. The fatty acid composition of both microalgal strains showed high palmitic acid and linoleic acid corresponding to high quality biodiesel. These results indicated that the T. dimorphus and D. asymmetricus could be potential candidates for high biocomponents accumulation and N, P removal.

AB  - Vegetable oils are a very important feedstock for many industries such as biofuels. There is the need to source for novel and underexploited plant oilseeds to meet the world demand for oils. Thus, the extraction of oil from Hura crepitans (sandbox) seeds was conducted using the solvent extraction method. Modeling of the extraction process was carried out using response surface methodology (RSM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The effects of the nature of the solvent (non-polar (n-hexane) and polar (acetone and ethyl acetate)), solid-solvent ratio (0.1–0.3 g/mL), extraction time (2–6 h), and their interactions on the oil yield were investigated using the D-optimal design technique. Performance assessment of the developed models was carried out to check their effectiveness in predicting the H. crepitans seed oil (HCSO) yield using various fit statistics. The coefficient of determination (R2) observed for the RSM and ANFIS models was 0.9720 and 0.9988, respectively, with corresponding mean relative percent deviation (MRPD) of 2.50 and 0.37%. Maximum HCSO yield of 62.95 wt% was achieved by ANFIS coupled with genetic algorithm (GA) using 0.1 g/mL solid-solvent ratio, extraction time of 4.19 h, and acetone, while maximum HCSO yield of 62.50 wt% was observed by RSM with a solid-solvent ratio of 0.1 g/mL, extraction time of 4.04 h, and acetone. Characteristics of the HCSO indicated that it could serve as a good feedstock for the production of oleochemicals such as biodiesel. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that ANFIS is marginally superior to RSM in the modeling of the HCSO extraction process, while GA was slightly better than the numerical tool of RSM in the optimization of the process. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The rate constants of the transesterification reactions of rapeseed oil with methanol, methyl formate, and methyl acetate at room temperature in the presence of homogeneous potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran were investigated and mutually compared for the first time. The aim of this study is to ascertain which of these reactants is the most promising in terms of reaction rate and fuel product formation with higher biodiesel yield. As rapeseed oil and methanol are immiscible with each other, the use of tetrahydrofuran as a co-solvent was also investigated to improve the miscibility of the oil and reactant and to exclude mass transfer effects. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model best described the reaction of the oil with methanol, with a reaction rate constant of 1.49 min−1, whereas the second-order kinetic model best described the reactions with methyl acetate and methyl formate, with reaction rate constants of 6.66 and 4.05 L mol−1min−1, respectively, at 25 °C. The best yield of biodiesel was obtained by the interesterification of triglycerides with methyl acetate (86.5%), and the properties of the obtained product conform closely to the biodiesel standard requirements despite the use of mild reaction conditions to save energy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biomass gasification is being regarded as an efficient process for the production of heat and power and even for the conversion of biomass into biofuels. Its main drawback is the non-negligible tar formation within the process. As the producer gas temperature decreases in the downstream equipment, tar will condense leading to the fouling, blocking of engines, filters and turbines or catalyst deactivation. The challenge is to remove/reduce tar in the product stream. An oil-based gas washing process (OLGA), combining a collector with an absorber and a stripper, is one of the most adapted processes for tar removal. In this work, simulations were conducted using Aspen Plus. These simulations helped in assessing the efficiency of the process in reducing the tar content for an initial concentration of 7,098 mg/Nm3. The variation of the tar reduction efficiency was studied as a function of the oil flow rate and temperature to validate the simulated data by the experimental one. Results showed that equal overall tar reduction efficiency, of 98.8 %, was achieved for an oil flow rate of 5,500 kg/h at 333 K. However, certain deviation was faced while comparing the elementary tar content reduction. Excluding the light tar components, mainly benzene and toluene, led to this high removal efficiency. By adding those components to the simulations, the tar removal efficiency was reduced to 57.6 %. This work focuses on a large assessment of existing processes and perspectives, in particular the removal of the lightest tar components. © 2020 Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC.

AB  - The increasing demand for transportation fuels, es-pecially middle distillates, stimulates the research of new strategies to obtain or synthesize biofuels. The processing of lignocellulosic biomass (for example straw) is a process of great interest, because after its hydrolysis and sub-sequent dehydration of the resulting sugar monomers, very valuable substances including furfural are obtained. Then, furfural is selectively hydrogenated to 2-methylfu-ran, sylvan, that is the basic “building block” in the Sylvan process. This manuscript summarizes the knowledge on Sylvan process as a promising way of biofuels synthe-sis. By sylvan condensing with aldehydes, ketones or even 2-methylfuran itself, it is possible to prepare C13-C16 oxygenates in high yields up to 100 % under mild reaction conditions (30-60 °C) over various heterogeneous catalysts. Based on the overview, the heterogeneous catalysts are preferred and the immobilized sulfonic acids are the most active catalysts, however, expensive. The reaction products then may be hydrodeoxygenated commonly over supported noble metal catalysts to provide premium quality C13-C16 hydrocarbons to produce diesel or kerosene. These fractions have great low-tempera-ture properties such as CFPP (-50 °C) or cetane number (70-72). According to the proposed sustainability predic-tion, this process could be sustainable in the Czech Re-public, where 30 % of produced wheat straw could be used for the production of 130 kt advanced biofuels by Sylvan process required by EU directive RED II. Finally, the future approaches have been suggested. © 2020, University of Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Environmental Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the article is to substantiate the methodological approaches of scenario planning in the management of biofuel production development. The following methods were used in order to achieve the goal: cross-factor analysis, scenario planning method, expert methods, and scenario tree. The study analyzed primary energy consumption by economic sector and the total supply of primary energy by source, resulting in a declining supply of non-renewable energy sources such as oil, gas, coal and growing supply of biomass and waste, which was a source of biofuel production. The grouping of biofuel properties from the point of view of its attractive-ness as an alternative energy resource was carried out. Factors that can negatively affect the pace of development of biofuel production are systematized. Dominant factors that had a critical impact on the development of biofuels have been identified: fluctuations in prices for electricity production in the traditional way, change in the popularity of greenhouse gas emission reduction programs, fluctuations in the use of electric vehicles, fluctuations in prices for fossil fuels, change in funding for programs to reduce environmental pollution and climate change. Stages of scenario planning with the use of cross-factor analysis were offered. A scenario tree model was formed. A matrix of cross-influence was constructed using expert evaluation and a scale of relations. The procedure of cross-influence and determination of dominant factors influencing the development of the activity “biofuel production” was proposed, which was characterized by the use of cross-factor analysis, which allowed assessing the probability of scenarios, establishing the interaction between them, and further calculating the expected effect from the implementation of measures. Applied research results and scenario assessments of the development potential of this area of activity can be used by entrepreneurs in the context of development and further implementation of investment projects for biofuel production. © 2020, Kaunas University of Technology.

AB  - Biofuels are attracted by many investigators because of its environment friendly nature and contribution in the reduction of global warming. The advent of nanotechnology improved the performance of the biofuels while including the nanoparticles in it. Hence, the research focussing on the performance improvement and emission reduction of engine using biofules blended with nanoparticles is a noteworthy. In the present work, an investigation was performed on Common Rail Direct Injection (CRDI) engine equipped with Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) setup to analyze the engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics at variable injection pressures by using rice bran biodiesel blended with ceria (CeO2) and zirconia (ZrO2) nanoparticles. Experimental work was done using fuel samples of pure diesel (D100), biodiesel (B30), biodiesel with 15% EGR (B30 + 15%EGR), biodiesel blended with 50 ppm ceria nanoparticles with 15% EGR (B30 + 50CeO2 + 15% EGR), biodiesel blended with 50 ppm zirconia nanoparticles with 15% EGR (B30 + 50ZrO2 + 15%EGR) and biodiesel blended with 50 ppm of ceria and zirconia nanoparticles with 15% EGR (B30 + 25ZrO2 + 25CeO2 + 15%EGR) under various load conditions and injection pressures. Based on the experimental work, the B30 + 25ZrO2 + 25CeO2 + 15%EGR fuel sample displayed better performance compared to other samples. The results showed that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of B30 + 25ZrO2 + 25CeO2 + 15%EGR fuel sample was increased by 8% and the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was reduced by 9% compared to D100. The combustion characteristics showed that the heat release rate and cylinder pressure were increased by 4.3% and 2.8% respectively. Further, the sample B30 + 25ZrO2 + 25CeO2 + 15%EGR decreased the exhaust emission of CO, HC, and NOx by 30%, 19%, and 13.3% respectively. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The article summarized the possible transformations of pyrolysis bio-oil from lignocellulose into 2nd generation biofuels. Although a lot has been published about this topic, so far, none of the published catalytic processes has found commercial application due to the rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Most researches deal with bio-oil hydrotreatment at severe conditions or its processing by catalytic cracking to prepare 2nd generation biofuels directly. However, this approach is not commer-cially applicable due to high consumptions of hydrogen and fast catalyst deactivation. Another way, crude bio-oil co-processing with petroleum fractions in hydrotreat-ment or FCC units seems to be more promising. The last approach, bio-oil mild hydrotreatment followed by final co-processing with petroleum feedstock using common refining processes (FCC and hydrotreatment) seems to be the most promising way to produce 2nd generation biofu-els from pyrolysis bio-oil. Co-processing of bio-oil with petroleum fraction in FCC increases conversion to gasoline and, thus, it could be a preferable process in the USA. Otherwise, co-hydrotreatment of hydrotreated bio-oil with LCO leads not only to the reduction of hydrogen consumption but also to the conversion preferably to die-sel. This process seems to be more suitable for Europe. Further research on bio-oils upgrading is still necessary before the commercialization of the bio-oil conversion into biofuels suitable for cars. However, the first commercial bio-refinery that will convert bio-oil into biofuel for marine transport is planned to be built in the Nether-lands. © 2020, University of Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Environmental Technology.

AB  - Green diesel or known as the hydrocarbons (alkane and alkene) is a renewable and globally friendly biofuel which generally was derived from the triglycerides or fatty acids. The sustainability of the green diesel always concerned the cost of the production, energy supply and demand (net energy balance), the sustainability of more significant crops production or feedstock supply, acceptance of the country and economic stability. Above all, the lack of the petroleum products, the increase in fuel efficiency and affordable by the public are significant reasons for the green diesel to become one of the most important energy supplies for our future The review found important research areas to be reduction in cost of production and maintenance, improvement in fuel quality and improvement in the environmental benefit from using green diesel. With regard to cost reduction, experiments have been conducted on use of low cost catalysts, waste products as feedstocks and H2-free reaction atmosphere. Fuel quality improvement studies have proposed new catalysts, reaction pathways and conditions to improve hydrocarbon selectivity and fuel stability. Future studies must specifically focus on commercial feasibility of the use of waste materials as feedstocks, heterogeneous catalysts, improvement in reaction pathways to production green diesel and similar other concerns. This article covers the catalysis for deoxygenation, the factor influencing the deoxygenation process and the recent progress of deoxygenation. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.

AB  - Along with the great efforts in producing clean and low-cost fuel and chemicals, in this work, novel nanocatalysts are reported for the fast pyrolysis of the bagasse. To this end, different catalyst supports were employed to load Mo oxides or sulfides through incipient wetness impregnation. The prepared nanocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction to determine the formed phases, N2 adsorption/desorption to clarify the surface properties, and SEM to observe the morphology and energy-dispersive X-ray to provide the atomic mapping. A series of nanocatalysts including the Mo sulfide loaded over graphene oxide (MoS2/GrO) or porous graphene (MoS2/graphene), Mo oxide loaded over charcoal, and Co-Mo oxide loaded over MgO were studied in the fast pyrolysis of the bagasse. The results revealed that the use of catalyst decreased the bio-oil yield of the process. Interestingly, it was found the fast pyrolysis of the bagasse is dependent on the used catalysts and the fractions of bio-oil can be determined according the catalysts types. It was found that with accordance to the demanded chemicals, the catalysts can be chosen which is highly valuable in producing chemicals and each catalysts support results in a specific set of products. In general, the acetic acid was the main product without using catalyst, and by using the MoS2/GrO nanocatalyst, the phenols were formed dominantly which are of great importance in different industries. This novel work successfully revealed that the metal-based catalysts can be employed instead of the zeolites which paves the way toward using low-cost metallic catalysts in producing bio-chemicals and bio-oils. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Currently, due to the restriction of social sustainability certifications, exports of biofuel to Europe and other countries are a crucial phenomenon that financially affect companies. The primary aim of the current study is to investigate the effects on the profitability of palm oil export companies in Malaysia that have social sustainability certifications. Data were extracted from the annual reports of companies that export biofuel and have had social sustainability certifications between 2009 to 2018. The results indicate that exports have a positive financial effect on palm oil export companies in Malaysia. These findings present guidelines to policymakers on removing restrictions on exports and developing policies that enhance the exportation of biofuel, thereby enhancing the economic growth of the country. © 2020 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - Every 1 kg of palm oil fruit produces an empty fruit bunch (EFB) weighing approximately 0.25 kg. The EFB is considered as the agricultural waste of the palm oil industry due to the excessive amounts produced. The majority of EFB is not appropriately utilized and produces a high level of CO2 as a result of abandonment to landfills. This study investigates the utilization of conventional fast pyrolysis (CFP) to make the biofuel products from EFB waste. Additionally, microwaveassisted pyrolysis (MAP), a new high-performance technique, is also investigated. The calculation of mass and energy balance is conducted using commercial simulation software. The benefits of this plant are investigated in terms of economics and climate change. The results show that neither CFP nor MAP benefits the economy of developing the power plants since they are not profitable. The net present value (NPV) of CFP and MAP are-1,127,674 and-1,073,772 USD, respectively. However, from the climate change aspects, both power plants provide good environmental impact performance. The CO2 emissions resulting from the non-managed disposal of EFB for the CFP and MAP plants were 924, 917, 895 tCO2/yr., respectively. Although the development of these plants might not be beneficial from an economic perspective, they contribute significantly to the reduction of CO2 emissions compared with direct disposal through landfills. This work describes the advantages of using renewable technology in a transparent environmentally friendly process. © 2020 Institut za Arhitekturu i Urbanizam Srbije.

AB  - Palm oil biodiesel (POB) has a number of beneficial properties of the environment due to less exhaust emission (carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke). It can lead to a reduction of pollution by decreasing the emission of harmful and hazardous substances to the atmosphere. In this work, palm biofuel was produced in house from crude palm oil with transesterification reaction carried out using a base catalyst. A low-speed agriculture engine under the variable load range of 3-12kg at a constant speed of 1500 rpm was investigated the several combustion characteristics under ASTM standards. The effect of a variable compression ratio (VCR) from 16 to 18 on low-speed engine performance and the gas emission were investigated in order to find out the optimal values of compression ratio (CR) low-speed engine. The experimental results are found that this engine fueled by the biofuel under test load at 12kg obtained the highest thermal efficiency of 27% at the compression ratio of 18, while its brake specific fuel consumption reduced with the increase of the test load. An increase up to CR18 presents the consistent explanation of the higher heat release and the shorter ignition delay, while the amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission effectively reduced down to 42% and 21%, respectively. The optimum performance of the low-speed agriculture engine was found in CR value of 18 during full load condition. © 2020, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the recent era, utmost attention is paid towards exploring the alternative source of energies, being more specific green energies. In modern days, when growing energy scarcity is a hot topic and considered as a global threat, in that context a green technology capable of sustainably addressing waste management issues and synthesize waste-derived end-product such bio-diesel from Jatropha Curcas linnaeus (JCL) and Chlorella vulgaris shall be paid ancillary attention. The attribution of the above-mentioned species and Lemnagibba L towards the purification of the municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate by utilizing its bioaccumulation properties and ultimately yielding several value-added co-products could be the solution of the era in terms of sustainable leachate treatment. A specially designed ridge furrow phytoremediation wetland was fabricated under the controlled environment associated with a pre-treatment facility and bottom lining system to captivate the downward percolation. A 1.5 m high Jatropha species were planted at an interval of 1 m on the ridges and the root for the same found to reach a depth of 0.8 m on an average over a period of 3 months. Leachate was supplied by means of free flow into the furrows with an initial addition rate of 1 m3 per day for a 10 m × 10 m remediation hybrid pond system and simultaneously the loading was elevated up to 80 m3/ha/day. Prior to the active remediation zone, a pre-treatment unit was installed which works on the bio-accumulation property of the vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides). A packed bed system of gravel, marble chips, sand, and coconut coir as a medium of filtration was installed to bring the concentrate waste juice up to the wetland treatment standard. Moreover, the bleaching influence of the sunlight also found to be effective against pathogen removal, active evaporation, and evapotranspiration. The ultimate treatment capacity for the designated size was assessed as ~0.03 m3 per day ascertained with an HRT value of 45 days. The ultimate outcome was on par with the influent characteristics obligatory for the tertiary units with a comprehensive efficacy value evaluated as approx. 60%. Thus, it’s quite evident to claim the feasibility of the present study towards the bioremediation of the enormous quantity of leachate generation associated with the handling of solid waste which is otherwise, a costly affair. © 2020 Global NEST.

AB  - The increased demand of fossil based fuel gases for the growing population has also increased its disadvantage of increased greenhouse gases and peak pricing these criteria has demanded a replacement of renewable and eco-friendly biofuel. Despite of failures of 2ndgeneration biodiesel the algal biofuel has emerged out to be a promising 3rdgeneration biofuel with its properties, availability and cultivation. The cultivation of algae for biofuel has an added advantage of treating waste water. The biofuel is derived from the purchased the algal oil (species) by the process of alkalic transesterification using methanol and sodium hydroxide( basic catalyst) in the molar ratio of 6:1 the obtained mixture contains ester and biofuel which is further processed using downstream technology such as extraction, centrifrigation and purified using vacuum drying or high performance liquid chromatography. Thus we could able to extract the biodiesel from algal. The emission and engine performance analysis test are taken with the help of the biodiesel. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present an observer-based control design with application to continuous bioreactors. For this purpose, phenomenological bioreactor models were represented by identified linear models plus unknown modelling error terms. Therefore, an uncertainty-based observer with a polynomial structure capable of estimating the unknown modelling error of the reactor representation is coupled to a linear input-output controller. The proposed methodology was evaluated in a sulphate reduction bioprocess and an acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process for butanol (biofuel) production, under continuous regimes. Experimentally validated mathematical models were considered for this purpose. A theoretical framework is presented to demonstrate the corresponding closed-loop stability of the systems, and numerical simulations were carried out to corroborate the satisfactory performance of the proposed methodology. © 2020 Ricardo Aguilar-López et al.

AB  - Biomass has increasingly proven as a sustainable and important resource for the production of renewable fuels worldwide. The present study investigated the effect of cellulosic binders on thermal and resistive properties of biofuel briquettes produced from sugarcane bagasse. Biofuel briquettes were produced using an uniaxial cylindrical piston briquetting machine at 150 MPa and 100 OC from shredded and grinded bagasse samples. The binders used were recycled paper, recycled pulp, recycled fibers, and nanolignocellulose at three levels of 3%, 6%, and 9%. Resistance tests showed that cellulosic binders were effective in forming strong bonds and increasing solid bridges between bagasse particles. The cellulosic binders also improved the resistance and thermal properties of the briquettes due to their specific chemical structure and high compatibility with raw materials. As the results showed, at the 9% level, the highest compressive strength and calorific values were found to be 26 N/mm and 22.80 MJ/kg for recycled fibers and 34 N/mm and 22.80 MJ/kg nanolignocellulose, respectively. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel and its diesel blends have been accepted worldwide as potential renewable alternative fuels to substitute petroleum diesel. Perspectives for biodiesel commercial-ization using Camelina sativa L. Crantz as raw material are presented in this paper. Fatty acid profiles and the morphological characterization, including production, number of seeds, thousand seed weight and fatty acid percentage were analyzed for different varieties. A further assessment, considering four parameters, viscosity, iodine value, cold filter plugging point, and cetane number, was carried out to evaluate the biodiesel quality. It was concluded that camelina varieties have a similar percentage of fatty oil content. This work shows large differences in productivity and in the selected physical and chemical properties of derived biodiesel from camelina. Results show that varieties 1072, 117 and N5 (1.9) from Camelina Company Spain could be suitable due to their high productivity (over 4.2 g per plan)t. Variety 1109 could also be used due to its low iodine value (131). Varieties 1008, 1085 and 1109 could be used due to their high cetane number (over 51). This research has identified suitable varieties for biodiesel production. Further improvement of camelina’s characteristics is needed by means of plant breeding and manipulation of culture conditions. © 2020, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, the raw materials and produced bio oil were characterised in terms of physical and chemical properties. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite was used to investigate the process parameter significance on bio oil yield. The statistical significance is indicated by P-value of less than 0.05 at 95% confidence level. For raw material, coal lignite spectrum showed potential existence of phenols, alcohol and water linked to mineral water associated to the hydroxyl group found in stretching vibrations that are between 3200 and 3400 cm-1. The oxygen containing groups such as C=O, C-O and also aromatic skeletal lignin from lignocellulosic materials. Sewage sludge spectrum showed presence of amide I, amide II, aliphatic methylene, lipids and fats. Si-O of clay minerals and silicates impurities were attributed by peaks 872 cm-1 and 1031 cm-1 on the primary sewage sludge spectrum. The produced bio oil results from Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were in agreement with those of Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results. Maximum bio oil of 42 wt% was obtained under the following conditions of; temperature, 550 °C, heating rate, 180.3 °C/min and particle size 425 µm. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Global energy demand and depletion of fossil-derived fuels have posed an alarming need for alternate fuels. Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most promising sustainable carbon-rich feedstocks that can be directly converted to biofuels via fast pyrolysis technique. It involves thermochemical decomposition at very high heating rate (~104 °C s-1), moderate temperatures (400-600 °C) and short residence time (1-5 s) in inert ambience to yield bio-oil. However, significant presence of oxygen-containing chemicals in bio-oil is the root cause of various unenviable properties. The prime objective is to minimize the substantial amount of oxygen content in bio-oil by selectively altering the organic oxygenates into hydrocarbons through deoxygenation pathways. Accordingly, catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapours in hydrogen ambience is a promising strategy to tailor the chemical composition of bio-oil to a greater extent via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). However, it is mandatory to understand the ex-situ upgradation kinetics of organic vapours on the catalyst surface. To this end, mechanistic insight into deoxygenation of catalytically upgraded representative biomass pyrolysates such as guaiacol and furfural over protonated Zeolite Y catalysts of different Si/Al ratios were investigated in this study. Analytical pyroprobe connected with Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (Py-GC/MS) served in testing the HDO activity of catalysts. The use of catalysts significantly led to better HDO producing remarkable aromatic hydrocarbons in the condensed phase. Protonated Zeolite Y (Si/Al ratio: 5.1:1 and 30:1) catalysts converted guaiacol into valuable chemicals, viz. benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) in major quantities. Notably, 100% conversion of guaiacol and furfural were achieved with Zeolite Y (5.1:1). © 2020 Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC. All rights reserved.

AB  - A pure interesterification reaction of triglyceride with methyl acetate in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide homogeneous catalyst produces a reaction mixture containing 72.5 wt.% of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and 14 wt.% of triacetin. In order to harmonise the content of the reaction mixture by increasing the fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAE) and decreasing the content of triacetin, in this work a competitive interesterification - transesterification conversion of triglyceride has been made using iso-propanol. Due to the low reactivity of iso-propanol, it is possible to carry out the targeted harmonisation of biofuel composition by increasing the FAAE content up to 81.9 wt.% while retaining a relatively high triacetin content (6-9 wt.%). The lowering of the triacetin content and replacing it with the fatty acid iso-propyl esters provides the opportunity to obtain products that are more similar to conventional biodiesel and improve the cold flow properties of the fuel. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Recently, advanced biofuels have gained interest and importance; as a result, the world production of renewable diesel has quadrupled in the last 5 years. Renewable diesel is a type of biodiesel whose functional properties are similar, or even superior, to those of fossil diesel. It also looks more attractive than conventional biodiesel (FAME), as an option for the partial or complete replacement of liquid fossil fuels in the effort to reduce GHG emissions generated in the transport sector of diesel engines. However, when obtained by hydrotreating, the use of gaseous hydrogen makes the process lose sustainability due to its petrochemical origin (at least 90% comes from the reforming of naphtha) and high risk in its safe handling, besides increasing the costs due to its intensive operating conditions (temperature and pressure). A possible solution to this remarkable disadvantage is the generation of hydrogen in situ, which can be carried out by hydrogenation by catalytic transfer, using a donor, usually a solvent that transfers hydrogen. This is an interesting alternative for the hydrogenation of organic compounds, with substantial advantages over processes that use molecular hydrogen, in addition to moderate process conditions and reduction of the intensive energy consumption. In this sense, it is necessary to evaluate potential donors as renewable sources of hydrogen to obtain renewable diesel from palm oil. To carry out the previous analysis, in this study, a multicriteria decision method (MACBETH) is applied, using criteria such as renewable origin, decomposition products, cost, availability and toxicity, which are considered to select the most appropriate family of organic compounds that act as hydrogen donor: Alcohols, polyols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, condensed aromatic homologs, amines and alkanes. Results show that alcohols, polyols and carboxylic acids are the most suitable organic families for the generation of hydrogen in situ during hydroprocessing. According to sustainability and taking into account the atomic economy, the availability and biorefinery origin, it was found that the most promising compounds to use as donors in each of these families are the ethanol, glycerine and formic acid, which are then evaluated using thermodynamic analysis. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - This research is on the introduction and the effect of the pre-treatment method on oil recovery from African oil bean seeds for biodiesel production. Samples were dried in the solar dryer, open sun, and the oven at 50 °C, 60 °C, and 70 °C. The solvent extraction process with hexane was used to extract oil from the product, and their saponification value, peroxide value, acid value, iodine value, specific gravity, and the color of the bio-oil were analyzed. The oil was further used in acid-catalyzed esterification and alkaline transesterification for biodiesel production, and the effects of temperature, catalyst concentration, feedstock to methanol molar ratio, and reaction time on biodiesel conversion were investigated. Solar drying of the seed yielded the highest volume of oil compared with other drying methods. Peroxide values of the oil meet the standard values from CODEX but showed an increase in rancidity in the solar-dried and open sundried products. Bio-oil produced has good lubricating properties as its iodine properties showed that it is not a drying oil. The cetane number and heating value of the biodiesel produced are within the range when compared with the ASTM standard of diesel properties. By using a feedstock to methanol molar ratio of 1:6 and a sulfuric acid concentration of 0.8%, a biodiesel conversion of 81% was obtained after 6 h of reaction at 60 °C. The biodiesel produced by this process met the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Glycerol is the main byproduct of industrial biodiesel plants, and new technological routes using it as feedstock have been studied, due to the increase in world biofuel production. One of the possible applications is in the production of acrylic acid, a product with several industrial applications. This study analyzed a new process of converting crude glycerol, through purification for the removal of impurities, followed by oxidative dehydration reaction in a single step and purification until glacial acrylic acid specification standards are met. It was attested that the process is economically viable, with a payback period of 5 years for an NPV/Investment greater or equal to 2 and an IRR greater or equal to 10% per annum, or 4 years in case tax incentives offered for the development of green technologies. © 2020, CI and CEQ.

AB  - The EU's biofuels policy has made a full normative turn: introduced to advance sustainable development, it was curtailed as a threat to the global environment. Central to the crisis of legitimation was a contested scientific idea, emissions from indirect land-use changes. This article takes up the large impact of this small idea to discuss a central question of contemporary institutionalist and constructivist scholarship: Why and under what conditions can ideas and events become catalysts for change? Tracing the rise and crisis of the EU's biofuels policy, my central theoretical intervention is to conceptualize the fragile legitimacy of policies and institutions. In addition, I specify the scope condition that heighten or reduce a policy's fragility, arguing that it depends on: (a) a tight/loose coupling of legitimacy to underlying authoritative discourses, (b) the volatility of these sources of authority and (c) the agenda-setting power of groups opposing the status quo. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The increase in human needs in the economic field is very fast, it is influenced by the lifestyle of people who want to be fast and practical. Practical human life encourages consumption behavior, often occurs in almost all aspects, especially in the field of industrial processing and food. Activate the human mentality to use materials that are easy to find and practical, such as the use of plastic in the industrial and food fields. It is very bad because when the use of plastic is not followed by processing, it will become plastic waste and will be dangerous for humans and the environment. The most popular one is the pyrolysis process which is an option of waste to energy concept that eventually produce biofuel for car engine and purpose of this investigation is to reduce plastic waste by processing it to be useful for other activities, such as fuel. This research focuses on investigating the types of PP plastic waste and the types of HDPE plastic that have different properties. After analyzing the types of PP plastic and the types of HDPE plastic, it was discovered that waste of the HDPE type produces more plastic oil than the types of PP plastic. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

AB  - In the present global scenario, fossil fuels are facing challenges due to escalating costs, increasing demand and impact on environmental pollution. In internal combustion engines, the emission characteristics and economy of the fuel are controlled by the chemical and physical properties of the fuel. Various additives are being used to act like catalysts with the fuels to improve quality of fuel, to obtain better combustion and to reduce exhaust emissions. At the time of combustion process, fuel instability reactions get accelerated by the catalysts which improve the performance of the engine. In this study, the B10, B15 and B20 fuel blends of cotton seed oil and diesel were mixed with the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as an additive to analyse the performance and exhaust emissions of a CI engine. The carbon nanotubes were mixed with each fuel blend with the concentration of 50 ppm. All the tests were carried out for different engine loads. Tested characteristics were power, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), specific fuel consumption (SFC), and analysis of exhaust gases like hydrocarbons (HC), CO2, CO and smoke. The experimental results showed that there was significant reduction of SFC and improved combustion by addition of CNTs. It was also observed that the exhaust emissions, CO, HC and smoke percentage got decreased by the influence of CNTs. © 2020 Technoscience Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Catalytic cracking is widely used in biofuel production from natural fats and vegetable oils. Used cooking oils are one of the major wastes from food processing in Thailand. They are interesting raw materials to produce biofuel. This study focused on catalytic cracking of used cooking oils over two commercial (Z and Y zeolite) catalysts to generate light organic liquid products. The cracking reactor used was based on a fixed bed reactor setup. Temperature of reaction (400 °C) was controlled by a digital controller and a thermo-couple connected to the reactor. The liquid products obtained were subsequently analysed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The maximum liquid yield of 82.5 % was obtained. From the chemical analysis, the organic liquid products were found to contain three (gasoline-, kerosene-, and diesel-like) groups with the carbon number between C7 – C11, C12 – C15, and C16 – C21.

AB  - Dramatic changes in electricity generation, use and storage are needed to keep pace with increasing demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. There is great potential for application of bioengineering in this area. We have the tools to re-engineer biological molecules and systems, and a significant amount of research and development is being carried out on technologies such as biophotovoltaics, biocapacitors, biofuel cells and biobatteries. However, there does not seem to be a satisfactory overarching term to describe this area, and I propose a new word-'electrosynbionics'. This is to be defined as: The creation of engineered devices that use components derived from or inspired by biology to perform a useful electrical function. Here, the phrase 'electrical function' is taken to mean the generation, use and storage of electricity, where the primary charge carriers may be either electrons or ions. 'Electrosynbionics' is distinct from 'bioelectronics', which normally relates to applications in sensing, computing or electroceuticals. Electrosynbionic devices have the potential to solve challenges in electricity generation, use and storage by exploiting or mimicking some of the desirable attributes of biological systems, including high efficiency, benign operating conditions and intricate molecular structures. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Palm oil is one of the most consumed oils, one of whose refining steps is the removal of pigments and other substances using bleaching clay as adsorbent. Worldwide production of this oil was 70 million tons in 2017, requiring 1 t of clay to produce 1000 t of refined oil. The residual bleaching clay, having an oil fraction (12.70%) rich in phenolics, carotenoids and tocopherols, was extracted in this study with ethanol to obtain an antioxidant-rich palm oil bleaching extract (POBE), with the aim of using it as a natural antioxidant source. The POBE antioxidant capacity determined by the DPPH method corresponded to a 20.29% inhibition of radical formation. The POBE was also tested for its potential to enhance oxidative stability of passion fruit, pracaxi and Brazil nut oils used as reference oils, and compared to common synthetic antioxidants (tert-butylhydroquinone and propyl gallate), either separately as controls or in mixtures with them. Besides the increased oxidative stability of these oils induced by the POBE, a positive synergistic effect between it and the synthetic antioxidants was observed. These results taken together suggest that the exploitation of the waste oil from bleaching clay as an additive to improve the oxidative stability of biofuels or lubricating oils is feasible. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of three different agricultural and forestry wastes (pinewood, peanut shell, rice straw) was performed in a fixed-bed reactor heated slowly under a stream of purging argon in the temperature range from 300 °C to 700 °C using K2CO3 as the catalyst. The aim of this study is to investigate the gaseous, liquid, and solid products derived from three different biomasses, and to ascertain the effects of K2CO3 on the pyrolysis behaviours. The products’ yields correlated with the composition of the biomasses and the addition of catalyst in the biomasses. The addition of K2CO3 described a strong catalysis in all three phases of the products: The liquid yield decreased obviously in contrast to the increase in gas yield. The liquid yields of pinewood and peanut shell demonstrated a remarkable decrease, while that of rice straw demonstrated the least decrease owing to a significant difference between the fibre composition of rice straw and those of the other two biomasses. This catalytic pyrolysis procedure was observed to produce low yields of liquid that contained high proportions of ketones and phenols, with minor acids, aldehydes, and furans. Among the three, the phenols of rice straw indicated the most obvious increase, while guaiacols decreased significantly, indicating that K2CO3 facilitated the secondary decomposition of guaiacols. Generally, for K2CO3 catalyst, the order of catalytic effect was pinewood &gt; peanut shell &gt; rice straw. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis is a complex system where the selection of an efficient, cheap, abundant, and stable catalyst is vital to upgrade pyrolysis products to biofuels. Steel slag (SS) can be considered as an inexpensive catalyst, making it a very economical option. SS has a high content of calcium, iron, and magnesium, making this solid compound catalytically active. This study investigated the utilization of SS as a sacrificial catalyst in pyrolysis experiments using a thermocatalytic reforming (TCR) process to produce an upgraded bio-oil and syngas. In the first part of this work, SS was mixed with sugarcane bagasse (SB) and oat hulls (OH) biochar (in different trials) in the postreformer at different ratios (0, 30, 70, and 100 wt % of SS). In the second part, SS (powder) was pelletized directly with raw OH at different ratios (0, 10, 20, and 30 wt % of SS in the feed composition) and introduced into a pyrolysis reactor. The introduction of SS into SB in the reformer improved the higher heating value (HHV) from 29.1 MJ/kg (0 wt % of SS) to 35.5 MJ/kg (100 wt % of SS). Introducing 30 wt % of SS into OH in the feed showed a higher calorific value and lower acidity, viscosity, and density in comparison with using SS with different ratios in the reformer. The use of SS as a catalyst was found to significantly improve the quality and the properties of bio-oil and syngas, revealing an innovative pathway for its use as an inexpensive sacrificial catalyst for biofuel production via the TCR process. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass conversion to alcohols using supercritical methanol depolymerization and hydrodeoxygenation (SCM-DHO) with CuMgAl mixed metal oxide is a promising process for biofuel production. We demonstrate how maple wood can be converted at high weight loadings and product concentrations in a batch and a semi-continuous reactor to a mixture of C2-C10 linear and cyclic alcohols. Maple wood was solubilized semi-continuously in supercritical methanol and then converted to a mixture of C2-C9 alcohols and aromatics over a packed bed of CuMgAlOx catalyst. Up to 95 wt% of maple wood can be solubilized in the methanol by using four temperature holds at 190, 230, 300, and 330 °C. Lignin was solubilized at 190 and 230 °C to a mixture of monomers, dimers, and trimers while hemicellulose and cellulose solubilized at 300 and 330 °C to a mixture of oligomeric sugars and liquefaction products. The hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin were converted to C2-C10 alcohol fuel precursors over a packed bed of CuMgAlOx catalyst with 70-80% carbon yield of the entire maple wood. The methanol reforming activity of the catalyst decreased by 25% over four beds of biomass, which corresponds to 5 turnovers for the catalyst, but was regenerable after calcination and reduction. In batch reactions, maple wood was converted at 10 wt% in methanol with 93% carbon yield to liquid products. The product concentration can be increased to 20 wt% by partially replacing the methanol with liquid products. The yield of alcohols in the semi-continuous reactor was approximately 30% lower than in batch reactions likely due to degradation of lignin and cellulose during solubilization. These results show that solubilization of whole biomass can be separated from catalytic conversion of the intermediates while still achieving a high yield of products. However, close contact of the catalyst and the biomass during solubilization is critical to achieve the highest yields and concentration of products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The increasing use of alternative energy sources has brought benefits like the recycling of waste vegetable oils (WVO) for biodiesel production; however, this practice presents challenges derived from a highly variable raw matter. Our research focused on the washing techniques usually employed by small to medium scale producers which may lack the infrastructure to perform high-grade purification and often relay on the employment of “artisanal” technology. We report biodiesel production from pure canola oil (C1) and a mix of soybean/canola oil (C2) as well as WVO from sample C2 with high free fatty acid content (2.7 FFA %) oil. We selected seven quality tests: PH determination, cloud, pour and flash point, acid number (AN), water/sediments and soap content considering the most commonly failed checkpoints in biodiesel production. From the use of four washing techniques, we determined that the sawdust filtration had the highest recovering yield with 89%. The majority of the washed biodiesel met the America Society of Testing Material (ASTM) standard limits for the tests selected. Biodiesel stability was tested from week 0 to week 6, determining a shelf life of three weeks in optimal conditions without the addition of antioxidants or specific storage conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The increasing demand for energy has resulted in the current worldwide energy crisis. The uncontrolled use of fossil fuels has resulted in severe negative impacts on human health and the environment. Therefore, an alternative, renewable natural resource is required to fulfill the world’s energy needs. Indonesia has a potential alternative energy source: microalgae-based biofuel is renewable and can be further developed. The aim of this study was to determine the productivity of microalgae biomass, the effect of temperature and time on the transesterification reaction, content and composition of biodiesel (FAME). The general processes were cultivation using bubble column photobioreactors, harvesting, lipid extraction from the biomass, and biodiesel synthesis using transesterification. The cultivation of 7.5 L Synechococcus HS-9 resulted in 5.3 g of microalgae wet biomass and 3.32 g/L of dry biomass. The synthesis of biodiesel using transesterification was influenced by both temperature and reaction time. Here, a 5.5% biodiesel yield was obtained at 55 °C in 60 min. The highest biodiesel yield was 4.25% in 30 min at 65 °C. The FAME contents of Synechococcus HS-9 microalgae biodiesel were 3.16%, 18.96%, and 77.87% monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and saturated fatty acids, respectively. © 2020, Novel Carbon Resource Sciences.

AB  - Background: Industrial biofuels and other value-added products can be produced from metabolically engineered microorganisms. Methylomonas sp. DH-1 is a candidate platform for bioconversion that uses methane as a carbon source. Although several genetic engineering techniques have been developed to work with Methylomonas sp. DH-1, the genetic manipulation of plasmids remains difficult because of the restriction-modification (RM) system present in the bacteria. Therefore, the RM system in Methylomonas sp. DH-1 must be identified to improve the genetic engineering prospects of this microorganism. Results: We identified a DNA methylation site, TGGCCA, and its corresponding cytosine methyltransferase for the first time in Methylomonas sp. DH-1 through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. The methyltransferase was confirmed to methylate the fourth nucleotide of TGGCCA. In general, methylated plasmids exhibited better transformation efficiency under the protection of the RM system than non-methylated plasmids did. As expected, when we transformed Methylomonas sp. DH-1 with plasmid DNA harboring the psy gene, the metabolic flux towards carotenoid increased. The methyltransferase-treated plasmid exhibited an increase in transformation efficiency of 2.5 × 103 CFU/μg (124%). The introduced gene increased the production of carotenoid by 26%. In addition, the methyltransferase-treated plasmid harboring anti-psy sRNA gene exhibited an increase in transformation efficiency by 70% as well. The production of carotenoid was decreased by 40% when the psy gene was translationally repressed by anti-psy sRNA. Conclusions: Plasmid DNA methylated by the discovered cytosine methyltransferase from Methylomonas sp. DH-1 had a higher transformation efficiency than non-treated plasmid DNA. The RM system identified in this study may facilitate the plasmid-based genetic manipulation of methanotrophs. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - A series of heterogeneous acid catalysts are synthesized by supporting phosphotungstic acid on bamboo activated carbon and applied in catalyzing esterification for biodiesel production. With the activation of phosphoric acid, the obtained catalyst possesses the total acid density of 2.02 mmol g−1 and developed pore structure with specific surface area of 576 m2 g−1. It exhibits superior performance in catalyzing esterification of oleic acid with the maximum efficiency of 96% and acceptable renewability, where efficiency of 93% could be achieved by the regenerated catalyst. Density functional theory results indicate the activation barrier and reaction energy of the esterification are 19.73 kcal mol-1 and −15.83 kcal mol-1, respectively. This paper provides feasibility of the high value-added utilization of bamboo and basic theoretical data for esterification mechanism over heterogeneous acid catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study explores the methodology for the synthesis of bio-oil from waste trichosanthes cucumerina seeds by the solvent extraction method. It investigates the yield percentage, concentration of free fatty acids and acid contents in the extracted bio-oil. Effects of size of the crushed seeds, moisture content, extraction time, solvent to seed ratio and extraction temperatures were examined. The non-polar hexane solvent resulted in a higher percentage of oil yield (28.4 ± 0.4%) for the crushed seed size of 0.21 mm, 6% moisture content, 270 min extraction time, 68 °C temperature and 6:1(ml/g) of solvent to seed ratio. The synthesized bio-oil was characterized using Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectrum and Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy analysis. The properties of the bio-oil and biodiesel were assessed according to the American Society for Testing and Materials and the Association of Official Analytical Chemists standards. The obtained methyl-ester by trans-esterification process results in the fuel properties closer to the conventional fuel. Thus, Trichosanthes cucumerina bio-diesel can be used as a potential substitute. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The feasibility of potassium hydroxide for simultaneous removal of chlorophyll during solvent extraction from wet microalgae (200 g/L) was evaluated. Extracted oil was converted to biodiesel by ZSM-5-based heterogeneous catalysts. The total oil (fatty acid-based) content of Nannochlorposis oceanica cultivated in open raceway ponds was 19.5%. The oil recovery yields from dry and wet microalgae using hexane were 44.4 and 11.8%, respectively, whereas using a hexane-methanol mixture were increased to 79.3 and 74.8%, respectively. For the heterogeneous transesterification of microalgal oil extracted by the hexane-methanol mixture from wet microalgae, the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) contents were 2.3, 48.3, and 4.7% of product recovered after reaction for ZSM-5, Na/ZSM-5, and SO42−/ZSM-5, respectively; by the potassium hydroxide-assisted process, the corresponding FAME contents were increased to 21.9, 86.2, and 86.0%, respectively, due to improvement of the oil properties by the decrease of the chlorophyll content. Through the addition of potassium hydroxide, chlorophyll was effectively removed from oil, and eventually, the biodiesel conversion was sharply increased with heterogeneous Na/ZSM-5 and SO42−/ZSM-5 catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to investigate the co-liquefaction of high-density polyethylene (PE) and low density polyethylene bags (PB) with sugarcane bagasse (SCB) in supercritical ethanol solvent. The effect of blending ratios of SCB/PB and SCB/PE is studied. Results indicate that blending ratio of low density plastic bags and high-density polyethylene impacts the product distribution during solvo-thermal process. The optimum conversion of SCB/PE and SCB/PB up to 57.3% and 59.4% with bio-oil yields of 31.5% and 30.3% respectively are obtained at 280 °C. The higher heating values (HHV) of bio-oil obtained from SCB/PE and SCB/PB are 34.9 and 34.8 MJ/kg, respectively. CHNS/O, chemical composition, carbon and proton NMR, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses of bio-oil have been conducted. Investigation suggests that the SCB/PE and SCB/PB derived bio-oil have the superior qualitative properties compared to pure sugarcane bagasse. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from waste frying oil (WFO) was studied using fly ash as received as a heterogeneous catalyst. The fly ash used in this research had a high content of both CaO and SO3, two compounds that have been previously proposed as catalysts in FAME production. The study was carried out on the basis of a response surface methodology (RSM). The model generated by RSM predicted as optimal conditions to obtain a 100% FAME yield at a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 3.1:1, 11.2 (wt.% based on oil weight) fly ash and a temperature of 59 °C with agitation at 245 rpm and 6 h of reaction time. Additional experiments comparing anhydrous with aqueous medium showed that fly ash presented a high catalytic capacity to transform free fatty acids (FFA) into FAME through consecutive hydrolysis and esterification processes (hydroesterification) compared with that associated with the transesterification mechanism. According to the results, the fly ash used in this study would act as a multipurpose or “versatile” catalyst due to its chemical composition with constituents that act as acidic and basic catalysts, therefore, catalyzing the transesterification and hydroesterification reactions simultaneously and increasing the conversion yields of FAME. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drop-in biofuels from forest by-products such as black liquor can help deliver deep reductions in transport greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels in our vehicle fleet. Black liquor is produced at pulp mills that can increase their pulping capacity by upgrading some of it to drop-in biofuels but this is not well-studied. We evaluate the techno-economic and greenhouse gas performance of five drop-in biofuel pathways based on BL lignin separation with hydrotreatment or black liquor gasification with catalytic synthesis. We also assess how integrated biofuel production impacts different types of pulp mills and a petroleum refinery by using energy and material balances assembled from experimental data supplemented by expert input. Our results indicate that drop-in biofuels from black liquor part-streams can be produced for ~80 EUR2017/MWh, which puts black liquor on the same footing (or better) as comparable forest residue-based alternatives. The best pathways in both production routes have comparable costs and their principal biofuel products (petrol for black liquor gasification and diesel for lignin hydrotreatment) complement each other. All pathways surpass European Union's sustainability criteria for greenhouse gas savings from new plants. Supplementing black liquor with pyrolysis oil or electrolysis hydrogen can improve biofuel production potentials and feedstock diversity, but better economic performance does not accompany these benefits. Fossil hydrogen represents the cheaper option for lignin hydrotreatment by some margin, but greenhouse gas savings from renewable hydrogen are nearly twice as great. Research on lignin upgrading in industrial conditions is recommended for reducing the presently significant performance uncertainties. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The synthesis of ethyl levulinate (EL) via esterification of levulinic acid (LA) with ethanol, which can be derived from biomass, has become an attractive topic since EL can be applied in many fields, such as fuel additives for petroleum and biodiesel, food additives and fragrance. Herein, the sulfonated porous carbon catalysts derived from the rinds of corn stalk biomass wastes were prepared by using sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid as the sulfonating agent and activator, respectively. The preparation parameters were optimized based on the catalytic activity for LA esterification with ethanol and the acid density of the corresponding catalysts. Also, various reaction factors were optimized to improve the catalytic efficiency over the optimal sulfonated corn stalk-derived carbon (s-CSC). Under the conditions of reaction temperature 80 °C, catalyst dosage 5 wt%, ethanol-to-LA molar ratio 5.0:1 and reaction time 8 h, the LA conversion reached 94% and 93% catalyzed by s-CSC and the optimal porous catalyst (s-p-CSC), respectively. Noticeably, benefitting from the hierarchical porous structure with large surface area, s-p-CSC exhibited much better recyclability than s-CSC. This work offers a highly effective solid acid catalyst for the synthesis of biofuel. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Photosynthesis of C. vulgaris shows slow growth and low lipid production due to the low solubility of CO2, and it is thus necessary to increase the dissolved inorganic carbon source to solve this problem. In this study, carbonic anhydrase (CA) was fused with dockerin to form a CA complex by cohesion-dockerin interaction. The CA complex was displayed on the surface of C. vulgaris by a cellulose binding module. The CA complex increased activity and stability compared to those of a single enzyme. Additionally, C. vulgaris showed an average of 1.6-fold rapid growth during log phase through the influence of the CA complex. The bicarbonate produced by the CA complex increased the lipid production about 1.7-fold (23.3%), compared to 13.6% for the control group. The present results suggest that the CA complex successfully enhances the CO2 fixation, which should be an essential study for 4th generation biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigates the effect of NaZSM-5 zeolite’s acid properties on the catalytic cracking of crude soybean to produce gasoline-like hydrocarbons. We modified both the acid concentration and the acid strength of the NaZSM-5(60) zeolite (where 60 denotes the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio) either by varying the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (i.e., 30, and 90) or by exchanging the compensation cation (i.e., from Na+ to H+). Given the ammonia temperature-programmed desorption and temperature-programmed oxidation tests, we observed that the acid strength of the catalyst is associated not only with the distribution of the cracking products, but also with the nature of the carbonaceous deposits formed during the reaction. Weak, medium, and strong acidity were associated with the formation of heavy hydrocarbon species, soft, and hard coke, respectively. The NaZSM-5 zeolites exhibited weak and medium acidity, while the HZSM-5(60) zeolite exhibited weak and strong acidity. Although both NaZSM-5(30) and HZSM-5(60) zeolites delivered higher gasoline yield than the NaZSM-5(60) zeolite due to its higher acid concentration, the HZSM-5(60) zeolite formed carbonaceous deposits with lower reactivity (i.e., hard coke). Therefore, low values of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the NaZSM-5 zeolite drive the reaction products towards gasoline-like hydrocarbons and favor the catalyst reactivation through the formation of more reactive carbonaceous deposits. © 2020, Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Química.

AB  - Wastewater treatment by duckweed is a naturally sustainable technology. However, its development is limited due to the lack of a follow-up treatment of duckweed. The duckweed was proposed for the treatment of rural domestic wastewater and agricultural wastewater, and it was further processed to produce bio-oil via hydrothermal liquefaction at various temperatures (250 °C–370 °C) and residence times (15–60 min). The highest bio-oil yield of 35.6 wt% was obtained at 370 °C, 45 min. The higher heating value of bio-oil was 40.85 MJ/kg, and the H/C ratio (1.72–1.98) was similar to that of petroleum (1.84). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis results revealed that the bio-oil mainly consisted of N-heterocycles, cyclic ketones, esters, amides, long-chain hydrocarbons, phenols, and aromatic intermediates. Valuable compounds (3-pyridinol, 2-pyrrolidinone, and its analogues) of high concentration were identified in the water-soluble organic matter. Compared with other materials, this study produced higher-quality bio-oil and water-soluble organic matter. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: This research explores synergistic pre-treatment parameters and chemometrics as applicable to systems level biogas related research frameworks (such as the sustainable development goals) for anaerobic digestion biomass processes-policy. Specifically, the hypothesis that simple feedstock pretreatment-digestion methods can be applied to rapidly evaluate biochemical biogas potential of anaerobically digested Carica papaya petioles was tested. Pretreatment parameters explored include hydration, i.e. 1:4, 1:6, 1:8 and 1:10 substrate mass to water weight ratios and hydrochloric acid pretreatment chemistry, i.e. 1%—0.3 M, 3%—0.7 M, 5%—1.0 M, in batch digestions experiments with non-inoculated C. papaya petioles. Biomass feedstock was obtained from Edo State, Nigeria. Digestions were performed at ambient temperature, i.e. 27 °C, for 3 weeks. Pretreated C. papaya petiole samples were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to characterize spectra with characteristic absorbance ratios indicative of physicochemical changes in biomass that include; cross-linked lignin ratio, the lateral order index, and hydrogen bond intensity. Cumulative gaseous yields from C. papaya petiole digestions were fit to the modified Gompertz form and optimized with non-linear regression in Matlab® to derive mathematical parameters, i.e. daily maximum production rate of biogas, a lag phase prior to biogas production, and biogas potential. An optimum C. papaya petiole pretreatment digestion scenario, i.e. 1:4 substrate-to-water ratio and 3%, i.e. 0.7 M, HCl pretreatment resulted in a 150% increase in yield, (10.9 mL gas/g VS) compared to non-pretreated C. papaya petiole digestion. Analysis with the modified Gompertz form also suggests rapid biogas potential assessment can be performed in a few days-time, i.e. approximately 10 days with distinct visual characterization of individual digestion performance. It was concluded that the applied digestion procedures with the use of C. papaya petioles can evolve gas rapidly. It was also concluded that obtained FTIR spectra are indicative of hydrolysis acid pretreatment chemistry, i.e. decrease in glycosidic β-(1,4) bonds in cellulose compared to crystalline structure of cellulose, suggesting that spectroscopy chemometrics can inform systems frameworks. Finally, it was concluded that collaborative efforts in support of larger sustainability goals and towards more complex assessment models are possible.

AB  - Microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrosynthesis cell (MREC) is an attractive strategy for wastewater treatment and valuable chemicals production from CO2 reduction. Herein, one innovative MREC is proposed to drive CO2 conversion to ethanol and acetate with low-grade waste heat energy coupled with thermolytic solutions (e.g., NH4HCO3 solution) as driven power sources. In such MREC, the maximum ethanol and acetate accumulated concentration of 5.23 ± 0.35 and 2.85 ± 0.38 mM are obtained, catalyzed by Clostridium ljungdahlii ERI-2 with production rates of 130.75 ± 8.75 and 137.92 ± 7.92 mmol m−2 d−1, respectively. Moreover, the current as the key parameter for the CO2 conversion, which can be controlled by the salinity ratios of NH4HCO3 solutions and medium of Clostridium ljungdahlii ERI-2. This work for the first time proves the potential of the MREC for simultaneous biofuels production, CO2 reduction, wastewater treatment and waste heat energy utilization. © 2020

AB  - As a very promising biofuel or fuel additive, the synthesis of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) directly from renewable carbohydrates is an important biomass transformation process. Herein, a novel bifunctional catalyst has been successfully synthesized via a Pickering high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) template and pore-filled strategy and employed for the production of EMF from glucose in a one-pot manner. Catalytic results indicated that the grafted Cr3+ by the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method smoothly processed the isomerization of glucose to intermediate fructose and that the accessible -SO3H and Cr3+ active sites coexisted in the obtained bifunctional catalyst possessing synergistic effects. A high EMF yield of 48.1% was achieved under optimal reaction conditions in an ethanol/tetrahydrofuran (THF) medium. Besides, employing inulin, sucrose, cellobiose, maltose, and starch as the starting materials excellent EMF yields were also obtained over the developed bifunctional catalyst. This study offers new insights into the design of functional catalysts anchoring desirable active sites, and also highlights their applications for biomass transformation. © 2020 American Chemical Society

AB  - This study aimed to design and construct a quadruple solar/hydro/biomass/geothermal hybrid system, using a techno-economic analysis for water/biofuel production as energy carriers. First, in the case of the ground source heat pump-assisted microalgal culture pond, three influencing factors including light intensity, salinity, and air injection were investigated for maximum biomass production. Then, in the parabolic trough collector, the flow rate of operating fluid, the used hybrid nanoparticles, and their ratios were considered for obtaining the highest thermal efficiency. After, providing a better solar still distiller for the highest water production efficiency, the pressure, fluid's flow rate, and the depth of solar still were investigated. Finally, the water/heart supply of producing biodiesel from the pond's biomass in the trans-esterified conversion reactor was provided from the distiller/collector. The results indicated that using a 300-lx light intensity, a 3-g/L salinity, and a 0.4-L/min air injection in the pond, a 3-L/min nanofluid, including CuO/GO (4:1) and mass fraction of 0.4 in the operating fluid in the collector, a 2.5-cm water depth under a 0.4-bar pressure in the distiller, and a 1.8-wt%/wt catalyst concentration under a reaction temperature of 55 °C at 50 min in the reactor would yield the best water/biofuel production efficiency of 55%/80%. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society

AB  - This study aimed to study the feasibility and stability of biohythane production from cornstalk via two-stage anaerobic fermentation without hydrolysis step in a semi-continuous pilot scale system. The present study applied a 1 m3 continuous stirred tank reactor for biohydrogen production and a 0.5 m3 up-flow anaerobic sludge bed for biomethane production. During the entire operation, a hydrogen production yield of 25.02 L/kg TS and hydrogen production rate of 0.46 L/L/d was achieved in first-stage. In addition, a methane yield of 95.38 L/kg TS and methane production rate of 4.06 L/L/d was achieved in second-stage by using the liquid effluent after first-stage. The percentage of hydrogen in the biohythane gas was 18.47% which suitable for vehicle fuel. Moreover, it was feasible to use the solid residue as a growth medium in seedlings to improve energy and carbon recovery. The results suggest that biohythane production from cornstalk could be a promising biofuel avenue. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Black phosphorus (BP) has attracted tremendous attention as a new two-dimensional semiconductor material with excellent optical and electrical properties. Unfortunately, the mimicking enzyme characteristics of BP have never been investigated. Herein, BP is discovered to exhibit glucose dehydrogenase-like behavior, which can enable catalytic glucose oxidation without any byproducts (e.g., H2O2). More importantly, the BP nanosheets also exhibited excellent catalytic performance in broad pH and temperature scope, as well as high stability. This discovery breaks the situation where only glucose oxidase (GOx)-like nanozyme for glucose oxidation is reported. When BP nanosheets were utilized as anodic enzymes for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs), the EBFCs exhibited superior power output and high stability compared with that of bioenzyme-based EBFCs. This work not only develops the application of BP in the nanozyme field but also provides a new viewpoint to construct EBFCs with excellent performance and stability. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels used as biocomponents for transport fuels should meet quality requirements. Their properties have a significant impact on the proper functioning of the engine supply system and the wear of its components. Changes in the performance of biofuel functionality may already occur during storage. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate changes in selected rheological and tribological parameters of higher fatty acid esters depending on the time and method of their storage by considering different types of substrates used for their production. The presence of possible microbiological contamination, which may affect the examined parameters of biofuels, was also analyzed. The dynamic viscosity of the biofuels tested changed depending on the substrate used. The biofuel produced from waste oil had the highest viscosity. Tribological studies show that both the linear wear of samples and the friction moment were higher after the storage period. The acid number of the esters did not exceed the permissible value recommended by the standard. The type of raw material used for the production of biodiesel and the conditions of its storage affected biodeterioration, proved by the growth of microorganisms. The highest number of microorganisms was recorded in biofuels prepared from waste oil. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - As one of the major products from cellulose pyrolysis, levoglucosan (LG) is highly oxygenated and stubborn, causing serious problems to bio-oil utilization. In this study, catalytic ketonization of LG over nano-CeO2 was performed in a pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS) system to prepare hydrocarbon precursors (principally ketones). Nano-CeO2 has been proven effective to convert LG into ketones, with the highest selectivity (71.2 %) obtained when CeO2 to LG ratio was 15:1 (mm3: mg) at 700 °C. When 5% ZrO2 was loaded on CeO2 (5% Zr/CeO2), the selectivity of ketones further increased to 76.0 %, and that of linear compounds in all the ketone products reached 53.9 %. Results from catalyst characterization revealed that 5% Zr/CeO2 contained an abundance of basic surface sites and redox capacity, thus leading to high ketonization activity. Ketonization of LG possesses significant potential in facilitating the conversion of cellulose into high-quality biofuels in a sustainable way. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Compression ignition (CI) engines that run on high-viscosity fuels (HVF) like emulsified biofuels generally demonstrate poor engine performance. An engine with a consistently low performance, in the long run, will have a negative effect on its lifespan. Poor combustion in engines occurs mainly due to the production of less volatile, less flammable, denser, and heavier molecules of HVF during injection. This paper proposes a guide vane design (GVD) to be installed at the intake manifold, which is incorporated with a shallow depth re-entrance combustion chamber (SCC) piston. This minor modification will be advantageous in improving the evaporation, diffusion, and combustion processes in the engine to further enhance its performance. The CAD models of the GVD and SCC piston were designed using SolidWorks 2018 while the flow run analysis of the cold flow CI engine was conducted using ANSYS Fluent Version 15. In this study, five designs of the GVD with varying lengths of the vanes from 0.6D (L) to 3.0D (L) were numerically evaluated. The GVD design with 0.6D (L) demonstrated improved turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) as well as swirl (Rs ), tumble (RT ), and cross tumble (RCT ) ratios in the fuel-injected zone compared to other designs. The suggested improvements in the design would enhance the in-cylinder airflow characteristics and would be able to break up the penetration length of injection to mix in the wider area of the piston-bowl. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, agave bagasse (a lignocellulosic residue) was pretreated by steam explosion to increase the solubility of carbohydrates in the hydrolysates. The operational variables studied were pressure (0.28, 0.47, and 0.67 MPa, corresponding to 116, 142, and 154 °C, respectively) and pretreatment time (5, 10, 15, and 20 min). The conditions that favored the highest solubilization of glucose (66 ± 4 mg L−1), arabinose (160.31 ± 3.2 mg L−1), and the chemical oxygen demand (COD, 4395.71 ± 22.44 mg L−1) were 154 °C and 10-min. On the other hand, the maximum solubilization of total carbohydrates (TC, 2177.99 ± 197.22 mg L−1) and xylose (43 ± 2.8 mg L−1) was obtained at 154 °C and 15-min. Pretreatments catalyzed with H2SO4 at 154 °C and 10-min resulted in 3, 2.7, and 100-times TC, glucose and xylose concentrations, respectively, as compared to the uncatalyzed pretreatment. However, concentrations of potential inhibitor compounds (i.e., acetic acid, furfural, and hydroxymethylfurfural) increased as well, 26, 120 and 18-times, respectively. A biochemical methane potential (BMP) test of the hydrolysates resulting from the 154 °C-10 min conditions was used to calculate the energy balance of their conversion to methane. When considering only the energy invested in the pretreatment, the process showed an efficiency of 247%, thus being energetically feasible. The integration of methane production to the tequila processes could be implemented using the steam flow already present in the process, improving energy efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of this industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study provides kinetic and equilibrium information of the extraction of rice bran lipids using hexane from post-hydrolysis rice bran (PHRB). Rice bran (RB) is an agricultural residue with promising valorization potential in biodiesel production. In this study, native RB was subjected to dilute acid hydrolysis (DAH) with an acid solution 3 vol% using 95 wt% H2SO4 at 90 °C for 6 h, increasing the lipid density threefold. Batch extraction with hexane was carried out at various temperatures (30, 45, and 60 °C) and solvent to solid ratio (SSR, 4, 8, and 12 mL g−1). Improved extraction rates were observed at higher temperatures and lower SSRs. Regardless, ~90% of the extractable lipids were solubilized in hexane in less than 10 min. Data obtained were fitted with 5 different models. The extraction of lipids from RB and PHRB involves at least 2 mechanisms, a rapid washing step, and a diffusion step. The extraction process was found to be exergonic, endothermic, and irreversible. An SSR of 4 mL g−1 would require at least 5 ideal crossflow extraction stages for a lipid recovery of over 95%. Compared to RB, the extraction of lipids from PHRB provides potential solvent savings of ~80%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of NiO and Co3O4 supported oxide catalysts was synthesized and investigated in the acetalization of glycerol with butyraldehyde to biofuels production. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 sorption, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDS and HRTEM techniques. The influence of the catalysts mass, glycerol to butyraldehyde molar ratios, reaction temperature and presence of solvent were deeply investigated. The dispersion of Ni and Co oxides gave distinct effects on the catalytic performances of the solids with AlTi and CeMn being actives in all conditions tested. The mechanistic aspect of the reaction was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). Among the catalysts, the high acidity of the Co/CeMn and Ni/CeMn promoted the acetalization of glycerol more efficiently to produce 4-methanol-2-propyl-1,3-dioxolane, in spite of the glycerol oligomers formation. The correlation of the structure, acidity, morphology and texture of the solids with the catalytic performance was illustrated for solventless acetalization of glycerol with butyraldehyde reaction. The theoretical calculations by DFT studies revealed a more favorable route to 1,3-dioxolane production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study was targeted on investigating the facilitations of the combined pretreatment of acid washing and torrefaction on the co-production of syngas and phenols-rich bio-oil. Comparison of raw and modified samples indicated that combined pretreatments not only effectively removed the bulk of alkali and alkaline earth metals but also improved the fuel properties by decomposing unstable hemicellulose. Then, via the catalytic reforming of activated carbon catalyst, CO-rich syngas and phenols-rich bio-oil were obtained simultaneously. The optimal products was acquired from the acid-washed sample which torrefied at 240 °C (labeled as AT240). This syngas contained the maximal CO concentration of 61.86%, and its yield reached 174.34 mL/g. In bio-oil, relative content of phenolic compounds was 91.44%, in which the phenol occupied 71.72%. Quantitative analysis revealed the quantity of phenol in AT240 was 1.74 times of raw bio-oil. Furthermore, mechanism of combined pretreatment on catalytic co-production of syngas and phenols was proposed and discussed in this paper © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Use of nano-additives in biofuels is an important research and development topic for achieving optimum engine performance with reduced emissions. In this study, rice bran oil was converted into biodiesel and graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles were infused into biodiesel-diesel blends. Two blends containing (i) 5% biodiesel, 95% diesel and 30 ppm GO (B5D95GO30) and (ii) 15% biodiesel, 85% diesel and 30 ppm GO (B15D85GO30) were prepared. The fuel properties like heating value, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, etc. of the nanoadditives–biodiesel-diesel blends (NBDB) were measured. Effects of injection timing (IT) on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics were studied. It was observed that both B15D85GO30 and B5D95GO30 blends at IT23° gave up to 13.5% reduction in specific fuel consumption. Compared to diesel, the brake thermal efficiency was increased by 7.62% for B15D85GO30 at IT23° and IT25°. An increase in IT from 23° to 25° deteriorated the indicated thermal efficiency by 6.68% for B15D85GO30. At maximum load condition, the peak heat release rates of NBDB were found to be lower than the pure diesel at both IT. The CO, CO2 &amp; NOx emissions were reduced by 2–8%. The study concluded that B15D85GO30 at IT23° gave optimum results in terms of performance, combustion and emission characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: Valorization of food waste into value-added fuels or chemicals is of considerable significance. Herein, an efficient catalytic approach was developed for transforming expired fructan-rich food (probiotics beverage powder, onion powder and garlic powder that have expired) into the biofuel, 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), via a carbonaceous solid acid synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and sulfonation of restaurant food waste. The as-prepared restaurant food waste-derived carbonaceous solid acid catalyst (FW-SO3H) was well-characterized by a series of model physical and chemical technologies, and its catalytic performances were evaluated by the ethanolysis of expired fructan-rich food for EMF synthesis. The effects of reaction process variables were investigated. A considerable EMF yield of 52.1% from expired probiotics beverage powder was obtained in DMSO/ethanol medium at 140 °C for 4 h. EMF yields of 20.4% and 11.7% were achieved from expired onion powder and expired garlic powder, respectively. This work provides a valorization strategy for both expired fructan-rich food and restaurant food waste. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Bioelectricity production was achieved using human neuronal-like cells called SH-SY5Y cell line in single-chamber air-cathode fuel cells. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium was used as the carbon source. SH-SY5Y cells grown on carbon cloth were used as anode in the experiments. The voltage was 96 mV using 980 Ω external resistance. Voltage levels decreased when the medium was replaced with medium containing 4.5 g L−1 of glucose. Maximum power density, current density and Coulombic efficiency were measured as 12 mW m−2, 0.013 mA cm−2 and 15%, respectively. Anode biofilm was examined using a multipotentiostat, and cyclic voltammetry results showed redox activity. The output of the fuel cell was connected to a circuit to power LEDs, by using the circuit as a voltage-controlled current source. The results demonstrated for the first time that human neuronal-like cells can generate bioelectricity in a fuel cell to power LEDs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The shortage of resources and increasing climate changes have brought the need for sustainable and renewable resources to people's attention. Biomass is an earth-abundant material and has great potential as a feedstock for alternative fuels and chemicals. For the effective utilization of biomass, this biopolymer has to be depolymerized and transformed into key building blocks and/or the targeted products, and biological or chemical catalysts are commonly used for the rapid and energy-efficient reactions. This Special Issue introduces recent advances in the catalytic conversion of biomass into biofuels and value-added products. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The research of renewable alternatives to decarbonize the transport sector and to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels pushes towards the development of more sustainable solutions for fuel production. Among the diesel substitutes, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) is considered one of the most promising options, since it can be blended with fossil diesel without limitations. In this context, this paper assesses the technical and economic feasibility of producing HVO using waste vegetable oil (WVO) as feedstock, with the help of a simulation model that maximizes the integration of renewable energy sources. The process to synthesize HVO requires a large amount of hydrogen that, in this study, is supplied through an upstream high-temperature electrolysis process occurring in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which are fed by low-carbon electricity. The use of waste oils as feedstock eliminates the competition with food crops (e.g. soybean or rapeseed) and promotes the recycling of substances that need to be disposed. The results of the study prove the technical feasibility of a plant with an annual capacity of 100 kt of HVO, having an energy efficiency of 80%. Also, the breakeven point of such investment would be reached before the fourth year of operation, considering a WVO price of 400 €/t, which is assumed as target price. However, the uncertainty on the market prices of WVO, HVO and electricity, as well as on other fixed and variable production costs, can significantly affect the projected results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing sustainable biodiesel from oil crops has been a great challenge, especially for oil crops plantations that involve various small and medium stakeholders. Differences in plantation activities and environments create a unique sustainability profile for each oil crop that may impose more sustainability issues such as deforestation problems in oil palm plantations. This paper embraced the unique sustainability index profile of each oil crop, and an investigation was performed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating multiple oil crops into the existing biodiesel refinery to improve its economic and sustainability performances. The selection of the process feed is proposed to be based on oil crop properties such as iodine value, peroxide value and saturated and unsaturated fatty acid contents. The sustainability profiles considered in the study include deforestation, oil yield, fertiliser impact, water impact and carbon footprint. Case studies demonstrated that a more balanced sustainability index profile could be achieved at a higher production cost—from USD 6.43 billion·y−1 in a cost-saving-centric solution to USD 39.90 billion·y−1 in a sustainability-improvement-centric solution. The study provided excellent insight into the impact on production cost to achieve sustainability which can help stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of integrating multiple oil crops in the system. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, the effects of glycerol ethers as a biobased additive on some important fuel properties of the diesel–biodiesel blend are investigated. For this, firstly, glycerol ethers are synthesized by the etherification reaction of glycerol with tert-butyl alcohol with the presence of Amberlyst-15 as an acidic catalyst. The process of synthesis is followed by analyzing product composition through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Lastly, synthesized glycerol tert-butyl ethers are mixed with a diesel–biodiesel blend, and the effects of glycerol ethers on the fuel properties are determined. The analysis results show that glycerol tert-butyl ether mixture consists of mono- and di-ethers of glycerol. Due to the dehydration reaction and hindrance effect, the tri-ether of glycerol is not generated. The outcomes of determination of fuel properties reveal that glycerol ethers can be blended with a biodiesel-diesel mixture without any significant change in the fuel properties by fully meeting the ASTM D7467 standard, indicating glycerol ethers could serve as a biobased additive to diesel–biodiesel blend. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study investigated predictions of reaction mechanisms and reaction rate law model covering effect of plasma role on the heterogeneous catalytic reaction of triglyceride and methanol to produce biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester - FAME or fatty acid alkyl ester – FAAE) over a continuous flow hybrid catalytic-plasma reactor. This catalytic reaction was carried out in a dielectric-barrier discharge plasma reactor over 5 wt% K2O/CaO–ZnO catalyst under conditions of atmospheric pressure and the reactor temperature of 65 °C. During the hybrid catalytic-plasma reaction system, the voltage, the catalyst diameter, and the Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) were kept constant at 5 kV, 5 mm, and 1.186/min, respectively. It was found that transesterification reaction with the hybrid roles of catalytic and plasma achieved 77.2% biodiesel yield. Kinetic studies of this transesterification reaction over a continuous flow hybrid catalytic-plasma reactor suggested following Eley-Rideal mechanism model, where the methanol adsorbed on the catalyst surface reacted with triglycerides in bulk phase to produce an adsorbed methyl ester and glycerol in bulk phase. The possible reaction rate law model found is: -rTG = rME = rs = (0.0078∗(0.0061∗CTG∗CM3–3.0302 × 10−6∗CME3∗CG))/(0.1827∗CM+ 0.0145∗CME+1)3 gmol/gcat.min. This reaction rate law model was useful to design reactor of the hybrid catalytic-plasma chemical reaction system for biodiesel production. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - We present a new approach for the preparation of electrocatalytically active carbonaceous coatings embedding bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) - AgPt@C structures, on surfaces with 2D and 3D geometry such as glass covered with indium tin oxide (ITO) film and anodic aluminum oxide substrates, respectively. We provide extensive characterization of the deposited structures and demonstrate their performance towards the electrocatalytic glucose oxidation, one half-reaction of biofuel cells. We observe that a preliminary surface treatment of the porous alumina substrate is essential for a homogeneous laser-induced deposition of AgPt@C nanoparticles across the whole pore depth. © 2020

AB  - Owing to its importance in the fuel cell, biofuel and bioinorganic chemistry, since 1981, there has been an immense interest in the development of surface-confined ruthenium-oxo complex and to utilize it as a model bio-mimicking system for oxidation of water and alcohol reactions. In this connection, ruthenium-oxo complex has been attached on solid-surfaces by various chemical approaches. Indeed, the preparation of stable and fouling-free surface-confined ruthenium-complex system is a challenging task. Herein, we report a new methodology based on a modification of [Ru(tpy)(DMSO)Cl2]-Nafion (Nf) precursor, wherein, tpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine ligand, system on a graphitized mesoporous carbon (GMC) modified electrode followed by electrochemical treatment for in-situ conversion to a high-valent ruthenium oxo complex electrode, designated as GCE/GMC@[(tpy)RuIV/III=O]-Nf, in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution. It showed a stable and well-defined redox peak at a standard electrode potential, Eo’ = 0.780 V vs Ag/AgCl with a surface-excess value, 5.5 × 10−9 mol.cm−2. Some of the kinetic parameters such as transfer coefficient, α and heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant, ks values were evaluated as 0.54 and 2.43 s−1 respectively for the redox couple. Collective physicochemical characterizations of the surface-confined system by TEM, Raman, UV–Vis and FTIR spectroscopic techniques and ESI-MS analysis, it has been revealed that [RuIII(tpy)(DMSO)(Cl)(OH)]+ complex is surface-confined on the electrode via π-π interaction, pore-encapsulation, and ionic interaction and further transformed to [(tpy)(DMSO)RuIVO]2+ like complex at an applied bias potential, 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl. This new surface-confined electrode showed high efficient and enzyme-free electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol with a current sensitivity of 39 μA mM−1 in a neutral pH solution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Five catalysts were synthesized by changing the molar proportions (15, 30, 50, 70, 85 %) of ceria/alumina by the sol-gel method with nonionic surfactant (Tergitol 15-S-9), after they were impregnated with 1% weight Pt for evaluation in the dehydration of glycerol, modifying the W/F ratio (9.09, 13.63 and 18.18 gcat*h/mol). Through X-ray powder diffraction and also by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the presence of ceria in the structure of alumina was identified. As the amount of cerium oxide increase, the BET surface area and the strength of the acid sites (TPD-NH3) increased as well, in turn, the pore size (mesoporous) remained constant. The catalytic tests were carried out in the gas phase in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor, within which the ceria showed a positive effect on the performance of the samples, improving the levels of conversion and selectivity towards acetol, probably due to the contribution of acid and redox sites of ceria. On the other hand, as the molar ratio of ceria decreased, the selectivity toward acrolein increased, possibly resulting in the presence of Brnsted sites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of combining the usage of waste frying oil (WFO), as a feedstock, and a lipase produced in solid-state fermentation (SSF), as a biocatalyst, for semi-pilot scale production of biodiesel as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Two fungal mutants namely; Rhizopus stolonifer 1aNRC11 mutant F (1F) and Aspergillus tamarii NDA03a mutant G (3G) were used as a cocatalyst. The two mutants were cultivated separately by SSF in a tray bioreactor. The dried fermented solid of 1F and 3G mutants were used in a ratio of 3:1, respectively, for WFO transesterification. Optimization of several semi-pilot process stages including SSF and WFO transesterification reaction conditions resulted in 92.3% conversion of WFO to FAME. This FAME yield was obtained after 48 h using 10% cocatalyst (w/w of WFO), 10% water (w/w of WFO) and 3:1 methanol/ WFO molar ratio at 30 °C and 250 rpm. A preliminary economic evaluation of produced biodiesel price (190 $/Ton) is less than half the price of petroleum diesel in Egypt (401$/Ton) and is about 40.3% the price of biodiesel produced using a pure enzyme, which is a promising result. This strategy makes the biodiesel synthesis process greener, economical and sustainable. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The increasing global energy demand and environmental concerns around fossil fuels have been propelling research on biodiesel. Despite the benefits of biodiesel to the environment, its properties as a fuel are still not ideal. Babassu oil produces good quality biodiesel, but there are problems associated with its use as a fuel, mainly due to its susceptibility to oxidation. One way of improving the oxidative stability of biodiesels is by adding substances capable of hindering the oxidation process, the antioxidants. Most antioxidants used for biodiesel are synthetic antioxidants opposing the premise of using biodiesel, which is to be a better environmentally friendly alternative. Therefore, in this study three natural antioxidants were tested in the babassu biodiesel, for which an experimental design 23 was used. The viscosity, specific mass and oxidative stability of the samples were evaluated, and to determine the best conditions for the use of antioxidants, a statistical analysis was performed applying a variance analysis and the response surface methodology. It was verified that there was an improvement in the oxidative stability of babassu biodiesel for all the natural compounds tested with an improvement ranging from 52 to 92%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Production of biodiesel (FAME) via transesterification of triglycerides with methanol in the presence of basic catalysts has largely increased over time despite the low value of the by-product glycerol. Interesterification of the same feedstock with methyl acetate allows to obtain biofuel with higher yield, as the by-product of this reaction, i.e. triacetin, can be included into the fuel composition. Investigation of interesterification with methyl acetate to oil molar ratio 18 at 55 °C during 1 h in presence of potassium tert-butoxide solution in tetrahydrofuran shows that after catalyst to oil molar ratio 0.1 slow increase of FAME and a decrease of triacertin content occur. Variation of catalyst to oil molar ratio does not allow to lower the content of intermediates below 19 wt%. An increase of methyl acetate to oil molar ratio from 18 to 65 reduces the mass fraction of intermediates to 9.5% and FAME to triacetin mass ratio to 5.2. The fuel characteristics of obtained products are close to or comply with the requirements of LVS EN 14214, excluding the requirements for FAME and intermediate content and density. The optimal region of methyl acetate to oil molar ratio as the reasonable compromise between the yield of the target products and removable excess of reactant could be from 24 to 40. © 2020

AB  - Renewable terpene biomass has attracting interest for producing high energy density fuel, particularly cycloalkane in the range of jet fuels. In this contribution, catalytic conversion of menthol to p-menthane was systematically investigated. Noble metals (Pt, Pd and Ru) supported on a Lewis-Brönsted acidic oxide (Nb2O5) were explored, considering the effects of reaction temperature and the balance between acid and metal sites. Catalysts kinetics were quite distinct, and Pd-based catalyst rendered the most active one. Yields of p-menthane of around 90% were determined over Pt and Pd catalysts, while it was only ~70% on Ru/Nb2O5, on which the formation of p-menthene was also observed. These results evidenced that the reaction proceeds as a cascade reaction at which acid-catalyzed menthol dehydration and metal-catalyzed cycloalkene hydrogenation lead to the aimed cycloalkane. Reaction temperature and the balance between acid and metal sites were shown to be the key aspects affecting catalyst performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to reduce the pollutant emission and alleviate the pressure of petroleum resources shortage and greenhouse gas emission at the same time, the use of clean and renewable alternative fuel for marine engines is a promising option. In this study, a marine diesel engine, which was modified to run in diesel methanol compound combustion (DMCC) mode, was investigated. After the diesel injection parameters were calibrated, and combined with a sample after-treatment device DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst), the engine could meet the requirements of China II legislation. The overall MSP (methanol substitute percent) reached 54.1%. The value of each pollutant emission was much lower than that in China II emission legislation, and there was almost no methanol and formaldehyde emissions. When methanol was injected into the inlet manifold, the intake air temperature decreased a lot, as well as the exhaust gas temperature, which were beneficial to increase engine thermal efficiency and improve engine room environment. Compared with the engine running in pure diesel mode, when the engine ran in diesel/methanol dual fuel mode, the combustion phase was advanced, and the combustion duration became shorter. Therefore, the engine thermal efficiency increased, and fuel consumption decreased significantly. © 2020

AB  - Abstract: Physicochemical properties of biodiesel are influenced by the characteristic of fatty acids including chain length, degree of unsaturation and composition of fatty acid. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of Hermetia illucens fatty acid properties on biodiesel quality using a transesterification reaction. H. illucens larvae were grown on fruit waste and food waste. The harvested pre-pupae were processed into dry biomass and stored in a container for further use. H. illucens pre-pupae were transesterified with methanol in the presence of sulphuric acid as catalyst. The reaction was conducted using methanol to sample mass of 6:1, reaction time (255 min), reaction temperature (50 °C), and catalyst loading (20v/v%). Biodiesel quality was tested according to the ASTM and EN standard. The degree of unsaturation, long chain saturated factor and methyl ester composition of each biodiesel also influence the biofuel’s properties. Fatty acid extracted from the H. illucens biomass showed high saturated fatty acid (SFA) derived from both feeds. Lauric acids were found to be the predominant SFA. The properties of FAME produced under optimum conditions, including density, kinetic viscosity, copper strip corrosion, oxidation stability and cloud points were in accordance with EN 14214 and ASTM 6751 biodiesel standards.

AB  - The energetically viable fabrication of stable and highly efficient solid acid catalysts is one of the key steps in large-scale transformation processes of biomass resources. Herein, the covalent modification of the classical Dawson polyoxometalate (POMs) with sulfonic acids (-SO3H) is reported by grafting sulfonic acid groups on the POM's surface followed by oxidation of (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane. The acidity of TBA6-P2W17-SO3H (TBA=tetrabutyl ammonium) has been demonstrated by using 31P NMR spectroscopy, clearly indicating the presence of strong Brønsted acid sites. The presence of TBA counterions renders the solid acid catalyst as a promising candidate for phase transfer catalytic processes. The TBA6-P2W17-SO3H shows remarkable activity and selectivity, excellent stability, and great substrate compatibility for the esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) with methanol and conversion into biodiesel at 70 °C with &gt;98 % conversion of oleic acid in 20 min. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of a catalytically active emulsion, which results in a uniform catalytic behavior during the reaction, leading to efficient interaction between the substrate and the active sites of the catalyst. Most importantly, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused without any loss of its catalytic activity owing to its excellent phase transfer properties. This work offers an efficient and cost-effective strategy for large-scale biomass conversion applications. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Seasonal variation in microalgal biomass production is a well-known challenge when optimizing economics for algal fuel conversion, especially given the fluctuation in biomass production between winter and summer. Wet storage offers significant potential for cost and energy savings compared to dewatering and dry storage. This study demonstrates the feasibility of preserving harvested Scenedesmus acutus biomass through wet anaerobic storage for use in biochemical conversion. Anaerobic storage effectively preserved biomass with minimal degradation of carbohydrates and preservation of lipids and proteins. Screening experiments identified optimal pretreatment conditions for stored biomass. Scale-up of pretreatment enabled fermentation of the hydrolysate to butyric acid and indicated no observable difference in conversion between unstored and stored biomass. Lipid extraction improved by a relative 12% for stored biomass. These results suggest that wet anaerobic storage can effectively manage seasonal variation in biomass production and is compatible with biochemical approaches for biofuel production. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study is reporting the biofuel synthesis and characterization from the novel non-edible feedstock cocklebur seeds oil. The Cocklebur crop seeds oil was studied as a potential source for biofuel production based on the chemical, structural and fuel properties analysis. The oil expression and FFAs content in cocklebur crop was reported 37.2% and 0.47 gram KOH/g, using soxhlet apparatus and acid base titration method, respectively. The maximum conversion and yield of the cocklebur crop seeds non-edible oil to biofuel was pursued 93.33%, using transesterification process. The optimum protocol for maximum conversion yield was adjusted: 1:7 oil-methanol molar ratios, ZnO nano-particle concentration 0.2 gm (w/w), reaction temperature 60°C, and reaction time 45 min, respectively. ZnO nano-particle was prepared by a modified sol-gel method, using gelatin and the particle was XRD, TEM, XPS, and UV-vis spectroscopies. Qualitatively, the cocklebur crop synthesized biofuel was quantified and structurally characterized by GC/MS, FT-IR, NMR, and AAS spectroscopies. Quantitatively, the fuel properties of cocklebur crop biofuel was analyzed and compared with the international ASTM and EN standards. © Copyright © 2020 Ullah, Jan, Ahmad and Ullah.

AB  - Metal oxides are widely used in the formulations of the catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis of biomass, due to the large specific surface area, pore size, and suitable acidity. HZSM-5 was the best mesoporous catalyst for aromatics synthesis because of the best acidity. However, there are some problems, such as low target yield, catalyst coking and deactivation with solo the catalysts. In order to improve the quality of bio-oil, a catalytic co-pyrolysis vapor upgrading of bamboo sawdust and LDPE was conducted by a fixed bed reactor, further to investigate effect of bamboo to LDPE ratio (1:0, 2:1, 1;1, 1:2, 0:1) of pyrolysis and catalyst pyrolysis on product yield. This study also revealed the effect of metal oxide (including HZSM-5, CaO, MgO, CeO2, La2O3 and SnO2), the dual-catalyst bed of HZSM-5 and base catalysts, HZ to MgO ratio (HZ: MgO=5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5) and combination mode (layered mode and mixed mode) on the promotion of aromatic hydrocarbons and bio-char. In addition, an investigation was made to explore the synergistic effect, reaction mechanism, and process optimization. Experimental results illustrated that: the addition of LDPE and metal oxide can effectively promote the conversion of biomass, thereby to reduce the yield of bio-oil (from 36.82% to 9.76%~23.96%), and further to enhance the quality of bio-oil, and the graphitization degree of bio-char, indicating an obvious synergistic effect. Hydrogen-rich fragments that derived from LDPE can promote the Diels-Alder reactions of furans, and participate in the hydrocarbon pool reactions of non-furanic compounds. As a result, a high yield of hydrocarbons was achieved. Scum as the hydrogen donor, showed a significant synergistic effect with biomass to enhance the production of bio-oil and aromatic hydrocarbons, when the H/Ceff value exceeded 1. The maximum yield of aromatic hydrocarbons (89.32%) was obtained, when the optimal biomass to LDPE ratio was 1:2. MgO catalyst can facilitate the formation of phenol and alkylphenol. The MgO-based catalysts suppressed the formation of ethylene glycol, furans, carboxylic acids, and the aldehydes like acetaldehyde or hydroxyl acetaldehyde, but did not show much effect on the formation of hydroxyl acetone and acids. The formation of hydroxyl acetone was generally promoted by the oxide catalysts, as ketones were more stable than the aldehydes. CaO can effectively transform acids into ketones, as well as improved the yield of olefins. Moreover, La2O3 and SnO2 can exhibit better effect on furans formation. The mixed mode can effectively improve the yield of aromatics, compared with the layered mode. Ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis using HZ mixed MgO with ratio of 2:1 increased the aromatic hydrocarbon yield to 84.99% and mono-aromatic selectivity to 60.09%. Meanwhile, the contents of toluene and xylene were 25.97% and 16.91%, respectively, at the bamboo to LDPE ratio of 1:1, pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C, catalytic temperature of 550 °C, and the feedstock to catalyst of 1:2. The mixed mode can effectively promote the selectivity of benzene, toluene, and xylene, whereas, the layered mode can effectively promote the formation of alkylbenzene. The addition of MgO obviously inhibited the formation of PAHs. The findings can provide an efficient method to produce high-quality biofuels from renewable biomass resources. Normally, different kinds of metal oxides had different effects on the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and plastic, with the different ability of anti-carbon deposition. These factors should be fully considered in the development of metal oxide based catalysts. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - To address rising climate change problems, one significant task is reducing pollution in the transport sector by substituting fossil with biomass-based fuels. One of the potential production methods is by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. Both gasoline and diesel types of fuel can be produced. For FT fuels a carbon containing feedstock is needed as an end product, it can be processed in multiple ways using various systems, however the main parts of production are biomass preparation and gasification, where afterwards clean-up of the synthetic gas is required. A liquid form from the syngas is achieved via FT synthesis, after which hydroprocessing is needed for separating naphtha, diesel, and lighter-molecular-weight hydrocarbons or other components. For comparison of biofuel plants, the biomass of choice, production processes and end products were analysed, as well as economic feasibility of technologies, to determine whether the costs and investments required are reasonable for the possible outcome. © 2020 Agate Veipa, Vladimirs Kirsanovs, Aiga Barisa.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass, can be transformed via the hydrodeoxygenation process to potential biofuels, such as 2,5 dimethylfuran or other chemicals of industrial importance. Non-noble metal catalysts constitute a robust and cheap solution for this process. In this work, the modification of the Ni/TiO2 catalyst by the addition of iron and support modification was evaluated. It was shown that bimetallic Ni-Fe catalysts are more selective and stable than their monometallic counterparts. This improvement in properties depends on the Ni:Fe ratio, but the support plays an equally important role-namely the high surface area anatase titania support improves the metal dispersion, resulting in a higher catalytic activity, and the formation of NiFe alloy facilitates the C=O bond cleavage. Such catalysts are active and stable and can be easily separated from the reaction mixture thanks to their magnetic properties. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The study focuses on the partial hydrogenation of a C18:3-rich FAME mixture (α-linolenate/linoleate: ∼3.5:1 mol/mol) taken as a model of FAME materials obtainable from alternative non-edible oils deriving from non-food biomass, which are suitable feedstocks for 2nd generation biodiesel. High C18:1 yield and selectivity required an accurate control of reaction time and temperature because of stearate generation through consecutive reactions C18:3→C18:2→C18:1→C18:0. In n-heptane, under mild conditions (50 °C, 0.1 MPa H2, 1 h), the FAME mixture was converted over Pd(5%)/C into C18:1 selectively (97.8%), with high yield (81.1%). The final mixture was C18:3-free (0.1%) and showed a low content of stearate (2.0%). Also the C18:2 component was markedly reduced (21.5%→16.7%). The content of trans-C18:1-monoenes was 39.0%. A lower content of trans-C18:1 (16.4%) was attained at 0 °C (1.5 h). Under the latter conditions, stearate and C18:3 in the final product were, respectively, 3.3% and 1.5%. Remarkably, Pd/C can act as a tunable catalyst being able to promote effectively the full hydrogenation of the FAME mixture to stearate under uncommon very mild conditions (0 °C, 0.1 MPa) within a relatively short time (6 h). Under solventless conditions or in polar solvents (MeOH, THF, dimethyl carbonate), hydrogenation was slower and less selective than in n-heptane. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are potential candidate for biofuel production as alternative one for fossil fuels. CO2 in flue gas is available carbon source to support microalgae growth. In this study, the effects of different concentrations of the simulated flue gas onto algal growth and photosynthetic activity were evaluated for both Chlorella sp. AE10 and Chlorella sp. Cv. The growth profiles were correlated by a simple kinetic model. It was indicated that the simulated flue gas led to low pH and the photosynthetic activity was partially destroyed. Chlorella sp. Cv can tolerate full simulated flue gas, 10% CO2 + 200 ppm NOx + 100 ppm SOx. The pH in medium maintained at 6 and the photosynthetic activity was more than 0.6 at the first 6 days. If the concentration of NOx was more 100 ppm and that of SOx was more than 50 ppm, the pH was declined to 4 at day 2 or 3 for Chlorella sp. AE10. At the same time, the related photosynthetic activities of Chlorella sp. AE10 were less than 0.4, which was not suitable for algal growth. It was shown that Chlorella sp. Cv could be used for CO2 fixation from the simulated flue gas. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Miscanthus giganteous is probably the most fast growing and low nutrient bioenergy crop among lignocellulosic feedstocks. Despite its significant content in fermentable sugars, currently Miscanthus biomass is not used for biogas/methane production due to the high-lignin and low moisture content in the winter/spring harvest as well as cellulose crystallinity, which limit access to enzymatic action for all lignocellulosic feedstock. This study identified that a photocatalytic pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion helps increase the substrate's biodegradability by oxidising the lignin fraction, leading to increased methane yield up to 46% compared to the untreated. A novel photocatalyst was manufactured by reactive magnetron-sputtering deposition of TiO2 particles onto natural zeolite supports, which provided important trace elements for the anaerobic digestion process and retained a large surface area that acted as biofilm to boost growth of the microbial community. A load of 2% w/w catalyst in the bioreactor after 3 h of photocatalytic treatment led to 220 mLN gVS−1, with a net energy balance that is achieved for the whole process when treating the dispersed phase suspension at concentrations above 10 g m−3. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the hydrolysate containing ~15 g/L of xylose, which was obtained from Acacia mangium wood sawdust was used for the synthesis of xylose by a continuous distillation method. The synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 7 h using a carbon-based sulfonated catalyst (CBSC) from the same biomass source with an acid density of about 4.0 mmol/g. The CBSC showed its efficient catalytic activity in the dehydration of xylose to furfural. Under the optimal catalyst dosage of 20 wt% over xylose, the yield of furfural was 20.4 mol% and 34 wt% of xylose was transformed to furfural. The results presented a successful utilization of a wood-derived solid acid catalyst for production of furfural from the same biomass source as a sustainable production of furans for biofuel additives. © 2020 Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Hanoi & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a non-edible feedstock that can be used in integrated biorefinery for the production of biochemicals and biofuel. Among lignocellulosic biomass, Cynara cardunculus L. (cardoon) is a promising crop thanks to its low water and fertilizer demand. Organosolv is a chemical treatment that uses numerous organic or aqueous solvent mixtures, and a small amount of acid catalyst, in order to solubilize the lignin and hemicellulose fractions, making the cellulose accessible to hydrolytic enzymes. Lignocellulosic residues of cardoon underwent a two-step treatment process to obtain fermentable glucose. In the first step, the milled biomass was subjected to microwave-assisted extraction using an acidified γ-valerolactone (GVL)/water mixture, yielding a solid cellulose pulp. In the second step, the pre-treated material was hydrolyzed by cellulolytic enzymes to glucose. The first step was optimized by means of a two-level full factorial design. The investigated factors were process temperature, acid catalyst concentration, and GVL/water ratio. A glucose production equal to 30.17 g per 100 g of raw material (89% of the maximum theoretical yield) was achieved after conducting the first step at 150 ◦C using an acidified water solution (1.96% H2SO4 w/w). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Abietic acid is one of the main compositions of rosin and tall oil, it has a tricyclic molecular structure, which could be further modified into a branched saturated bicyclic substance with the process of hydro-creaking treatment. Branched decalin and its derivatives are main creaking products from abietic acid, which are promising aviation fuel components since they owe high density, good thermal stability, and low freezing point. In this work, two routes for the target aviation fuel production with abietic acid as raw material were investigated, and their reaction conditions were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, target aviation fuel with a yield of 45.8% saturated bicyclic products was obtained through the route of hydrogenation-cracking process. Meanwhile, a yield of 42.2% was obtained with the route of cracking-hydrogenation process. The branched saturated bicyclic compounds obtained from both processes had excellent fuel properties. Especially, the pour point of the fuel was below −75 °C, which makes the product could be potentially used as bio-aviation fuel in special areas, or as additive to improve low temperature performance of conventional bio-jet fuels. The investigation of this paper provided an efficient and green way for the bio-refinery of rosin or tall oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: In this study, sulfated zirconia on MCM-41 prepared through a new ultrasound-assisted sulfation method for biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. The effect of different sonication times (15, 30 and 45 min) on nanocatalyst properties were studied using BET, EDX, FESEM, NH3-TPD, FTIR and XRD analyses. The XRD patterns along with the results of FTIR and BET analysis revealed the MCM-41 framework destruction while Zr doping and sulfation of nanocatalysts. The FESEM images of the nanocatalysts illustrated a well distribution and uniform morphology for the SZM(T = 45). The size distribution of the SZM(T = 45) were subsequently determined by FESEM images. Biodiesel production carried out under following constant operational parameters to evaluate catalytic performance of synthesized samples: 5 wt% catalyst loading, 60 °C reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1 and 6 h reaction time. Using ultrasound-assisted sulfation method in nanocatalysts preparation was increased dispersion of active phase and stability of synthesized nanocatalysts. Obtained results demonstrated that longer irradiation time in nanocatalyst preparation led to higher biodiesel conversion. Additionally, after five cycles, the sonicated sample showed higher reusability compared to non-sonicated one. Among the prepared samples, the longer sonicated SZM(T = 45) nanocatalyst showed the highest conversion (93.5%) and significant stability in biodiesel production. Graphic Abstract: Sono-sulfated zirconia nanocatalyst supported on MCM-41 was synthesized by an ultrasound-assisted impregnation/hydrothermal hybrid synthesis method. The effect of irradiation time was studied by changing time of the sonication (15, 30, 45 min) during the synthesis which led to different physiochemical properties of the nanocatalyst. It was found that, the performance of investigated nanocatalysts in biodiesel production from sunflower oil showed sonicated catalysts have higher conversion in comparison to non-sonicated catalyst. Biodiesel conversion in catalyst with 60 W and 45 min ultrasonic irradiation showed higher biodiesel conversion and also reusability in reaction environment.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Ethanol Guerbet condensation is an environmentally friendly process for preparing biofuel such as n-butanol and alcohols with more than 4 carbon atoms. In this work, a multifunctional catalyst Ni/TiO2 was prepared by an excess impregnation method and its catalytic performance for ethanol Guerbet condensation was evaluated. The selectivity of C4-C8 alcohols reached up to almost 70% (41.4% of n-butanol) at nearly half conversion of ethanol at 210 °C and 10 h. Based on GC-MS analysis results, the products in ethanol Guerbet condensation were identified and a reaction network was established. The presence of acetaldehyde and 2-crotonaldehyde in the reaction products verified that Ni/TiO2-catalyzed ethanol condensation followed the traditional dehydrogenation-condensation-hydrogenation reaction mechanism. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) is a highly promising method for characterizing the different physical parameters and chemical structures of liquid fuels. In particular, there have been a variety of essential applications by means of time-domain NMR (TD-NMR). These applications can be developed for the characterization of petroleum fuels and biofuels, reaction monitoring, or process and quality control of liquid fuels. However, only a few applications have demonstrated the use of TD-NMR via on-line measurements. The principle of the majority of reviewed TD-NMR applications is based on finding the correlation between NMR and physical parameters. Special attention in this mini-review is paid to the description of on-line TD-NMR applications. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Used cooking oil is unsuitable to use again in the food process, but it may be harnessed as raw material in biofuel production. In this work, used palm oil was reacted via cracking over mechanically mixed catalysts between ZSM-5 and Y-Re-16 to generate organic liquid products (OLP). The catalysts used were known for high acidity and low cost for decomposition, degradation, and deoxygenation of triglycerides. The cracking experiments were conducted in a flow reactor. The experimental variables included reaction temperature between 300-500 °C, catalyst loading between 5-20 % w/w, and ratio of mixed catalyst between ZSM-5 and Y-Re-16 from 0-100 % w/w. They were set via response surface methodology and central composite design of experiments. Both catalysts showed good cracking reaction. The optimum condition for generating the OLP of about 85 % w/w was found at 300 °C, 5 % catalyst loading, 97 % ratio of mixed catalyst. The OLPs with different short-chain hydrocarbons between C7-C21 were identified. The main components were 71.43% of diesel, 12.11% of gasoline, and 8.95% of kerosene-like components. ©2020.

AB  - The widespread use of diesel/biodiesel blends as a transportation fuel can increase the risk of groundwater contamination, which requires remediation actions. Two pilot-field experiments were conducted to assess and compare their potential to treat groundwater contaminated with B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% diesel, v/v), using combined iron and sulfate biostimulation (CISB) and a modified Fenton system (MFS). A low-cost and sustainable product recovered from acid mine drainage was used to stimulate both iron- and sulfate-reducing conditions. The modified Fenton system was composed of magnesium peroxide to promote the slow release of hydrogen peroxide by magnesium peroxide decomposition. Fe2O3 recovered from acid mine drainage was used as catalyst for modified Fenton reaction. Both technologies demonstrated to efficiently degrade B20-blend aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the application of MFS maintained BTEX dissolved concentrations below the detection limit (1 μg L−1) over 22 months, while in CISB, the dissolved concentrations of BTEX compounds were &gt; 50 μg L−1 after 8.4 months. Additionally, total PAH dissolved concentrations in MFS experiment were lower than those observed for the CISB plot. In MFS, microbial growth was inhibited as opposed to CISB in which microbial growth enhanced up to 3 orders of magnitude. Therefore, though MFS was more efficient to meet remediation goals relative to CISB approach, if the site requires complete restoration, less aggressive technologies such as CISB should be considered. This novel pilot study presents chemical and biological technologies that can potentially be applied to remediate diesel/biodiesel blends in groundwater. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Renewable biodiesel with a high content of n-C17 alkanes was prepared through the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of oleic acid under optimum conditions of temperature, reaction time and weight percentage of Ni deposited in γ-Al2O3. The hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) was blended with petrodiesel (20 % and 40 % of HVO) to evaluate its behaviour in a diesel engine. Comparative studies of power and emission of atmospheric pollutants such as NOx, CO, HC and smoke were evaluated under prepared blends and petrodiesel. The presence of HVO biodiesel at full load generated a slight decrease in power compared to petrodiesel; however, the decrease in emission of pollutants when using the blends containing HVO was significant. In the case of 40 % HVO were able to reduce more of 20 % of CO and HC emissions, and more than 40 % reduction in smoke when compared with petrodiesel. The NOx emissions of the blends with HVO had a significant slightly decrease. Further, the properties of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are justified by the results of EDS characterization, surface area (SBET), XRD, XPS, HR-TEM and it's capacity to produce biodiesel. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Niobium oxide impregnated with sodium (Na/Nb2O5) was used as a heterogeneous catalyst to produce biofuel from conventional raw materials, such as soybean oil and beef tallow, and non-conventional feedstocks, including andiroba, babassu, coconut, crambe, macaw palm, palm, palm kernel, and jatropha oils. The trials were performed at fixed conditions using 10% catalyst at 78.5 °C under stirring (600 rpm) for 5 h. On the basis of the results generated by gas and liquid chromatographies, high catalytic activity was found for all tested feedstocks, revealing yields higher than 95%. The purity of the ethyl esters was validated by thermogravimetric analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance. The Na/Nb2O5 catalyst performed efficiently, converting the fatty acids present in the lipid raw materials to the ethyl esters, and showed high stability in consecutive batches, generating products that meet the specificity of international standards. The heterogeneity of the catalyst was also confirmed by determining the sodium concentration in both biodiesel and the catalyst after consecutive batch runs.

AB  - Large molecular weight pig biogas slurry (L-PBS) and small molecular weight pig biogas slurry (S-PBS) were separated from original pig biogas slurry (O-PBS) using a 100 kDa membrane. The original bioavailability and biosafety of L-PBS was very low. In order to enhance the total bioavailable dissolved organic nitrogen (TB-DON) and total bioavailable dissolved organic phosphorus (TB-DOP), optimum catalytic ozonation of L-PBS conditions were determined using Box-behnken design models (P &lt; 0.0001) and intersection tests. The optimal values for ozone concentration, pH value, active catalyst concentration and reaction time were 2.63 mg·L−1, 6.48, 1.43 g·L−1 and 40 min, respectively. Catalytic ozonation can effectively decompose and transform 68.07% of L-PBS into S-PBS to improve content organic bioavailability, with a molecular weight distribution of 0–1 kDa (13.53%), 1–5 kDa (16.62%), 5–10 kDa (11.16%), 10–30 kDa (11.73%), 30–100 kDa (15.04%). Catalytic ozonation of L-PBS can reduce protein levels from 85.28% to 47.18%, but increases the proportion of fulvic and humic components from 10.22% to 32.67% and 4.51%–20.15%, respectively. Because catalytic ozonation changes the internal components and molecular weights of L-PBS, both saw increases in TB-DON and TB-DOP from 3.33% to 41.12% and 2.43%–37.88%, respectively, with a large number of TB-DON and TB-DOP derived from hydrophilic organic components during catalytic ozonation. These important internal mechanisms changed by catalytic ozonation can effectively reduce the ecotoxicity (IR, from 76.5% to 33.1%) and phytotoxicity (GI, enhanced from 35.4% to 70.3%) of L-PBS. Therefore, catalytic ozonation combined with membrane separation is a choice technology in improving the nutrition of biogas slurry and reduce its ecological risk. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The high-efficiency synthesis of biofuel γ-valerolactone (GVL) from biomass-derived levulinates is a challenging task. The Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction with its extraordinary chemoselectivity is advantageous for the hydrogenation process, compared to the molecular-hydrogen-based process using noble metal catalysts. Therefore, we used a classical Al-based isopropoxide to catalyze transfer hydrogenation (CHT) of methyl levulinate (ML) to GVL. A high yield of GVL up to 97.6% could be achieved using 2-proponal as the H-donor and solvent under mild conditions (150 °C, 30 min). Besides, three reaction stages were observed in the conversion, including transesterification, hydrogenation and cyclization. LC/MS analysis and the density functional theory (DFT) caculations revealed that Al atom of Al(OiPr)3 as the electron transfer center activated ester carbonyl of the substrate via four-membered transition states before activating the ketone carbonyl, resulting in the occurrence of transesterification prior to the hydrogenation. In addition, 2-propanol as proton transfer carrier assisting the cyclization process was proved to be the lowest-energy pathway. Our work shed light on the role of Al (OiPr)3 in the MPV reduction of ML, providing a comprehensive understanding on the metal alkoxide catalysis mechanism for GVL production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aliphatic synthetic intermediates with high added value are generally produced from alkane sources (e.g., petroleum) by inert carbon–hydrogen (C−H) bond activation using classical chemical methods (i.e. high temperature, rare metals). As an alternative approach for these reactions, alkane monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida (alkB) is able to catalyze the difficult terminal oxyfunctionalization of alkanes selectively and under mild conditions. Herein, we report an electrosynthetic system using an alkB biocathode which produces alcohols, epoxides, and sulfoxides through bioelectrochemical hydroxylation, epoxidation, sulfoxidation, and demethylation. The capacity of the alkB binding pocket to protect internal functional groups is also demonstrated. By coupling our alkB biocathode with a hydrogenase bioanode and using H2 as a clean fuel source, we have developed and characterized a series of enzymatic fuel cells capable of oxyfunctionalization while simultaneously producing electricity. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Microalgae are an ideal source for next-generation biofuels due to their high photosynthetic rate. However, a key process limitation in microalgal biofuel production is harvesting of biomass and extraction of lipids in a cost-effective manner. The harvesting of the algal biomass amounts to approximately 20 to 30% of the total cost of the cultivation; hence, developing an efficient and universal harvesting method will make the commercialization of microalgal bio-cultures sustainable. In this study, we developed, demonstrated, and evaluated a novel harvesting method based on Glass Reinforced Fiber Polymer (GFRP) panels, suitable for industrial-scale installations. The proposed method was based on previous observations of preferential micro-algae development on glass surfaces, as well as in the assumption that the microalgae cells would prefer to attach to and grow on substrates with a similar size as them. At first, we developed a laser micromachining protocol for removing the resin and revealing the glass fibers of the GFRP, available for algal adhesion, thus acting as a microalgae biomass harvesting center. Surface micromachining was realized using a ns pulsed ultraviolet laser emitting at 355 nm. This laser ensured high machining quality of the GFRP, because of its selective material ablation, precise energy deposition, and narrow heat affected zone. A specially built open pond system was used for the cultivation of the microalgae species Scenedesmus rubescens, which was suitable for biofuel production. The cultivation was used for the experimental evaluation of the proposed harvesting method. The cultivation duration was set to 16 days in order for the culture to operate at the exponential growth phase. The biomass maximum recovery due to microalgae attachment on the GFRP surface was 13.54 g/m2, a yield comparable to other studies in the literature. Furthermore, the GFRP surfaces could be upscaled to industrial dimensions and positioned in any geometry dictated by the photobioreactor design. In this study, the glass fiber reinforced polymer used was suitable for the adhesion of Scenedesmus rubescens due to its fiber thickness. Other microalgae species could be cultivated, adhere, and harvested using GFRP of different fiber sizes and/or with a modified laser treatment. These very encouraging results validated GFRPs' harvesting capabilities as an attachment substrate for microalgae. Additional studies with more algae species will further strengthen the method. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Deoxygenation by transition-metal-based catalysts is employed to produce a biofuel from fatty acids. In this study, the citric acid/CoMo ratio of an unsupported CoMo catalyst prepared by a sol-gel method was increased from 1 to 7 to investigate its effect on the physicochemical properties and performance of the catalyst. Deoxygenation was carried out at 300 °C under solvent- and hydrogen-free conditions. The CoMo-3 catalyst (e.g., citric acid/CoMo = 3) showed the highest oleic acid conversion rate, C9-C17hydrocarbon selectivity, oxygen removal rate, and biofuel product quality. This catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance because it had the highest amount of active species (CoMoO4). Catalyst acidity considerably effected on the catalytic performance. Additionally, the citric acid/CoMo ratio affected the formation of single/mixed Co and Mo oxides. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - The main aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of a KI/KIO3 impregnated hydroxyapatite (HAP) catalyst derived from natural phosphate rocks for biodiesel production. This study evaluated the effect of impregnation concentrations (1-6% w/w) on the catalyst performance in biodiesel production. The biodiesel was produced from waste cooking oil (WCO) under simultaneous esterification-transesterification reactions at 60 °C for 6 h. The results showed that the biodiesel yield increased by increasing impregnation concentration and the maximum yield (91.787%) was achieved at an impregnation concentration of 5% w/w. The KI/HAP catalyst showed better performance (91.78% biodiesel yield, 59.1% FAME yield and surface area of 13.513 m2/g) as compared to the KIO3/HAP catalyst (90.07% biodiesel yield, 55.0% FAME yield and surface area of 10.651 m2/g). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Pyrolysis is an important technology to convert lignocellulosic biomass to a renewable liquid energy carrier known as pyrolysis oil or bio-oil. Herein we report the pyrolysis of pigeon pea wood, a widely available biomass in the Philippines, in a semi-continuous reactor at gram scale. The effects of process conditions such as temperature (400-600 ◦C), nitrogen flow rate (7-15 mL min−1) and particle size of the biomass feed (0.5-1.3 mm) on the product yields were determined. A Box-Behnken three-level, three-factor fractional factorial design was carried out to establish process-product yield relations. Of particular interest is the liquid product (bio-oil), of which the yield was shown to depend on all independent variables in a complex manner. The optimal conditions for highest bio-oil yield (54 wt.% on dry feed intake) were a temperature of 466 ◦C, a nitrogen flow rate of 14 mL min−1 and a particle size of 1.3 mm. Validation of the optimized conditions proved that the average (n = 3) experimental bio-oil yield (52 wt.%) is in good agreement with the predicted value from the model. The properties of product oils were determined using various analytical techniques including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C- and HSQC-NMR) and elemental and proximate analyses. The bio-oils were shown to have low ash content (0.2%), high heating value (29 MJ kg−1) and contain high value-added phenolics compounds (41%, GC peak area) as well as low molecular weight aldehydes and carboxylic acids. GPC analysis indicated the presence of a considerable amount of higher molecular weight compounds. NMR measurements showed that a large proportion of bio-oil contains aliphatic carbons (~60%), likely formed from the decomposition of (hemi)cellulose components, which are abundantly present in the starting pigeon pea wood. Subsequent preliminary scale-up pyrolysis experiments in a fluidized bed reactor (~100 gfeed h−1, 475 ◦C and N2 flow rate of 1.5 L min−1) gave a non-optimized bio-oil yield of 44 wt.%. Further fractionation and/or processing are required to upgrade these bio-oils to biofuels and biobased chemicals. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - As petro-based production generates numerous environmental impacts and their associated technological concerns, bio-based production has been well recognized these days as a modern alternative to manufacture chemical products in a more renewable, environmentally friendly, and sustainable manner. Herein, we report the development of a microbial bioprocess for high-level and potentially economical production of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3-HV), a valuable special chemical with multiple applications in chemical, biopolymer, and pharmaceutical industries, from glycerol, which can be cheaply and renewably refined as a byproduct from biodiesel production. We used our recently derived 3-HV-producing Escherichia coli strains for bioreactor characterization under various culture conditions. In the parental strain, 3-HV biosynthesis was limited by the intracellular availability of propionyl-CoA, whose formation was favored by anaerobic conditions, which often compromised cell growth. With appropriate strain engineering, we demonstrated that 3-HV can be effectively produced under both microaerobic (close to anaerobic) and aerobic conditions, which determine the direction of dissimilated carbon flux toward the succinate node in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. We first used the ∆sdhA single mutant strain, in which the dissimilated carbon flux was primarily directed to the Sleeping beauty mutase (Sbm) pathway (via the reductive TCA branch, with enhanced cell growth under microaerobic conditions, achieving 3.08 g L−1 3-HV in a fed-batch culture. In addition, we used the ∆sdhA-∆iclR double mutant strain, in which the dissimilated carbon flux was directed from the TCA cycle to the Sbm pathway via the deregulated glyoxylate shunt, for cultivation under rather aerobic conditions. In addition to demonstrating effective cell growth, this strain has shown impressive 3-HV biosynthesis (up to 10.6 g L−1), equivalent to an overall yield of 18.8% based on consumed glycerol, in aerobic fed-batch culture. This study not only represents one of the most effective bio-based production of 3-HV from structurally unrelated carbons to date, but also highlights the importance of integrated strain engineering and bioprocessing strategies to enhance bio-based production. Key points • TCA cycle engineering was applied to enhance 3-HV biosynthesis in E. coli. • Effects of oxygenic conditions on 3-HV in E. coli biosynthesis were investigated. • Bioreactor characterization of 3-HV biosynthesis in E. coli was performed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The increasing importance of sustainability in energy production has led to a global commitment to the use of fuels derived from renewable biological sources, such as biodiesel produced from plant crops or biomass residues, that do not compete with human food for their production. For a biofuel to be considered biodiesel, it must satisfy the specifications described in the UNE 14214, with the UNE-EN 14103 referring to the determination of fatty acid methyl ester content. This standard applies gas chromatography as an analytical technique. Gas chromatography is a widely used technique in the analysis of methyl ester although it has a number of drawbacks such as: long analysis times, a high consumption of high-quality gases and internal standards, does not allow the analysis of different compounds with the same column, etc. From an industrial production point of view, is necessary to know the fatty acid methyl ester content in biodiesel samples quickly. This paper studies the development of an analytical method using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as alternative to gas chromatography (GC), since it is a simple, rapid, and precise analytical technique to quantify fatty acid methyl ester content in biofuel samples. © 2020 AOCS

AB  - Fabrication of active, stable, and regenerable catalysts is the main purpose of researchers in which spinel-type catalysts can provide some excellent properties to utilize in chemical processes. However, some effective parameters on their properties and performance must be deeply evaluated. Therefore, in this study, the effect of Ni/Al ratio on the properties and performance of Ni-NiAl2O4 catalyst synthesized by solution combustion method was investigated. The sulfated structure of the samples was used as solid acid catalysts for the esterification of oleic acid. Various characterization techniques were carried out on SO4 2−/Ni-NiAl2O4 composites, and the results revealed that the increase of nickel concentration led to the formation of NiO and metal Ni which bonded strongly with sulfate groups during the impregnation process. The strong bands between Ni cations and sulfate group increase sharply the surface area (from 28.6 m2 s−1 for Ni/Al ratio = 1 to 35.4 m2 s−1 for Ni/Al ratio = 1.75) and the activity of the samples, consequently. However, higher amounts of Ni cations (Ni/Al ratio of 2) led to agglomerated particles that were detected on the surface which filled the porosities. It can cause to reduce the surface area and activity of SO4/Ni-NiAl2O4 nanocatalyst. The sample fabricated by 1.75 times of Ni/Al ratio presented the highest surface area, pore diameter (the most of pores are greater than 8 nm), less roughness and uniform particle size that converted more than 95% of oleic acid to ester at the conditions of 120 °C, 9 molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid, 3 wt% of catalyst and 4 h of reaction time. It was also remained active for four uses and was successfully regenerated after deactivation by re-loading the sulfate group. © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - In this paper, the accelerated degradation and oxidation of Jatropha biodiesel were carried out at 110 °C through the Rancimat method. The applicability of surface tension and UV absorbance in the fuel oxidation degree detection was studied through Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer(GC-MS) and acid value titration. The analysis of experimental data demonstrated that the acid value, surface tension and density of Jatropha biodiesel increased by 551%, 3.8% and 0.91% following oxidation, respectively, while the UV absorption intensity at 230 nm increased nearly 2 times. Subsequently to oxidation, the correlations among surface tension, UV absorbance and acid value of Jatropha biodiesel were 0.9743 and 0.9702. Based on this fact, four prediction models for the degree prediction of fuel oxidation through surface tension and UV absorbance were proposed, while the cross-validation method was utilized. The test analysis finally determined that the two models were Logarithm model and Power model, while the RMESP and R values were 0.093, 0.9875, 0.0705 and 0.9928. Both the accuracy and correlation were high. The acid value prediction model based on surface tension was 7.8%, while the acid value prediction model based on UV absorbance was 3.8%. Both could accurately determine the oxidation degree of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report here alumina-substituted Keggin tungstoborate/kaolin clay composite materials (KAB/kaolin) as polyethylene cracking catalysts. KAB/kaolin composites with varying concentrations of KAB (10–50 wt.%) were synthesized by the wet impregnation method and successfully characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, thermo-gravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analytical techniques. Use of KAB loaded kaolin composites as the catalyst for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) cracking exhibited a higher percentage of polymer conversion (99%), producing 84 wt.% of fuel oil and negligible amount (˂ 1 wt.%) of solid residue while thermal cracking produced ~22 wt.% residue. Furthermore, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of oil obtained by non-catalytic cracking exhibited a high selectivity to high molecular weight hydrocarbons (C13–C23) compared to the catalytic cracking where 70 mol.% of gasoline range hydrocarbons (C5–C12) were produced. We propose that higher cracking ability of our prepared catalysts might ensue from both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (from KAB and kaolin respectively), which enhanced the yield of liquid fuel products and reduced the cracking temperature of LDPE. These findings suggest that the prepared composites were cost-effective and excellent cracking catalysts that could be recommended for highly efficient conversion of waste plastic materials to petrochemicals at an industrial scale. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Synthesis of a highly ordered mesoporous acid- as well as metal-functionalized carbon (-SO3H/C-Si-Zr) material is achieved for the first time from a simple single-pot template-free carbonization of low-value bio-derived glycerol. Addition of TEOS to glycerol right before the carbonization was observed to facilitate molecular-level interactions between them to establish C-Si bonding, which eventually leads to the formation of a high surface area mesoporous -SO3H/C-Si composite material. Unlike this, the addition of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O to glycerol could not have such an effect, but when Zr is used in the presence of TEOS the mixture could successfully produce the -SO3H/C-Si-Zr composite possessing mesoporosity and uniform acidity suitable for bulky tri-acetin production useful for fuel applications. Here TEOS is observed to play two roles, (1) as a surface area and porosity improver of graphitic carbon by its C-Si interaction and (2) as a mediator to involve Zr in the carbon composite structure through its Si-OH group. Thus, the combined inclusion of Zr and Si sources in the glycerol-derived carbon structure could successfully introduce the positive aspects of porosity improvement (by Si) and acidity improvement (by zirconia) in the mixed composite -SO3H/C-Si-Zr to produce the highest ever selectivity of tri-acetin (∼94 wt%) from the same low-value bio-derived glycerol by an acetylation reaction. The sustainability of the process lies in the utilization of waste glycerol as a source of the carbon composite, which in turn catalyzes selective low-value glycerol conversion to industrially important fuel additives. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Efficient cellulose depolymerization is a major bottleneck for economical production of second-generation biofuels. In this work, crystalline cellulose was subjected to sequential ball milling and ethanolysis as a mild and selective depolymerization approach. Ball milling and ethanolysis resulted in 38±1 % cellulose conversion, with 24 % ethyl-glucopyranoside as the main identified and quantified product and negligible side reaction of the ethanol solvent to form diethyl ether. In comparison, ethanolysis of the original cellulose resulted in only 3±1 % conversion. Additional soluble products from cellulose ethanolysis included carbohydrate isomers and oligomers, differing from the products obtained from hydrolysis. X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed increased crystallinity post-reaction, retarding further depolymerization. Hot liquid water extracted soluble oligomers from the ethanolyzed cellulose, suggesting formation of a nanoscale barrier of crystalline cellulose that traps soluble products during ethanolysis. Use of cellulose-swelling co-solvents and repeated mechanical decrystallization both proved effective at increasing cellulose conversion and soluble product yields. Repeated ball milling and ethanolysis resulted in 62±1 % cellulose conversion. Ethanolysis of decrystallized cellulose has potential for rapid (<2 h) de-polymerization at mild conditions. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - 5-Ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) is a new type of biofuel with a high energy density and excellent fuel properties. One-pot production of EMF from renewable carbohydrate catalyzed by heterogeneous catalysts has the potential to be an attractive reaction pathway. In this study, fructose was directly converted to EMF in ethanol medium catalyzed by ultra stable Y zeolite (USY). The effects of different reaction conditions on EMF yields were investigated, and an optimum reaction condition was obtained by utilizing response surface methodology. Under the optimum reaction conditions, which were a temperature of 132 °C, substrate density of 60 g/L, and catalyst dosage of 2.1 wt%, a maximum EMF yield of 73.8 mol% with the prediction error of 1.6% was achieved in 25 min. Moreover, the reusability of USY and characterization were evaluated. This study demonstrated a promising strategy for EMF production from fructose. © 2020, North Carolina State University.

AB  - The economical production of biodiesel from lignocellulose requires an effective co-fermentation of lignocellulose-derived sugars, such as glucose and xylose. Our present work discovered thatLipomyces starkeyiAS 2.1560 could produce microbial lipid effectively from co-fermentation of glucose and xylose in a two-stage culture mode under non-sterile conditions. High lipid production was achieved by a feed-batch fermentation process without sterility in the second fermentation stage. After incubation for 46 h in a bioreactor utilizing unsterile glucose and xylose solution, the cell biomass, lipid and lipid content reached 98.3 g L-1, 62.7 g L-1and 63.8%, respectively. The results showed that the two-stage fermentation method should be a promising process to produce lipid from lignocellulose hydrolysates. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - This work is focused on the process system modelling of an indirectly heated gasifier (10 MWth) using torrefied wood as feedstock and its integration with methanol and power production using Aspen Plus®. The modelling of the gasification process along with the obtained reaction kinetics were validated with experimental data found in literature. Different processing steps such as gasification, gas cleaning and upgrading, methanol synthesis and energy conversion, were modelled and their performance was optimized through a series of sensitivity studies. The results obtained were then used to investigate the effect of different technologies and the variation of operational parameters on the overall process performance. Three cases were examined: “syngas production” (case 1), “methanol production” (case 2), and “power production” (IGCC) (case 3). Case 1 and case 2 were simulated using sand and dolomite as bed materials respectively, in order to study the incorporation of Absorption Enhanced Reforming (AER) on the syngas and methanol production efficiency. For case 3 the simulation was performed for two different configurations: a conventional Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and an innovative Inverted Brayton Cycle (IBC) turbine system. Dolomite was used as the bed material for both configurations. For case 1, an increase of 5% in hydrogen yield in the product gas when AER is applied was observed. For case 2, higer values of Cold Gas Efficiency and Net Efficiency (34% and 60% instead of 33% and 55%, respectively) and a slightly lower value of Carbon Conversion (96% instead of 100%) were obtained when AER was employed. Gasification temperature was lowered by 110 °C in this scenario. For case 3, a lower value of Net Efficiency was obtained when IBC was considered (43% instead of 47%), while a value of 60% was obtained for methanol production with AE. Moreover, the results of case 3, showed that the latent heat in the hot syngas is best utilised when IBC is considered. The developed model accurately predicted the composition of the produced gas and the operational conditions of all the identified blocks within the methanol synthesis and power production processes. This way the use of this model as a generic tool to compare the utilization of different technologies on the performance of the overall process was validated. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The aim of this work is to evaluate analytical tools for fast assessment of the catalysts’ ability to conduct a catalytic cracking process with the use of vegetable oils. The practical context of the presented concept relates to the use of cracking reaction products as valuable chemical raw materials. The proposed analytical tools allow for quick assessment of reaction products, indication of the molecular weight range, or the presence of specific functional groups. We want to emphasize that vegetable oils can not only be raw products for biofuels but also an alternative to petrochemicals. The study was undertaken to determine the influence of acid–base properties of catalysts on the rapeseed oil conversion process at 500°C. The effect of these properties on the character of the process and quality of the products obtained was shown to be very high. Basic correlations between the formation of coke, gaseous products and dehydrogenation products, and acid–base parameters of the individual catalysts have been observed. The use of spectroscopic methods (FTIR - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, 1H NMR - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) for fast qualitative analysis of the products is described. © 2020 AOCS

AB  - Desert streams occur in abundance in the mountain regions of the Arabian Peninsula, where massive areas are covered by phototrophic microbial mats. In this study, 11 different phototrophic microbial mats were screened for their carbohydrate and lipid contents and their ability to produce methane, and mats with potential were further used for biofuel production. A maximum bioethanol yield of 0.76 ± 0.1 g/L was obtained by enzymatic saccharification of one mat, which was dominated by the alga Spirogyra, followed by fermentation of the produced sugars using the native Clostridium strain AK-1. A lipid content of 9–18 wt% was measured from the microbial mats. An increase of 4% and 9% was observed, when the mat with the highest lipid content was incubated under 3% salinity and nitrogen deprivation conditions, respectively. Anaerobic digestion of one selected cyanobacterial mat for biomethane production yielded a maximum of 95 mL CH4/g VS (volatile solids) after 49 days. MiSeq analysis revealed that the microbial community of this mat was 99.5% dominated by archaea, mainly belonging to the genera Methanoculleus (56.7%), Methanobacterium (27%) and Methanosarcina (7.6%). Our results demonstrate the potential of using microbial mats from desert streams to produce bioethanol, biodiesel and biomethane. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Alcohols are attractive fuel blendstocks for spark ignition engines due to their high octane values and potentially positive influence on performance and emission. Although methanol, ethanol, and butanol have been widely studied, other biomass-derived alcohols may have similar or better properties. However, it is not feasible to experimentally investigate the fuel potential of every molecule. The goals of this study were to develop a methodology for rapid screening of a fuel property database for mono-alcohols and to identify alcohols with the potential of blending to produce advantaged motor gasolines. A database was developed with 13 fuel properties of all saturated C1-C10 mono-alcohols. A decision framework was used to evaluate alcohols suitable for blending in gasoline for spark ignition engines in two scenarios: low-range (up to 15 vol%) blends and high-range (greater than 40 vol%) blends. The low-range blend cases resulted in the identification of 48 alcohols. In the case of high-range blending, only six alcohols were found to be suitable. This is the first study to systematically evaluate all C1-C10 saturated alcohols for blending with gasoline using relevant fuel properties. A novel aspect of this study is the evaluation of the influence of errors in predicted property values. These scenario screenings focus attention on a smaller number of promising candidate molecules, and the approach could be modified for other classes of fuel molecules, engine types, and fuel blending goals. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Towards the aim of developing implantable and fully biodegradable sensors and biofuel cells, 2D nanosheets of hematite have been exfoliated and processed into electrode materials for glucose sensing. Gold, (Au) nanoparticles were electrodeposited onto the 2D substrate to develop a sensitive non-enzymatic glucose sensor. Despite a low loading of a catalyst, the composite achieved a sensitivity of 10 μA mM-1 cm-2, good linearity (0-3.2 mM) with a detection limit of 0.4 mM, a response time of less than 10 s, and long-term performance stability. These results make Au/Fe2O3 hematene nanosheet, a promising catalytic material not only for glucose monitoring but also from which to construct biofuel cells using glucose as fuel. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Energy demand by mankind has become one of the most important aspects of our society. A promising technology that seeks to provide part of the energy demand and to obtain high-value products is the thermochemical conversion of microalgae biomass. Inorganic species presented in microalgae biomass may act as catalysts for thermochemical reactions and are responsible for notorious ash-related issues during thermochemical decomposition. Results: In this study, the freeze-dried biomass of Scenedesmus sp. was used to evaluate the lipid extraction methodology regarding a sonication bath as pretreatment technique for cell disruption followed by vortex mixing and n-hexane as solvent. It is also presented the lipid and amino acid profiles for Scenedesmus sp. The freeze-dried biomass was pyrolysed through a TGA (thermogravimetric analysis), with heating rates of 20 °C/min, from 100 to 650 °C. The ash and sulfated ash contents were accurately determined by combustion of biomass in a muffle furnace. The element component of ashes of the freeze-dried, defatted, pyrolysed and sulfated biomasses was determined by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) fitted with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The lipid content obtained for Scenedesmus sp. dry biomass was 16.72% (± 0.03). The content of the sulfated ash obtained was 17.81 ± 0.15%. The SEM-EDS technique identified different mineral compounds in ashes, allowing to quantify Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Fe, Co and Br, as well as oxides. Conclusion: The results suggest a possible strategy to evaluate in a semi-quantitative manner the ash composition of freeze-dryed, defatted, sulfated and pyrolysed biomass of Scenedesmus sp. and its feasibility in using Scenedesmus sp. biomass in different thermochemical conversion strategies to achieve processes with positive energy ratio, representing potential use both environmental and energetically. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) extraction was applied on a raw biocrude, obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction of pinewood. The extractions were carried out in a semicontinuous mode, in the ranges of 80 to 150 °C and 330 to 450 bar. Extraction yields from 44 to 53 wt % were achieved. The extracts were richer in lower-molecular-weight (MW) compounds, with fatty acids and aromatic hydrocarbons concentrated up to 14 and 24 wt %, respectively. For comparable MWs, lower-polarity compounds concentrated in the extracts. Compared to the feed, the extracts exhibited a lower density (from 1030 kg/m3 down to 914 kg/m3), lower water content (from 5.7 wt % down to 1.3 wt %), and lower oxygen content (from 10.0 wt % down to 5.0 wt %). In addition, the metal content was drastically reduced (from 8500 mg/kg down to 170 mg/kg on average). In the context of biofuel production, the sCO2 extracts are a better feed for catalytic hydrotreating. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

The results show that CoFe2O4 MNP’s was dispersed on NaP Zeolite without any significant aggregation with particle size about 30–50 nm. The BET and TEM confirmed the presence of mesoporous phase in the surface of NaP Zeolite/CoFe2O4 and preparation a micro–meso-structure. The NaP Zeolite/CoFe2O4 and NaP Zeolite/CoFe2O4/Am-Py were used as acid–base catalysts for aldol condensation of cyclohexanone with benzaldehyde, and furfural with acetone which produce curcumin and biofuel intermediates, respectively, in solvent-free condition. The effect of different factors such as the percent of CoFe2O4 MNP’s, catalyst amount, solvent, time and temperature was investigated. The catalyst was easily separated with an external magnet and reused four times without significant change in the yield. These catalysts have various advantages including high loading capacity, low leaching for CoFe2O4 MNP’s and simple and efficient recovery procedure which can be used under mild and ecofriendly condition. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The rapid growth of industrialisation has resulted in an ever-increasing demand for energy, with fossil fuels being an essential source of fuel for vehicles in the transport sector of countries. The world fossil fuel reserve is fast depleting, and also, it dissipates unhealthy emissions, this, has led to researches to seek sustainable alternatives in biofuels production. The authors experimented with the production of biodiesel from refined, bleached and deodorized palm olein (RBD) extracted from unrefined palm oil (UPO). Despite being considered as a feasible biodiesel feedstock, scanty reports had been found on the processing of biodiesel from palm olein compared to other oils from the palm tree. The transesterification of RBD palm olein with methanol and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst yielded biodiesel with an average yield greater than 50% in this experimental work. The derived biodiesel has a density of 0.884 g/ml and a flashpoint of 208°C, which is equivalent to ASTM D975 for biodiesel fuels. This result has proven this technique viable and will serve as a reference for continuous research on the biofuel production process. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - Following the COP21 conference in Paris, most of the world's industrialized countries, as well as emerging markets, pledged to reduce or stabilize their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in light of increasing concerns regarding climate change [1]. The necessity to decrease GHG emissions will have implications on the consumption patterns of different types of energies around the world. Apart from the obvious need to replace part of the increasing fossil fuel consumption in transportation (including road, rail, air and sea), there is a growing demand in other sectors as well, such as for electricity produc¬ tion, heating and cooling. Many opportunities are being investigated to address some of the issues related to this green energy transition, including the increased harnessing of alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and biomass. Despite varying potential for each of the mentioned energy sources to help replace or supplement fossil fuels, only biomass currently has the potential to address most of these needs without requiring significant changes to existing energy distribution networks. For example, biomass can be burnt to generate combined heat and power, but it can also be used as a source of carbon to produce biofuels. In the latter case, biofuels such as ethanol could be blended into the existing fuel pool as well as distributed and utilized in engines without requiring significant modifications to the existing chain of distribution. This adaptiveness is not necessarily the case when considering electric vehicles (Ev), although they are also of crucial importance towards collectively reducing GHG emissions. This manuscript will review the Biorefinery Done Right-concept, developed by the company ReSolve Energie in close collaboration with the Biomass Technology Laboratory. This simple feedstock-agnostic technology allows conversion of any type of residual biomass (including but not limited to softwood bark) to three-types of biofuels. The first objective is to take advantage of the carbohydrate content in the biomass through hydrolysis of the constitutive hemicellulose and cellulose. The fermentable sugars are then converted to ethanol, achieved without any constraints, since the ReSolve process generates a hydrolysate with very low inhibitor levels. The lignin recovered from the process is essentially unmodified lignin and after washing, it is pelletized. Pellets, containing the most energetic components of the lignocellulosic biomass, can provide up to 26 GJ/tonne. Finally, the non-fermentable sugars (C5), as well as the lignin that does not comply with Grade A lignin characteristics, are predigested for utiliza¬ tion in a classical biomethanation system. Hence, through this approach, 100% of the carbon from the biomass is converted into commercial products, which at this point are all related to the energy market. © 2020 WIT Press

AB  - In the present study, bio-oil produced from vacuum pyrolysis of woody biomass has been investigated as a source of chemical feedstock. Bio-based resins were produced using the bio-oil with phenol substitutions ranging from 10 to 30 wt%. The conventional GC/MS analysis was carried out for the evaluation of the chemical composition of bio-oil. TGA, DSC and FT-IR analyses were used in order to characterize the bio-oil-phenol-formaldehyde (BPF) resins. The bonding quality of wood samples bonded with the BPF resins was investigated under different pre-treatment conditions. The highest shear strength was observed for the control samples bonded with the laboratory PF resin. As the amount of bio-oil was increased up to 30 wt%, the shear strength of the samples decreased from 12.08 to 11.76 N/mm2. The bonding performance was not negatively affected by the combination of bio-oil under dry conditions. According to TS EN 12765 standard, the relevant performance requirements for bonded samples under dry conditions must be at least 10 N/mm2. Relating to the standard, all samples bonded with BPF resins obtained the requirements for durability class C1. Under wet conditions, the bonding performance was negatively affected by the addition of bio-oil. However, the BPF resins fulfilled the durability requirements for C1, C2, and C3 specified in EN 12765 (2002). © 2020 by the author(s).

AB  - Methyl esterification of free fatty acids with reduced energy intensity under ambient conditions is challenging. This paper presents an environmental friendly electrochemical approach for the methyl esterification of free fatty acids to fatty acid methyl esters with a cell voltage at 1.52 V over boron-doped diamond. The effects of supporting electrolyte and alkyl chain length of free fatty acids on the performances of the electrocatalytic methyl esterification are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer, and high-performance liquid chromatography. A reasonable mechanism of the electrocatalytic methyl esterification method has also been proposed. Moreover, using the as-developed method, free fatty acids mixture of microalgae (Schizochytrium limacinum) oil is transformed into their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters. Fatty acid methyl esters are obtained at near-quantitative liquid selectivity at 1.52 V V for 1 h with the addition of 16.7 wt.% KOH. This work not only provides an alternative low-cost strategy for methyl esterification, but also an approach to transfer intermittent renewable sourced electricity energy and biomass into valuable chemicals and fuels. © 2020

AB  - The aim of this study is to present the optimum operating conditions for reducing energy consumption in the process of obtaining bio-oil from the mixture of sawdust, waste lubricating oil, lime, and commercial catalyst. In the study where the catalytic pressureless depolymerisation (also called Katalytische Drucklose Verölung – KDV) was applied, the operating conditions were analysed with response surface methodology. According to the analysis of variance results, a mathematical model was obtained for specific product yield (bio-oil amount/energy consumption g kWe −1). Effects of temperature (260°C–290°C), catalyst rate (1–2 wt.%) and reaction time (0.5–1 h) were investigated. The optimum conditions for the three independent variables (temperature, catalyst rate, reaction time) were 279 ± 2°C, 2 wt.% and 0.5 h, respectively. Maximum specific product yield was obtained as 970.17 g kWe −1. While the reaction time was the most effective regarding the amount of bio-oil obtained at 1 kWe energy consumption, the temperature was found to be the least effective. In addition to these, bio-oil obtained under optimum conditions were characterised and compared with standard diesel specifications. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Production of chemicals from microalgae is a substantial way to contribute to the economic viability of a biorefinery. In this research, we report a new and green method for producing acetic acid from microalgae directly or from its waste residue after biofuel extraction using copper (II) oxide (CuO) as a solid oxidant. Results show that the CuO can significantly facilitate the oxidation of microalgae and its waste residue into acetic acid with the simultaneous reduction of CuO to Cu and Cu2O. The maximum acetic acid yield reached up to 35 % and 31 % from the microalgae and its waste residue, respectively, which are much higher than previous report (14.9 %) which is obtained with traditional liquid oxidants such as H2O2. The reduction of CuO to Cu(0) at a relatively low temperature (300 °C) offered an additional benefit of developing a sustainable method in copper metallurgy at mild conditions. © 2019

AB  - Hemin, an iron porphyrin, was used as a model compound to study the fate of iron during hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Hemin decomposed hydrothermally and produced an oil-phase with appreciable iron content only at temperatures exceeding 250 °C. Both the temperature of and the time in the hydrothermal environment affect the iron concentration in the oil from hemin HTL, with severe conditions leading to lower iron concentrations. Catalysts (Ni/Al2O3-SiO2) and solvents (MTBE) that were effective in algal HTL biocrude demetallation also reduced iron concentrations in oil from hemin HTL. Iron porphyrinic species were identified in the oil from hemin HTL. They were much less prevalent when a Ni/Al2O3-SiO2 catalyst was also used, which points to the effectiveness of catalytic HTL for demetallation of the oil. In addition, there were many species in the oil products with two nitrogen atoms, which formed from hemin decomposition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Controllable functionalization of targeted oxygen-containing species of biomass feedstocks is one of the prevalent approaches to biofuels and important chemicals, and well-designed functional catalytic materials are typically required to promote the smooth proceeding of the desired conversion processes. In this work, HCOONH4 was demonstrated to be capable of acting as both hydrogen and nitrogen source in the absence of any catalyst and additive for the reductive cycloamination of bio-based levulinic acid (LA) to 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (MPL) with more than 90 % in just 60 min at 180 °C. Pressurized hot water remarkably enabled the reaction efficiency and rate by promoting the hydrolysis of HCOONH4 to liberate ammonia and formic acid for the cascade reactions, and this catalyst-free protocol is also applicable to the efficient synthesis of various cyclic amides from relevant keto acids. Moreover, the reaction pathways were investigated by conducting deuterium-labeling experiments and kinetic studies of selected reactions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Solketal is a promising oxygenate additive that can be chemically derived from bioglycerol. Emulsification by a microwave-irradiating method was used to prepare the micro- and nanoemulsions of solketal dispersed in continuous ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) due to the immiscibility of solketal with ULSD. The emissions from a direct-injection, four-stroke and naturally aspirated diesel engine fueled with each of these emulsions, and with neat ULSD, were analyzed and compared. The experimental results show that the nanoemulsion and microemulsions were successfully produced. In addition, an increasing engine speed resulted in lower NOx, CO and O2 but higher CO2 emissions. The nanoemulsion was found to produce the lowest NOx emission while neat ULSD produced the highest NOx emission among these three test fuels. The lowest CO emission was formed by fueling the micro-emulsion of dispersed solketal-in-ULSD. Moreover, the burning of the nanoemulsion in the diesel engine formed the highest CO2 along with the lowest O2 emissions. Hence, the nanoemulsion had the highest burning efficiency among the three test fuels for the diesel engine. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The low-temperature oxidation (LTO) mechanisms of the 2-methylfuran (2-MF) biofuel and the corresponding thermodynamic and kinetic properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and composite G4 methodologies as well as kinetic simulations. The O2 addition to the main furylCH2 radical from the methyl dehydrogenation in 2-MF forms three peroxide radicals PO1, PO2, and PO3 with the energy barriers of 15.1, 19.3, and 20.6 kcal mol-1 and the reaction ΔG of -8.2, 5.7, and -0.1 kcal mol-1 (298 K and 1 atm), respectively. Through hydrogen transfer followed by dehydroxylation, these nascent products evolve into stable aldehydes and cyclic ketones, which may further decompose into smaller species under the action of OH. Calculations and simulations show that the product P1 from the dehydroxylation of PO1 has a dominant population (higher than 96%) among the final products, although the temperature and pressure may influence the species profiles and rate constants to some extent. Based on the G4-calibrated thermodynamic parameters, the temperature and pressure dependence of the rate constants and the two- and three-parameter Arrhenius coefficients for all reactions considered here have been determined by using the transition state theory (TST) and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) methods. The present results provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of the LTO process of the 2-MF biofuel. This journal is © the Owner Societies.

AB  - The hydrochloric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment of brown seaweed residues (Laminaria japonica) was optimized with respect to three operating factors: temperature, time, and the concentration of HCl, using response surface methodology (RSM). In order to confirm the significance of the quadratic model, an analysis of variance was performed, which resulted in an F-value of 11.09. Therefore, the regression model was highly significant. Additionally, the pareto chart was used to contrast the absolute values of the standardized effects. Response surface and contour plots were used to illustrate a surface with a maximum. The perturbation plot showed the sensitivity of the reducing sugars yield to the independent factors. Under the reaction conditions of 142 °C, 9 °C, 18.6 min, and 0.1 N HCl concentration, the experimental yield of 113.0 mg/g and the predicted yield of 107.5 mg/g were obtained. © 2020 North Carolina State University.

AB  - The negative impacts of fossil fuel on the environment should be replaced by clean and sustainable energy sources worldwide. Therefore, the use of biodiesel as a clean energy source is crucial. Biodiesel is produced from various natural resources through a transesterification process. Considering the importance of this topic, this study focuses on the assessment of oil properties of Thymelaea hirsuta and Echinops spinosus as primary sources for biodiesel production. The two investigated plants were collected from the Western Desert of Egypt. The results showed that the lignocellulosic content was about 57.3 and 79.8 g/100 g in E. spinosus and 59.1 and 82.8 g/100 g in T. hirsuta, respectively. The two investigated samples showed variable lipid contents (30.2-76.1%). The GC-MS fatty acid profile characterized seven FAs in E. spinosus and twelf FAs in T. hirsuta. The greatest CN was calculated in T. hirsuta (379.2) compared to the lowest in E. spinosus (229.9). Furthermore, the values of saponification number (SN) were 27.9 in E. spinosus and 16.07 in T. hirsuta. The value of higher heating value (HHV) was about 47.5 MJ/kg in E. spinosus and 48.3 MJ/kg in T. hirsuta. Meanwhile, T. hirsuta exhibited a higher induction period (IP) value (19.3 h) comparable to that of E. spinosus (4.3 h). The results revealed that both plants are potential sources for biodiesel production according to various international standards for biodiesel production, and this work appears to be one of the first reports regarding such wild xerophytic plants as promising new primary sources for biodiesel production in Egypt. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - To further develop the second-generation biofuel industry, both government and business sectors need to better comprehend the full costs of buying crop straws from farmers – understanding transportation and baling costs alone is insufficient. Due to the limited market activity of crop straws, this paper uses the contingent valuation method to elicit farmers' willingness-to-accept (WTA) price to sell their crop straws in northeast China. The results from finite mixed models showed that the estimated WTA for maize straw was 9.6 yuan/ton, 43.2 yuan/ton and 83.2 yuan/ton across different farm groups. For rice straw, the WTA for the first farm group was 51 yuan/ton and 204 yuan/ton for the second group. Our results also show that both rice and maize farmers place a higher price on crop straw if it is used in more productive ways, such as for domestic fuel, animal feed or selling; but place a lower price when it is burnt as crop residue in the field. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: In the search of hydrocarbon fuels derived from biomass, the increase in the chain length with the elimination of oxygenated species is a hard task. The simultaneous conversion of furfural and cyclopentanone to fuel range hydrocarbons has been investigated on a series of solid base catalysts. Furfural represents the family of sugars, typically obtained from the hemicellulose biomass fraction by different catalytic routes. Cyclopentanone can be readily obtained from the catalytic conversion of furfural via Piancatelli ring-rearrangement under reducing conditions. Aimed to enlarge the carbon chain length of these oxygenates, the aldol-condensation reaction between furfural and cyclopenanone was studied over MgAl mixed oxides, among which the MgAl-3 mixed oxide exhibited the best catalytic activity to produce C10–C14 oxygenates, a suitable range for transportation fuel precursors (C7–C15). After this C–C coupling reaction, the large oxygenates were successfully upgraded via hydrodeoxygenation on carbon-supported Ru and Pd nanoparticles to produce a mixture of linear alkanes and saturated cyclic hydrocarbons, which in practice would be direct drop-in components for transportation fuels. As an illustration of the potential implementation of this strategy for biofuel production, palm oil empty fruit bunches were experimentally evaluated using different acid pretreatments to extract the furfural, which was further employed to perform the aldol-condensation reactions. It was found that the proposed catalytic strategy is an environmentally-friendly route to add value to the palm oil industry wastes by producing value-added chemicals and fuel precursors.

AB  - The hydrothermal liquefaction of municipal sludge was investigated under isothermal conditions (255 °C, 45 min) with TiO2 as a catalyst. In this study, we used two separation methods (an organic solvent-assisted extraction method and the Soxhlet extraction method) for the production of bio-crude oil. The maximum yield of bio-crude oil was 20.7 wt. % reported with the Soxhlet extraction method. The aqueous phase was examined for TN, TP, COD, and TOC to determine the suitability of this phase for microalgae cultivation. Four strains of oleaginous microalgae were cultivated in the aqueous phase. The results show that the growth of microalgae in the aqueous phase was lower compared to the control medium; this may be due to the high COD value. Microalgae and yeast co-cultivation increases biomass and lipid productivity using nutrients in the aqueous phase. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sewage sludge is a very harmful waste when improperly discharged into the environment because of its inherent abundant pathogens, organic pollutants, and heavy metal constituents. The pyrolysis of sewage sludge is viewed not only to reduce pollutants associated with it but also one of the viable alternative sources for renewable energy or biofuel production. In this study, the effect of catalyst and temperature on the yield and composition of bio-oil obtained from the catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of desludging sewage samples (DSS) was investigated. Modified pyrolysis reactor was used to pyrolyze the DSS at temperature ranges of 300–400, 400–500, 500–600 and 600–700 ℃ with and without the use of zeolite-Y catalyst. The ‘heterogeneous’ catalysis reaction yielded 20.9 wt% bio-oil, while the reaction without catalyst yielded 18.2 wt% bio-oil. Pyrolysis of the DSS favored char yield of between 55.4 and 76.6 wt%. The X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis showed high silica (46 and 56.1 wt%), calcium (20.9 and 15.50 wt%), and low organic matter (12 and 12.87 wt%) contents present in the desludging feedstock before and after pyrolysis respectively. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis indicated the presence of nitrogen-containing compounds (between 20 and 50 wt%), mono-aromatics (18 and 28 wt%) and oxygenated compounds, in the form of carboxylic acids, aliphatics, ketones, ethers, esters and aldehydes in the bio-oils. Pyrolysis process development is, therefore, essential to clean the environment of pollutants from sewage sludge, by its conversion to more useful chemicals. Incontrast, sewage sludge with high silica content may be tailored to the production of building materials. © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - The saccharification of cellulosic biomass to produce biofuels and chemicals is one of the most promising industries for green-power production and sustainable development. Cellulase is the core component in the saccharification process. Simple and efficient assay method to determine cellulase activity in saccharification is thus highly required. In this work, a boronate-affinity surface based renewable and ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor for cellulase activity determination has been fabricated. Through boronate-sugar interaction, celluloses are attached to the electrode surface, forming the cellulose nano-network at the sensing interface. Cellulase degradation can lead to the variation of electrochemical impedance. Thus, electrochemical impedance signal can reflect the cellulase activity. Importantly, via fully utilizing the boronate-affinity chemistry that enables reversible fabrication of cellulose nano-network, a renewable sensing surface has been firstly constructed for cellulase activity assay. Thanks to interfacial diffusion process of electrochemical sensor, the product inhibitory effect in the cellulase activity assays can be circumvented. The proposed electrochemical sensor is ultrasensitive for label-free cellulase activity detection with a very simple fabrication process, showing great potential for activity screen of new enzymes in saccharification conversion. © 2020

AB  - Biofuels are one of the largest sources of renewable and sustainable energy, which are made from organic matter or wastes. One of the main biofuels type are the biofuels that is derived from vegetable oils. Nowadays, biofuels are drawing more attention to global scientists because of the scarcity of mineral oil supplies. The primary objective of this analysis is to explore the influence of variability in ambient temperature on the ignition delay period and emission. The type of biodiesel fuel used is the Jatropha Biodiesel with three different blending ratio, which are J40, J30 and J40. The ambient temperature of constant volume chamber (CVC) Ti,cvc and combustion chamber (CC), Ti,cc, was varied from 750 K, 850 K, 950 K and 1100 K. In the form of the hydrocarbon (HC) pollution criterion, nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon oxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), the emission was studied. While the ignition delay was also studied with biodiesel blending ratio variation. The blending ratio of the biodiesel used were from 20% until 40%. The biodiesel used were algae, Jatropha and waste cooking oil. The finding reveals that the higher value of the ambient temperature mixture induces shorter ignition delay when the CVC and CC are coupled at different ambient temperatures. The emissions data obtained shows that the CO and HC component is lowered while the ambient temperature is higher but the volume of NOx rises. In the future, biofuels can be inferred as excellent fuel alternatives to replace diesel. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - India is the world's third largest consumer of energy. India's energy consumption consists of 44% coal, biomass and waste 24%, petroleum and other liquids 23% and other renewable sources such as wind, solar, nuclear and biofuels. Due to the shortage of diesel and increasing prices, biodiesel gained its importance as an alternate to the petroleum based fuels. This paper deals with the transesterification of waste cooking oil to biodiesel with copper doped zinc oxide nanocatalyst under varying parameters such as oil to methanol ratio (1:2-1:5 mol), catalyst loading (2-8% w/w), reaction time (30-60 minutes) and temperature (40-70°C). Results show that the maximum yield of about 97.7% was obtained at optimum reaction conditions. This result is further validated. The economic analysis of biodiesel production is carried out and the cost of biodiesel per litre works out to be 68 rupees INR ($0.99). © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - 2-Methylfuran (MF) is a candidate to be a high-quality fuel additive. For the first time, efficient Co-Cu/ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by the sol-gel method and herein used for MF synthesis from furfural. Although a 9.2% MF yield and no MF was obtained using Cu/ZrO2 and Co/ZrO2, respectively, a 77.5% MF yield was observed at 200°C, under 1.5 MPa initial H2 pressure for 4 hours using a Co-Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. The Co amount was changed in the catalyst structure and the effect of the Co amount on furfural hydrogenation was investigated. The most effective catalyst was the Co-Cu/ZrO2 catalyst, with 0.08 g/g (8 mass%) Cu and 0.118 g/g (11.8 mass%) Co. The activity tests of the catalysts were carried out for hydrogenation of furfural to MF by changing reaction parameters such as pressure, loading of catalyst, temperature, and time. A 94.1% MF yield was achieved in the presence of the Co-Cu/ZrO2 catalyst with 0.08 g/g (8 mass%) Cu and 0.118 g/g (11.8 mass%) Co at 200°C for 6 hours under 1.5 MPa H2 pressure. The catalyst also showed good reusability properties after the fifth use. The catalysts were characterized by Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction techniques. © 2020 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering

AB  - Enzymes as industrial biocatalysts offer numerous advantages over traditional chemical processes resulting on improvements in process economy and environmental sustainability. Because enzymes are extensively used in different industrial areas, the enzyme kinetics is an important factor for industry as it is able to estimate the extent of substrate conversion under known conditions and evaluate reactor performance. Furthermore, kinetic modelling is useful in the analysis, prediction, and optimization of an enzymatic process. Thus, kinetic modelling is a powerful tool for biochemical reaction engineering. In addition to the aforementioned, in the industrial technology, modelling together with simulation play a key role because they help to understand how a system behaves under specific conditions, and thus they allow saving on costs and lead times. Enzymatic conversion of renewable cellulosic biomass into biofuels is at the heart of advanced bioethanol production. In the production of bioethanol from cellulosic biomass, enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to fermentable sugars accounts for a large portion (∼30%) of the total production costs. Therefore, a thorough understanding of enzymatic hydrolysis is necessary to create a robust model which helps designing optimal conditions and economical system. Nevertheless, it is a challenging task because cellulose is a highly complex substrate and its enzymatic hydrolysis is heterogeneous in nature, and thus the whole process of cellulose conversion to glucose involves more steps than classical enzyme kinetics. This chapter describes the bases of enzyme kinetic modelling, focussing on Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and presents the models classification based on the fundamental approach and methodology used. Furthermore, the modelling of cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis is described, also reviewing some model examples developed for cellulose hydrolysis over the years. Finally, the application of enzyme kinetics modelling in food, pharmaceutical and bioethanol industry is presented. © 2020 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this research work, analytical, experimental methods and monitoring techniques of bio-hydrogenated kerosene (BHK) production in continuous mode were presented. Two kinds of raw materials obtained from palm processing plant named as refined bleached deodorised palm oil (RPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) were converted into BHK via hydrocracking reaction catalysed by Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in pilot scale. Firstly, both of RPO and PKO were pretreated by thermal technique. Subsequently, fatty acid compositions of palm oils were analysed by Gas Chromatography (GC). Then, hydrocracking reaction of RPO and PKO were separately conducted in continuous high pressure packed bed reactor (HPPBR). After reaction, crude-biofuel was refined into BHK via fractional distillation. In addition, some properties of BHK obtained from RPO/PKO such as were C, H, O elements, freezing point, flash points, total acid number and carbon distribution were analysed following the ASTM and UOP 915 standards. • Thermal pretreatment of refined bleached deoderised palm oil (RPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). • Continuous hydrocracking reaction of palm oil was conducted in pilot scale. • Characterisation of bio-hydrogenated kerosene obtained from palm oil. © 2020

AB  - Nigella sativa is one such plant species indigenous to Middle-east, Eastern Europe, and the Asian Subcontinent. Black cumin seeds derived from N. sativa are one of the identified biomasses to produce biodiesels for the use in an unmodified CI engine. The current study aims to evaluate the credibility of Nigella sativa methyl ester (NSME) as a suitable blend alongside mineral diesel in a common rail direct Injection engine via fundamental combustion analysis. In the present work, 20% of Nigella sativa methyl ester has been tested in diesel engine at 600 bar injection pressure under different pilot and main injection forms. The pilot injection mass has been varied from 5–15% along with variation in main injection also. An optimized injection strategy has been found with respect to performance and emissions for effective implementation of EGR at 10% and 20% rate. At 5% pilot injection, the NSME20 fuel showed comparable brake thermal efficiency and brake-specific fuel consumption at all engine loads. Furthermore, NOx emission of NSME20 fuel has been reduced by increasing the pilot injection rate when compared to diesel and this has been further reduced with 10–20% exhaust gas recirculation. On the other hand, the combustion characteristics of NSME20 blend also shown similar pattern like diesel fuel with slight reduction in cylinder pressure and heat release rate. Finally, it has been concluded that the newly developed Nigella sativa methyl ester can be used as sustainable biofuel for various energy applications in the present scenario.

AB  - This purpose, zinc and nickel were chosen as the catalytic materials and Calophyllum inophyllum was chosen as the feedstock for biodiesel production. Experimental results proved maximum reduction of hydrocarbon emissions by 14.8%, carbon monoxide emissions by 21.89% and smoke opacity by 13.22% for nickel coated catalytic converter. However, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides emission levels increased by 22% and 5.5%, respectively for nickel coated catalytic converter. On the other hand, zinc coated catalytic converter exhibited an increase of all emission levels except nitrogen oxides. The reduction level of nitrogen oxides with zinc coated catalytic converter was observed as 34.2%. Through this work it is revealed that nickel acts as an oxidative catalytic agent and zinc as the reducing catalyst in the catalytic converter. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, an alternative form of biofuel for the Compression Ignition (CI) Engine is generated from inedible disposable chicken skin and pig tallow. The collected resources are heated up to 80°C to extract fat and subjected to a trans-esterification process to obtain biofuel. The process resulted in 730ml and 950ml of high viscous biofuel from 1000ml of fat from waste chicken skin (WCS) and pig tallow (PT) respectively. The pure biofuels from WCS and PT have 38.07% and 41.68% higher viscous than diesel. The obtained biofuel is blended with diesel at 10, 20, and 30% by volume. The thermal, physical, and chemical properties of blended fuel are determined and found closer to the diesel properties. The engine tests indicate that the brake power of the B30 blend was decreased by 15.78% while the B10 combination produces 11.02% less power as compared to diesel at full load. The efficiency was reduced by 22.15, 7.59 % for B30, and B10 respectively at full load condition. About 3.9% and 34% of reduction in NOx, 22.5%, 27.5% of reduction in HC emission were recorded for respective blends at the same operating condition. This paper emphasizes on deriving value-added products from waste resources and its effective utilization. The findings from work indicate that the derived biofuel could be used in combination with diesel for the adequate partial replacement of diesel in CI engines without any significant alterations. © 2020 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - In this study, biomasses of microalgae Scenedesmus and Synechocystis species were thermochemically converted to biofuel in a fast pyrolysis process. The effect of pyrolysis temperature on the products yield was investigated. The optimal pyrolysis temperature for Scenedesmus and Synechocystis biomass was 500 °C and 600 °C, respectively, resulting in higher bio-oil yield of 35.3 wt% and 21.1 wt%. The produced bio-oil had higher high heating value (HHV) (35–40 MJ/kg) than that of beech wood source bio-oil (23–35 MJ/kg). The obtained biochar had low surface area but with considerable nitrogen, phosphorus, and other mineral content was suggested as fertilizer. It was concluded that the microalgae type and its cultivation and harvesting method affects the characteristics of the products and final energy efficiency as well. Energy efficiency assessment showed that the technology needs to be improved substantially to reduce the energy demand in cultivation, harvest, and pyrolysis step to be energy efficient. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The catalytic activity of Co and Pd loaded on mordenite (MOR) was evaluated in the hydrotreatment of cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) into biofuel. Metals were loaded into MOR as support via wet impregnation process. The Co content was varied as 2, 4, and 6 wt.% to produce Co(1)/MOR, Co(2)/MOR, Co(3)/MOR catalysts. The micro-mesoporous structures of the catalyst were confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR, and N2 adsorption-desorption measurement. AAS were used to analyze the amount of metal that is successfully loaded in the catalysts. Hydrotreating of the CNSL was conducted in a semi-batch reactor at 450 °C with hydrogen flow (20 mL/min) for 2 h. The liquid product was analyzed using GC-MS. The activity of Co/MOR was compared with the activity of Pd/MOR as a noble metal. The result of the hydrotreatment process showed a decrease of liquid product in the sequence of Co(3)/MOR &gt; Co(2)/MOR &gt; Pd/MOR &gt; Co(1)/MOR &gt; MOR. The Co(3)/MOR catalyst exhibited the highest conversion of liquid hydrocarbon than the others (61.8 wt.%), comprising predominantly by gasoline compounds with over 25.21 wt.% conversion. © Maya Tri Hapsari et al.

AB  - Nowadays, the production of liquid motor fuel faces such problems as compliance of the final product with existing international standards (for the content of sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen) as well as the improvement of the feasibility of the existing technologies for fuel production. Biomass is one of the most perspective and widely spread sources for energy. The existing techniques for biomass conversion into the fuels are mainly based on the hydroprocessing and can be successfully applied in petroleum industry. The integrated processes involving both biofuel and oil conversion are of great interest. In this work, the novel hydrogen-free approach for co-processing of heavy oil fractions and bio-oil is described. The use of supercritical solvent mixture, which includes propanol-2 and n-hexane, allows full substrate conversion to be achieved for maximum 3 h. As a result, the hydrocarbon mixture consisting of aromatic and cyclic compounds was obtained with 99 wt. % yield. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Fuel-like hydrocarbons (also known as biofuel) isolated from the deoxygenation of fatty acids present different advantages as compared with fossil fuels. In particular, the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic deoxygenation methods have been the center of attention during recent years. Although catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids via heterogeneous catalysis has been widely investigated, there is a high demand to review the progress in using the homogeneous catalysis pathways. Among the various homogeneous pathways, radical-based reactions and transition metal catalysis demonstrate the most promising results in the decarboxylation and decarbonylation processes. It is shown that radical-based reactions are more active in decarboxylation meanwhile the transition metal catalysts are rather selective to decarbonylation of fatty acids. Besides, the reaction conditions and type of catalysts are capable of enhancing biofuel production. Homogenous catalysis provides the huge potential for commercializing viability of biofuel via deoxygenation of fatty acids. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Non-edible fats are a common renewable feedstock for the biofuels production to avoid partially the use of edible feeds and fossil fuels. The aim of this work was the use of waste rendering fat to produce pyrolyzed and hydrogenated oils. The feedstock was hydrolyzed producing free fatty acids and glycerol + residues. The free fatty acids were pyrolyzed (with and without metal sulfides metal supported catalyst) or hydrotreated separately. An autoclave closed hermetically in nitrogen (pyrolysis) or hydrogen (hydrotreatment) atmosphere was used. Gaseous products were analyzed by GC-FID/TCD. Liquid products were analyzed by Simulated Distillation (ASTM D2887) and FT-IR (attenuated total reflectance technique). For the pyrolysis, the main gaseous products were carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, and propane. For the hydrotreatment, the total amount of gases produced was much lower being the main product the carbon dioxide. For liquids, the hydrotreatment of the free fatty acids produced the respective hydrocarbons by decarboxylation reaction and the pyrolysis produced a mixture of compounds with lighter boiling ranges compared to the original free fatty acids. The use of a metal sulfide metal supported catalyst in the pyrolysis led to a higher amount of hydrogen production. but similar boiling range liquid products compared to the non-catalytic test. © 2020 Atlantis Livros Ltda..

AB  - Green diesel, also known as renewable diesel, is a biofuel obtained from biomass with similar physical properties than petroleum diesel. Renewable diesel is mainly composed by hydrocarbons free of oxygen, which can be blended at high concentrations with petroleum diesel due to their chemical affinity. Density and viscosity are two important physical properties of fuels that play an important role in the processes of atomization and injection in engines. Also, the knowledge of these properties is important for the correct design, operation, and optimization of chemical processes. Despite their importance, there is low information about experimental data and developed models related to the renewable diesel–petroleum diesel blend. To overcome the above limitation, this paper is focused on the study of four blends of renewable diesel and petroleum diesel in order to study the variation of density and kinematic viscosity with respect to the concentration and temperature. In addition, empirical correlations to predict the density and kinematic viscosity as function of temperature and concentration were developed. Density and viscosity of renewable diesel, petroleum diesel, and their blends were simultaneously measured with a densitometer–viscometer device with an uncertainty in density and viscosity of 0.1 kg/m3 and 1 × 10−8 m2/s. The parameters of the developed correlations were adjusted by the Levenberg–Marquardt optimization method. There was a good agreement between the calculated and experimental data because an average absolute deviation (AAD) of 0.07 and 1.66% were obtained for the predictions of density and kinematic viscosity respectively. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Petroleum has been the most consumed energy source in the world, but it tends to run out due its non-renewable character. Among biofuels, biodiesel has emerged as the main candidate to substitute petroleum diesel. The present study aimed to identify the maximum yield point of biodiesel production by generating a response surface using molar ratio, temperature and agitation time as independent variables, and yield as a dependent variable. From the response surface, it is observed that the increase in temperature and reaction time leads to reduced yield. The configuration that resulted in maximum yield of 93.30% was 12:1 molar ratio, 30 °C temperature and 30-minute reaction time. From the chromatographic analysis it was possible to identify five different fatty acids in the composition of the biodiesels. Total saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic acids) ranged from 41.53% to 42.09% and total unsaturated fatty acids including monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids) ranged from 57.92% to 58.48%. According to the results of the physicochemical analyses, the specific mass at 68°F is in agreement with Brazilian, American and European specifications, ranging from 877.46 kg m-3 to 879.64 kg m-3. The kinematic viscosity at 104 °F ranged from 4.49 mm² s-1 to 4.82 mm² s-1. The acid value obtained did not vary within the limits established by the norms, and values between 0.54 and 2.74 mg KOH g-1 were observed. © 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - Algae is a potential third-generation biofuel sources that can be used to produce high quality liquid fuel. The physio-chemical properties of algae depend on the species type, of which can also vary with climate, geography and environmental conditions. In this study, the pyrolysis behaviour of a brown macroalgae, Sargassum polycystum (SP), obtained along the coast of Desaru, Malaysia is characterised using a thermogravimeter. The thermal decomposition of the selected brown algae was carried out at the heating rate of 5, 10, 20 and 40 ∘Cmin-1. A model-fitting method, which includes the most common reaction mechanism in solid-state decomposition processes is being used to predict the kinetic parameters for Sargassum polycystum. The results showed that the Sargassum polycystum macroalgae decomposition process follows the third-order of reaction, F3 with a highest correlation value of 0.94, at 15-70 % of conversion level. The average activation energy from all heating rates is found to be 19.09 kJ/mol with a pre-exponential value of 0.537 s-1. An increase in heating rate results in the increase of activation energy and pre-exponential values. Copyright © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Lignin is one of three components that make up wood, and it is the most recalcitrant among these compounds due to its highly degradation-resistant phenolic polymer structure. Lignin is composed of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, which has the potential to be a feedstock for biofuels and biorefining processes. In this work, lignin was depolymerized to produce succinic and acetic acids via a photocatalytic reaction. TiO2 and H2O2 under UV-light were used as a photocatalyst and photocatalyst promoter, respectively. The effect of TiO2 and H2O2 dosage, solution pH and reaction time on % yield of dicarboxylic acid was determined. Optimization of reaction conditions was done with response surface methodology using a Box-Behnken design. It was found that the maximum %yield of succinic acid (7.8%) was at a reaction time of 24 h, a 2.37 g/l of TiO2 dosage and 25.45 µl of H2O2 dosage and pH 7.0. The predicted dicarboxylic acid yield using was accurate with R2=91.8%. This would be an alternative way to produce high-value fine chemicals from lignin. © 2020, Paulus Editora. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental concerns caused by the constant use of fossil fuels can be solved by the use of biofuels. This work shows the application of the oil of Trichilia emetica Vahl (Mafura) seeds originating from Mozambique as a feedstock for biodiesel production. The high oil acidity required a two-step reaction involving esterification using sulphuric acid (H2SO4) as catalyst followed by for the conversion of Mafura oil to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The acid value was reduced from 27.58 to 0.36 (mg KOH g−1). Other physicochemical properties (moisture content, density, free glycerol) of FAME attended the established limits of EN14214 and Brazilian norms. The low induction-period (IP) was surpassed after the addition of 500 ppm of the synthetic antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) resulting in 10.8 h. The conversion of the feedstock (99.1%wt) was confirmed by gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The fatty-acid methyl ester contents of the Mafura biodiesel presented palmitic acid (39.32%wt), linoleic acid (31.09%wt), oleic acid (25.77%wt), stearic acid (2.29%wt), meristic acid (0.78%wt), linolenic acid (0.61%wt) and lauric acid (0.14%wt). These results show that the biodiesel produced from Mafura oil met most of the quality standards required by American, Brazilian and European regulatory agencies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The attachment of redox metalloenzymes to electroactive surfaces is of great importance for both fundamental and applied studies. Oriented covalent immobilization of a metalloenzyme on the electrode allows for the use of electrochemical methods to study its catalytic mechanism by direct electron transfer. Furthermore, redox metalloenzymes specifically catalyze many reactions of great interest in the energy conversion process, such as H2 production or oxidation, O2 evolution or reaction, and generation of biochemical power within living cells. Therefore, their optimized immobilization on electrodes has potential applications in biofuel cell development, water splitting or CO2 valorization using electrochemical and photoelectrochemical cells, and electroenzymatic systems for cofactor regeneration. This chapter reviews novel strategies developed in recent years for tailoring electrodes with the aim of specific, stable, and oriented binding of redox metalloenzymes. This review is focused on the strategies designed for three different applications: (1) development of efficient oxygen reduction biocathodes; (2) production of hybrid semiconductor and enzyme photoelectrocatalysts; and (3) biomimetic reconstitution of membrane enzymes over electrodes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A fast pyrolysis biofuel, mainly consisting to 98% of ethanol, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, acetone and 2-butanone with mass ratios of 9:6:2:1:1, was catalytically produced from rice husk. A preliminary engine test demonstrated this biofuel has the possibility of being a gasoline blending stock. However, its fundamental burning features are not fully understood. This work presents the experimental investigations of the spherical propagating flame of a surrogate fuel representing the biofuel in a constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC). Tests were conducted at initial pressures of 0.1–0.4 MPa, initial temperatures of 358–418 K, and equivalence ratios of 0.7–1.4. Employing the constant volume method (CVM) allows determining laminar burning speeds (Su) of this surrogate at conditions far beyond the initial conditions (0.1–0.8 MPa, 358–490 K). Power law fitting correlations between Su and pressure were obtained via the constant volume method (CVM). Cellularity appears when pressure or temperature is high, and cellular burning speed was calculated by CVM as well. Su determined via the constant pressure method (CPM) were compared with those from the CVM. Discrepancies between the results from the CVM and the CPM are within 15%, except at the conditions where flame cellularity appeared. Additionally, an explicit correlation of Su was obtained from the experimental results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of sustainable fuels has been a great challenge during the last decades. In this regard, this research discusses the liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse, a waste from bio-ethanol and/or sugar manufacture, using water, hydrous ethanol and anhydrous ethanol over shellfish waste catalysts (mussel and crab) constituted mainly by CaCO3. In the absence of catalysts, the bagasse dissolved better in hydrous ethanol (82%) than to dry ethanol (72%) and water (73%). The total yield of biocrude for the process with water was low (18%) because it was necessary to perform a liquid-liquid extraction with an organic solvent to recover it. The yield of the biocrude increased to approximately 60% when ethanol was used instead of water. Reactions with the waste catalysts presented a reduction of biochar content and yielded products with different compositions, mainly due to esterification/hydrolysis reactions between the ethanol, water, and the acids from the biocrude. The biochars and biocrudes presented high-energy content, with a higher heating value between 19.8 and 26.9 MJ.kg−1. The catalysts based on crab residues showed to be a little more effective for liquefaction compared to the catalyst from mussel wastes, due to the presence of more alkaline phases than CaCO3. The biocrude obtained with hydrous ethanol and crab catalyst presented esters (39%), alcohols (6%), and phenols/aromatics (35%). For the reactions with mussel catalyst, the biocrude composition changed to esters (56%), alcohol (5%), and phenols/aromatics (38%). Both biocrudes have the potential to be used as sustainable biofuels for a sugarcane plantation, processing, and other activities. Due to the alkaline compounds present in the solid product, which is a biochar-CaCO3 composite, it could also be used in the soil to neutralize its acidity and reducing cane plantation costs, in a circular economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mesoporous silica nanoflowers bearing -NH2 groups were synthesized by the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) with reverse microemulsion method, following with the grafting of -NH2 groups by the post modification with (3-Aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS). The lipase from C. antarctica was immobilized on the as-synthesized amino-grafted mesoporous silica nanoflowers to fabricate the lipase-immobilized mesoporous silica nanoflowers composite, which was applied for the catalytic transformation of biomass-derived levulinic acid to biofuel ethyl levulinate (EL), and exhibited excellent catalytic activity. An ethyl levulinate yield as high as 99.5% could be achieved at 40 °C in 8 h reaction time, which was much higher than that catalyzed by the free lipase (67.9%) under the identical conditions. The immobilized lipase showed good stability and recyclability that ethyl levulinate yields above 68% could be remained after seven recycle times. This work represents a novel strategy to construct the immobilized biocatalyst for the production of bio-based chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A systematic approach for advanced soft sensor development was applied to predict free fatty acid (FFA) content from NIR spectra under real plant conditions, namely in process streams from a biofuel producing unit integrating raw materials with time-varying complex matrices (e.g., wasted cooking oils, WCOs). The proposed methodology systematically screened through 52 combinations of preprocessing and inferential modeling methods, including current state of the art predictive methodologies, and the recently proposed multiresolution soft sensors. The model's prediction capabilities were compared through a rigorous framework based on Monte Carlo double cross-validation and statistical hypothesis testing. This study used 119 samples with FFA content in the range of 0.1030% to 5.6740%. The best model is based on the novel multiresolution soft sensor framework. This model had a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9792 and a prediction root mean squared error of 0.1187 (13.6% lower than the best model based on standard modelling methodologies). The proposed approach can be easily replicated to other scenarios where soft sensors based on Process Analytical Technology (PAT) are to be developed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algal bloom biomass, sourced from a freshwater lake in Chongqing, was pre-treated by hydrothermal pre-treatments with or without acid/alkali catalysts, and subsequently used as a substrate for sustainable biohythane production via fermentation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses suggested hydrothermal acid/alkali pre-treatments significantly changed peak intensities of chemical compositions in algal bloom biomass. Derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analyses showed more macromolecular substances hydrolysed after hydrothermal acid/alkali pre-treatments. When bloom algae were pre-treated with 1% HCl at 140 °C for 10 min, an optimal specific hydrogen yield (SHY) of 39.4 mL/g volatile solid (VS) was obtained, which is 38.2% higher than raw biomass. However, a 34.4% decrease in SHY occurred under hydrothermal pre-treatment with 1% NaOH due to the enhancement of Maillard reaction. When using the effluents in methane fermentation, specific methane yields (SMYs) were 177.1–276.8 mL/g VS. Two-stage process effectively reduced the total fermentation time by 22.7% compared with single-stage fermentation. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This study provides fundamental insight and offers a promising catalytic hydrothermal method to harness cranberry pomace as a potential bioenergy and/or hydrochar source. The physical and chemical properties of Canadian cranberry pomace, supplied by Fruit d’Or Inc., were examined and the optimum operational conditions, in terms of biocrude yield, were obtained by the I-optimal matrix of Design Expert 11. Afterward, cranberry pomace hydrochar (CPH) and zeolite were separately introduced to the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process to investigate the benefits and disadvantages associated with their catalytic activity. CPH was found to be a better host than zeolite to accommodate cellulosic sugars and showed great catalytic performance in producing hydrocarbons. However, high amounts of corrosive amino and aliphatic acids hinder the practical application of CPH as a catalyst. Alternatively, zeolite, as a commercial high surface area catalyst, had a higher activity for deoxygenation of compounds containing carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups than CPH and resulted in higher selectivity of phenols. Due to the low hydrothermal structural stability, coke formation, and narrow pore size distribution, further activations and modifications are needed to improve the catalytic behavior of zeolite. Our results suggest that a composite composed of CPH and zeolite can resolve the abovementioned limitations and help with the development and commercialization of advanced biofuels from cranberry pomace. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The main objective of this work is to contribute to a gradual replacement process of fossil diesel (D) with biofuels composed by diethyl carbonate (DEC) and either sunflower or castor oil, as straight vegetable oils (SVOs). DEC is a very interesting candidate as an oxygenated additive not only because of its low price and renewable nature, but also its favorable fuel properties, such as very low kinematic viscosity, high cetane number, high oxygen content, rich cold flow properties and good miscibility with fossil diesel and vegetable oils. In this work, the more suitable DEC/SVO biofuels are chosen based on kinematic viscosity, according to the European normative. Additionally, the most relevant physical-chemical properties of (bio)fuels such as density, calorific value, cloud point, pour point and cetane number are determined. The influence of DEC on engine performance and exhaust emissions is analyzed by fueling a conventional Diesel engine with the different D/DEC/SVO triple and DEC/SVO double mixtures. The tests results are also compared with commercial diesel. From the results, it is concluded that Diesel engine fueled with the blends studied exhibits an excellent performance in terms of power output, very similar to diesel. Additionally, the use of these blends can remarkably decrease smoke emissions down to 98%, with respect to fossil diesel. The addition of DEC shows a significant improvement in cold flow properties of fuel mixtures in the exchange of a slightly higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) than diesel. Interestingly, the pure biofuels composed by DEC and SVO allow for a suitable engine operation and achieve the lowest emissions, which means these blends can be successfully employed in current engines without adding fossil diesel, i.e., their use entail a 100% renewability. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The growing demand of microalgal biomass for biofuels, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, animal feed, and other bioproducts has created a strong interest in developing low-cost sustainable cultivation media and methods. Agricultural and food residues represent low-cost abundant and renewable sources of organic carbon that can be valorized for the cultivation of microalgae, while converting them from an environmental liability to an industrial asset. Biochemical treatment of such residues results in the release of various sugars, primarily glucose, sucrose, fructose, arabinose, and xylose along with other nutrients, such as trace elements. These sugars and nutrients can be metabolized in the absence of light (heterotrophic) or the presence of light (mixotrophic) by a variety of microalgae species for biomass and bioproduct production. The present review provides an up-to-date critical assessment of the prospects of various types of agricultural and food residues to serve as algae feedstocks and the microalgae species that can be grown on such residues under a range of cultivation conditions. Utilization of these feedstocks can create potential industrial applications for sustainable production of microalgal biomass and bioproducts. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This work investigates the optimization of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE, biodiesel) production from waste cooking oil (WCO) via the transesterification with ethanol (EtOH) under calcium oxide catalyst from green mussel shell impregnated with potassium chloride (KCl). The green mussel shell is calcined at 900 °C for 5 h, grounded into powder prior to immersion into KCl solution, and characterized by an attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR/FT-IR) spectrophotometer and X-ray diffraction (XRD) before using as a catalyst. The catalytic performances are evaluated via WCO-EtOH transesterification and optimized for production parameters. The maximum yield of FAEE is 97% w/w from the following optimum conditions: catalyst ratio of 4.0% w/w, EtOH-to-WCO molar ratio of 10:1 at 80 °C in 3 h. This work benefits on value-added raw materials, such as green mussel shell and WCO, which can be renewed for energy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cobalt and/or Molybdenum based catalysts were simply dispersed on γ-Al2O3 through wet impregnation. The set of prepared monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of aCoO/γ-Al2O3, aMoO/γ-Al2O3, aCoOaMoO/γ-Al2O3, and bCoObMoO/γ-Al2O3 were investigated and evaluated in the hydrocracking of Calophyllum inophyllum (CIO) which is not a food crop as well as rich in unsaturated fatty acid that potential to be converted into biofuel. Out of the prepared catalysts, aCoOaMoO/γ-Al2O3 with total metal content, acidity, and specific surface area of 13.62 wt%, 5.01 mmol.g-1, and 107.67 m2.g-1, respectively, showed the best catalytic performance. The high metal loading of aCoOaMoO/γ-Al2O3 is favorable by producing 65.56 wt% liquid fraction through carbocation formation mechanism. It was selective to produce 8.61 wt% gasoline and 5.01 wt% diesel. Copyright © 2020 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Polysiloxane acidic ionic liquids containing pyridinium trifluoroacetate salts (PMO-Py-IL) were synthesized from pyridine containing organosilane precursors. Characterization by SEM, XRD, TGA, and nitrogen porosimetry confirmed that both pyridinium cation and trifluoroacetate anion were successfully incorporated within the organosilica network. The resulting organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterial (PMO-Py-IL) was studied as nanocatalyst in free fatty acids esterification into biodiesel-like compounds. Remarkably, the synergistic hydrophilic/hydrophobic effect of pyridinium and trifluoroacetate ionic liquid in the well-ordered channels of PMO-Py-IL nanomaterial enhanced the activity toward sustainable biodiesel-like esters production. More importantly, PMO-Py-IL nanocatalyst also exhibited an exceptional activity and stability. The catalyst could be easily separated to reuse at least in ten reactions runs preserving almost intact its catalytic activity under otherwise identical conditions to those employed for the fresh catalysts. © 2020

AB  - Microalgae have been widely considered as a promising alternative to renewable feedstock to biofuel production. Considering the many oleaginous strains of microalgae, this work assessed the potential of two species, Chlorella minutissima and Nannochloropsis gaditana, to be tested as raw material for ethyl esters production of biodiesel value. This work demonstrates an efficient pilot-size photoautotrophic growth of the two strains using 40-L bubble-column photobioreactors, providing lipid productivities of around 15.2 and 8.7 mg L−1 day−1 for C. minutissima and N. gaditana, respectively. The lipid-bearing biomass, which presented fatty acids composition similar to vegetable oils, such as soybean, rich in palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids, was then assayed in direct trans/esterification reactions using ethanol as acyl donor, lipid extracting and solvent for the liquid phase in a pressurized reactor. The reactions, which were catalyzed by a heterogeneous acid catalyst (12-molybdophosphoric acid supported onto aluminum oxide), demonstrated an efficient route for producing a product mixture containing ester contents greater than 96.5 wt%, total conversion of triacylglycerols, and low levels of mono- and diacylglycerols, promoting an ethyl ester mixture with possible integration within the biodiesel market specifications. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - At present, wheat straw is comprehensively studied to produce chemicals and biofuels, such as bioethanol, biohydrogen, and biogas. In this study, we used wheat straw as raw material to produce organic carboxylic acids in NaIO4 + H2SO4, and electron beam irradiation (EBI) pretreatment was used in the process to enhance the efficiency of straw conversion. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of raw and pretreated wheat straw showed that surfaces have been fractured after EBI pretreatment, and there were many micropores distributed in the pretreated straw. Moreover, the experimental results showed that EBI pretreatment can efficiently promote the transformation of wheat straw to organic carboxylic acids. Effects of irradiation dose, temperature, reaction time, the amount of sulfuric acid and sodium periodate on the yield of lactic acid (LA), formic acid (FA), and acetic acid (AA) were investigated. The highest LA yield of 34.37% was obtained at the optimum conditions (EBI 100 kGy, H2SO4 concentration 2 wt%, NaIO4 concentration 0.6 wt%, reaction time 45 min, reaction temperature 200 °C). And the yields of FA and AA were 29.16% and 10.39%, respectively. FT-IR analysis showed that hemicellulose, compared to cellulose and lignin, was partially removed after irradiation. The reaction pathways and mechanisms were inferred by analyzing the products of hydrothermal conversion of several intermediates.

AB  - Considered as a promising source of sustainable energy, biofuel produced from algae holds many advantages. However, to truly understand the production process and assess the potential for further optimization, a novel analytical technique is needed. Comprehensive multiphase (CMP)-NMR is introduced as a potentially powerful tool for the biofuel industry. CMP-NMR combines all aspects of solution and solid-state NMR into a single probe, permitting the detection and differentiation of liquids, gels, and solids in intact multiphase samples. Here, algal biomass is subjected to subcritical water extraction, where the effects of feedstock species, reaction temperatures, and the presence of a catalyst are investigated. The distribution of organic components (i.e., lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) across phases (liquid, gel, and solid) under various reaction conditions provides the understanding required to further optimize both targeted and nontargeted extraction processes. This provides the basis to not only increase the efficiency of the main fuel-related products but also understand the useful "byproducts", such as animal feed from the protein-rich solid residue. The goal of this study is to act as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the considerable potential of CMP-NMR to monitor and understand biofuel-related processes at the molecular level. ©

AB  - Lignocellulose is a promising raw material for the production of second-generation biofuels. In this study, the effects of acid-catalyzed liquid hot water (LHW) on pretreatment of corn stover (CS) for subsequent hydrolysis and conversion to ethanol were studied. The effects of reaction temperature, acid concentration, and residence time on glucose yield were evaluated using a response surface methodology. The optimal condition was 162.4 °C for 29.5 min with 0.45% v/v of sulfuric acid, leading to the maximum glucose yield of 91.05% from enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose-enriched fraction. Conversion of the solid fraction to ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation resulted in a theoretical ethanol yield of 93.91% based on digestible glucose. Scanning electron microscopy revealed disruption on the microstructure of the pretreated CS. Increases of crystallinity index and surface area of the pretreated biomass were observed along with alteration in the functional group profiles, as demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This work provides an insight into the effects of LHW on the enzymatic susceptibility and modification of the physicochemical properties of CS for further application on bioethanol production in biorefinery. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae for biofuel production is suffering from low bio-oil yield and high heteroatomic compositions owing to their low efficiency and selectivity to hydrolysis of cellular compounds. Hereby we report Keggin-type (Mo−V−P) heteropolyacids (HPAs)-catalyzed HTL of microalgae for efficient low-nitrogen biocrude production. The increases of reaction temperature, reaction time, and vanadium substitution degrees of HPAs are favorable to biocrude yield initially, whereas a significant decrease of biocrude yield is observed owing to the enhanced oxidation of carbohydrates above the optimum reaction conditions. The maximum biocrude yield of HPAs-catalyzed HTL of microalgae is 29.95 % at reaction temperature of 300 °C, reaction time of 2 h, and 5 wt% of HPA-4, which is about 19.66 % higher than that of control with 71.17 % less N-containing compounds, including 1,3-propanediamine, 1-pentanamine, and 2, 2’-heptamethylene-di-2-imidazoline than that of control. This work reveals that HPAs with Brønsted acidity and reversible redox properties are capable of both enhancing biocrude production via catalyzing the hydrolysis of cellular compounds and reducing their nitrogen content through avoiding the Maillard reactions between the intermediates of hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins. HPAs-catalyzed HTL is an efficient strategy to produce low N-containing biofuels, possibly paving the way of their direct use in modern motors. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Triglycerides from animal fats and vegetable oils are used as the sustainable feedstocks for the generation of biofuels. Tung oil, rubber seed oil, Jatropha curcas oil, waste cooking oil, and waste acidified oil were selected as the triglyceride feedstocks for the production of drop-in biofuels by a catalytic cracking process. The one-step process was carried out in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor using a SO42-/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The catalyst exhibited an excellent performance of cracking, deoxygenation, and aromatization reactions. Moreover, it could be repeatedly used for more than 15 times without an obvious deactivation. The catalytic cracking process resulted in a high yield (65-72%) of the biofuel, which showed a low acid value (3.78 mg KOH/g) and low oxygen content (1.49%). The biofuels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, suggesting that the dominant components of the biofuels are hydrocarbons in the range of C6-C26, including 17% alkanes, 56% olefins, and 22% monocyclic aromatics. These bio-hydrocarbon fuels in the crude form are chemically identical or near-identical to petroleum-based fuels, which have an attractive fraction distribution (>32% bio-gasoline, >50% green diesel, and <11% heavy fraction) and can be fractionated and used in different formulations depending on the types of desired fuels. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A series of self-solidifying hybrid ionic liquids (SHILs) were synthesised via a mild nucleophilic substitution reaction between (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane and 1,3-propanesultone followed by a facile sol-gel reaction, during which not any acid, catalyst or support was introduced. Part of the grafted –SO3H groups would make SHILs become solid nature by forming the zwitterion, while the rest of –SO3H groups could endue SHILs with acidic catalytic sites. Besides, –Si–O–Si– networks formed by the sol-gel reaction would further impart the water-tolerance and heterogeneity to SHILs, conducive to the easy separation and good reusability. For the oleic acid esterification catalysed by P-APTMS-PS-5 SHIL, 96.55% conversion was achieved under appropriate conditions (optimised by response surface methodology), and the catalytic activity well remained after 7 cycles. More importantly, SHILs exhibited excellent catalytic activity and satisfactory generality in the esterification of various free fatty acids, as well as in the transesterification of different oils, signifying the great potential for biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Zanthoxylum bungeanum is an important commercial crop of the Rutaceae family, its peel is used as a condiment and also in traditional Chinese medicine. Seeds are rich in fatty acids but are usually rejected. To investigate the feasibility of using Z. bungeanum seeds to make biodiesel, techniques including GC–MS, transcriptome sequencing and RT-qPCR were used to analyse the fatty acids content and gene expression levels in seeds of five developmental stages. The results show that nine fatty acids are produced and that these accumulate during seed development, to reach the highest levels at maturity. At maturity, the levels of elaidic acid and palmitic acid are highest, each accounting for 22 % of the total. These are followed by linoleic acid, linolenic acid, oleic acid and palmitoleic acid, which account for 18, 15, 7 and 12 % of the total, respectively. The contents of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids continued to accumulate during seed development. At maturity, the content of saturated fatty acids was 46.48 mg/g and the content of unsaturated fatty acids was 142.05 mg/g. Using transcriptome sequencing, the expression levels of 20 genes related to fatty-acid synthesis were determined. A fatty acids synthesis pathway model was established based on gene function annotation information. The results of inter-group correlation analysis and RDA analysis show that ENR, ECR and SAD1 play active roles in fatty acids synthesis in Z. bungeanum and were identified as key genes for fatty acids synthesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the current research, MgO/MFS nanocatalyst was used in the transesterification process to produce green fuel from vegetable oil. The effect of various synthesis methods such as precipitation, hydrothermal, conventional combustion, and microwave combustion on the magnesium ferrite nanostructure support was investigated. MgO active phase was then impregnated on the support. Synthesized nanocatalysts were characterized by BET-BJH, FTIR, XRD FESEM, and EDX-Dot mapping techniques, and the best performance was staged by the combustion method while the microwave synthesized sample is slightly more active. This catalyst had fine pore size distribution, sheet-like morphology, appropriate roughness (4.6 nm) in the range of 500 nm, and the highest specific surface area (140 m2/g), which 95.4 % of sunflower seed oil was converted to FAMEs. This nanocatalyst was also more stable in the successive reaction conditions than the conventionally combustion synthesized sample which shows the superiority of this heating method in combustion synthesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable source of energy which can be harnessed to produce biofuels maintaining the carbon neutrality in the atmosphere. Thus, in this work, results of the pyrolysis of solid wastes of Polyalthia Longifolia (PL) leaves have been reported over a range of temperature from 450 °C to 600 °C at an interval of 50 °C. All experiments have been carried out three times in order to ensure repeatability and/or reduce measuring uncertainties; and the average values along with their standard deviation values are presented. The pyrolytic products have been thoroughly characterized by several advanced characterization techniques such as FTIR, GCMS, NMR, XRD, SEM, TGA, etc. as applicable to different products in addition to their physical and fuel properties. Further, the physical and fuel properties are reported for both individual organic and aqueous phases after separating liquid pyrolysis product; as well as based on raw liquid product obtained by pyrolysis before separating into organic and aqueous phases. The average higher heating value of organic phase bio-oil is varying in the range 21.74–24.28 MJ/kg for different pyrolysis temperatures. The moisture content of organic phase bio-oil varies between 0.36 mass % and 8.88 mass % over the temperature range of this study. The pH of organic phase bio-oil is in the range of 5.80 to 6.04 which indicate that the bio-oil is only marginally acidic; and further this range of pH is far better than their counterparts of open literature. From the GCMS analysis of bio-oil samples, it is found that phenol, 2,6-dimethoxy (syringol) is present with highest area % of 22.71 for the case of 600 °C pyrolysis temperature. Finally, the bio-oils produced from the pyrolysis of PL leaves are of good quality in terms of moderately large HHV, pH and low moisture content. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of lignocellulosic and herbaceous biomass over heterogeneous catalysts has been demonstrated to recover high-yield phenolic monomers and holocellulose-rich solids effectively, and these products could be further used to produce value-added chemicals and second-generation biofuel. Catalyst selection plays a critical role in the performance of the RCF process, and noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, and Ru) with a high loading of 5 wt % have been extensively used to obtain high-yield phenolic monomers and delignified holocellulose-rich solids. In this study, we demonstrated that the RCF of biomass over extremely low Pd loaded on N-doped carbon (CNx) support catalysts could produce phenolic monomers at approximately theoretical maximum yield and presented high holocellulose-rich solid recovery. When birch wood was converted over the catalyst with 0.25 wt % Pd loaded on CNx (Pd0.25/CNx) at 250 °C and an initial H2 pressure of 3.0 MPa for 3 h, a lignin-derived phenolic monomer carbon yield and highly delignified holocellulose recovery of 52.7 C % and 84.2 wt %, respectively, were achieved. The Pd0.25/CNx catalyst contained both ultrasmall Pd nanoclusters and single Pd atoms, which were stabilized on the N-functionalized carbon support. The highly activated hydrogenolysis and double-bond saturation that occurred over the Pd0.25/CNx catalyst dominantly produced 4-n-propyl guaiacol/syringol. In contrast, 4-n-propanol guaiacol/syringol with residual -OH groups was the major species obtained over the typical 5 wt % Pd/activated carbon catalyst. The plausible reaction pathways for the production of different types of phenolic monomers were discussed using density functional theory calculations. The excellent RCF performance of the Pd0.25/CNx catalyst was demonstrated using other types of biomass, such as oak, pine, and miscanthus. The successful use of extremely low-Pd-loaded catalysts is advantageous for implementing economically viable RCF techniques. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Using fatty acids as renewable sources of biofuels requires deoxygenation. While a number of promising catalysts have been developed to achieve this, their operating mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, model molecular systems are studied in the gas phase using mass spectrometry experiments and DFT calculations. The coordinated metal complexes [(phen)M(O2CR)]+ (where phen=1,10-phenanthroline; M=Ni or Pd; R=CnH2n+1, n≥2) are formed via electrospray ionization. Their collision-induced dissociation (CID) initiates deoxygenation via loss of CO2 and [C,H2,O2]. The CID spectrum of the stearate complexes (R=C17H35) also shows a series of cations [(phen)M(R’)]+ (where R’ &lt; C17) separated by 14 Da (CH2) corresponding to losses of C2H4-C16H32 (cracking products). Sequential CID of [(phen)M(R’)]+ ultimately leads to [(phen)M(H)]+ and [(phen)M(CH3)]+, both of which react with volatile carboxylic acids, RCO2H, (acetic, propionic, and butyric) to reform the coordinated carboxylate complexes [(phen)M(O2CR)]+. In contrast, cracking products with longer carbon chains, [(phen)M(R)]+ (R&gt;C2), were unreactive towards these carboxylic acids. DFT calculations are consistent with these results and reveal that the approach of the carboxylic acid to the “free” coordination site is blocked by agostic interactions for R &gt; CH3. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Thailand has been implementing its Alternative Energy Development Plan aiming to replace 20–25% of fossil fuels with locally produced biofuels by 2036. The partial substitution of fossil diesel with fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derived from palm oil is one of the major options but blending beyond 20% of FAME is a concern for use in conventional diesel engines. This problem has led to the consideration of other bio-based diesels also derived from palm oil; namely, partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl ester (H-FAME) and bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD). This study performed a comparative life cycle assessment of various bio-based diesels using the ReCiPe life cycle impact assessment method. The results showed that in comparison to fossil diesel, bio-based diesels have superior performance for global warming and fossil resource scarcity, but an inferior performance for eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, human toxicity, and land use. Considering the collective environmental damages, BHD performed the worst for human health, and all the bio-based diesels showed poor performance for ecosystem quality, while diesel showed poor performance for resource availability. Among the bio-based diesel products, BHD has higher environmental burdens than FAME and H-FAME. Improvements have been suggested to enhance the environmental performance of the bio-based diesels. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Non-edible cellulose-containing biomass is a promising and abundant feedstock for simple sugar production. This study presents the results of different cellulose-containing materials (CCM) hydrolysis experiments with P. verruculosum enzyme complexes in laboratory conditions. Among the non-pretreated substrates, only a few had a relatively high convertibility—soy bean husks (31%) and sugar beat pulp (20%)—while wheat straw, oat husks, sunflower peals, and corn stalks had a low convertibility of 3% to 12%. This indicates that a major part of CCM needs pretreatment. Steam-exploded (with Ca(OH)2) soy bean and oat husks (76% and 58%), fine ball-milled aspen wood and nitric acid-pretreated aspen wood (62% and 78%), and steam-exploded (with sulfuric acid) corn stalks (55%) had a high convertibility. Woody biomass pretreated with pulp and paper mills also had a high convertibility (56–78%)—e.g., never dried kraft hardwood and softwood pulp (both bleached and unbleached). These results demonstrate that effective cellulose-containing material processing into simple sugars is possible. Simple sugars derived from CCM using P. verruculosum preparation are a promising feedstock for the microbiological production of biofuels (bioethanol and biobutanol), aminoacids, and organic acids (e.g., lactic acid for polylactic acid production). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Decreasing in fossil fuel reserves and its adverse environmental effects motivate the development of the biofuels production, such as biodiesel. Animal fats residues, generated by agro-processing industries in large quantities, can be considered a low-cost raw material for conversion to alkyl esters (biodiesel). This study aims to evaluate the production of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters – FAME) from enzymatic catalysis applying the novel commercial lipase in liquid formulation NS-40116 obtained from the modified Thermomyces lanuginosus microorganism, using residual chicken oil as feedstock. The reaction parameters “oil to methanol molar ratio”, “water content” and “temperature” were investigated through a statistical design. At 200 rpm during 36 h, enzymatic catalysis (0.3 wt% of lipase to residual chicken oil) presented the most appropriate condition at 35 °C, 2 wt% of water content and oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:4, yielding 93.16% in FAME. Therefore, the recovery of that waste was satisfactorily performed in feasible conditions, producing a less environment-harmful biofuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper is aimed at performing an environmental evaluation regarding biofuel production. The process combines four sections: biomass fast pyrolysis to bio-oil with two phases, oil-phase upgrading by hydrotreating, using H2 obtained by steam reforming, and a new process to produce Fischer-Tropsch biofuels from supercritical water reforming of the aqueous phase. This phase can be valorised in the latter process entirely so natural gas is reformed to H2 (case-study 1), or partially so a fraction of this aqueous phase is reformed (case-study 2), or all this phase is reformed to H2 (case-study 3). The two former can include CO2 storage and aqueous phase concentrations were 15, 25 and 35 wt% organic compounds. At 25 wt%, the global warming potential is 11 g CO2-eq/MJ-biofuel for the case 2 with CO2 storage, while it was 11.3, 12.6, 27.7 and 34 g CO2-eq/MJ-biofuel for the cases 3, 2 without CO2 storage, 1 with and without CO2 storage, respectively. Thus, the case-study 2 with CO2 storage gives the minimum global warming potential, allowing significant reductions with respect to the use of fossil fuels. For the other categories, the case-study1 presents the lowest impacts. Similar trends are found at 15 and 35 wt%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the central composite design of response surface methodology was employed as a design of an experiment to optimize the extraction of oil from Maesopsis eminii seeds using ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction (UASE). The most appropriate values of operating variables such as extraction time and n-hexane to biomass ratio and its effects on oil yield were analyzed. The 7:1 n-hexane-to-biomass ratio (140 mL n-hexane/20 g seed powder) and the 20 min extraction time were found as optimum conditions to get an oil yield of 47.86 ± 0.09 %. Oil's chemical characteristics and compositions include yellowish color, 0.90 g/mL density, 5.40 pH, 47.9 mm2/s kinematic viscosity, 39.63 MJ/kg high heating value, &gt;200 °C flashpoint, and 0.36 ± 0.05 % free fatty acid content. The analyses of Fourier Transform Infrared Radiation (FTIR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometry (GC–MS) revealed that oil from the M. eminii seeds has esters and looked-for fatty acids signifying its potential for biodiesel production. Major fatty acids include oleic (36.7 %), linoleic (24.3 %) and stearic (22.6 %) with minor components shared by palmitic (10.2 %), arachidic (2.6 %), y-linolenic (1.5 %), cis-11-eicosenoic (1.5 %) and behenic (0.5 %). The exploratory oil refining via UASE and transesterification resulted in 84.6 % biodiesel yield indicating its high conversion rate and demonstrating its potential as a feedstock for green diesel production. Hence, the coming of the liquid biofuel from the unexplored non-edible M. eminii seeds would benefit humanity and the environment as this would reduce the use of petroleum-based fuels that are known for producing much air pollution in the atmosphere. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: The use of raw materials from renewable sources has become an important topic for different industries. Pine oleoresin is one of the most important renewable sources. It is composed of a broad range of chemical substances from volatile molecules to complex compounds. The resinic fraction, known as rosin or colophony, comprises approximately 80% of oleoresin. This fraction has become the most attractive one from the economic standpoint. Rosin is a complex mixture of diterpenic acids and is typically used in formulation of adhesives, coating materials, rubbers, printing inks, among others. Although their transformations have been studied, scarce information on the thermal and thermochemical properties of rosin and rosin-derived products has been reported. In this work some of these properties have been estimated to evaluate the influence of chemical transformations such as reduction, isomerization and esterification of rosin components. The estimations have been compared to the literature data and to some experimental values. The interest of some of these transformations is based on the reduction in melting and boiling temperatures observed, although such reductions are probably not enough to use these substances as fuel components.

AB  - Bio-oil catalytic upgrading has been performed using mesoporous Mg-loaded ZSM-5. The presence of Mg modifies both textural and acidic properties, which do not only depend on the Mg content (1 and 5 wt. %) but also on the Si/Al ratio of the parent zeolite (25 and 40). Mg impregnation over mesoporous acidic zeolites has been shown to be essential for further deoxygenation of the raw bio-oil. Thus, remarkable deoxygenation rates have been achieved, exceeding 68 % for a 5 wt. % Mg-loaded ZSM-5 (Si/Al=25). For this catalyst, decarboxylation reactions at MgO active sites seem to be predominant, promoting the upgrading of phenols towards the formation of phenolic compounds with lower oxygen content. As in the case of acidic mesoporous ZSM-5, the formation of aromatics for Mg-loaded mesoporous ZSM-5 samples could be mainly related to the promotion of decarbonylation reactions of phenolic compounds over Brønsted acidic sites at the external surface.

AB  - Flavin oxidases are valuable biocatalysts for the oxidative synthesis of a wide range of compounds, while at the same time reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. Compared to other redox enzymes, their ability to use molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor offers a relatively simple system that does not require a dissociable coenzyme. As such, they are attractive targets for adaptation as cost-effective biosensor elements. Their functional immobilization on surfaces offers unique opportunities to expand their utilization for a wide range of applications. Genetically engineered peptides have been demonstrated as enablers of the functional assembly of biomolecules at solid material interfaces. Once identified as having a high affinity for the material of interest, these peptides can provide a single step bioassembly process with orientation control, a critical parameter for functional immobilization of the enzymes. In this study, for the first time, we explored the bioassembly of a putrescine oxidase enzyme using a gold binding peptide tag. The enzyme was genetically engineered to incorporate a gold binding peptide with an expectation of an effective display of the peptide tag to interact with the gold surface. In this work, the functional activity and expression were investigated, along with the selectivity of the binding of the peptide-tagged enzyme. The fusion enzyme was characterized using multiple techniques, including protein electrophoresis, enzyme activity, and microscopy and spectroscopic methods, to verify the functional expression of the tagged protein with near-native activity. Binding studies using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), nanoparticle binding studies, and atomic force microscopy studies were used to address the selectivity of the binding through the peptide tag. Surface binding AFM studies show that the binding was selective for gold. Quartz crystal microbalance studies show a strong increase in the affinity of the peptide-tagged protein over the native enzyme, while activity assays of protein bound to nanoparticles provide evidence that the enzyme retained catalytic activity when immobilized. In addition to showing selectivity, AFM images show significant differences in the height of the molecules when immobilized through the peptide tag compared to immobilization of the native enzyme, indicating differences in orientation of the bound enzyme when attached via the affinity tag. Controlling the orientation of surface-immobilized enzymes would further improve their enzymatic activity and impact diverse applications, including oxidative biocatalysis, biosensors, biochips, and biofuel production.

AB  - Blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa are prevalent in Lake Qaraoun, Lebanon, which poses a great danger to the environment and to the local population. The threat could be inverted onto an opportunity if an efficient method exists to turn microalgae into valuable fuel products. An experiment was conducted to optimize an efficient pyrolysis conditions to produce bio-fuel from such increasingly prevailing microalgae. Five pyrolysis tests were set, including two different temperatures of 400 and 500 °C, two flow rates of 0.3 and 0.6 ml/min, and three heating rates of 10, 15 and 20 °C /min. On the other hand, in order to further evaluate the quality of pyrolysis oil, three hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) tests were run, including three temperatures of 200, 250 and 300 °C as well as three residence times of 1, 1.5 and 2 h. According to results, the high temperature and heating rate of 500 °C and 20 °C /min led to the highest quantity (32.5%) and quality, lowest amount of oxygen and highest heating value, of biocrude oil. Moreover, results of GC–MS analysis revealed that pyrolysis oil contained more straight chains and less oxygenated components; therefore, higher quality, than HTL oil. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Microalgae and cyanobacteria are unicellular microorganism that contain high-added-value compounds. To make their extraction economically feasible, the biorefinery concept is the only solution. In this study, the residues resulting from lipid or protein extraction from Arthrospira platensis biomass were valorized by catalytic pyrolysis using ZSM5 zeolite or amorphous silica–alumina as catalyst. The reaction was performed in a quartz reactor, and the catalysts were placed in a fixed bed, to force the reaction gases to pass through it. The reaction products were analyzed by FTIR and GC–MS analyses. The reaction gases and liquids obtained from the extraction residues had higher hydrocarbon contents compared with the untreated biomass. Moreover, the pyrolysis of biomass after protein extraction led to fractions with lower nitrogenated component contents, while that after lipid extraction to fractions with lower oxygenated component contents. This study showed that the pyrolysis process could be used to valorize the microalgae extraction residues, aiming to make biofuels production and extraction of high-added-value products more economically feasible. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Surface immobilized enzymes play a key role in numerous biotechnological applications such as biosensors, biofuel cells, or biocatalytic synthesis. As a consequence, the impact of adsorption on the enzyme structure, dynamics, and function needs to be understood on the molecular level as it is critical for the improvement of these technologies. With this perspective in mind, we used a theoretical approach for investigating local protein flexibility on the residue scale that couples a simplified protein representation with an elastic network and Brownian dynamics simulations. The impact of protein adsorption on a solid surface is implicitly modeled via additional external constraints between the residues in contact with the surface. We first performed calculations on a redox enzyme, bilirubin oxidase (BOD) from M. verrucaria, to study the impact of adsorption on its mechanical properties. The resulting rigidity profiles show that, in agreement with the available experimental data, the mechanical variations observed in the adsorbed BOD will depend on its orientation and its anchor residues (i.e., residues that are in contact with the functionalized surface). Additional calculations on ribonuclease A and nitroreductase shed light on how seemingly stable adsorbed enzymes can nonetheless display an important decrease in their catalytic activity resulting from a perturbation of their mechanics and internal dynamics.

AB  - In this study, three types of biomass were torrefied at different times (0.5, 1, 1.5 h) and temperature (200, 240, 280, 320 °C), which were further pyrolyzed at 550 °C after torrefaction. CEI (carbon element index), which was established based on the carbon content of the torrefied biomass, was chosen as an indicator for reflecting torrefaction severity. The results showed that there was a curvilinear relationship between CEI and the physicochemical characteristics, energy recovery of torrefied biomass, which obtained an average goodness of fit was higher than 0.93. Moreover, the goodness of fit between CEI and pyrolysis carbon and bio-oil yield was higher than 0.95 and 0.91, respectively. Especially, the bio-oil composition and CEI were fitted by a quadratic function (y = a + bx + cx2). Based on the function, the yield of phenols could be predicted based on the CEI value, which would benefit for the preparation of higher quality bio-oil directionally. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work assessed the effects of biodiesel on carbonyl emissions from diesel trucks. Biodiesel converted from waste cooking oil was employed and mixed with commercial fossil diesel to produce four blends: B0 (pure conventional diesel fuel), B5 (5% v/v biodiesel), B20 (20% v/v biodiesel) and B100 (pure biodiesel). Four diesel trucks were tested under real-world conditions using a portable emissions measurement system, including one China III light-duty diesel truck (LDDT), one China IV LDDT, one China III heavy-duty diesel truck (HDDT) and one China IV HDDT. A driving cycle including highway (HW) and non-highway (NHW) driving conditions was employed and carbonyls were sampled using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine cartridges and analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography. Seven carbonyl compounds were detected, and formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone and butyraldehyde were the primary carbonyls. Total carbonyl emissions from the China III LDDT, China III HDDT and China IV HDDT vehicles with selective catalytic reduction decreased monotonically with increases in the biodiesel proportion, while the China IV LDDT with a particle oxidation catalyst system showed an increasing trend. With increases in the biodiesel proportions, complementary variations were observed in the proportions of formaldehyde and butyraldehyde obtained using the China III LDDT, China IV LDDT and China III HDDT vehicles. However, in the case of the China IV HDDT trials, the formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions exhibited complementary variations. Under different driving conditions, the effects of adding biodiesel on carbonyl emission factors were different. In China III LDDT trials, biodiesel reduced carbonyl emissions to a greater extent under HW conditions, but the opposite occurred in China III HDDT tests. Using the China IV LDDT vehicle, the emission factors did not increase as much during HW trials compared with NHW trials when the B5 and B20 fuels were used, but were significantly higher than the NHW values when pure biodiesel was employed. In China III LDDT data, the proportions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and butyraldehyde showed opposite variations under the two driving conditions. Using the China IV LDDT vehicle, a significant increase in formaldehyde and decrease in butyraldehyde were found during HW trials, but not NHW trials. Ozone formation potentials were obtained from carbonyls emission factors using the maximum incremental reactivity method and their variations were similar to those of the carbonyl emission factors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper quantitatively investigates the return transmission, volatility spillovers, dynamic correlations, and financial risks between corn, soybean, and crude oil futures and US and European equities. Specifically, by applying our newly extended quinquevariate dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) system with asymmetric spillovers and skew-t errors, we obtain the following new evidence. First, during our recent sample period, the nexuses and dynamic interactions between corn, soybean, and crude oil futures and US and European equities have tightened. Second, we find strong return transmission from US equities to corn, soybean, and crude oil futures and European equities. Third, we clarify significant volatility spillovers that are tied to the leverage effect, from US and European equities to corn and crude oil futures, indicating that downside risk in equity markets is important when considering volatility spillovers to fuel and energy markets. Using the conditional variances and covariances from our new system, we further derive more precise time-varying optimal hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights. These newly find that for the three asset classes of biofuel crops, crude oil, and equities, hedging one asset class with the other asset classes is effective, and well-balanced portfolios constructed using the three asset classes are optimal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the alkali-related problems arising from firing a Thai rice-straw/rice-husk mixture in a pilot-scale grate-fired combustor (150 kWth) and to evaluate different countermeasures in order to mitigate these problems, i.e., addition of kaolin, co-firing with anthracite, and the synergistic effect of combining these measures. Chemical fractionation analysis was used as a preliminary indication of the propensity for interaction between the ash-forming elements in order to predict the slagging and fouling tendencies of the fuels. The results agreed well with those of the combustion experiments and the morphological and microstructural analyses of the bottom-ash and deposit samples via SEM-EDX and elemental mapping. Firing pure biofuels was found not to provoke sintering/slagging but instead resulted in severe fouling. The high deposition flux and significant impediment to the heat transfer of the deposit probe were attributed to the accumulation of condensing gas KCl and the impact of Si-based particles on the probe, as well as the K2SO4 aerosols originating from gas-phase sulfation. All the countermeasures applied showed a promising ability to reduce the deposit formation and prevent the heat transfer from deteriorating, particularly with kaolin or anthracite, or both, at stoichiometric amounts. The success of these countermeasures can be credited to the incorporation of the K-containing species released from biomass into the kaolin and anthracite minerals (a byproduct from the crushing process), as well as to the formation of high-temperature-melting K–Al- silicates. Another topic of interest was the exploitation of anthracite for any option, which could completely extinguish Cl in the deposits and simultaneously generate K2SO4, which may help to reduce chlorine corrosion. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising building block for the production of biofuels and fine chemicals. While HMF can be derived from biomass, specifically sugars, its synthesis typically requires the use of metal-based catalysts and ionic liquids. In this study, the supercritical CO2-subcritical H2O-isopropanol system was proposed as a green reaction medium for the conversion of glucose to HMF. The response surface methodology based on the Box-Behnken design was used to investigate the effect of temperature, pressure, and isopropanol concentration on the yield of HMF. From the quadratic models, the highest HMF yield was predicted to be 38.3% with a corresponding glucose conversion of 87.5% at 200 °C, 16 MPa, and 8 vol % isopropanol. A mechanistic study based on the density functional theory was also performed and the results revealed that isopropanol can facilitate the various hydride shifts that occur in the conversion of glucose to HMF.

AB  - Glucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28 V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Undoubtedly, fossil fuels being the primary source of energy have led us to milestone achievements to date. However, its alarming rate of depletion has raised concerns on a global level, which has channelized significant scientific research on biomass-to-biofuel conversion. Nonetheless, the economics of biomass conversion still poses a challenge due to low yield and conversion. In this regard, experimental studies have suggested supercritical water as a medium, which can facilitate better heat and mass transfer amidst the products and reactants. Thus, in this study, the authors applied the density functional theory (DFT) to simulate upgrading of a bio-oil model compound, levulinic acid, under supercritical water conditions. The supercritical water was defined at densities 0.089, 0.109, 0.190, and 0.360 g/cc, and the corresponding parameters (such as dielectric constant, refractive index, hydrogen-bond acidity, basicity, etc.) were manually set in the SMD implicit solvation model. The present method of model description for supercritical water within the framework of DFT is first of its kind and is the most reliable approach owing to validation with experimental results. Further, in this study, numerous pathways elaborating the conversion of levulinic acid to pentane via intermediates like pentanol and acetopropanol were simulated. The kinetic mapping of the pathways was then done by evaluating Gibbs free-energy change and enthalpy change. The supercritical water showed an advantage in deoxygenating compounds with a higher number of oxy groups. However, in some reactions like conversion of 5,5-dihydroxypentan-2-one to 5-hydroxypentan-2-one (γ-Acetopropanol), the effects of temperature and pressure were seen to offset the solvent effect. Of the four supercritical conditions, ρ = 0.109 and 0.360 g/cc were found to be the most favorable supercritical water densities for the conversion of levulinic acid. Overall, the production of pentane from levulinic acid is found to be most advantageous in the supercritical water density of ρ = 0.109 g/cc till pentane-1,4-diol and further conversion to pentane under supercritical conditions of ρ = 0.360 g/cc is the best pathway. Furthermore, the gas phase was found to be the least favorable medium in almost all of the reactions. In contrast, the presence of supercritical water showed an advantage in nearly all of the reactions suggesting supercritical water to be a suitable solvent for the production of biomass-derived chemicals. Thus, this line of investigation warrants further study, especially by experimental groups, to corroborate the findings of this study and scale-up potential. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Valorization of biomass has become an area of intense focus because of the diminishing reserves of crude oil and the ongoing problem of climate change. The principal strategies for the utilization of biomass as a feedstock are (i) to produce biofuels for the transportation sector and (ii) to produce organic commodity chemicals. In this respect, we have developed a serious of manganese-catalyzed dehydrogenative/deoxygenative coupling reactions of lower alcohols, obtainable from oxygen-rich lignocellulosic biomass, to deliver advanced liquid fuels and valuable chemicals. 1 Introduction 2 Manganese-Catalyzed Upgrading of Ethanol to Butan-1-ol 3 Manganese-Catalyzed Selective Upgrading of Ethanol with Methanol to Isobutanol 4 Manganese-Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Alcohols with Hydroxides to Give Carboxylates 5 Manganese-Catalyzed Dual-Deoxygenative Coupling of Primary Alcohols with 2-Arylethanols 6 Conclusion. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - Lignin is the only biomolecule with aromatics that could serve as a feedstock to displace some petroleum for specialty chemicals. However, catalysts that are active and selective on model compounds for lignin fail when applied to real lignin with respect to performance and reaction mechanism. Here, we report kinetic data based on atomizing aqueous solutions of waste lignin, guaiacol, and syringaldehyde in a continuous catalytic fixed bed reactor operating at atmospheric pressure, a 5 s residence time, and a 30 mL min-1 (1:2 Ar:H2) volumetric flow rate (STP). The catalyst, NiMoS2 supported on activated carbon, was synthesized by a microemulsion technique and exhibited a combination of weak, strong, and very strong acid sites. Syringaldehyde reacted mostly to liquid products, and conversion increased with time-on-stream from 42% to 72% after 5 h. The main products were 2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylphenol and 1,6 dimethoxyphenol through hydrodeoxygenation and decarbonylation, respectively. Guaiacol conversion decreased with time-on-stream and ranged from 76% to 62% after 5 h. The main product was toluene via catechol, cresol, and phenol as intermediates. We propose reaction pathways for both syringaldehyde and guaiacol. The liquid fraction produced from the conversion of waste lignin contained 16 compounds that were mostly organic acids, followed by aldehydes, alcohols, and ketones. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the latex production chain, rubber tree seeds (Hevea brasiliensis) represent an underutilized fraction with high potentialities, which can increase the sustainability of the whole process if rightly valorized. In the present study, the quality of all the fractions obtained from the rubber fruit were evaluated, with the aim to identify possible applications for their valorization with a circular economy perspective. Seeds from five different varieties of rubber tree were analyzed. Furthermore, a whole mass and energy balance was defined, which has allowed us to define hypothetical production scenarios. The obtained results show negligible differences among varieties. Shells and capsules have shown a composition similar to woody biomass, with high heating values (more than 16.5 MJ kg-1), low nitrogen content (below 0.5% on weight basis (w/w)) and reduced ash content (0.51% w/w and 1.90% w/w, respectively). Kernels were chemically extracted comparing two different solvents: n-hexane and ethanol. Both solvents showed similar extraction yields, i.e., 49% w/w and 46% w/w for n-hexane and ethanol, respectively. The resulting extraction flour was characterized by a high protein content (around 40% w/w) making it suitable for animal feeding. The rubber seed oil could be used in blends of different vegetable oils for biodiesel production. All this information is useful for improving the sustainability of the latex production chain and to assess the sustainability of possible bioenergy value chains. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuel resources has prompted the scientific community to find renewable alternatives for the production of energy and chemicals. The products of the aldol condensation between bio-based furfural and acetone have been individuated as promising intermediates for the preparation of biofuels and polymeric materials. We developed a protocol for the microwave-assisted condensation of these two compounds over hydrotalcite-based materials. Mg:Al 2:1 hydrotalcite was prepared by co-precipitation; the obtained solid was calcined to afford the corresponding mixed metal oxide, which was then rehydrated to obtain a meixnerite-type material. The prepared solids were characterized by PXRD, ICP-AES, TGA-DSC and N2 physisorption, and tested as catalysts in the aldol condensation of acetone and furfural in a microwave reactor. The performance of the catalysts was assessed and compared; the meixnerite catalyst proved to be the most active, followed by the mixed metal oxide and the as-synthesized hydrotalcite, which has often been reported to be inactive. In all cases, the reaction is quite fast and selective, which makes our protocol useful for rapidly converting furfural and acetone into their condensation products. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, the production of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from sugars e.g. xylose and glucose, and agricultural wastes e.g. corncob, rice straw and wheat straw were examined in the presence of boron-doped biochar catalysts, boric acid and an ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([emim]Cl). Boron-doped trapa shell biochar (BTB) and coconut shell biochar (BCB) catalysts were synthesized via the wet impregnation method. Fourier transform infrared spectra of biochar catalysts showed a band for B[sbnd]O stretching vibrations confirming successful boron impregnation. Furfural and HMF yields from glucose reached 32% and 40%, respectively. One-pot hydrolysis-dehydration conversion of corncob, rice straw and wheat straw resulted in yields of up to 12% and 21% for furfural and HMF, respectively. In addition, catalyst reusability up to 4 cycles was demonstrated with less than 5% variation in HMF yield. Overall, the results of the study offer new insights and great potential in the conversion of waste biomass to high value platform chemicals for energy applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Phaeodactylum tricornutum is an interesting source of biomass to produce biocrude by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Its biochemical composition, along with its biomass productivity, can be modulated according to this specific application by varying the photoperiod, the addition of CO2 or the variation of the initial nitrate concentration. The lab-scale culture allowed the production of a P. tricornutum biomass with high biomass and lipid productivities using a 18:6 h light:dark photoperiod and a specific CO2 injection. An initial concentration of nitrates (11.8 mM) in the culture was also essential for the growth of this species at the lab scale. The biomass generated in the scale-up photoreactor had acceptable biomass and lipid productivities, although the values were higher in the biomass cultivated at the lab scale because of the difficulty for the light to reach all cells, making the cells unable to develop and hindering their growth. The biocrudes from a 90 L cultivated microalga (B-90L) showed lower yields than the ones obtained from the biomass cultivated at the lab scale (B-1L) because of the lower lipid and high ash contents in this biomass. However, the culture scaling-up did not affect significantly the heteroatom concentrations in the biocrudes. A larger-scale culture is recommended to produce a biocrude to be used as biofuel after a post-hydrotreatment stage. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Residues of the palm oil agro-industry (palm empty fruit bunches - EFB) were pyrolysed to produce biofuels. Effects of several parameters on the slow pyrolysis process were evaluated using the central compound rotational design (DCCR) for modelling and optimization the process conditions aiming the maximum yield of bio-oil. After pyrolisis and using various approaches the products were characterized with emphasis on bio-oil. The response surface methodology and desirability function indicate that the temperature was the most influential parameter in regard to the liquid yield, in which the optimum pyrolysis conditions were: temperature of 628.2 °C and N2 flow rate of 0.259 L/min. The empirical relationships for the bio-gas, bio-oil, and bio-char were carried out from a second-order polynomial equation adequately describing the nonlinear behaviour of the experimental data with a precision of approximately 85%. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier Transformer infrared (FTIR) analysis shows that bio-oil has a high content of oxygenated compounds with four main components: hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (25.57 area%), nonane (12.51 area%), n-hexadecanoic acid (10.66 area%) and phenol (10.13 area%). Moreover, high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis showed the bio-oil is very promising for biodiesel-based automotive additives preventing oxidation of the bis-allylic methylene groups and the consequent generation of free radicals. Biochar showed low yield (27.52%) but good energy capacity, with a calorific value of 19.27 MJ/kg. Regarding to gases production, CO2 and CH4 are the main compounds observed in optimized conditions suggestion its use like raw material in the energy production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alternative, more sustainable and environmentally positive, sources of energy are one of the current global challenges. One approach to achieving more sustainable sources of energy is to use waste from one system as a raw material for energy production, following the circular biosystem philosophy. This study successfully adopted this approach whereby microalgae strains Chlorella emersonii and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were bioprospected and metabolically engineered in simulated wastewater supplemented with glucose to produce neutral lipids. Using a two-step cultivation approach neutral lipid content was enhanced in Chlorella emersonii and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata biomass. Via in-situ transesterification, these neutral lipids were subsequently bioconverted to biodiesel feedstock fatty acid methyl esters using novel solvent stable lipase(s) from Pseudomonas reinekei and Pseudomonas brenneri. The culturing of appropriate microalgae on wastewater, and bioconversion via organo-stable lipases may provide a commercially viable and sustainable biodiesel feedstock to help address the current global energy challenge. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

By using incipient wetness impregnation (I) and precipitation-deposition (PD) two different catalysts were prepared, characterized and tested in reaction. With larger Ni0 particles and a significantly higher acid site density, Ni/SA-I was more active and selective to PV, revealing the crucial impact of preparation method on the catalytic performance. After 24 h, a GVL conversion of 83.5% with PV selectivity of 87.8% was reached with Ni/SA-I. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The performance of ferric iron/calcium peroxide (Fe3+/CaO2) catalyzed Fenton-like process at different reagent dosages for enhancing the digestibility of rice straw (RS) was investigated. Despite the fact that the pretreatment did open up the RS surface, no substantial destruction in the RS supramolecular structure was achieved, as evidenced by the slight decrease of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose contents under all tested conditions. Soluble carbohydrates showed a negative correlation with the increase in Fe3+/CaO2 dosage presumably due to the oxidative destruction effect of the chemicals on the labile soluble organics. The highest methane yield of 143.3 mL/g-VSfed was obtained with the RS pretreated by 4.0 mM Fe3+ and 2.0 mM CaO2, which was 3.6 times higher than that with the raw RS (31.1 mL/g-VSfed). From the experimental results, Fe3+/CaO2 catalyzed Fenton-like chemistry could serve as a feasible strategy for enhancing the biodegradability of lignocellulosic biomass materials. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focused on the valorization of the date syrup obtained from low-quality date fruits to be used as a low-cost alternative medium for producing single cell oil (SCO) by Rhodotorula glutinis PTCC5256, which could further be converted into biodiesel. The higher C/N ratio of date syrup (C/N 70) led to restricting the formation of cell biomass and enhancing the biosynthesis of SCO. The maximal cell biomass and lipid productivities were obtained 72 mg/L/h and 17 mg/L/h by C/N ratios of 20 and 70, respectively. Although the obtained biodiesel met the international standards for cold filter plugging point (4.92 °C), iodine value (87.22 g I2/100 g oil), cetane number (52.26), higher heating value (40.19 MJ/kg), cloud point (6.29 °C), pour point (0.00 °C), density (878 kg/m3), kinematic viscosity (4.30 mm2/s) and oxidation stability (7.87 h), its weak cold-flow properties might limit its application in cold areas in comparison with diesel fuel. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The growing awareness to advance new ways to transform renewable materials for producing clean fuels, under technical and sustainable viability, is evident. In this regard, hydrogen arises as one of the cleanest and energetic biofuels in the market. This work addresses the modeling and evaluation of a biomass gasification topology employing process simulation along with an environmental and inherent safety analysis. The presented pathway considered two renewable raw materials (cassava and rice waste) based on their vast availability in north Colombia regions. We employed Aspen Plus process simulation software to model the process, setting biomasses (and ash content) as nonconventional solids in the software and inclusion of FORTRAN subroutines for handling solid properties. Otherwise, the environmental evaluation was performed applying the waste reduction algorithm (WAR). At the same time, safety assessment involves a comprehensive approach based on the inherent safety index (ISI) and the process route index (PRI) methods. Data generated from the implementation of rigorous process simulation of biomass gasification allowed us to determine the needed aspect for performing process analysis methodologies. Results revealed that this topology generates a total flow of 3944.51 kg/h with more than 97% vol of H2, from the sustainable use of 19,243 kg/h of cassava waste and 15,000 kg/h of rice straw. From the environmental viewpoint, the process showed moderately to a high overall rate of potential environmental impacts (PEIs), with a higher contribution from process sources than energy sources. It indicates that most of the generated impacts would come from self-operation than from the energy supply generation. In the case of process safety, the topology obtained an ISI score of 35, which represents that modeled gasification would operate below 50% of the expected neutral standard for a physical−chemical process. Complementing the safety evaluation, the obtained PRI suggests that compared to other processes, the analyzed topology shows relatively adequate performance considering the nature of this type of process. © 2020 American Chemical Society

AB  - Biomass is the only renewable carbon source capable of replacing conventional production of chemicals and fuels derived from nonrenewable resources. The cellulose monomers derived from lignocellulosic biomass can be transformed into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which can be further converted into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF). These products can be used as substitutes for standard gasoline or as additives. This study has shown that by using Ni-Cu catalysts supported on ZrO2, DMF can be obtained with a yield of 70% after 25 h on stream. Experiments were carried out in a continuous fixed-bed reactor, and complete HMF conversion was achieved by the formation of Ni-Cu species. The importance of Ni active sites in the hydrogenation of DMF to obtain DMTHF was shown, observing how the progressive Ni oxidation phenomenon during the reaction favors DMF production to the detriment of DMTHF. Catalyst evolution was corroborated by different characterization techniques after carrying out several experiments with different durations. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of the present work is to investigate the possibility of producing activated carbons from the residual lignin stream of lignocellulosic ethanol biorefineries, as this represents an optimal opportunity to exploit a residual and renewable material in the perspective of sustainable bioeconomy, increasing biorefinery incomes by producing value-added bioproducts in conjunction with biofuels. Activated carbons (ACs) were produced via chemical (KOH) and physical (CO2) activation. Char samples were obtained by slow pyrolysis (SP) and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). Several HTC experiments were carried out by varying residence time (0.5-3 h) and reaction temperature (200-270 °C), in order to evaluate their influence on the product yield and on the morphological characteristics of the hydrochar (specific surface area, total pore volume and pore size distribution). ACs from hydrochars were compared with those obtained from pyrochar (via physical activation) and from the raw lignin-rich stream (via chemical activation). In both cases, by increasing the HTC temperature, the specific surface of the resulting activated carbons decreased from 630 to 77 m2 g-1 for physical activation and from 675 to 81 m2 g-1 for chemical activation, indicating that an increase in the severity of the hydrothermal pretreatment is deleterious for the activated carbons quality. In addition, the HTC aqueous samples were analyzed, with GC-MS and GC-FID. The results suggest that at low temperatures the reaction mechanisms are dominated by hydrolysis, instead when the temperature is increased to 270 °C, a more complex network of reactions takes place among which decarboxylation. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was produced from waste coffee grounds (WCGs) using solid catalysts manufactured from waste eggshells (WESs). A one-step direct process (OSDP), comprising extraction of lipids from WCGs and simultaneous transesterification of these lipids with methanol in a reactor, was employed. To facilitate reuse of the solid catalysts, a cartridge containing the solid catalysts was devised and applied in the OSDP. The optimal reaction conditions of the OSDP with the cartridge were 100 wt% catalyst relative to WCGs, the mixture of 4.0 mL methanol and 4.0 mL n-hexane per gram WCG, 45°C, 9 h, and 200 rpm. Under these optimal conditions, an 8.7% biodiesel yield (g-biodiesel/g-WCGs) was achieved. Solid catalysts retained in the cartridge were successfully reused for seven rounds of repeated batch operation and, using this approach, a biodiesel yield exceeding 92% of that of the first batch operation was maintained. © 2020, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer.

AB  - Caldicellulosiruptorbescii is the most thermophilic cellulolytic organism yet identified (Topt 78 °C). It grows on untreated plant biomass and has an established genetic system thereby making it a promising microbial platform for lignocellulose conversion to bio-products. Here, we investigated the ability of engineered C.bescii to generate alcohols from carboxylic acids. Expression of aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (aor from Pyrococcusfuriosus) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhA from Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514) enabled C.bescii to generate ethanol from crystalline cellulose and from biomass by reducing the acetate produced by fermentation. Deletion of lactate dehydrogenase in a strain expressing the AOR–Adh pathway increased ethanol production. Engineered strains also converted exogenously supplied organic acids (isobutyrate and n-caproate) to the corresponding alcohol (isobutanol and hexanol) using both crystalline cellulose and switchgrass as sources of reductant for alcohol production. This is the first instance of an acid to alcohol conversion pathway in a cellulolytic microbe. © 2020, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - The conversion of biomass to green hydrocarbons offers great advantages to shorten our path to sustainability. Unfortunately, none of the existing approaches produces a biocrude that is compatible (in terms of density, viscosity, and reactivity) with current refinery processes. In this work, sugarcane bagasse was converted completely to a biocrude rich in O-isopropylidene acetals by an acetalization process using a continuous flow reactor. Hemicellulose is the first component that transformed into acetals followed by amorphous and crystalline cellulose. Hence, the composition of the biocrude to be collected under specific reaction conditions could be tuned in terms of the type of carbohydrate (pentoses and hexoses) and their derivatives. The process was also applied at a larger scale (20-fold increase) to produce a stable biocrude with density ≈1.2 g cm-3, viscosity of 200 cp (60 °C) and specific heat 1.8 J g °C-1 confirming its properties for conversion in typical refinery processes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - First-generation biofuel biorefineries may be a starting point for the development of new value chains, as their by-products and side streams retain nutrients and valuable molecules that may be recovered and valorized for high-value applications. This study provides a chemical characterization of post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage, side streams of dry-grind corn bioethanol production, in view of their valorization. An overall long-term study was conducted on the two co-products collected over 1 year from a bioethanol plant. Water content, acid value, sedimentation, mineral composition, and fatty acid profiles were analyzed on post-fermentation corn oil. Results highlighted that its acid value was high (19.72–24.29 mg KOH/g), indicating high levels of free fatty acids, but stable over the year due to standardized operating conditions. The fatty acid profile was that typical of corn oil, with a prevalence of linoleic (54–59% of total fatty acids) over oleic (23–27%) and palmitic (12–17%) acids. Macronutrients, fatty acid, and mineral profiles were investigated in thin stillage. Results revealed the acidic pH (4.05–4.68) and high dilution (90–93% water) of this side stream. The dry mass was composed of fats (19–30%), proteins (8.8–12.8%), ash (8.7–9.5%), and fiber (7.3–9.8%). The concomitant presence of a variegate complex of molecules of nutritional interest in corn bioethanol co-products, with several potential high-value market applications, make the perspective of their recovery a promising strategy to create new cross-sector interconnections according to circular economy principles. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The alcohols ethanol and 1-butanol are interesting options as blending components for renewable fuels. We studied whether it is possible to mix these alcohols with a little refined material, rapeseed oil, to obtain stable fuel samples. At room temperature, the stable samples consisted of rapeseed oil blended with butanol at 5 vol-%, 10 vol-%, 20 vol-%, 30 vol-% and one sample of rapeseed oil with 5 vol-% of ethanol. The samples' fuel properties analysed were kinematic viscosity (at 40_C), density (at 15 C) and surface tension. Cold filter plugging point was measured for rapeseed oil with 20 vol-% and 30 vol-% of butanol. Stability of butanol or ethanol and rapeseed oil blends can be achieved at the studied volumes. The density of neat rapeseed oil and all the alcohol-rapeseed oil blends met the requirements set for residual marine fuels. The 30 vol-% butanol-rapeseed oil blend met the requirements for distillate marine oil for density, and almost for kinematic viscosity. The blends appeared most suitable for power plants and marine engines. More detailed analyses of their properties are needed before recommendations for use can be given. © 2020 MDPI AG.

AB  - Filamentous fungi are intensively used for producing industrial enzymes, including lignocellulases. Employing insoluble cellulose to induce the production of lignocellulases causes some drawbacks, e.g., a complex fermentation operation, which can be overcome by using soluble inducers such as cellobiose. Here, a triple β-glucosidase mutant of Neurospora crassa, which prevents rapid turnover of cellobiose and thus allows the disaccharide to induce lignocellulases, was applied to profile the proteome responses to cellobiose and cellulose (Avicel). Our results revealed a shared proteomic response to cellobiose and Avicel, whose elements included lignocellulases and cellulolytic product transporters. While the cellulolytic proteins showed a correlated increase in protein and mRNA levels, only a moderate correlation was observed on a proteomic scale between protein and mRNA levels (R2=0.31). Ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing were significantly overrepresented in the protein set with increased protein but unchanged mRNA abundances in response to Avicel. Ribosome biogenesis, as well as protein processing and protein export, was also enriched in the protein set that showed increased abundance in response to cellobiose. NCU05895, a homolog of yeast CWH43, is potentially involved in transferring a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to nascent proteins. This protein showed increased abundance but no significant change in mRNA levels. Disruption of CWH43 resulted in a significant decrease in cellulase activities and secreted protein levels in cultures grown on Avicel, suggesting a positive regulatory role for CWH43 in cellulase production. The findings should have an impact on a systems engineering approach for strain improvement for the production of lignocellulases. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - In the present study, pyrolysis of pine needles has been conducted in a semi-batch reactor at different operating parameters such as particle size, temperature and flow rate of nitrogen for bio-oil production. The maximum bio-oil yield of 43.5% was obtained at a temperature of 550 °C, N2 flow rate of 100 ml/min and particle size of 462μ. At the above optimum conditions, catalytic pyrolysis was observed that bio-oil yield decreased up to 35.2%. The analysis of bio-oil by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) shows that zeolite HZSM-5 catalyst increases the production of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and reduces the oxygenated compounds as compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis bio-oil. From the analysis, it has been confirmed that catalytic bio-oil produces more diesel and gasoline range compounds in comparison to non-catalytic bio-oil. In pyrolysis, products such as 2, 5 dimethyl furan compounds have been found that can be easily used as gasoline range compounds as well as rocket engine fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The deactivation of catalyst is a significant reason for its limited application during the catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) process. To reduce the coke formation, binary compound impregnation (BCI) and chemical liquid deposition (CLD) were used to modify HZSM-5 catalysts. At the same time, the self-designed microwave reactor separated the pyrolysis of bamboo and catalytic upgrading of primary vapor, which made the catalytic effect more thorough. Experimental results indicated that CLD used TiO2 deposition to cover external acid sites, while BCI by phosphorus-nickel could cover and partly destroy superficial acid sites through two different ways. Within the scope of the loaded amount studied, the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil phase increased at first and then decreased, while the coke formation reduced continuously. BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene), the most valuable product in bio-oil, drastically increased by 39.1% and 22.6% respectively over the CLD and BCI modified catalysts. Considering the catalytic performance as well as cost, CLD over HZSM-5 has more advantages in the CFP process to upgrade bio-oil. © 2020

AB  - The biodiesel is important as a renewable fuel, but some parameters of the industrial production, such as the use of homogeneous catalysts and the large quantities of residues (wastewater and glycerin) are a problem. In this work, four heterogeneous catalysts were synthesized by the hydrolytic Sol-Gel method for the biodiesel production and to possible reduce the production costs because the catalyst can be reused. The catalyst can also reduce the wastewater and glycerin contaminations. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, basicity determination, and infrared spectroscopy. According to the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels, the biodiesel samples were characterized by specific gravity, copper corrosivity, kinematic viscosity, acidity, Karl Fischer coulometry, and gas chromatography. The wastewaters were characterized by ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy, pH, dissolved oxygen, ashes, and solids (total, volatile, and non-volatile). The wastewater from heterogeneous catalysis was less harmful to the environment and can be easily treated, with reduction of 78.58% of organic residues to be converted by the wastewater treatment. In conclusion, the new catalyst produced biodiesel successfully and showed high catalytic activity (97.58% of ester content and 92.94% of yield), and produced wastewater and glycerin with lower amount of residues (eco-friendly). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Molybdenum supported over activated carbon has been carburized under carbothermal hydrogen reduction conditions at different temperatures in order to modify the carburization degree. The resulting catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, CO chemisorption, XPS, TPR, and TPD-NH3 and compared in the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol in a batch reactor as a lignin-derived model compound. The results have shown that the CO produced during the TPR could be related to the CO chemisorbed and the carburization degree of the material. The carburization degree was shown to increase with the final temperature, and under such conditions, two different Mo species, Mo4+ and Mo3+, were identified in the oxycarbide phase. Catalytic results showed that the Mo2C is less active than the oxycarbide MoOxCy phase. Mo2C showed to improvement in the transalkylation reactions while in the case of MoOxCy, Mo4+ promotes the hydrogenolysis of catechol to benzene while the Mo3+ species was shown to activate hydrogenation reactions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Background: The current production of bioethanol based on lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) highly depends on thermostable enzymes and extremophiles owing to less risk of contamination. Thermophilic bacterial cellulases are preferred over fungi due to their higher growth rate, presence of complex multi-enzymes, stability, and enhanced bioconversion efficiency. Corncob, underutilized biomass, ensures energy conservation due to high lignocellulosic and more fermentable sugar content. In the present study, the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus aerius CMCPS1, isolated from the thermal springs of Manikaran, Himachal Pradesh, India, was characterized in terms of its activity, stability, and hydrolytic capacity. A two-step process comprising: (i) a combined strategy of hydrodynamic cavitation reaction (HCR)-coupled enzymatic (LccH at 6.5 U) pretreatment for delignification and (ii) subsequent hydrolysis of pre-treated (HCR-LccH) corncob biomass (CCB) using a thermostable cocktail of CMCPS1 was adopted to validate the efficiency of the process. Some of the parameters studied include lignin reduction, cellulose increase, and saccharification efficiency. Result: Among the five isolates obtained by in situ enrichment on various substrates, B. aerius CMCPS1, isolated from hot springs, exhibited the maximum hydrolytic activity of 4.11. The GH activity of the CMCPS1 strain under submerged fermentation revealed maximum filter paper activity (FPA) and endoglucanase activity of 4.36 IU mL-1 and 2.98 IU mL-1, respectively, at 44 h. Similarly, the isolate produced exoglucanase and β-glucosidase with an activity of 1.76 IU mL-1 and 1.23 IU mL-1 at 48 h, respectively. More specifically, the enzyme endo-1,4-β-d glucanase E.C.3.2.1.4 (CMCase) produced by B. aerius CMCPS1 displayed wider stability to pH (3-9) and temperature (30-90 °C) than most fungal cellulases. Similarly, the activity of CMCase increased in the presence of organic solvents (118% at 30% acetone v/v). The partially purified CMCase from the culture supernatant of CMCPS1 registered 64% yield with twofold purification. The zymogram and SDS-PAGE analyses further confirmed the CMCase activity with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa. The presence of genes specific to cellulases, such as cellulose-binding domain CelB, confirmed the presence of GH family 46 and β-glucosidase activity (GH3). The multifunctional cellulases of CMCPS1 were evaluated for their saccharification efficiency on laccase (LccH, a fungal laccase from Hexagonia hirta MSF2)-pretreated corncob in a HCR. The lignin and hemicelluloses removal efficiency of HCR-LccH was 54.1 and 6.57%, respectively, with an increase in cellulose fraction (42.25%). The saccharification efficiency of 55% was achieved with CMCPS1 multifunctional cellulases at 50 °C and pH 5.0. Conclusion: The multifunctional cellulase complex of B. aerius CMCPS1 is a potential biocatalyst for application in lignocellulosic biomass-based biorefineries. The saccharification ability of HCR-LccH-pretreated corncob at elevated temperatures would be an advantage for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Macroalgae are a valuable energy source that can be transformed into numerous products most notably fuels and chemicals due to their high content of carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. In order to use macroalgae on a commercial scale, it is essential to evaluate various potential pathways into value-added products as well as intermediate components and technologies. Furthermore, the prospective processes have to be economically competitive while simultaneously offering minimum environmental impact in terms of carbon and other waste emissions. This in turn presents a large decision-making problem with a significant combinatorial complexity. This study addresses this problem by utilizing a superstructure process design approach for a seaweed biorefinery which produces mixed alcohols and mixed organic acids via an anaerobic digestion/volatile fatty acid route. Seventeen design alternatives have been proposed to determine the optimal design and technical feasibility by maximizing the net present value in the most environmentally beneficial manner. The results indicate that biofuel production from macroalgae is economically viable at a minimum ethanol selling price of $1.17 gal-1. Furthermore, the optimal design enables a 90% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that seaweed price is the most important parameter that can contribute in improving the economics, thereby confirming that the cost-effective and efficient large-scale seaweed cultivation is of utmost importance to the success of macroalgae-based biofuel production. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Crude glycerol from biodiesel production is not of high quality due to catalyst and alcohol contamination. A product that could utilize glycerol, excess alcohol and catalysts could enhance the value proposition for the biodiesel industry. Here, we show that glycerol can be reacted with methanol and tert-butanol in the presence of common transesterification catalysts to produce an ether-rich mixture that is miscible with biodiesel. Our studies cover the impact of type and concentration of catalysts, molar ratio of reactants, temperature, and reaction time on alcohol conversion, product yield, selectivity and select fuel properties. Results show both NaOH and H2SO4 are capable of producing etherified blends from glycerol that are miscible with biodiesel. We anticipate the results to be a starting point for the development of an effective fuel additive to recycle the byproduct glycerol and excess alcohol resulting from biodiesel production. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Nickel-based catalysts play an important role in the hydrogen-free deoxygenation for the production of biofuel. The yield and quality of the biofuel are critically affected by the physicochemical properties of NiO supported on nanosized zeolite Y (Y65, crystal size of 65 nm). Therefore, 10 wt% NiO supported on Y65 synthesized by using impregnation (IM) and deposition-precipitation (DP) methods were investigated. It was found that preparation methods have a significant effect on the deoxygenation of triolein. The initial rate of the DP method (14.8 goil•h-1) was 1.5 times higher than that of the IM method (9.6 goil•h-1). The DP-Y65 showed the best deoxygenation performance with a 80.0% conversion and a diesel selectivity of 93.7% at 380 °C within 1 h. The outstanding performance from the DP method was due to the smaller NiO particle size (3.57 ± 0.40 nm), high accessibility (H. F value of 0.084), and a higher Bronsted to Lewis acidity (B/L) ratio (0.29), which has improved the accessibility and deoxygenation ability of the catalyst. The NH4+ released from the decomposition of the urea during the DP process increased the B/L ratio of zeolite NaY. As a result, the pretreatment to convert Na-zeolite to H-zeolite in a conventional zeolite synthesis can be avoided. In this regard, the DP method offers a one-pot synthesis to produce smaller NiO-supported nanosized zeolite NaY with a high B/L ratio, and it managed to produce a higher yield with selectivity towards green diesel via deoxygenation under a hydrogen-free condition. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In the last few decades, consciousness of fossil fuel resources and increased environmental concerns have given the need for emergence of alternative fuel. Biodiesel is one of the potential renewable energies produced from edible and non-edible biomass which could be a potential alternative for petrol-derived diesel. In this work, initially the process of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using potassium hydroxide as catalyst and the process parameters were studied in laboratory. The maximum biodiesel yield of 97% was attained at 75 °C with 1 wt% catalyst concentration and oil-methanol molar ratio of 1:06 at 350 rpm and 90 min. Also, these process conditions were used for biodiesel production in the pilot plant and obtained 97% yield. Overall, mass balance for the pilot plant was studied to analyze the product yield loss. The fatty acid methyl ester formation in the plant was confirmed by characterization with FTIR and 1H NMR. Further, the quality of biodiesel produced was compared for its physiochemical properties with the ASTM standards. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In recent days, the scientific community has been forced to develop renewable fuels due to the demand and increasing cost of conventional fuels. Among the different renewable fuels, biodiesel is a primary renewable fuel produced by the efficient and straightforward process (i.e., catalytic transesterification) with the homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. The heterogeneous catalysts are of greater interest in industrial biodiesel production, offering high activity, easy separation, low cost of production, and high reusability. Various studies have shown that the heterogeneous catalysts of calcium and potassium oxides offer a faster reaction rate. In this context, this study provides an overview of calcium and potassium oxide catalysts derived from waste resources. This study also presents the biomass catalytic preparation method and the optimal process conditions under which high biodiesel yield can be achieved. On the whole, the core objective of this study is to find the feasibility of biomass-derived catalyst in the commercial sector and to determine its suitability for sustainable industrial application. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Process design is a challenging task for researchers and engineers. Incomplete information and variation in input data affect the outputs and reliability of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the designed process. The efficient utilization of waste is becoming increasingly important, and researchers use simulation and modelling tools for design and assessment of waste conversion processes. The complex nature of modelling of waste conversion processes and uncertainty of technical and financial data result in substantial variation in the KPIs of the designed process. In this study, we identified the critical parameters and assumptions that cause uncertainty in the process design analysis of waste-to-biofuels conversions. We used a stochastic modelling approach to address these methodological challenges and performed Monte Carlo simulations on waste-to-biofuel processes. The identified uncertain parameters and inputs were varied for a whole year with a one-minute time step. Different thermochemical conversion pathways were modelled by varying uncertain inputs and assumptions over the year by applying Monte Carlo simulations. Variations in the system's technical and economic KPIs were observed and compared. The results show that the heterogeneous nature of waste is a highly sensitive parameter, and a small change in its elemental analysis varies the technical performance significantly. Similarly, operating hours, plant size, capital investment, waste, and biofuel price are also very influential parameters on process design. Furthermore, the feasibility of waste-to-biofuel systems depends largely on how researchers and engineers select these parameters. Overall, the results reveal that by including the uncertainty of input parameters and assumptions in process design, the biases in results could be addressed transparently, making the overall assessment more reliable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With a high number of diesel vehicles worldwide, particulate emission control is an urgent issue with a global impact, from the health of citizens to commercial future of this technology in some transport segments. Particulate filters are widely used in automotive engines to comply emissions regulations, but current technologies have room for improvement as they add additional backpressure in the exhaust system, and efficient on-board regeneration process is challenging. The Fil-Bio-Diesel Project is a R&D initiative to improve current particle filtration systems, based on the development of novel biomorphic substrates. By replicating the biologic tissue of a wood precursor, a biomorphic silicon carbide with hierarchic orthotropic microstructure can be produced. The porosity, the pore size, and pore orientation of this bioceramic material can be tailored through the selection of a suitable precursor, widening the initially narrow relationship between filtration efficiency and pressure drop that characterizes granular ceramic materials. In this paper the methodology and main results of the Fil-Bio-Diesel Project are presented. This work shows the peculiar advantages of biomorphic silicon carbide through several experimental studies. The results show the potential of this novel filter substrate to be used in future particulate abatement systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study assesses the potential of triisobutane as a sustainable biojet fuel blending component to reduce the environmental impacts caused by the continually growing aviation sector. Cellulosic isobutanol, used as feedstock, was sequentially upgraded through dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation processes to produce triisobutane (2,2,4,6,6-Pentamethylheptane). The dehydration process yield is 99.1% of isobutene, and the achieved conversion of isobutene to triisobutene in the oligomerization stage is 90%. The optimal operation conditions to produce the maximum amount of triisobutene during the isobutene oligomerization are 100 °C, 0.20 MPa, and a space–time τ’ of 5.5 g h/L. Triisobutene is converted quantitatively to triisobutane through a final hydrogenation stage. The production model was simulated using Aspen Plus® v.10 software. The production costs were calculated based on a biorefinery that uses 16,264 kg/h of isobutanol to obtain 10,723 kg/h of triisobutane. The predicted minimum triisobutane selling price is 1.34 €/kg or 1.04 €/L. The environmental assessment carried out in Simapro® v.9.0 software, estimated emissions of the isobutanol upgrade to triisobutane of 7 gCO2eq/MJ. A combined footprint of 65 gCO2eq/MJ is obtained considering the 58 gCO2eq/MJ emitted in isobutanol production, which represents a 28% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared with the conventional Jet A1 production. Physico-chemical properties of triisobutane were estimated using group contribution methods, and the results comply with the ASTM D7566 standards. The Payload vs. Range analysis confirmed the capabilities of triisobutane as a biojet fuel blend component for a given range flight. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

The microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MH) pretreatment was optimized by using a response surface methodology, and the respective maximum reducing sugar yield and saccharification efficiency of 17.59 g/100 g and 33.85%, respectively, were achieved under the pretreatment conditions of microwave power = 120 W, solid-to-liquid ratio = 1:15 (g·mL-1), and time = 3.5 min. The fungal pretreatment with Phanerochaete chrysosporium digestion (PC) achieved the maximum ligninolytic enzyme activities in 6 days with 10% inoculum size at which the reducing sugar yield and saccharification efficiency reached 19.74 g/100 g and 36.29%, respectively. To further improve the pretreatment efficiency, MH and PC pretreatments were combined, but the sequence of MH and PC mattered on the saccharification efficiency. The MH + PC pretreatment (the MH prior to the PC) was better than PC + MH (the PC prior to the MH) in terms of saccharification efficiency. Overall, the MH + PC pretreatment achieved superior reducing sugar yield and saccharification efficiency (25.51 g/100 g and 66.28%, respectively) over all other studied pretreatment methods. The variations of chemical compositions and structure features of the raw and pretreated grain stillage were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results reveal that both MH and PC pretreatments mainly functioned on delignification and decreasing cellulose crystallinity, thus enhancing the enzymatic saccharification of the pretreated grain stillage. The combined MH and PC pretreatment could be a promising method to enable cost-efficient grain stillage utilization for downstream applications such as biofuels.

AB  - The simultaneous use of crude glycerol and euent from anaerobic digestate, both wastes derived from the biofuel industry, were tested in the frame of circular economy concept, as potential low-cost nutrient sources for the cultivation of rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) oil microalgae strain Schizochytrium limacinum SR21. Initially, the optimal carbon and nitrogen concentration levels for high S. limacinum biomass and lipids production were determined, in a culture media containing conventional, high cost, organic nitrogen sources (yeast extract and peptone), micronutrients and crude glycerol at varying concentrations. Then, the effect of a culture media composed of crude glycerol (as carbon source) and euent digestate at varying proportions on biomass productivity, lipid accumulation, proximate composition, carbon assimilation and fatty acid content were determined. It was shown that the biomass and total lipid content increased considerably with varying euent concentrations reaching 49.2 g L-1 at 48% (v/v) of euent concentration, while the lipid yield at the same euent concentration reached 10.15 g L-1, compared to 17.0 g L-1 dry biomass and 10.2 g L-1 lipid yield when yeast extract and peptone medium with micronutrients was used. Compared to the control treatment, the above production was obtained with 48% less inorganic salts, which are needed for the preparation of the artificial sea water. It was shown that Schizochytrium limacinum SR21 was able to remediate 40% of the total organic carbon content of the biofuel wastes, while DHA productivity remained at low levels with saturated fatty acids comprising the main fraction of total fatty acid content. The results of the present study suggest that the simultaneous use of two waste streams from the biofuel industry can serve as potential nutrient sources for the growth of Schizochytrium limacinum SR21, replacing the high cost organic nutrients and up to one half the required artificial sea water salts, but upregulation of DHA productivity through optimization of the abiotic environment is necessary for industrial application, including aqua feed production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Energy security on islands is a challenging issue due to their isolation from energy markets and fossil fuel dependence. In addition, islands' average energy intensity has increased in recent years due to economic development. This research explores the environmental performance of two alternative non-variable bioelectricity feedstocks to increase energy resilience on islands. The study was developed for the Galapagos islands to address the environmental impacts from the direct use of waste cooking oil (WCO) and refined palm oil (RPO) to produce 1 MWh using the life cycle assessment methodological framework. A combination of primary and secondary data sources was used. The results show better performance for the electricity derived from WCO in all the impact categories considered when compared to RPO. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Nano and fine particles have caused serious health problems. Despite the continuous decline of their concentrations, the remaining amounts are still considered a problem in compression ignition engines. This study describes the impact of using biokerosene fuel instead of Iraqi diesel, which is characterised by high sulphur content, on the concentrations of various particulate matter (PM) sizes emitted from engines. A TD 313 Fiat diesel rig (a 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, water-cooled and direct injection engine) was used in the experimental tests. In addition to biofuel (produced from sunflower vegetable oil through a transformation process), Iraqi diesel and kerosene were also used. Four blends were produced, namely, diesel mixed with 10% and 20% volume fractions of biodiesel (denoted as BD 10 and BD 20, respectively) and kerosene added with 10% and 20% biofuel (labelled as KB10 and KB20, respectively). Fuelling the engine with biokerosene significantly reduced PM1.0 by up to 12.3%, 36.65%, 60.92% and 81% and PM2.5 by up to 21.29%, 25%, 41.43% and 51.85% for BD10, BD20, KD10 and KD20, respectively, compared with diesel at varying engine speed. Changing engine load at a constant speed reduced PM10 by up to 12.9%, 21%, 31.6% and 42.7% and total suspended particles by up to 5%, 12%, 21.5% and 25.5% for BD10, BD20, KD10 and KD20, respectively, compared with diesel. The concentrations of all PM sizes were reduced when engine was running at medium speed and load. By contrast, concentrations increased when engine was running at low and high loads and speeds. Results demonstrated that biokerosene is better than biodiesel–diesel blends in reducing PM emissions. © 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University

AB  - Phenolic compounds, which are present in considerable amounts in industrial wastewater, are toxic, even at low concentrations. Most bacteria used in conventional treatment methods for the removal of phenolics are pathogenic, and their biomass does not have an evident commercial value. We evaluated the usability of microalgae for the removal of phenolic compounds from simulated wastewater and as a sustainable oil source for biodiesel production with the aim to render microalgae cultivation more economically attractive. Freshwater and marine microalgae species, Chlorella sp. and Tetraselmis sp., were used to remove phenol, 4-nitrophenol, and 2,4-dinitrophenol, which are commonly found in refinery wastewater. The effect of initial phenolics concentrations on biomass growth and phenolics removal was evaluated and kinetics models were developed to describe the systems. Freshwater Chlorella sp. was grown in a pilot-scale open pond with optimum phenolics concentrations, and oil extracted from the harvested biomass was used to produce biodiesel using an in-house heterogeneous alkaline catalyst. The effects of catalyst amount, methanol:oil molar ratio, and reaction temperature on biodiesel production were determined after 4 h of reaction. The experimental data were used to determine the kinetics parameters of the reaction, and to develop a second-order interactive model that was used to determine the significance of the above parameters and to optimize the process. The optimum conditions were found to be a catalyst wt% of 7.7, methanol:oil molar ratio of 12, and temperature of 45 °C, at which the biodiesel after 4 h was 30.4%. © 2020, University of Tehran.

AB  - According to the report of the renewable energy policy network for the 21st century published in 2014, biodiesel and bioethanol are the most used biofuels and are responsible for transportation worldwide. Biodiesel specially has shown an increase in production globally by 15 times by volume from 2002 to 2012. Promising feedstock of biodiesel are cyanobacteria and microalgae as they possess a shorter cultivation time (4 fold lesser) and high oil content (10 fold higher) than corn, jatropha and soybean (conventional oil-producing territorial plants). Various valuable natural chemicals are also produced from these organisms including food supplements such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), pigments, and vitamins. Additionally, cellular components of microalgae and cyanobacteria are connected with therapeutic characteristics such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral and immune stimulating. Commercialization of algal biodiesel (or other products) can be achieved by isolating and identifying the high-yielding strains that possess a faster growth rate. Indigenous strains can be genetically engineered into high-yielding transgenic strains. The present article discusses about the use of nanotechnology and genetic engineering approach for improved lipid accumulation in microalgae for biodiesel production. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Microalgal biomass sequestrates CO2 and is regarded as a promising renewable feedstock for anaerobic digestion because of its adequate carbohydrate content and lignin-free structure. This study optimizes the dilute-acid pretreatment of Chlorella sp. and subsequent biomethane production using response surface methodology and central composite design with temperature, pretreatment time and solid-to-liquid ratio as variables. A temperature of 64.1 °C, pretreatment time of 1.2 h, and a solid to liquid ratio of 0.29 were the optimal pretreatment conditions and resulted in a methane yield of 302.22 mL CH4/g COD and methane production rate of 110.04 mL CH4/g VSS-d. The severity factor of 1.5–1.6 was adequate to render the Chlorella sp. bioavailable for high methane recovery. The results obtained from the experiments conformed to those predicted by the model. This study effectively utilizes algal biomass for biomethane production and enables the possibility of scaled-up studies using a closed-loop approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims at studying the combustion in a homemade combustion chamber of biofuel briquettes prepared from olive mill solid wastes. Two different samples of briquettes compressed under 150 MPa and 35 °C were investigated: with binder (BOMSW) by adding corn starch and without binder (OMSW). Three combustion regimes were considered: 18, 36, and 55 m3/h, respectively. Seven K-thermocouples were used for temperature measurements. Moreover, the gaseous emission analysis was undertaken. Results show that the flame front propagation velocity reaches maximum values of 11 mm s−1 and 8.54 mm s−1 for OMSW and BOMSW, respectively. We find that the NOx content was higher in the case of the OMSW. On the contrary, the percentages of methane, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide were more significant with the BOMSW. The combustion efficiency was evaluated and gives a higher value with BOMSW. We concluded that the used binder affects seriously the combustion efficiency and the gaseous emissions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Succinic acid (SA), a valuable chemical compound with a broad range of industrial uses, has become a subject of global interest in recent years. The bio-based production of SA by highly efficient microbial producers from renewable feedstock is significantly important, regarding the current trend of sustainable development. Results: In this study, a novel bacterial strain, LU2, was isolated from cow rumen and recognized as an efficient producer of SA from lactose. Proteomic and genetic identifications as well as phylogenetic analysis were performed, and strain LU2 was classified as an Enterobacter aerogenes species. The optimal conditions for SA production were 100 g/L lactose, 10 g/L yeast extract, and 20% inoculum at pH 7.0 and 34 °C. Under these conditions, approximately 51.35 g/L SA with a yield of 53% was produced when batch fermentation was conducted in a 3-L stirred bioreactor. When lactose was replaced with whey permeate, the highest SA concentration of 57.7 g/L was achieved with a yield and total productivity of 62% and 0.34 g/(L*h), respectively. The highest productivity of 0.67 g/(L*h) was observed from 48 to 72 h of batch fermentation, when E. aerogenes LU2 produced 16.23 g/L SA. Conclusions: This study shows that the newly isolated strain E. aerogenes LU2 has great potential as a new biocatalyst for producing SA from whey permeate. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Deoxygenation of fatty acids into liquid hydrocarbons is an efficient method of producing second-generation biofuels from biomass. Herein, we report efficient upgrading of stearic acid into a long-chain hydrocarbon at relatively low reaction temperature (140-220 °C) over a commercial Ru/C catalyst. The conversion process is predominantly through the hydrodecarboxylation pathway and not hydrodeoxygenation since heptadecane and not octadecane is found as the main product with the detection of CO2 in the gaseous products. The effects of process parameters including the solvent type (hexane, dodecane, isopropanol, water, and solvent-free), solvent volume, hydrogen pressure, catalyst loading, mass of feedstock, reaction temperature and reaction time on the conversion of stearic acid were systematically studied and optimized and the reusability of the catalyst was also studied. Hexane is found to be the most suitable solvent for the catalytic system. Under the optimized reaction conditions, 100% stearic acid conversion can be achieved at even 160 °C alongside a 90.1% yield of heptadecane. The apparent activation energy of the hydrodecarboxylation process over the commercial Ru/C catalyst was calculated to be 58.6 kJ mol-1. Notably, the reusability potential of the Ru/C catalyst is slightly limited by the accumulation of carbon deposits across multiple usage cycles. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Traditional approaches for corn stover utilization create an inhomogeneous, whole plant mixture that does not achieve performance and cost targets for biofuel production. The improvement of conversion performance will require one to gain a fundamental understanding of the inherent cellular structure and ash content in the process. This study investigated cellular structure and inorganic species contents with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), advanced energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and wet analytical chemistry methods. These techniques provided a complementary means to understand variability within the dynamic cell walls and the distributions of inorganic species at the anatomical and tissue scales for various corn stover fractions. Material properties were investigated for bales from in-field storage scenarios ranging from mild to severe biological degradation. Results show that stem, cob, and leaf tissues all maintained cell wall and surface structure integrity after mild biological degradation. However, severe degradation (with spontaneous heating) caused remarkable structural distortion and cell wall shrinkage for all tissue types. Inorganic species quantitation data shows that three fractions of severe degradation have slightly reduced total ash, 4.91% vs 3.92% for cobs, 7.28% vs 5.98% for stems, and 14.21% vs 13.07% for leaves. Silica contents also decreased (2.67% vs 1.83% for cobs, 3.60% vs 2.89% for stems, and 9.72% vs 8.48% for leaves), likely due to the loss of extrinsic inorganic species. SEM-EDS inorganic species mapping of stems demonstrated that severe biological degradation caused the translocation of the dominant silicon elements from pith to rind tissue as well as a reduction of potassium in the stem. These findings offer detailed knowledge of feedstock variability at the anatomical tissue level that can be used to inform the development of advanced processing strategies. Innovative storage and selective fractionation processes have the potential to manage low-quality fractions/tissues and remove unfavorable inorganic species for efficient conversion of corn stover as well as other lignocellulosic biomass.

AB  - NiO and CaO catalysts with different weight percentages were used as catalysts in pyrolysis to investigate the feasibility of producing biofuels from Bambusa balcooa. Non-catalytic bio-oil was dominated by aromatic (23.74 %), acids (18.07 %), and alcohols (20.02 %) while optimized catalysts NiO and CaO increased the rate of ketonization in pyrolysis of Bambusa balcooa and decreased the mass yield of acids to 6.31 % and 9.06 % respectively. The quality of bio-oil obtained from catalytic tests was compared to the non-catalytic tests in terms of its product distribution, gasoline range hydrocarbon, viscosity, pH, flash point and fire point. It was observed that 0.5 wt.% NiO and 5 wt.% CaO contained a high yield of gasoline range hydrocarbon reaching 66.75 % and 73.47 %, respectively. In addition to the chemical composition, lower viscosity of the pyrolytic oil shows 0.5 % NiO as a better catalyst in pyrolysis systems to produce enhanced quality bio-oil. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Emulsification is a cost effective and simple method to use pyrolysis oil (or bio-oil) along with diesel as an emulsified fuel. Several combinations of emulsifiers, such as Span 80 and Atlox 4916, Span 80 and Zephrym PD3315, and Atlox 4916 and Zephrym PD3315, were tested to obtain stable emulsions. Two set of reactors (ultrasonicator and agitator-based mechanical reactor system) were used for the process. The ether-extracted pyrolysis oil (EEO), emulsifier, and diesel content of 10%–15%, 3%, and 82–87% were exposed to an ultrasonic power of 40% and with an agitation rate of 900 rpm. The emulsions obtained using Span 80 and Zephrym PD3315 showed stratification within 10 min. The emulsions for Span 80 and Atlox 4916 with a ratio of 3/15/82 for Emulsifer/EEO/Diesel, and for Atlox 4916 and Zephrym PD3315 emulsifiers with a ratio of 3/10/87 for Emulsifer/EEO/Diesel remained stable for more than 15 days. The functional groups analysis showed the stability of the emulsion for Span 80 and Atlox 4916, whereas a change in the absorbance intensity was observed when Atlox 4916 and Zephrym PD3315 were used, indicating stratification. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The present study aims to study the effect of low viscous biofuel, namely pine oil (PO) and orange oil (O) blending with Jatropha methyl ester (JOME) along with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on NO-smoke tradeoff in a single-compression ignition (CI) engine. Two blends of pine oil and orange oil (30% by volume) with JOME were prepared and tested at 10%, 15%, and 20% EGR rates for various load conditions and compared with base fuels. JOME operation increased NO emission by 4% and reduced smoke opacity by 10% in comparison to diesel at maximum load condition. Poor physical properties of JOME, namely high viscosity and inferior volatility leads to reduced brake thermal efficiency with higher HC and CO emissions. Blends of JOME with low viscous biofuel reduces smoke emission with a further increase in NO emission in comparison to JOME as a result of combustion enhancement. Addition of EGR with JOME70 + PO30 and JOME70 + O30 aids in the reduction of NO emission with a slight increase in smoke opacity. Considering the NO-smoke tradeoff, JOME70 + O30 + EGR (10%) is optimum, NO emission is reduced by 14% and 11% in comparison to JOME and diesel and smoke opacity is reduced by 5% and 15% in comparison to JOME and diesel at maximum load, respectively. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Lignin depolymerization is a very promising process which can generate value-added products from lignin raw materials. The main objective of lignin depolymerization is to convert the complex molecules of lignin into small molecules. Nevertheless, lignin is natural polymer which the molecules of lignin are extremely complicated due to their natural variability, and it will be a big challenge to depolymerize lignin, particularly high water yield. The various technology and methods are developed to depolymerize lignin into biofuels or bio chemical products including acid/base/metallic catalyzed lignin depolymerization, pyrolysis of lignin, hydroprocessing, and gasification. The distribution and yield of chemical products depend on the reaction operation condition, type of lignin and kind of catalyst. The reactor type, product distributions and specific chemicals (benzene, toluene, xylene, terephthalic acid) production of lignin depolymerization are intensive discussed in this review.

AB  - The aim of this work is to study the influence of the physicochemical characteristics of neem seeds, according to their mass and oil content, on the production of biodiesel. After the physical characterization of the seeds and extraction of the oil (triglycerides), biodiesel was produced from crude neem seed oil by transesterification with ethanol in the presence of sodium hydroxide. This study shows that the physicochemical characteristics of these seeds vary according to the origin of the samples. The seeds from Zidim, with a mass average of 200 seeds evaluated at 141.36 g and an almond content of 40.70%, have better characteristics compared to those collected in the city of Maroua, with average values evaluated at 128.00 g and 36.05%, respectively. Almonds have an average lipid content of 53.98 and 56.75% for the Maroua and Zidim samples, respectively. This study also reveals that neem oil, by its physicochemical characteristics, has a satisfactory quality for a valorization in the production of biodiesel. However, its relatively high free fatty acid content is a major drawback, which leads to a low yield of biodiesel, evaluated on average at 89.02%, and requires a desacidification operation to improve this yield. The analysis of biodiesel indicates physicochemical characteristics close and comparable to those of petrodiesel, particularly in terms of calorific value, density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, evaluated at 41.00 MJ/kg, 0.803, 4.42 cSt, and 0.130 mg/g, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The continuous rising demands and fluctuations in the prices of fossil fuels warrant the search for an alternative renewable energy source to manage the present energy crisis. Thereby, ongoing research activities are actively engaged in developing an environmentally clean synthesis of biodiesel from agro-waste via an oleaginous bacterium process. A potent oleaginous bacterial strain has been isolated from poultry industry wastewater. On the basis of morphology, biochemical and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, the strain has been identified as Bacillus cereus (MF 908505), which enables 3.1 g L-1 lipid productivity, and the satisfactory production of 5.1 g L-1 cell dry weight with 36% (w/w) lipid content using pomegranate waste-peel as a substrate. 37 °C temperature, 7% carbon source and 140 rpm agitation speed with a 72 h incubation period are found to be the optimum lipid production conditions. Lipids are then extracted and transesterified under the optimized reaction conditions using 0.2% Ca(OH)2 as a base catalyst and a 1 : 6 bacterial oil to methanol ratio, at 70 °C for 90 min reaction time, which, under these conditions, enables an 85% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield. The esterified FAMEs were subjected to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) measurements, revealing the presence of benzenesulphonic acid methyl esters and methyl esters, thus, doubtlessly, supporting the formation of biodiesel. The resulting FAMEs were characterized further by means of various tools and the properties of the obtained biodiesel were found to match those of standard biodiesel, i.e. ASTM D6751. These results suggest the potential suitability of Bacillus cereus (MF 908505) lipids for use as an agro-waste substrate in the biodiesel conversion process.

AB  - Bio-based hydrocarbon fuels made from carbonaceous wastes are a renewable and potentially carbon neutral alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Pyrolysis biofuels are limited largely because of a poor overall energy balance along with the fuel's high viscosity and high oxygen content. This study explores an integrated biorefinery approach to manage Brewer's Spent Grain (BSG) waste that combines in situ catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis fuel with production of value-added products to improve process economics. By incorporating silver nitrate via a wet impregnation method into BSG prior to pyrolysis, non-condensable gas (particularly hydrogen and ethane) production dramatically increases, while the evolution of methane is largely unchanged. Critically, the peak temperatures at which pyrolysis gases evolve are decreased by the incorporation of silver, suggesting that this process could lower required pyrolysis temperatures. The silver-treated pyrolysis bio-oil showed a considerable increase in furfural, an important precursor in many chemical processes. The silver-impregnated biomass also showed a decrease in 2-methyl-propanal and 2-methyl-butanal yields, and virtually eliminated detectable anthracene and pyrene. In conjunction with the evolved gas results, it is likely that molecular rearrangement and dehydrogenation pathways, as opposed to a complete thermochemical cracking of the bio-oil fraction, are responsible for the catalytic behavior observed. After pyrolysis, the biochar can be oxidized to yield bio-templated, green-synthesized silver micro- and nanomaterials. The integrated biorefinery approach offers a novel path for upgrading pyrolysis biofuels, unifying synthesis of micro- and nanostructured materials and fuel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, production of hydrocarbon fuel from Mahua oil has been characterised for diesel engine application, by appraising essential fuel processing parameters. As opposed to traditional trans-esterification process, the reported oil was identified by using heterogeneous catalysts, as the latter improves the fuel properties better than the former. Therefore, interest has been taken in utilising heterogeneous catalyst such as Coal fly ash (CFA) for biofuel production process. From the experimental investigation it was observed that performance results such as BTE for B25 blend show marginally lower value to sole fuel at all loads and NOx emission for B100 blend exhibit significantly lower value than sole fuel. Smoke emission for B25 show the increasing trend that of other blends. However, CO, HC emission for B25 shows the marginal increases when compared to the sole fuel and the combustion analysis of B25 blend showed almost similar trend of sole fuel. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Rapid depletion of petroleum fuels with high fluctuating market prices have enforced mankind to switch for an alternate fuel. The present investigation reports a comparison on the effect of Induction heating and LPG heating for acid hydrolysis of cocoa pod biomass (CPB) to carryout ABE fermentation for the production of biobutanol. The effect of Sulphuric acid (H2SO4), CPB load and residence time on release of total sugar was studied and optimized using Central Composite Design (CCD). The optimum condition for the pretreatment by induction heating was found to be 3.05 (%v/v) of H2SO4, 11.51 (%w/v) of CPB and 41.43 min of residence time with 36.26 g/L of total sugar. Similarly for LPG heating an optimum of 25.66 g/L of total sugar released with pretreatment condition 4.03 (%v/v) of H2SO4, 6.53 (%w/v) of CPB and 64 min of residence time was observed. The treatment of high biomass load with low concentration of acid in lesser time makes induction heating energy efficient and cost effective. The CPB hydrolysate produced through Induction and LPG heating was allowed to undergo anaerobic fermentation, using Clostridium acetobutilicum MTCC11274. The ABE yield produced using induction assisted CPB hydrolysate was 5.04 ± 0.32 g/L of acetone, 11.73 ± 0.84 g/L butanol and 1.43 ± 0.04 ethanol in 312 h with total ABE of 18.25 ± 1.17 g/L. The resulted ABE fermentation yield was higher than the LPG assisted CPB hydrolysate with 1.69 ± 0.17 g/L acetone, 3.36 ± 0.27 g/L butanol and 0.22 ± 0.08 g/L ethanol with total ABE of 5.27 ± 0.51 g/L. The less energy consumption, higher conversion of carbohydrate and great fermentability of hydrolysate makes induction assisted acid pretreatment method significant in biofuel industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Copper mining in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the mid-19th century generated millions of tons of mining waste, called stamp sand, which was deposited into various offshoots of Lake Superior. The toxic stamp sand converted the area into barren, fallow land. Without a vegetative cover, stamp sand has been eroding into the lakes, adversely affecting aquatic life. Our objective was to perform a greenhouse study, to grow cold-tolerant oilseed crops camelina (Camelina sativa) and field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) on stamp sand, for the dual purpose of biofuel production and providing a vegetative cover, thereby decreasing erosion. Camelina and field pennycress were grown on stamp sands in columns, using compost to supply nutrients. A greenhouse study in wooden panels was also done to evaluate the effectiveness of camelina in reducing erosion. Results show that camelina significantly reduced erosion and can also be used commercially for generating biodiesel. A 25-fold reduction in Cu content in the surface run-off was observed in the panels with camelina compared to those of the control. Stamp sand-grown camelina seeds contained 20% and 22.7% oil and protein respectively, and their fatty acid composition was similar to previous studies performed on uncontaminated soils. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of levulinic acid (LA) aldol condensation product dimers was studied between 250 and 300 °C and 50 bar H2 in a batch reactor with Ru catalyst supported on mesoporous zirconia. During the reaction, the unsaturated dimers, which contained ketone groups and double bonds, were hydrogenated to saturated dimers. A greater degree of deoxygenation was achieved at higher temperatures, and oxygen was removed as water and CO2. Oxygen removal was evidenced by elemental analysis and infrared spectroscopy, in which the C=O peak decreased with increasing temperature. A drawback of high reaction temperature (300 °C) was a minor degree of oligomerization. The formation of aromatics was also observed at the higher temperatures. Aside from the saturated dimers, volatile products were obtained at all temperatures, including ketones, acids, and esters. This study demonstrates for the first time the potential of LA dimers as a sustainable route from lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and biocomponents. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - As the shortage of non-renewable fossil fuels, the renewable fuels should be further developed. Biomass energy has emerged the great utilization potential, and liquefaction of biomass is a typical technology. This paper studied the effect of the operation parameters on the hydrothermal liquefaction of corn straw using a batch reactor, including liquefaction temperature, initial pressure, retention time, solvent, and catalyst. The optimal liquefaction conditions for corn straw were 300 °C under 4 MPa for 15 min using the mixture of water and methanol as the solvent. After the addition of catalyst, NKC-11 catalyst showed the excellent performance, and the primary components were phenol and derivatives, alkane, furan, and the low concentration of organic acids. Lastly, the life cycle assessment on the hydrothermal liquefaction of corn straw for bio-oil production was executed. The results of LCA suggested that a net 1.31 kg of CO2 equivalent was produced for 1 kg of bio-oil product without considering syngas, while the value changed to 13.03 kg with considering syngas. Moreover, the results of sensitivity analysis further suggested that the syngas was a key factor on the environmental impacts in the hydrothermal liquefaction of corn straw process. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fly ash (FA), a by-product of coal combustion, is considered as waste due to its high content of lime and other impurities and is either disposed of in landfills or recycled. Utilization of waste FA as a starting material for the synthesis of zeolite catalysts is a promising solution to reuse this waste. Meanwhile, de-oiled Millettia (Pongamia) pinnata seed waste (PPW) is produced in large amounts from the bio-oil extraction process. This waste is of no value due to its toxicity. However, it was previously shown that the fast pyrolysis of PPW to produce biofuels resulted in oleic acid and other oxygenated (O)-compounds as the main composition (67.2%) with smaller levels of hydrocarbons (HCs). In this work, the catalytic upgrading fast pyrolysis of PPW over the FA-derived ZSM-5 (FA-ZSM-5) and zeolite X (FA-X) catalysts to enhance the formation of HCs was performed using a pyrolyzer interfaced with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS), using various biomass to catalyst (B:C) weight ratios (1:1, 1:5 and 1:10). The FA-ZSM-5 and FA-X were derived from FA by alkali hydrothermal and alkali fusion methods, respectively. The result demonstrated that the pyrolysis vapors of PPW had a high content of undesirable components, such as carboxylic acids, oleic acid and other O-compounds (67.2%), whereas the aliphatic and aromatic HC contents were markedly lower. The presence of the synthesized FA-ZSM-5 or FA-X catalysts resulted in a major improvement in the pyrolysis vapor quality. Selectivity on total HCs (aliphatic and aromatic) was significantly increased with greater catalyst contents for both FA-ZSM-5 (90.6%) and FA-X (84.9%). FA-ZSM-5 exhibited a high selectivity for aromatic HCs (82.6%) while zeolite-X showed a higher selectivity towards aliphatic HCs (71.0%). The level of O-compounds was substantially decreased to 1.12% and 21.9% with FA-ZSM-5 at a B:C ratio of 1:10 and FA-X at a B:C ratio of 1:5, respectively. In addition, FA-ZSM-5 and FA-X reduced the content of nitrogenated-compounds from 24.8% (no catalyst) to 8.3% and 0.0%, respectively. Overall, the results suggest that FA-ZSM-5 had a higher HC selectivity and was more effective in promoting deoxygenation reactions, whereas FA-X significantly enhanced the denitrogenation reaction. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In this study biodiesel was produced from waste sunflower cooking oil and ethanol using N,N′,N″-tris(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-guanidine as new catalyst, which allows to avoid unwanted side-reaction of saponification. The influence of process variables on the conversion was investigated using experimental design and response surface methodology. Independent factors were varied in the following range: molar ratio of alcohol/oil from 3:1 to 15:1; catalyst concentration from 0.5 to 3 wt%; reaction temperature from 40 to 80 °C; and reaction time from 40 to 200 min. An empirical model of the process was developed. With this model and the goals of minimizing the independent factors in the tested range and maximizing the conversion, the optimization resulted in the following conditions: 1.13 wt% of catalyst, a molar ratio of 11.16:1, temperature of 67.96 °C, and a reaction time of 80 min. With those optimal conditions, the conversion predicted by the model was 94.6%. © 2019

AB  - Solid acid carbon catalysts were prepared by activating hydrothermal carbon with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to form high surface area carbon and using an environmentally benign L-cysteine method for subsequent sulfonation. The textural and physical properties of the solid acid catalysts were characterized by different techniques including Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in order to understand the functionalization of sulfonic acids on the carbon support. The catalytic activity of the carbon-based materials towards biofuel production was studied by using the esterification of oleic acid as a prime example. A quantitative yield of 95 % fatty acid methyl ester was achieved using the high surface area sulfonated catalyst (HSC-SO3H with SA=1751 m2/g) at 80 °C for 4 hours at 1 atm with 10 wt. % of catalyst loading and at a 10 : 1 molar ratio of methanol/oleic acid. Sulfonation of carbon with L-cysteine represents a promising technique to obtain solid acid catalysts, which are expected to be useful for other applications in Lewis-acid catalysis, separations, and beyond. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Concerns on environmental change, high-energy costs, and diminishing oil reserves have compelled a robust interest for the exploration of alternative energy sources. Current study was aimed to prepare biodiesel from waste cooking oil collected from restaurant and domestic kitchen, and to compare their fuel properties. To obtain high yield of biodiesel, some important variables such as methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration, and reaction temperature were varied. Results showed that highest yield of biodiesel was obtained at 1.5% catalyst concentration by restaurant oil at 6:1 methanol/oil at 65°C. Acid value, free fatty acid content, specific gravity, and kinematic viscosity were in accordance to ASTM standards. Cloud and pour point for both the oils was less than 14°C. Flash point and cetane index of restaurant biodiesel samples were according to the standards proposed by ASTM. Restaurant waste oil biodiesel showed better fuel properties as compared to domestic waste oil and can be suggested as an effective environmental-friendly source for biodiesel production. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - There has been an increased interest as regards the use of biofuels in aviation gas turbine engines due to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions along with fluctuating jet fuel prices. This work researches the use of soap-derived biokerosene (SBK) in aircraft engines. SBK is a promising biofuel option for emerging tropical countries as its production requires a relatively simple technology, and its feedstock sources are abundant in these countries. Blends of Jet A-1 with up to 20 vol.% SBK were tested on a 1S/60 Rover gas turbine engine over a range of brake powers to measure engine performance and emissions. The results were then compared to those of pure Jet A-1. It shows that the engine running on SBK/Jet A-1 blends and pure Jet A-1 have almost similar engine performance parameters including engine efficiency, specific fuel consumption (SFC), turbine inlet temperature (TIT), and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). On the other hand, increasing the volume fraction of SBK in the fuel blends with Jet A-1 leads to a slight increase in carbon monoxide (CO) and HC emissions, while insignificant differences in the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were found. From this study, some valuable recommendations could be found to improve the feasibility of SBK for use as an alternative aviation fuel. © 2020 The Authors. Published by SAE International.

AB  - Pelleted fertiliser production represents improvements in fertiliser management and ensures several benefits, such as a more accurate dosing (less applications), the slow-release of long-lasting nutrients, the possible application during the whole year, easier storage and transportation and better separation of fertilisers and pesticides. The present research investigated the physical-mechanical properties of a pelleted chicken litter organic fertiliser. The pellet samples' particle density ρ (kg·m-3), mechanical durability DU (%), compressive strengths in the cleft σc (N·mm-1) and in simple pressure σp (MPa) were investigated. The last two indicators, σc and σp, demonstrated the pellets' resistance to the compressive stress. The resulting values proved ρ = 1 289.73 kg·m-3, DU = 95.5%, σc = 58.61 N·mm-1 and σp = 20.02 MPa, while all the results were evaluated positively. The observed level of the DU (%) did not achieve the mandatory level for the commercial production of pellets (DU = 97.5%), however, such a level is stated for a pellet solid biofuel intended for energy production. Therefore, the achieved level of the DU (%) represents a satisfactory result within the investigated pellet samples' mechanical quality. In general, the viability and practicability of chicken litter pellet production was proven, as well as, the suitability of such a feedstock for pellet production. Moreover, the observed results proved a high level of the investigated pellet samples' mechanical quality. © 2020 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Ni-ZSM-5 catalyst, under four different factors of Swida wilsoniana pyrolysis products of catalytic hydrogenation, GC-MS, FI-IR, and elemental analyzers, was used to identify the elements, carbon chain distribution, and composition of the products. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and catalyst hydrogenation level on the conversion rate were investigated. The reaction pressure and the amount of catalyst are the main factors that affect the conversion of the pyrolysis products into biofuels. Using 1.05 wt.% Ni-ZSM-5 catalyst, the highest conversion rate was 98.10% at 173°C and 2.00 MPa. The results show that Swida wilsoniana-decomposed products can be converted to high-quality biofuels by catalytic hydrogenation of Ni-ZSM-5 and can be used as an alternative energy source. © 2020 Aihua Zhang et al.

AB  - Scenedesmus obliquus is a locally available microalgae in the north-eastern region of India. Pyrolysis of Scenedesmus obliquus has been performed in a fixed-bed vertical reactor, at 350 to 550 °C temperature range with 40 °C/min heating rate. The physicochemical properties of the solid and liquid yields were investigated. The influence of temperature on the amount of product yields was analysed. The highest bio-oil yield of 20.42% and bio-char yield of 58.63% were achieved at 500 °C and 350 °C, respectively. 1H NMR and FTIR were performed for the bio-oil characterisation. The higher heating value of the bio-oil was found to be highest 32.97 MJ/kg at 550 °C. SEM-EDX, FTIR, and XRD techniques were used for the bio-char analysis and characterisation. The resulted char was found to be porous, amorphous, heterogeneous, and basic in nature. The present work suggests Scenedesmus obliquus as a potential candidate for the production of energy substituting conventional fuel sources. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present study undertakes the research problem on the optimization of production of biodiesel as a renewable energy resource from the transesterification of soybean oil and ethanol. Predictive modelling and surface analysis techniques were applied based on the artificial neural network search algorithm to correlate the yield of ethyl ester and glycerol and the input parameters. The formulated models accurately predicted the yield of the products with a high coefficient of determination. When the reaction time is low, the ester yield decreases with an increase in temperature and the maximum yield of obtained biodiesel at a very low value of time of reaction and temperature. Plots based on parametric and sensitivity analysis reveals that the yield of ethyl ester can be maximized and that of glycerol minimized at an integrated condition with lower ethanol/oil molar ratio, higher temperature value, higher catalyst concentration value, and longer time of reaction. The global sensitivity analysis reveals that the catalyst concentration and temperature of the reaction influence the yield of ethyl ester the most. In addition, an optimal ethyl ester yield of 95% can be achieved at specific input conditions. Moreover, according to the results of global sensitivity analysis, the catalyst concentration is found to be most significant for both the glycerol and ethyl ester yield. © 2020 Sri Krishna Murthy et al.

AB  - Residual lipids with high fatty acid content represent an important source of raw material for renewable biofuels. They are not suitable for the production of biodiesel via alkaline transesterification but can be converted to biodiesel via esterification. For these feedstocks, hydrodeoxygenation is suitable for producing hydrocarbons. However to limit hydrogen consumption, thermal processes are also object of studies. In these thermal processes nickel has been used in the form of supported catalysts but has not been well studied in the form of mixed oxides. This work aims at studying the Ni/Al ratio influence on the properties of unsupported mixed oxides prepared from layered double hydroxides (LDH) precursors, to evaluate their performance in the fast pyrolysis of myristic acid (MA) as a model compound of residual acidic lipids. Prepared materials had molar ratios Ni/Al = 0.3, 1 and 3. The catalysts were obtained through calcination of the precursors, and were characterized by XRD, TGA, FTIR, N2 adsorption isotherms, TPD of NH3 and EDX analysis. Myristic acid pyrolysis, with catalyst:MA mass ratio of 5:1, was carried out in a micropyrolyzer at 550 °C, and the products were analyzed through online GC/MS. Results show that the obtained catalysts presented a rather high surface area, important mesoporosity and NiO and NiAl2O4 crystalline phases. The catalysts with the highest Al content favored cracking with the production of hydrocarbons in the gasoline range, while the sample with highest Ni content favored the production of hydrocarbons in the kerosene range. The catalyst obtained with the combination of Ni/Al = 1 presented the highest surface area and acidity and the lowest NiO crystallite size, resulting in the best MA conversion (∼84 %) and deoxygenation degree. It also produced the highest yield in aromatic compounds due to the higher acidity and hydrogen transfer, compared to other catalysts. The present results confirm that catalytic reaction under pyrolysis conditions is able to identify some intrinsic properties of catalysts using model molecules as starting feed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the design point performance of a custom engine via GasTurb software. In this study, a turbojet engine model is simulated without afterburners and limited to design point (DP) simulation at a speed of 15,000 rpm. The input parameters such as pressure ratio (PR) for the main components, the mechanical and burner efficiency, and isotropic PR for compressor and turbine have been identified for a custom engine as a design point. The results compared at different levels of the condition using GasTurb-13 and GSP-11 software. It was found that each software was able to provide similar results at various conditions tested. There are small differences in the values for the fuel flow and specific fuel consumption. Also, the same results were obtained at the baseline point. Furthermore, the heating value has a primary effect on specific fuel consumption. It was also found that the optimal thrust value was at 34.2 kN, and the best value for optimal specific fuel consumption was 20.9 g/kN.s. The main factors affecting biofuel properties are calorific value and viscosity. When the calorific value of the fuel is reduced, the thrust FN and specific fuel consumption increase. For example, Methanol and Ethanol recorded the highest amount of fuel consumption, which is 54.72 g/KN. s and 47.56 g/(KN. s), respectively. This is because they have the highest mass fuel flow (1.79 kg/s for Methanol, and 1.54 kg/s for Ethanol) than other types of fuel, while the mass fuel flow for green diesel (0.78 kg/s) was lower than other fuels, so its specific fuel consumption (22.11 g/(KN. s) was lesser than other fuels. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel, as a green and renewable biofuel, has great potential to replace fossil diesel. The development of efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts is vital to produce bio-diesel in an efficient and green way. Nanocatalysts provide a high surface-to-volume ratio as well as high active site loading and can improve mass transfer, which is beneficial to enhance their catalytic activity. Objective: The review focuses on the latest advances in the production of biodiesel using nanostruc-tured catalysts. Methods: Biodiesel is mainly produced through esterification and transesterification reaction using acids, bases or lipases as catalysts. We mainly review the synthesis methods and physicochemical properties of various basic, acidic and lipase nanocatalysts. Meanwhile, their catalytic activities in biodiesel production are also discussed. Results: Alkali nanocatalysts are mainly suitable for transformation of oils with low acid values to biodiesel via transesterification reaction. In contrast, acidic nanocatalysts are not sensitive to water as well as free fatty acids and can avoid saponification associated with basic nanocatalysts while pro-mote simultaneous esterification and transesterification reaction. However, acid-catalyzed trans-esterification usually requires harsh reaction conditions. In addition, the lipase-catalyzed process is also suitable for non-edible oils containing high contents of free fatty acids, which possess environmental and economic advantages. Conclusion: Nanocatalysts have many advantages such as good accessibility with nanostructure, high active site loading and reduction of mass transfer resistance. However, most of those materials undergo deactivation after several cycles. Therefore, the development of more efficient, stable, and low-cost nanocatalysts is desirable for producing biodiesel. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Increased energy consumption leads to a reduction in limited nonrenewable resources called fossil fuels. Due to this fact, researchers look for alternative energy sources to satisfy the need of the current generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. As a result, nowadays the production of energy from biological sources is highly applicable and takes advantage of fossil fuel due to the limited impact on the environment. On the other hand, food cost, land use for some other purposes, and carbon emissions have risen due to the increased production of first-generation bioethanol. Even though the second-generation bioethanol from lignocellulose agricultural waste solved this problem, it again faced difficulties-to-overcome technological barriers. This, in turn, pushed researchers to come up with another alternative called the third-generation biofuel production. The renewed promise is held in microalgae biomass as an alternative feedstock. This review deals with the important aspects of biofuel production from algae as a renewable resource. The production processes and their merits and demerits of algae capacity in producing biofuel are also discussed. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuel derived from lignocellulosic biomasses recently emerged as one of the most suitable environmental friendly substrates that cannot only lead the renewable energy, but also minimizing the emission of greenhouse gases. Lignocellulosic materials are considered to be the major components as of yet unexploited source of for bioethanol production. The main aim of the current works was to discover the optimal bioethanol production from a local wild plants biomass Quercus aegilops, which are very common in Kurdistan region, Iraq. Pretreatment with different sulfuric acid concentrations at varied reaction times and temperatures was used. Three-step conversion process, separate hydrolysis, and fermentation (SHF) were used to evaluate the conversion of both cellulose and hemicellulose to monomeric sugars, and ethanol production. The results showed that the maximum yields of glucose and xylose were 5.7 g L−1 and 21.1 g L−1, respectively, when the biomass pretreated with 15% total solid, 2% acid concentrations at 120 °C for 120 min. During 48 h of enzymatic hydrolysis, the maximum glucose and xylose concentrations were 5.97 g L−1 and 17.53 g L−1, respectively, showing a conversion rate of 21.8% and 80.1% for the corresponding sugars. The highest ethanol yield of 6.01 g L−1 at 96 h fermentation with the productivity of 0.049 g L−1 h−1 was obtained when fermentation carried out with Pichia Stipitis yeast strain, while the maximum ethanol concentration and ethanol yield the productivity of 6.93 g L−1 and of 0.242 g L−1 h−1, respectively, were obtained during 24 h of fermentation by Kluyveromyces marxianus yeast strain. From the outcomes, it was obvious that K. marxianus was the favored yeast strain to be used for the generation of bioethanol from leaves of Q. aegilops, and Q. aegilops has potential to be exploited as a native, abundant raw material for the production of ethanol. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuels are fuels produced from hydrocarbon rich living organisms such as plants or microalgae by thermal chemical or biochemical conversion process. Biofuels such as biodiesel, biogas and syngas are combusted to generate energy. Biodiesel is an ecofriendly and an alternate of renewable diesel fuel. It is defined as an alternative fuel for diesel engines produced by chemically reacting a vegetable oil or animal fat with an alcohol such as methanol or mono-Alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from a renewable lipid feed stock. It is typically produced by reacting the fatty acids with alcohol in the presence of catalyst to produce the desired mono-Alkyl esters and glycerol. After reaction, the glycerol, catalyst, and any remaining alcohol or fatty acids are removed from the mixture. The alcohol used in the reaction is typically methanol, although ethanol and higher alcohols have been used also. The majority of the biodiesel currently produced is made from soybean oil and this soya biodiesel consists of the five methyl esters. While neat (i.e., 100%) biodiesel can be used, a blend of between 2 and 20% (by volume) of biodiesel with petro-diesel fuel is recommended to avoid engine-compatibility problems. With a flash point of 160°C, it is classified as non-flammable, biodegradable and non-Toxic fuel. Biodiesel has emits much lower emissions than petro diesel and it can also be mixed with petro diesel to reduce emissions. For example B20 is a fuel containing 20% biodiesel and 80% petro diesel. Pure biodiesel is B100. Biodiesel reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 78%, and carbon monoxide emissions by 50%. It also does not have sulphur emissions. The purpose of this work is to study the development of biodiesel process at pilot plant scale using plant origin oil as the raw material with methanol and sodium hydroxide as the catalyst and evaluate the produced biodiesel as a fuel. It may lead to a revolutionary transformation of the current economic and energy scenario with an era of economic bloom and prosperity for our society. © 2020 Plant Archives. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Liquid C8-C15 long-chain alkanes, as the main components of jet fuels or diesel, can be synthetized from abundant and renewable biomass derivatives by extending the car-bon-chain length through cascade C-C coupling over acidic catalysts and hydrodeoxygenation over metal particles. Objective: This research aims to develop a carbon-increasing catalytic process through the dimeriza-tion of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol to produce the C11 oxygenate bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane. Methods: In this work, 5-methylfurfural, derivable from sugars, could be reduced to the expensive 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol over Cs2 CO3 using an eco-friendly hydride polymethylhydrosiloxane. In the subsequent carbon-increasing process, a solid acidic nanocatalyst 3-chlorpyridine phosphotungstic acid (3-ClPYPW) was developed to be efficient for the conversion of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol to bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane under mild reaction conditions. Results: A good bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane yield of 51.6% was obtained using dichloro-methane as a solvent at a low temperature of 70°C in 11 h. The solid nanocatalyst was able to be reused for at least four cycles without a remarkable loss of catalytic activity. The kinetic study proved that the reaction is a first-order reaction with apparent activation energy (Ea) of 41.10 kJ mol-1, while the thermodynamic study certified that the reaction is non-spontaneous and endother-mic. Conclusion: A novel catalytic pathway for the synthesis of BMFM (C11 oxygenate) by the one-pot process was successfully developed over solid acidic nanocatalysts 3-ClPYPW. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Transforming waste to energy is essential in view of the need to search for greener and more sustainable energy sources. Such transformation of energy is also aligned with the aim of reducing excessive waste generation whilst creating potential biofuel pathways for power generation. In the present study, animal waste in the form of horse manure is being used as feedstock to undergo microwave-induced pyrolysis via a fixed-bed pyrolysis rig. The relationship of the pyrolysis parameters such as pyrolysis temperature of 350 and 550 °C, carrier gas flow rate of 0.5 and 1.5 L/min and ratio of horse manure to activated carbon blend of 1:2 and 1:1, with the yield of pyrolysed products is studied. The derived pyrolysis products in the form of solid, liquid and gaseous are characterised and quantified. Result shows that the highest yield of solid, liquid and gaseous products obtained are 78.8 wt%, 24.7 wt% and 34.2 wt%. Solid yield is observed to decrease with increasing pyrolysis temperature while gaseous yield shows a reverse trend. Higher carrier gas flow rate is observed to lower the generation of gaseous and liquid yield while increasing the solid yield. Higher amount of activated carbon within the feedstock is seen to lower the solid yield but increase the gaseous and liquid yields. The liquid yield is found to contain 55.78 wt% of phenolic compounds while gaseous product consists of up to 55 vol% of syngas. The control of the operating conditions in pyrolysis rig enables the production of pyrolysis end products in different phases, generating useful bioenergy and biofertilizer products in the context of circular economy.

AB  - The thermal and catalytic conversion processes of alternative feedstocks (e.g., waste and biomass) to different engine fuels can result in the formation of a significant amount of light hydrocarbons as by-products in the boiling range of gasoline. The properties of these C5/C6 hydrocarbons need to be improved due to many reasons, e.g., their benzene content, and/or poor oxidation stability (high olefin content) and low octane number (&lt;60). The aim of the research work was to increase the octane number of benzene containing C5/C6 bioparaffin fractions by catalytic isomerization. These by-products were obtained from special hydrocracking of waste cooking oil to hydrocarbons in the boiling range of aviation turbine fuels (JET fuels)/diesel fuels. Experiments were carried out in a reactor system containing down-flow tubular reactors over Pt/Al2O3/Cl and Pt/H-Mordenite/Al2O3 catalysts at 115-145 °C and 230-270 °C, respectively. Based on the results obtained at different process parameter combinations, it was concluded that the hydrogenation of benzene was complete over both catalysts, and the liquid yields were higher (ca. 98% &gt; ca. 93 %) in the case of Pt/Al2O3/Cl. In addition, the octane number was also enhanced (ca. 32 &gt; ca. 27 unit) in the products compared to the feedstock. This was because a higher isoparaffin content can be obtained at a lower operating temperature. Moreover, cracking side reactions take place to a lesser extent. The utilization of these isomerized bio-origin light fractions can contribute to the competitiveness of second-generation biofuels. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The research on ethyl levulinate synthesis is now increased due to its potential to be derived from biomass and for applications in biofuel. In the present work, model compound of biomass-derived intermediates, levulinic acid and furfural alcohol, were utilized for ethyl levulinate synthesis using modified carbon cryogel. Carbon cryogel produced from urea and furfural (UCC) mixtures was modified via sulfonation (UCC-S) and subsequently doped with Fe (UCC-S-Fe) to increase the surface chemistry of the reaction. In order to study the acidity and phase structure of the catalyst, the UCC-S and UCC-S-Fe were characterized by using NH3- TPD and XRD. The ethanolysis of levulinic acid and furfuryl alcohol were conducted in a batch reaction system for the catalytic testing experiment by study the effect of reaction time and catalyst loading. At the selected conditions, with UCC-S as the catalyst, a high ethyl levulinate yield of 99.5 mol% was obtained from ethanolysis of levulinic acid using 10 wt% of a catalyst loading for 4 h. Although UCC-S catalyst gives low ethyl levulinate yield from ethanolysis of furfuryl alcohol, a high yield ethyl levulinate of 97.8 mol% was observed within 5 h of reaction time by applying 20 wt% of UCC-S-Fe catalyst loading. Thus, the modification of urea-furfural carbon cryogel via sulfonation and Fe-doping have improved the properties of carbon cryogel and performed as a promising solid acid catalyst for ethyl levulinate production. However, different activity performances were demonstrated by the two catalysts in the ethanolysis reactions of levulinic acid and furfuryl alcohol. © 2020 AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Bamboo "Ori" (Bambusa blumeana) is a potential raw material for activated carbon production due to rapid growth and abundant availability. Raschig ring activated carbon for industrial catalyst, catalyst support and adsorbent in purifi cation process can be made from small diameter bamboo branches. The activated carbon as a support for Fe and Co catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis provides an opportunity for direct conversion from synthesis gas (CO and H2) to biofuel (C5-C19). The effect of activation sequence on the activated carbon and impregnation product properties was investigated. Activated carbon was obtained from bamboo waste through various activation sequences (steam, phosphoric acid and carbonization), then it was impregnated with 10% metal loading. The Fe composition in the initial metal mixture was varied at 0-40% from total composition. After impregnation, reduction was applied by fl owing hydrogen gas at 400°C for 10 hours.These catalysts were performed for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a batch reactors. The activation sequences of carbonization-acid and acid-carbonization gave similar surface area (2173 and 2091 m2/g), much greater than the steam-carbonization-acid and steam-acid-carbonization (427 and 478 m2/g) sequences. Functionalization with nitric acid produced oxygen functional groups of carboxyl, carbonyl, alcohol and phenol.Catalyst reduction gave Fe, Co and Fe-Co alloys as active metal and a little oxides Fe2O3 and Co3O4. The larger amount of Fe-Co alloys were formed on 30Fe-70Co/Activated Carbon and 40Fe-60Co/Activated Carbon catalyst. Fischer-Tropsch synthes is was performed in batch at H2/CO = 2, Fe-Co/Activated Carbon catalyst, 250°C, 8 bars for 18 hours. The n-paraffi n compound is only formed in 40Fe-60Co/Activated Carbon catalyst which contained the highest amount of Fe-Co alloys. The more Fe-Co alloys content was, more n-paraffi n was formed. The n-paraffi n (OH) compound was only formed in 10Fe-90Co/AC. The more Co content was, more n-paraffi n (OH) was formed. © 2020 Institut za Istrazivanja. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biogas is a potential renewable energy resource that can reduce the current energy dependency on fossil fuels. The major limitation of utilizing biogas fully in the various applications is the presence of a significant volume fraction of carbon dioxide in biogas. Here, we used adsorption-driven CO2 separation using the most prominent adsorbents, NaX (faujasite) and CaA (Linde Type A) zeolites. The NaX and CaA zeolites were structured into hierarchically porous granules using a low-cost freeze granulation technique to achieve better mass transfer kinetics. The freeze granulation processing parameters and the rheological properties of suspensions were optimized to obtain homogenous granules of NaX and CaA zeolites 2–3 mm in diameter with macroporosity of 77.9% and 68.6%, respectively. The NaX and CaA granules kept their individual morphologies, crystallinities with a CO2 uptake of 5.8 mmol/g and 4 mmol/g, respectively. The CO2 separation performance and the kinetic behavior were estimated by breakthrough experiments, where the NaX zeolite showed a 16% higher CO2 uptake rate than CaA granules with a high mass transfer coefficient, 1.3 m/s, compared to commercial granules, suggesting that freeze-granulated zeolites could be used to improve adsorption kinetics and reduce cycle time for biogas upgrading in the adsorption swing technology. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This paper reports the synthesis and utilization of cerium oxide (CeO2) nanorods as a cathode catalyst and a potential, low-cost replacement of platinum for microbial biofuel cells (MBFCs). The nanorod electrocatalyst had exhibited significant improvements over Pt nanoparticles in terms of forward and backward onset potentials and peak current densities, electronic conductivity, charge transfer resistance, stability in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, and cost. It had also demonstrated a more stable forward peak current density at the 100th steady cycle, as well as, higher current density values up to 7,200 s. In addition, the synthesized CeO2 nanorods also produced ∼103 times higher exchange current density over the synthesized Pt nanoparticles. Furthermore, in a single-chamber MBFC, the CeO2 nanorods exhibited higher open circuit voltage (+0.80 V after 14 days), and output current (3613 mAm-2 at +0.3 V) and power (1084 mWm-2) densities in comparison to Pt nanoparticles. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrogenation of bio-based furfural (FUR) to furfuryl alcohol (FFA) is tremendously expanding the application of biomass in many industries such as resins, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals. However, mass manufacture of FFA from FUR is restrained by strict requirements of reaction conditions and expensive catalysts. In this work, an economical and benign catalytic system, containing an easily prepared and reusable catalyst 5 wt.% KF/ZrO2 and a low-cost hydrogen source polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS), was developed to be efficient for the hydrogenation of FUR to high-value FFA under mild conditions. The catalyst reactivity was found to be remarkably influenced by the support acid-base properties and KF loading doge. In the presence of 5 wt.% KF/ZrO2, a high FFA yield of 97% and FUR conversion of 99% could be obtained at 25°C in just 0.5 h, which was superior to those attained with other tested catalysts. The KF/ZrO2 catalyst could be recycled at least five times, with the FFA yield slightly decreasing from 97% to 71%. The spare decrease in FFA yield is possibly attributed to the catalyst pore blocking, as clarified by SEM, BET, XPS, and ICP-MS measurements of the fresh and reused catalysts. © 2020 Zhaozhuo Yu et al.

AB  - Dependence on the exhaustible fossil fuels exhibited the urgent need for the development of alternative energy production based on green chemistry methods. Biodiesel production marks a green product produced from a variety of bio-entities. Current investigation is an account of the first time exploration of the biodiesel production from the seeds of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) previously garnered at a phytoremediation site. Sunflower crop has been grown for the accumulation of heavy metals at a contaminated site, later on such plants were utilised for biodiesel production via transesterification signifying a duality in achieving the purpose of environmental detoxification in addition to energy production. Biodiesel production based on the ethanolysis expressed an augmented transformation of up to 96% with simultaneously occurring inconsequential reactions. The prepared biodiesel was analysed for the presence of compounds and functional group through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Furthermore, the derivation of other products, e.g. ethyl oleate can find a potential utilisation in the pharmaceutical industry associated with the making of drugs. Relevant and apropos upgradation of the sunflower seed oils can result in the favourable biofuels. Current research is the indicative of successful use of phytoremediated crops for gaining environmental integrity. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this study, hyperaccumulator waste, i.e., Pteris vittata L. was converted into bio-oil, biogas and biochar via sub- and supercritical hydrothermal liquefaction processes. These products were characterized in terms of EI/MS, FTIR, TGA and GC to understand their chemical composition, thermal decomposition, structural properties and high biofuel reactivity. Characterization results revealed that the dominant chemical components in the heavy bio-oil were esters (40.22%), phenols (20.02%), alcohols (10.16%), organic acids (9.07%), nitrogenous compounds (8.83%) and ketones/aldehydes (6.42%), while the light oil was rich with a higher fraction of phenols (54.13%) and nitrogenous compounds (27.04%). Particularly, bio-oils obtained from supercritical conditions contained increased phenolic compounds and reduced oxygenated chemicals such as alcohols, aliphatic acid, ketones and aldehydes, suggesting the improved quality of bio-oil due to the reduction in oxygen contents. Meanwhile, H2-rich syngas production with the H2 yield of 38.87% was obtained at 535 °C for 20 min, and higher reaction temperature presented a positive influence on H2 production during Pteris vittata L. liquefaction. Moreover, the remaining biochar product was analyzed to determine whether it could be used as a direct solid fuel or auxiliary fuel. This study provided full exploitation of this feedstock waste in energy and valuable chemical complexes. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - We studied acetone butylation over KF/Na-ZSM-5 and ZSM-5 impregnated with other K-compounds which impart basicity. These base catalysts have, so far, not been reported for ketone alkylation. These catalysts did not contain any metal any of metal which are conventionally used to affect dehydrogenation-hydrogenation reactions which have been reported to be involved in mechanism of acetone alkylation. Absence of such metals reduces catalyst costs and eliminates metal sintering. Catalyst basicity was determined by FTIR of pyrrole-adsorbed samples and CO2 adsorption method. Coke deposited after reaction for 20 h time-on-stream on promising catalyst, namely, 10 wt% KF/Na-ZSM-5, was characterized by TGA and GCMS. This confirmed stability of KF on Na-ZSM-5, without leaching of F. Acetone conversion (60%) and ketone plus alcohol selectivity (exceeding 90%) surpassed reported performance at comparable operating conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pyrolysis processes were investigated using expanded polystyrene waste (EPW) with a catalyst synthesized from rice husk (RH). Biomass was treated with different acids, i.e., sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, and hydrochloric acid. The effect of normality on the oxalic acid-treated catalyst and the effects of polymer to catalyst ratio on (i) oil, gas, and residues yields; (ii) temperature; and (iii) time for the complete reaction were investigated for the effective use of oil for fuel production. The catalyst treated with 0.25 N (RHOA0.25) resulted in a high oil yield of 96 wt% and a residue yield of 3.47 wt%. The oil produced contained mainly aromatic compounds, which contributed 67.86% in an area-based GC-MS analysis. The synthesized catalyst showed a stable capacity for three regeneration runs. The significant factor is that the synthesized catalyst decreased the activation energy during the pyrolysis of EPW.

AB  - One of the promising alternatives to fossil fuels, biodiesel, is a renewable fuel which can be defined as methyl or ethyl ester of fatty acid made prominently from vegetable oils or animal fat. The present study outlines the observations on the fatty acid alkyl ester generation by transesterification of cottonseed oil using Aspergillus species as whole-cell biocatalyst. Current work also represents the difference in ester yield on the addition of alcohol blends with two different molar ratios (1:4 or 1:6). Further, the fuel properties viz., density, viscosity, gross calorific value, flash point, cloud point and pour point of ethyl-butyl and ethyl-propyl ester were analyzed, as per ASTM 6751. No significant difference was observed in ester yield with both the molar ratio of alcohols. Ester yield up to 91% and 87% was obtained using 1:4 and 1:6 M ratio respectively. By the use of a lower molar ratio (1:4) and whole-cell catalyst, a significant reduction in the cost of production of biodiesel is as expected. Alcohol other than ethanol facilitated only a marginal increase in ester yield with no significant variation from propanol to octanol. The fuel properties showed significant improvement in comparison to standard biodiesel. The use of whole cell bio-catalysis, as demonstrated in present study can be considered as a promising alternative to a chemical catalyst for the generation of long-chain fatty acid esters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulose liquefaction in supercritical ethanol with 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidinooxy (TEMPO) was carried out in a stainless autoclave. The influence of process parameters on bio-oil (BO) and platform chemicals, mainly including the dosage of TEMPO, reaction temperature and reaction time, were investigated. Characterization of liquefaction products was explored by fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS). The maximum yield of BO (57.98%) was obtained from cellulose liquefaction at 320 °C, 4 g TEMPO and moderate time of 60 min. It showed that the conversion rate and yield of BO was significantly improved by 46.14% and 31.87% due to temperature and TEMPO respectively. The relative contents of dominant platform chemicals in bio-oil were as follows approximately: ketones > esters > alkanes > alcohols > acids. The total yields of ketones enhanced markedly (from 20.00 to 41.83%) with the increasing of TEMPO. The results showed that TEMPO catalyst under appropriate reaction conditions improved the selectivity of platform chemicals with carbonyl, which had an obvious contribution on the converting of ketones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research work, the effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) as additive with waste fishing net oil on performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine were examined. Waste fishing net oil (WFNO) was obtained by pyrolysis process. The properties of WFNO revealed that oil produced from the waste fishing net can be used in a diesel engine without any engine modifications. The nano additive was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and also by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). At a constant speed of 1500 rpm, engine performance, emission and combustion characteristics were analysed and compared with conventional diesel fuel. Engine test showed that fuel produced from the waste fishing net was able to work efficiently in a diesel engine without any engine alterations. Experimental results revealed that there was a significant improvement in combustion characteristic with the incorporation of MWCNT with WFNO. At 100% load, brake thermal efficiency was increased by 3.83% and brake specific fuel consumption was decreased by 3.87% with the addition of MWCNT to WFNO. Further, the results showed a significant reduction in engine exhaust emissions like CO, UHC, NO and smoke by 25%, 9.09% 5.25% and 14.81% respectively and a slight increase in CO2 emission by 17.39%. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Availability of sustainable transportation fuels in future hinges on the use of lignocellulosic resources for production of biofuels. The process of biomass pyrolysis can be used to convert solid biomass resources into liquid fuels. In this study, laboratory experiments and process simulations were combined to gain insight into the technical performance of catalytic and thermal pyrolysis processes. Waste pinewood was used as a feedstock for the processes. The pyrolysis took place at 500◦C and employs three different catalysts, in the case of the catalytic processes. A process model was developed with Aspen Plus and a wide range of representative components of bio-oil were used to model the properties of the bio-oil blend. The results of the process model calculations show that catalytic pyrolysis process produces bio-oil of superior quality. Different technical process scenarios were explored based on the properties of the bio-oil after separation of water-soluble components, with the intention of producing a blendable or stand-alone product. It was found that—depending on the bio-oil requirements—sufficient hydrogen can be made available from the aqueous fraction to further treat the organic fraction to the desired extent. The resulting organic fractions are suitable candidates for blending with conventional fuels. The analysis results are used to provide guidance for catalyst development. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) entails the analysis of potential environmental loads and natural resources utilised while manufacturing a product, which helps in sustainable production of biofuel and prudent management of natural resources. A variety of bio resources including microalgae are being explored for its potential as viable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels. This communication presents the lifecycle assessment of biodiesel production from microalgae and valorisation of other value-added products. Comparative assessment of feedstock cultivation was done by considering varied nutrient inputs – (i) no nutrient input (scenario 1), (ii) wastewater as nutrient input (scenario 2) and (iii) fertiliser input (scenario 3). Two different transesterification techniques followed for converting microalgal oil into biodiesel were i) acid catalyst and ii) biocatalyst. Environmental impacts of different scenarios considered were assessed using OpenLCA v1.10.3, which highlights higher eutrophication and photochemical oxidation related emissions for fertiliser input scenario with acid catalyst based transesterification. However, significant reductions in environmental impacts with minimal GHG footprint was observed with wastewater use for cultivating algae and transesterification through biocatalyst. Life cycle assessment of three different scenarios revealed a fossil energy requirement variation between 3.6 and 5.7 MJ/kg and the greenhouse gas emission (as kg equivalent CO2 emissions) of 0.85–1.46 kg CO2eq.kg−1 of biodiesel. This highlights a reduction in fossil energy requirement of about 87.3% in the pilot substrate-based microalgal bioreactor. Wastewater – biocatalyst scenario exhibited a highest net energy ratio (NER) of 18.8 with an additional benefit of low cost remediation of wastewater. © 2020

AB  - Purpose: Cellulase, due to its massive applicability, has been used in various industrial processes such as biofuels (bioethanol, triphasic biomethanation), agricultural and plant waste management, chiral separation, and ligand binding studies. The finding of a novel cellulase-producing bacterium will benefit the industries, which rely on yeast to produce cellulase in fermentation technology, because bacteria can easily be manipulated and fermented cost-effectively. Methods: Cellulase enzyme-secreting bacteria were isolated from different regions of the world’s largest mangrove forests, Sundarbans in Bangladesh. Biochemical, morphological, and 16S rRNA identification protocol was followed to precisely characterize the bacterial strains. Result: We have determined that the strain T2-D2 (Bacillus sp.), E1-PT (Pseudomonas sp.), and D1-PT (Pseudomonas sp.) showed maximum endoglycolytic and strain C1-BT (Bacillus sp.), E1-BT (Bacillus sp.), and T-4 (E) showed relatively higher exoglycolytic activity during the test. So, it can be easily cultured at a normal temperature (97.7–99.5 °F). On the one hand, T2-D2 (Bacillus sp.) and E1-PT (Pseudomonas sp.) have shown the highest growth rate at pH 7 as it was neither acidic nor basic. Conclusion: It was concluded that the strain T2-D2 (Bacillus sp.) and E1-PT (Pseudomonas sp.) would be our target cellulolytic strains wherein the experimental isolates belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae, Psuedomonacea, Bacillacea, and Morganellacea family. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The present study emphasized on ethanol production using biologically synthesized ZnO nanoparticles as a catalyst. Fusarium oxysporum has been shown to have a high zinc metal tolerance ability and a potential for extracellular synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. The purity and quality of synthesized nanoparticles were confirmed by various characterization methods such as UV–Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, SEM, TGA and DTA analysis. Primarily, for bioethanol production the rice straw was subjected to delignification by ammonia. Enzymes required for further degradation of lignocellulosic biomass of rice straw into monosaccharide sugars was produced using fungus Fusarium oxysporum. These sugars were then converted into ethanol via fermentation under micro-aerobic conditions. Ethanol yield was enhanced by using zinc oxide nanoparticles in certain concentration range during fermentation. Maximum ethanol yield of 0.0359 g/g of dry weight based plant biomass was obtained at 200 mg/L concentration of ZnO nanoparticles. Here, we summarizes the synthesis and recent advances of ZnO nanoparticles in bioethanol production which in turn will be used in various industrial applications, pharmaceutical sector and also as a bio-fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production from microalgae requires energy-intensive dewatering before lipid extraction and transesterification. In order to avoid this energy penalty, one-path direct transesterification of wet microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) using supercritical methanol is attempted, for the first time with added heterogeneous catalysts. This methanothermal process was found to be robust, maintaining high fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) fraction yields in a wide range of water content (16–64 mol % water in methanol). Among the eight metal oxide catalysts tested, α-Al2O3 showed the best performance for the reaction, producing 1.4–1.6 times as much FAME fractions compared to non-catalytic reaction in the same moisture range. The present catalysis is found to be not affecting transesterification step, evidenced by the weak effect of surface acidity. Instead, it appears to add extra routes to produce fuel components that fall in the FAME fraction range. © 2020

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) as feedstocks for biodiesel production contains high free fatty acid and water, causing negative impacts on the biodiesel yield and its purity. In this work, three alternative methods for handling water content in WCO feedstocks using the earlier hybridization of esterification and transesterification in a single reactive distillation column (hybridized RD) were investigated. Our simulation results revealed that using two heat exchangers combined with the hybridized RD is a simple method to remove water from WCO. However, it requires the highest energy as well as biodiesel production cost (1.63 USD/kg biodiesel). The extended spacing stage modification of the hybridized RD was proposed to remove water content. It requires a new hybridized RD construction by spacing stages addition which can handle WCO with 10 wt% of water content and require less energy, resulting in lower biodiesel production cost (1.07 USD/kg biodiesel). The integration of pervaporation unit was found to be the best option. It offers the highest performance in terms of water removal and methanol recovery, resulting in the lowest biodiesel production cost (1.04 USD/kg biodiesel). This study shows that using pervaporation or extended spacing stages with hybridized RD are promising methods for biodiesel production from WCO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present research, the efforts have been lodged to improve the combustion and performance characteristics along with exhaust emissions of diesel-schleichera oleosa biodiesel blends by adding nanoparticles of alumina and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The nanoparticles (np's) were synthesized and their morphologies were characterized by using Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray Diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) techniques. Test fuels containing 50 ppm and 100 ppm dosage of nanoparticles were dispersed with diesel–biodiesel blends and were labelled as D80B20A50, D80B20A100 (alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles) and D80B20C50, D80B20C100 (multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)). The droplet size of test fuels was analysed by using a laser-diffraction based Malvern Spraytec set-up. Interestingly, nano-additive dispersed test fuels showed smaller droplet size due to the higher force of collision between the nanoparticles. Moreover, the engine trial showed up to a 2–13% increase in brake thermal efficiency and upto 5–60% drop in exhaust emissions for nanoparticles dispersed test fuels. Also, alumina showed better results than MWCNT in terms of higher thermal efficiency, lower specific energy consumption and lower exhaust emissions as compared to diesel. However, due to the superior sorbent of nitrogen oxides, the (100 ppm) MWCNT has resulted in a maximum reduction of NO emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a novel renewable hybrid system was designed and constructed to efficiently produce biodiesel through various methods. First, a parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) was used as a renewable source for producing desalinated water in a solar still. Then, the heat dissipated by PTC and water produced by the solar still were used to generate biodiesel. Finally, the combined cycle of PTC/desalination/biodiesel generator was applied to produce heat and steady power. Necessary electricity in the hybrid system containing pumps, mixing tools, etc. was provided by photovoltaic panels. After launching the hybrid system and performing experiments to produce biodiesel on Palm and Chlorella bioenergy carriers, the percentage of the biodiesel production for these two species in different ways were as follows: alkaline catalyzed transesterification (79.17,81.46), acid-catalyzed transesterification (79.1,81.43), two-step transesterification (78.07,81.42), supercritical transesterification (75.16,80.68), microemulsion (76.3,81.4), electrolysis (50.25, 58.87), and pyrolysis (13.677,14.833). Moreover, the lowest price belonged to the alkaline catalyzed transesterification which for palm/chlorella was 0.65/0.972. In most methods, the cetane number of palm-based biodiesel was higher (∼58). Consequently, it had a better combustion quality compared to chlorella-based biodiesel (∼44). This study also modeled various processes for the bioenergy carrier conversion. The results were consistent with experimental data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipase from Candida rugosa was physically attached to Mg modified Fe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and employed for the conversion of brewers’ spent grains (BSGs) into biodiesel, in the presence of methanol. The proposed strategy explored the direct immobilization of the enzyme on the as-prepared oleic acid modified inexpensive NPs. In addition, a large amount of enzyme was bound on the NPs, allowing their efficient recycling by using an external magnet. A very remarkable better yield of 98% was achieved at 1:4 oil/methanol molar ratio after 48 h at 45 °C reaction temperature. The nanocatalyst also exhibits good recyclability. The biodiesel produced was analyzed according to EN 14214. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study demonstrates that the biodiesel (BD) from swine manure (SM) could be a promising way for large scale generation of biofuel. Also, the economic and environmental benefits of SM derived BD were evaluated. Transesterification of lipid contents extracted from the collected SM had low BD yield (14.2 wt%) using H2SO4 catalyst due to high acid value and impurities. However, thermo-chemical non-catalytic transesterification with a porous material showed 94.7 wt% yield of BD from the lipid in SM. Considering the current population of swine, the annual production of BD from SM was estimated. The SM derived BD could cover 19.7 and 46.8 wt% of BD currently produced in both Korea and the USA with the economic benefits of up to $96 million and $2.1 billion, respectively. The proposed approach also can save vast arable lands needed to cultivate oil-bearing feedstocks for BD production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are seen as potential biomass to be used in a biorefinery concept. Several technologies can be used to convert microalgal biomass, but pyrolysis is viewed as a unique pathway to obtain valuable chemicals distributed in three phases: liquid (bio-oil), gas (bio-gas) and solid (bio-char). The liquid phase, bio-oil, usually presents higher heating value than raw biomass, but acidity and oxygen content are major drawbacks. In situ catalyzed pyrolysis can help to decrease the oxygen content and acidity of pyrolytic bio-oils. Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed reactor using commercial carbonate catalysts (Li2CO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, MgCO3, SrCO3 and MnCO3). The catalysis pyrolysis temperature (375 °C) was selected from thermal degradation profiles obtained using thermogravimetry under nitrogen flow and corresponds to the maximum degradation rate for both microalgae. In spite of similar volatile and fixed carbon contents, microalgae performed differentially during pyrolysis mainly due to the different contents of carbohydrates, oils and proteins. Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus showed bio-oil yield in the range 26–38 and 28–50 wt%, respectively. Only sodium carbonate was able to decrease the bio-char yield, confirming that carbonate catalysts prompt simultaneously gasification and carbonization reactions. Fourier transform infrared spectra of produced bio-oils showed a net decrease of acidity, associated with carbonyl species when carbonate catalysts were used. Bio-char morphology, for both microalgae, showed evidence of melting and resolidification of cell structures, which might be due to the lower melting points of the pyrolysis products obtained from proteins and lipids. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Marine algae are promising third-generation feedstocks for bioethanol production as they are fast growing, require minimal inputs, and do not compete for land. However, marine algae have complex cell walls which necessitate pretreatment prior to fermentation, and this represents a major component of the cost of bioethanol production. Standard pretreatment processes using acids are costly and generate hazardous waste streams. This study aims to develop an economic and environmentally friendly pretreatment process using ozonolysis for the marine algae Kappaphycus alvarezii and Gelidium amansii. Acid and ozone pretreatments were compared across the pretreatment, enzyme hydrolysis, and fermentation stages of bioethanol production. Acid pretreatment outperformed ozonolysis over the pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis stages. However, it also generated as by-products the compounds 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) and levulinic acid (LA), which inhibited ethanol fermentation and reduced the efficiency of the process overall. Ozone pretreatment did not produce these inhibitory compounds, and as such outperformed acid pretreatment across the process as a whole. These results indicate the potential of ozonolysis as an economic and environmentally friendly pretreatment for the production of bioethanol from marine algae. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We report a variety of manganese-based catalysts containing both chelating diphosphine (bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm: 1, 2, and 7) or 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe: 3)), and mixed-donor phosphinoamine (2-(diphenylphosphino)ethylamine (dppea: 4-6)) ligands for the upgrading of ethanol and methanol to the advanced biofuel isobutanol. These catalysts show moderate selectivity up to 74% along with turnover numbers greater than 100 over 90 h, with catalyst 2 supported by dppm demonstrating superior performance. The positive effect of substituting the ligand backbone was also displayed with a catalyst supported by C-phenyl-substituted dppm (8) having markedly improved performance compared to the parent dppm catalysts. Catalysts supported by the phosphinoamine ligand dppea are also active for the upgrading of ethanol to n-butanol. These results show that so-called PNP-pincer ligands are not a prerequisite for the use of manganese catalysts in Guerbet chemistry and that simple chelates can be used effectively. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The effect of liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment with or without acid addition (A-LHW) on the production of hydrogen—through dark fermentation (DF)—and methane—through anaerobic digestion (AD)—using three different lignocellulosic biomass types (sunflower straw (SS), grass lawn (GL), and poplar sawdust (PS)) was investigated. Both pretreatment methods led to hemicellulose degradation, but A-LHW resulted in the release of more potential inhibitors (furans and acids) than the LHW pretreatment. Biological hydrogen production (BHP) of the cellulose-rich solid fractions obtained after LHW and A-LHW pretreatment was enhanced compared to the untreated substrates. Due to the release of inhibitory compounds, LHW pretreatment led to higher biochemical methane potential (BMP) than A-LHW pretreatment when both separated fractions (liquid and solid) obtained after pretreatments were used for AD. The recovered energy in the form of methane with LHW pretreatment was 8.4, 12.5, and 7.5 MJ/kg total solids (TS) for SS, GL, and PS, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The formation, growth and transformation of the carbon residue (coke) deposited on the catalyst during the raw bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation have been studied. These deposits have a great impact on the overall process performance, and they have been formed in accelerated deactivation conditions (450 °C, 65 bar, space time of 0.09 gcat h gbio-oil-1) using a continuous fixed bed reactor and a FeMoP/HZSM-5 catalyst. Coke deposition causes partial deactivation of the catalyst, which reaches a pseudosteady state of constant activity and also contant yields of interesting chemicals. The evolution of the coke in the transient state has been studied through temperature-programmed oxidation, Raman spectroscopy and elemental analysis. We have identified three different types of coke, whose composition evolves with time on stream towards condensed and stable structures. The assessment of the evolution of the reaction medium composition and the application of the principal component analysis (PCA) methodology have evidenced that the dynamics of coke have three stages: (1) it is controlled by the thermally-induced deposition of thermal lignin; (2) followed by the interconversion into intermediate coke through aging reactions; and (3) it ends up in a pseudosteady state dominated by the formation of catalytic coke species originating from both deoxygenated and carbonized intermediate coke as well as the condensation of aromatics in the reaction medium.

AB  - Continuous expansion of agriculture for the production of biofuels may be considered a potential source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the ever-increasing amount of waste and fossil fuel-dependent materials involved. Agricultural waste utilization through the circular bioeconomy concept offers a pathway to reduce GHG emissions. Palm oil production, for instance, produces palm kernel shells (PKS) and palm oil mill effluents (POME) as wastes in enormous amounts. PKS and POME account for &gt;60% of solid and liquid waste generated from the mill. In this work, the feasibility of a circular palm bioeconomy is explored where waste PKS is directly converted to activated carbons (AC) in a cost-effective one-step technique (550 °C, 10 mL min−1 N2) that departs from the conventional two-step (carbonization and activation) technique. Characterization of the synthesized carbons, PKAC, using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed oxygen-rich morphological features that were 2-fold higher than in bituminous coal-derived AC. The &lt;10 μm pore diameters of PKAC were relevant in the immobilization of Aspergillus oryzae whole-cells expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (PKAC-FHL). For biodiesel production, the 81.6 IU mg−1 specific activity of PKAC-FHL yielded ≥97.5 wt% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) from POME. While offering the benefits of environmental remediation through effluent utilization, the produced FAME showed 48.8 Cetane Number and cold-flow properties that conform to ASTM and EN biodiesel requirements. This waste valorization approach, thus, proposes a green framework for the use of POME and PKS in immobilized lipase-catalyzed methanolysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To study the effects of different ash/organics and C/H/O ratios on bio-fuel characteristics and energy efficiency, four kinds of sludge with different properties were used for microwave pyrolysis (800 °C). Moreover, the microwave pyrolysis reaction mechanisms of different sludge were also explored. The results showed that high-ash sludge could accelerate the frequency of polar molecule rotation in the microwave field due to the presence of oxides with dielectric properties in ash, thereby achieving faster heating rates and higher temperatures. However, compared with high-organic sludge, high-ash sludge exhibited lower bio-gas yield and higher bio-char yield. As the H/C ratio increased from 0.127 to 0.148, the bio-gas yield increased from 15.41% to 40.01%, and the content of H2 in bio-gas and aliphatics in bio-oil increased to 36.69 vol% and 26.54 wt%, respectively. When the O/C ratio was reduced to 1.31, the content of CO and oxygenated compound in bio-oil increased to 31.25 vol% and 40.04 wt%, which lowered the quality of the bio-oil. Those consequences also determined that a mixture of sludge with different ash/organic ratios could be pyrolyzed to obtain high-quality bio-fuels and high energy efficiency. Differences in C/H/O ratios in the mixed sludge greatly affected the microwave pyrolysis heating process, which affected the pyrolysis reactions and the quality of the bio-fuels. Therefore, this study provides a theoretical basis to elevate the quality of bio-fuels and reduce microwave pyrolysis costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work investigated the synthesis of carbon nanotubes from engine soot particles by laser ablation vaporization method. The synthesized carbon nanotubes were characterized structurally by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy and Thermogravimetry Analysis. Further, the effects of adding carbon nanotubes in to Schizochytrium methyl ester-diesel blended fuel (20% by volume Schizochytrium methyl ester + 80% diesel and 40% by volume Schizochytrium methyl ester + 60% diesel; symbolized by SCME 20 and SCME 40 respectively) were investigated on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of direct injection diesel engine. The carbon nanotubes were mixed ultrasonically at two concentrations of 25 and 50 ppm in SCME 20 and SCME 40 individually. All blends were investigated under different engine loading conditions and their results reported that by adding carbon nanotubes at 25–50 ppm of SCME 20 increased the brake thermal efficiency by 2.5% and decreased the brake specific fuel consumption by 3.2% when compared to the neat SCME 20 blend. The maximum heat release rate and peak in-cylinder pressure were found increased by 5% and 4%, respectively. More specifically, the engine exhaust emissions such as UHC, CO, NOx and smoke found reduced by 14.28%, 23.07%, 5% and 21.52% respectively, at a concentrations of 50 ppm in SCME20 blends. The result showed that the concentrations of 50 ppm in SCME20 possess the optimum enhancement in the performance and emissions of the DICI engine. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - As demand of proteins from meats has significantly increased with economy growth, the population of livestock proliferates. Thus, heavy amount of livestock byproducts released from livestock industries will become more problematic if they are handled in an unsatisfactory manner. In this study, swine manure (SM) waste was directly valorized to be used as a reaction catalyst for biodiesel production. Pyrolysis was adapted to produce swine manure biochars at 500 (SMB@500) and 650 °C (SMB@650), and the materials were used for conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesels (i.e., fatty acid methyl esters: FAMEs). The properties of SMBs and resulting pyrolytic gases (i.e., H2, CO, and C1-2 hydrocarbons (HCs)) and liquids during pyrolysis were also characterized. SMBs used in this study included a large quantity of metallic contents that significantly contributed to the rapid reaction for biodiesel production. In detail, SMB@500 and SMB@650 showed higher than 96% of FAME yield at 305 and 210 °C of reaction temperature, while non-catalytic reaction using SiO2 showed similar FAME yield at 330 °C. Thus, this work offers a sustainable way to recycle organic and inorganic materials in livestock manures for energy (biodiesel, pyrolytic oil, H2, and C1-2 HCs) production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel obtained from yeast derived single cell oil (SCO) is considered as an alternative to conventional biodiesel derived from plant oils, having the potential to substitute petroleum-derived transport fuels. In this work, we have developed a heterogeneous potassium hydroxide catalyst (K-RAC) supported on Rhodotorula mucilaginosa deoiled cake activated carbon (RAC) to enhance the conversion of R. mucilaginosa isolate R2 derived SCO as well as waste cooking oil (WCO) to biodiesel. The prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, FTIR, EDX, SEM, BET and TGA. Basicity of the catalyst was determined by CO2-TPD and the hammet indicator test. The maximum fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) conversion of 96.6% and 98.66% for SCO and WCO respectively were obtained at optimized parameters i.e. 9:1 molar ratio (methanol/oil), 3 wt % of K-RAC loading at 60 °C and reaction time of 3 h. 1H NMR and GCMS was used to confirm the formation of biodiesel. The K-RAC was recycled effectively for five consecutive cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Deoxygenation (DX) is a key enhancement process for biomass-derived biofuel production. To understand the DX mechanism of palm oils, we performed experimental and computational studies to investigate the DX reaction of palmitic acid on Ni2P catalyst. Experimental characterization and catalytic testing demonstrated that the DX on unsupported (0 0 1)-Ni2P catalyst prefers the decarbonylation (DCO) pathway over the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) pathway with the ratios between 2.17 and 4.13 to 1. Mechanistic study using density functional theory calculation revealed that the DX of butyric acid also prefers DCO over HDO pathway. Both experimental and computational results suggested that the decarboxylation (DCO2) pathway is unlikely. The computation results indicated that the rate-limiting step of HDO pathway is in the butanol to butane conversion (activation energy Ea = 1.99 eV), whereas that of the DCO pathway is found during the butanal to propane conversion (Ea = 1.52 eV). However, additional thermodynamic analysis accounting for hydrotreating reaction condition (H2 = 50 bars at 653 K) suggested that the rate-determining step for the DCO pathway is actually the hydrogenation of butyric acid. In addition, the thermodynamics analysis also suggests that increasing reaction temperature may increase selectivity of HDO pathway. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will be beneficial for the enhancement of DX process for biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, Proteus vulgaris lipase (PVL) was engineered using directed evolution to increase methanol tolerance so that it would be more tolerant and efficient for harsh conditions employed in biodiesel synthesis, which is limiting their industrial use. The influence of ultrasound under different experimental conditions on the biodiesel conversion yield using methanolysis of non-edible neem oil was also emphasized. A special attention was also paid to the immobilization of lipase on Polysulfone (PS) beads and comparative studies with industrially used Burkholderia cepacia lipase. The Engineered Proteus vulgaris lipase showed >80% activity after 3 h when incubated in 50% methanol with simultaneous sonication. The lipase retained improved longevity (~70% residual activity) over wild-type PVL over repeated use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torrefaction has been proven as a promising pretreatment process that can effectively reduce the moisture content and increase the energy density and higher heating value (HHV) of raw biomass and convert it into high-grade solid biofuel. To reveal the overall efficacy, mechanism, oxygen distribution, and carbon densification during torrefaction, in-depth analyses of solid residues, liquid condensates, and gaseous products became reasonably significant. Therefore, the present work aimed to establish the oxygen distribution and carbon densification mechanism during torrefaction by investigating the characteristics of solid residues, liquid condensates, and gaseous products by performing torrefaction between 225 and 300 °C and retention time (RT) (15-60 min). Results revealed that oxygen distribution and carbon densification are mainly responsible for the upgradation of raw biomass. The oxygen removal efficiency and carbon densification increased by 39.6 and 51.8%, respectively, at 300 °C and 30 min of RT. The densification of carbon in torrefied biomass resulted in an increase of HHV by 41.6% as compared to raw biomass. The oxygens distributed in the form of CO2 (52.4 wt %) and CO (47.5 wt %) in gaseous products and oxygen-containing liquid condensates were mainly water (43.9 wt %) followed by phenols (18.0 wt %), ketones (15.6 wt %), furans (13.1 wt %), aldehydes (4.4 wt %), and acids (4.4 wt %) at 300 °C and 30 min of RT. The physical property like water content improved due to dehydration reaction, while viscosity and pH improved due to decrease in water content and acidic compounds, respectively, present in the liquid condensate. The 13C NMR spectroscopy suggested that the total aromatic carbon and aromaticity of the liquid condensate increased with temperature during the process. ©

AB  - Currently, the major obstacle in the utilization of biofuels produced from the thermochemical processes for the co-refining approach is miscibility with conventional crude oil followed by co-processing to reduce the high oxygen content. The present study attempted to find the appropriate refinery distillate to blend with bio-crude produced via hydrothermal liquefaction to determine the desired process conditions for miscible blend formulation. Boiling point distribution curves revealed that hydrotreated heavy gas oil was found to be the suitable refinery distillate and the desired process conditions were established for 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% blends formulation. Further, 10 wt% blend was hydrotreated to evaluate the hydrodeoxygenation ability of the commercial catalysts such as CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiMo/γ-Al2O3 to reduce the oxygen content. The physicochemical properties of the formulated blends showed that proper mixing took place between bio-crude and hydrotreated heavy gas oil. Hydrotreatment (via co-processing) of the 10 wt% blend revealed that the commercial catalysts can reduce the oxygen content in the range of 21–28%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, ethyl and methyl esters of black mustard (Brassica nigra L.) seed oil using NaOH and KOH were produced. To attain the optimum condition for biodiesel production from black mustard oil, varied catalyst quantity, alcohol amount, reaction temperature, and reaction time were explored and applying polynomial regression method (PRM) adopted. The minimum biodiesel yield was obtained as 96.229% using 45.12 wt% ethanol and 0.838 wt% KOH by weight of oil at 56 min reaction time, and 35.4 °C reaction temperature. On the other hand, the maximum biodiesel yield was achieved to be 97.335% utilizing KOH of 0.4 wt% and methanol of 20.39 wt%, at the reaction temperature of 57.1 °C, and reaction time of 54.1 min. The increase in biodiesel yield was determined to be on the order of 1.4380, 0.0814, 0.0548 and 0.4352% for NaOHMB, KOHMB, NaOHEB, and KOHEB, respectively, with PRM. Consequently, it can be stated that in comparison with the classical method, PRM is a more promising optimization technique in order to get a higher biodiesel yield. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethyl Levulinate (EL), biofuel additive can blend up to 20% with biodiesel to improve its fuel properties. Till the date, there are reports on homogeneous catalysts (H2SO4, ionic liquid) for synthesis of EL from raw biomass like wheat straw. To best of our knowledge, there is no single report on heterogeneous catalyst for one step synthesis of EL directly from wheat straw. This work is a successful attempt to use heterogeneous micro-meso acidic H-USY (post dealumination and desilication) for direct one step conversion of wheat straw to EL with higher EL yield 24.5 wt%, which is probably the highest so far. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The production of biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) from an important biomass platform of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) involves a complicated reaction pathway due to the competition of C=O hydrogenation and C-O hydrogenolysis; however, the dependence of formed intermediates and catalytic sites needs to be further identified. Herein, we constructed a highly efficient and selective Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst via reduction of a CuZnAl-layer double hydroxide (LDH) precursor, aimed for studying the effect of Cu/Cu+ species on forming different intermediates and their synergetic promotional effect on HMF hydrodeoxygenation. As expected, the dependence of formation of different intermediates on the Cu+/Cu ratio was observed; notably, Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 with higher Cu+/Cu ratio finally gave 90.1% DMF selectivity at 100% HMF conversion, more selective than CuNi/Al2O3 (59.6%) and Cu/MgO-Al2O3 (75.8%) references. By a combined study of in situ IR experiments, the observed correlation between the reaction intermediates and the Cu/Cu+ site suggests that Cu tends to adsorb the C=O bond as well as hydrogen molecule, while the Cu+ site is preferable to adsorb and activate the C-O bond. With the synergy of dual active sites, the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst showed both high activity and selectivity to DMF. This work provides deep insight into the nature of active Cu species in multiple functional group biomass platform transformation. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As the demand for biofuels increases globally, microalgae offer a viable biomass feedstock to produce biofuel. With abundant sources of biomass in rural communities, these materials could be converted to biodiesel. Efforts are being done in order to pursue commercialization. However, its main usage is for other applications such as pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and aquaculture, which has a high return of investment. In the last 5 decades of algal research, cultivation to genetically engineered algae have been pursued in order to push algal biofuel commercialization. This will be beneficial to society, especially if coupled with a good government policy of algal biofuels and other by-products. Algal technology is a disruptive but complementary technology that will provide sustainability with regard to the world’s current issues. Commercialization of algal fuel is still a bottleneck and a challenge. Having a large production is technical feasible, but it is not economical as of now. Efforts for the cultivation and production of bio-oil are still ongoing and will continue to develop over time. The life cycle assessment methodology allows for a sustainable evaluation of the production of microalgae biomass to biodiesel. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Recent studies show the feasibility of choosing sewage sludge as feedstock to produce biodiesel. However, low yield of biodiesel as using wet sludge directly, high cost of the pretreatment of sludge drying, and poor cognition about residues utilization, lead to the urgent need of new processes. In this study, hydrothermal process (HP) was introduced for biodiesel production by in situ transesterification. A favorable condition was determined as methanol dosage of 20 g g−1 dried sludge, and 2% sulfuric acid at 160 °C for 4 h, where the biodiesel yield reached 8.63%. HP also shows the ability to break the distinction of biodiesel yield derived from wet or dried sludge, since a similar yield of 8.71% was obtained when using dried sludge as feedstock. Furthermore, solid and liquid residues from HP could be applied as adsorbent for organic pollutant removal and nutrient substrate for yeast cultivation, respectively. A maximum adsorption capacity of 75.52 mg g−1 for Congo red (CR) was obtained using the solid residue as adsorbent. A 4.6 g L−1 biomass of Candida utili and 35.33% of protein in yeast cell were harvested using the liquid residue as nutrient substrate. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of applying HP for biodiesel production from wet sludge, but also brings new insights about full utilization of wet sludge. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of sustainable biofuel production has been promoted in many countries to reduce the use of fossil fuel. This work analyses the life cycle global warming impact, net energy and fossil energy ratios for two alternatives diesohol (diesel/bioethanol) fuels and a new modified diesohol using distilled cashew nut shell liquid/biodiesel. Owing to the molecular structure, biodiesel and distilled cashew nut shell liquid can be used as emulsifier to stabilise the diesohol as well as to slightly reduce the portion of diesel in the blend. The uncertainty analysis, land use change impact, and cost performance comparison in the life cycle assessment were also considered. The well-to-wheel analysis of the biofuel life cycle was used as a system boundary. The results indicated that the global warming impact and the energy performance were not significantly different among the three diesohol alternatives. The global warming impact of all studied alternative fuels was estimated as 68.22–75.69 kg CO2 equivalent/1000 MJ, which was 18–26% lower than that of conventional diesel. This was due to the environmental benefits obtained from biodiesel, bioethanol, and distilled cashew nut shell liquid, avoiding CO2 emissions from combustion in fuel blends because they are of biogenic origin. The substitution of diesel by fuel blends resulted in the net energy ratios (1.01–1.08) and fossil energy ratios (0.96–1.04) of the three alternatives diesohol fuels that were 14–19% and 9–16% higher than that of the conventional diesel. The fossil energy ratios of fuel blends were slightly lower than the net energy ratios by 3.70–4.95%. The LCIA result showed that, according to the uncertainty analysis, the global warming impact from well-to-wheel analysis of the modified diesohol fuel with 85 vol.% diesel, 15 vol.% bioethanol and 20 vol.% (based on the combined volume of diesel and bioethanol) biodiesel was, with 100% probability, less than that of other disohol alternatives studied. The results indicated that alternative diesohol fuel in the case of 15% bioethanol was an environmental and economic superior choice of all studied alternatives fuels because of its lowest global warming impact (with and without LUC), while providing the highest energy efficiency with the net energy ratio and fossil energy ratio of 1.08 and 1.04, respectively. To improve the performance in terms of environmental and eonomic perspectives, the integration of fossil fuels and biofuels would improve the sustainable choices and promote the value-added domestic materials from renewable resources for transportation fuels in Thailand. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA), a lignocellulosic biomass-derived compound has been recognized as one of the versatile building blocks for the synthesis of commodity chemicals having biofuel properties together with potential as precursor for the synthesis of several value-added pharmaceuticals and polymers. Herein, we report the synthesis of catalytically active functionalized porous organic polymer and its utilization as heterogeneous organocatalyst for the synthesis of EL from LA in very high yield. Here, sulfonic acid functionalized porous organic polymer SBZ@POP have been prepared via simple Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with dimethoxymethane followed by sulfonation of the aromatic rings. The structure and properties of the material was examined through PXRD, N2 sorption, HR TEM, 13C CP-MAS NMR, NH3-TPD, TG-DTA and FTIR analysis. Our characterization data suggested nanoscale porosity with high surface acidity in SBZ@POP. The effects of reaction time, catalyst loading, molar ratio of levulinic acid to ethanol and reaction temperature were studied thoroughly to optimize the catalytic activity of SBZ@POP. Under optimized reaction conditions EL yield of 88 % has been achieved with 1:15 molar ratio of LA to ethanol under refluxing conditions in 10 h. This porous organic polymer based organocatalyst displayed good recyclability for consecutive five reaction cycles suggesting the sustainable application potential of this acidic organocatalyst. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present investigation aims to develop simultaneous extraction and conversion of inedible Madhuca longifolia seed oil into biodiesel by one-step acid-catalyzed in situ transesterification/reactive extraction process. Six different types of pretreatment were used to assess maximum yield of biodiesel. The maximum yield of 96% biodiesel was acquired with ultrasonic pretreatment at 1% moisture content, 0.61 mm seed grain size, 55 °C temperature, 400 rpm stirring speed, 15 wt% catalyst (H2SO4) concentration, and with 1:35 seed oil to methanol ratio in a time period of 180 min. This reaction kinetics precedes first order also the finest value of rate constant and activation energy were calculated as 0.003 min−1 and 14.840 kJ mol−1. The thermodynamic energy properties ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are computed as 96457.172 J/mol, 12121.812 J/mol K, and − 257.12 J/mol K correspondingly. The enumerated outcome illustrates a heat absorb non-spontaneous/endergonic and endothermal reaction. The result of proposed work unveils ultrasonic pretreatment escalates the biodiesel efficiency and reactive extraction exemplifies the clean, cost-effective single-step approach for production of biodiesel from non-edible sources. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Bioethanol and direct glucose fuel cells pledged clean energy to the world. Cellulose depolymerization for glucose production has been a successful approach in bioethanol production. Heteropoly acids (HPAs) are strong Brønsted solid acid catalysts for biomass hydrolysis. Keggin type HPAs, namely, Silicotungstic acid (HSiW), Phosphotungstic acid (HPW), and Phosphomolybdic acid (HPMo), were used for the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to glucose. Five different biomass feedstocks, namely, miscanthus, sugarcane leaves, switchgrass, sunflower seeds, and bamboo leaves, were examined for the feasibility of total reducing sugar (TRS) yield through the composition analysis and catalytic biomass hydrolysis. Sunflower seeds contained the maximum holocellulose with 90.6%, and switchgrass contained the least i.e., 77.63%. Among the five biomass tested, switchgrass resulted in the highest TRS (5.77 wt/dry wt. %) with HPMo catalyst at a catalyst to biomass ratio of 30:100 (wt./wt. %), a reaction temperature of 120 °C for 3 h. The reaction parameters for depolymerization were optimized for all three HPAs, and the optimized conditions were 3 h and 120 °C. HPMo showed maximum TRS yield (5.77 wt/dry wt.%) among the three HPAs at 30:100 catalyst to biomass ratio. However, a catalyst to biomass ratio of 20:100 (wt./wt.%) was economical (5.25 wt/dry wt.%) for commercial application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focuses on the synthesis of a novel heterogeneous CoO–NiO promoted sulfated ZrO2 (CN/SZ) catalyst and investigating its catalytic efficiency as a transesterification reagent. Catalytic performance has also been compared with two reference catalysts viz., sulfated ZrO2 (SZ) and pure ZrO2 (Z). Prepared materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, N2- adsorption/desorption study, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), Raman, Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopy techniques. Surface acidity and basicity were assessed by NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) respectively that established high surface acidity and basicity of CN/SZ nanocatalyst. The reagent has shown supreme catalytic performance as only 0.2 wt% catalyst loading amount has provided 98.8% of biodiesel yield with 3:1 MeOH:Oil molar ratio at 65 °C for 2 h. Also, the reusability study has proved the efficacy of CN/SZ nanocatalyst that it can successfully be reused in five consecutive reaction cycles displaying promising results and the reactivated catalyst provided remarkably high biodiesel yield of 96.8%. Further, the mechanistic pathway of the simultaneous catalytic esterification of free fatty acid and transesterification of triglyceride occurring on catalyst surface has also been explored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to gain high bioethanol yield and concentration using reed as a raw material at a low enzyme loading to reduce its production cost. Reed was pretreated with liquid hot water–alkaline/oxygen (LHW–NaOH/O2), and then hydrolyzed at a cellulase loading of 3 fiter paper units/g–substrate with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 to promote fermentation. Approximately 40.2 g/L of bioethanol concentration and 83.7 % (w/w) yield were achieved via separate hydrolysis and fermentation under optimal conditions. PEG 6000 was effective for promoting a high reed-to-bioethanol conversion at a low enzyme loading in the presence of a LHW–NaOH/O2 pretreated substrate. Enzyme dosage in the treatment with PEG 6000 decreased by 88 % compared with that in the treatment without PEG 6,000. The total cost decreased by 72.8 % compared with fed-batch semi-simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Hence, separate hydrolysis and fermentation with PEG 6000 added method was recommended for LHW–NaOH/O2 pretreatment. This study provided an optimal reed-to-bioethanol conversion with a reduced production cost. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The high concentration of oxygenated compounds in pyrolytic products prohibits the conversion of hemicellulose to important biofuels and chemicals via fast pyrolysis. Herein CaO and HZSM-5 was developed to convert xylan and LDPE to valuable hydrocarbons by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and elucidate the reaction mechanism were also investigated in detail. The results indicated that xylan/LDPE copyrolysis was more complicated than pyrolysis of the individual components. LDPE hindered the thermal decomposition and aromatic hydrocarbon formation from xylan at temperatures under 350 °C and had a synergistic effect at high temperatures. 50% LDPE was proven to be more beneficial than other percentages for the formation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, the addition of CaO/HZSM-5 significantly reduced the reaction Ea and increased the reaction rate. CaO can effectively improve the deoxygenation and aromatization reaction, enhancing the yield and selectivity of aromatics to a certain extent. The maximum yield of hydrocarbons (96.01%), mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (88.53%) and SBTXE (85.79%) were obtained at a CaO/HZSM-5 ratio of 1:2, a pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C, a catalytic temperature of 550 °C, a catalyst dose of 1:2 and a xylan-to-LDPE ratio of 1:1 via an ex situ process. The system was dominated by toluene, xylene and alkyl benzene. Diels-Alder reactions of furans and hydrocarbon pool mechanism of nonfuranic compounds improved aromatic formation. This study provides a fundamental for recovering energy and chemicals from pyrolysis of hemicellulose. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - In order to treat waste during oleic acid production, pyrolysis method was used to investigate the plant oil asphalt (POA) to obtain bio-fuel. It was found that the compounds contained alkane, alkene, fatty acid, plant sterol derivatives, alcohol and etc. in pyrolysis products of POA by Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (Py-GC-MS). The Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR-MS) results showed that dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions took place during the pyrolysis process, but the main reaction was decarboxylation. According to van Krevelen diagram the nature of the bio-fuel can be evaluated. The acid value and viscosity of the resulting bio-fuel produced were higher than that of diesel fuel and reference bio-fuel. The calorific value showed a slight lower value than that of diesel oil. These studies nominated POA as a potential renewable feedstock for bio-fuel production the simple pyrolysis method. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) are one of the promising next-generation energy conversion systems. However, their applications are often obstructed by their power density and their lack of long-term operational stability. Enzyme immobilization is one of the strategies to overcome these limitations. The construction of a surface-confined electrode architecture that provides biocompatible microenvironments for enzyme immobilization might be a promising approach to address such barriers. Inspired by the interaction between laccase and copper ions leading to the growth of micrometer-sized flower-like particles, we successfully demonstrate a cathodic electrode design using these hybrid nanoflowers as a biocatalyst for oxygen reduction. Using this electrode architecture, enhanced activity and stability are achieved. By integrating this cathode in a fuel cell setup, two H2/O2fuel cell configurations have been constructed: a membraneless fuel cell (MFC) and a proton exchange membrane H2/O2fuel cell (PEMFC) that show enhancement of the performance. The cell is equipped with an oxygen-reducing laccase-Cu nanoflower/carbon nanotube biocathode and an abiotic anode. The maximum power densities of the H2/O2MFC and PEMFC were 52 μW cm−2and 0.41 mW cm−2, respectively. Remarkably, the H2/O2PEMFC system maintained ∼85% of its initial power density for 15 days at room temperature, which was greatly improved when compared with previous fuel cells with different nanostructures. These results allow a great variety of conductive biocompatible cathodes to be used and engineered, opening vast possibilities for the development of bioelectronics and biosensors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - Biofuels may contain phenolic molecules, which are toxic for humans and can significantly affect engine performance. In this context, amorphous silica surfaces are attractive since they have the potential to separate the harmful molecules from the biofuel constituents through a selective adsorption process. Here, density functional theory is employed to describe the different adsorption modes of toluene and phenol, chosen as model molecules, on amorphous silica surfaces with various silanol densities. It is found that surfaces with densities of 2.0, 3.3, and 4.6 OH/nm2 are optimal to trap phenol, with certain configurations attaining an adsorption energy of more than 100 kJ/mol. These trends remain similar at 300 K as shown by our molecular dynamics simulations, although the interaction energy between the molecules and the surface is reduced due to the temperature. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The effect of temperature (300–650 °C) on the bio-oil quality and yields during pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse was investigated. Results showed that temperature had a profound influence on the pyrolysis products’ yields and bio-oil quality. Elemental analyses of bio-char and bio-oil showed that the carbon content in bio-char increased from 15.25% to 19.31% with increase in temperature from 300 °C to 500 °C and then decreased to 19.18% at 600 °C. Bio-oil and bio-char yields were seen to increase and decrease with an increase in pyrolysis temperature, respectively. Highest bio-oil yield (56.6% wt) was achieved at 500 °C while maximum amounts of bio-char (53.5% wt) and gas (32.9% wt) were obtained at 300 °C followed by at 400 °C. Highest HHV for bio-char (11.78 MJ/kg) was recorded at 500 °C, which decreased with further increase in temperature to 600 °C. Conversely, highest HHV for bio-oil (25.91 MJ/kg) was obtained at 300 °C. The obtained bio-oils were enriched in lignin derivatives and sugars oligomers and their concentration increased with increase in temperatures from 450 to 550 °C. FTIR spectra revealed the presence of aromatics, ethers, alkanes, alkenes and other alcohols in bio-char. Whilst alcohols, alkenes, ethers and other alcohols were noticed in the bio-oil. The complete absence of aromatics in bio-oil facilitates long-term stability of the bio-oil. These results suggest that good yields and high-quality bio-oil from sugarcane bagasse could be obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C. However, for an efficient pyrolysis process with relatively high bio-oil yields, pyrolysis reactor should be operated at 450 °C. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The incorporation of highly active but also highly sensitive catalysts (e.g. the [FeFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) in biofuel cells is still one of the major challenges in sustainable energy conversion. We report the fabrication of a dual-gas diffusion electrode H2/O2 biofuel cell equipped with a [FeFe] hydrogenase/redox polymer-based high-current-density H2-oxidation bioanode. The bioanodes show benchmark current densities of around 14 mA cm−2 and the corresponding fuel cell tests exhibit a benchmark for a hydrogenase/redox polymer-based biofuel cell with outstanding power densities of 5.4 mW cm−2 at 0.7 V cell voltage. Furthermore, the highly sensitive [FeFe] hydrogenase is protected against oxygen damage by the redox polymer and can function under 5 % O2. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Today, biofuels are indispensable in the implementation of fossil fuels replacement processes. This study evaluates ethyl acetate (EA) as a solvent of two straight vegetable oils (SVOs), castor oil (CO), and sunflower oil (SO), in order to obtain EA/SVO double blends that can be used directly as biofuels, or along with fossil diesel (D), in the current compression-ignition (C.I.) engines. The interest of EA as oxygenated additive lies not only in its low price and renewable character, but also in its very attractive properties such as low kinematic viscosity, reasonable energy density, high oxygen content, and rich cold flow properties. Revelant fuel properties of EA/SVO double and D/EA/SVO triple blends have been object of study including kinematic viscosity, pour point (PP), cloud point (CP), calorific value (CV), and cetane number (CN). The suitability of using these blends as fuels has been tested by running them on a diesel engine electric generator, analyzing their effect on engine power output, fuel consumption, and smoke emissions. Results obtained indicate that the D/EA/SO and D/EA/CO triple blends, composed by up to 24% and 36% EA, respectively, allow a fossil diesel substitution up to 60–80% providing power values very similar to conventional diesel.In addition, in exchange of a slight fuel consumption, a very notable lessening in the emission of pollutants as well as a better behavior at low temperatures, as compared to diesel, are achieved. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Paper mill sludge (PMS) solids are predominantly comprised of cellulosic fibers and fillers rejected during the pulping or paper making process. Most sludges are dewatered and discharged into landfills or land spread at a cost to the mill; creating large economic and environmental burdens. This lignocellulosic residual stream can be used as a source of sugars for microbial fermentation to renewable chemicals. The aim of this study was to determine the possibility of converting mill sludge to sugars and then fermentation to either isoprene or ethanol. Chemical analysis indicated that the cellulosic fiber composition between 28 to 68% and hemicellulose content ranged from 8.4 to 10.7%. Calcium carbonate concentration in the sludge ranged from 0.4 to 34%. Sludge samples were enzyme hydrolyzed to convert cellulose fibers to glucose, percent conversion ranged from 10.5 to 98%. Calcium carbonate present with the sludge resulted in low hydrolysis rates; washing of sludge with hydrochloric acid to neutralize the calcium carbonate, increased hydrolysis rates by 50 to 88%. The production of isoprene “very low” (190 to 470 nmol) because the isoprene yields were little. Using an industrial yeast strain for fermentation of the sludge sugars obtained from all sludge samples, the maximum conversion efficiency was achieved with productivity ranging from 0.18 to 1.64 g L−1 h−1. Our data demonstrates that PMS can be converted into sugars that can be fermented to renewable chemicals for industry. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most abundant renewable source of commodity chemicals like hydroxymethylfurfural. Solvothermal hydrodeoxygenation of hydroxymethylfurfural towards value added chemicals was performed with a series of nickel based catalysts supported on different titania materials, ie. hydrothermally-prepared high aspect ratio and commercial TiO2 with different morphologies and crystallographic structures. The kind of titania strongly influenced the properties of the supported nickel nanoparticles, which allowed to tune the reaction selectivity towards specific products. Rutile-containing titania forced stronger Ni-Ti interaction, enhanced hydrogen adsorption, and formed larger Ni particles which resulted in high activity. Hydrothermally-prepared materials allowed to obtain selectively 2,5-bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (biopolymer precursor) due a relatively small surface acidity and large Ni particles. By contrast, large surface area anatase with small nickel particles and small surface acidity allowed to selectively obtain 2,5-dimethylfuran (biofuel additive). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Within the so-called bioliq® process, renewable carbon resources, especially agricultural residues, are converted to gasoline. The process chain comprises pyrolysis of the feedstocks, gasification to synthesis gas, gas cleaning and conversion of synthesis gas to dimethyl ether (DME) followed by conversion of DME to hydrocarbons. Construction of all process units has been completed now and the entire plant has been successfully operated in several campaigns. Thus, hundreds of liters of a new alternative gasoline are available now, which allow for an extensive testing. The basic characteristics of the resulting bioliq®/100 fuel are described. It is rich in aromatics and a blend consisting of 90 Vol.−% of conventional RON95 E5 fuel and 10 Vol.−% of bioliq®/100, designated as bioliq®/10, has been produced which meets the DIN EN 228 standard. Initial measurements on a single cylinder research engine have been carried out focusing on efficiency and emissions. A comparison of bioliq®/10 with neat RON95 E5 revealed an improved knocking behavior of bioliq®/10 even by a small fraction of regenerative bioliq® fuel. Particle as well as hydrocarbon emissions from bioliq®/10 are significantly higher than in the case of RON95 E5. Increased particle emissions are attributed to the higher content of aromatics. Soot reactivity has been investigated and soot from bioliq®/10 exhibits higher reactivity than soot from RON95 E5. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To minimize waste generation in ethanol production from starchy and cellulosic feedstocks, the feasibility of stillage recycle to fermentation process was studied. For sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and palm empty fruit bunch (EFB), optimal hot-compressed water (HCW) pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis (10% wt) gave the highest total reducing sugar (TRS) yields of 64.2% and 67.3%, respectively. Ethanol fermentation of SCB, EFB and fresh cassava by Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR5606 gave the highest yields of 0.31 g g−1, 0.40 g g−1, and 0.31 g g−1 TRS, respectively. For recycling of SCB and EFB stillage, a slight decline of ethanol yield was found while ethanol yield of cassava significantly increased from 60.8% to 89.9%. The ethanol yields from the 2nd recycle of cassava was still 10% higher than no recycle. Addition of 10%–20% v/v black liquor from lignocellulosic HCW pretreatment into anaerobic digestion system noticeably enhanced the chemical oxygen demand removal and methane production. Analysis of variable operating cost showed that stillage recycles for 20% for fresh cassava and 10% for SCB is cost-effective process for ethanol production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, microalgae have been targeted for emitted carbon capture besides producing value-added products like biofuels, biogas, food supplements and other nutrients. The present work has evaluated the carbon dioxide capture potential of microalgae Chlorella sp utilizing the oil and gas industrial vent gas at an Indian gas processing complex. The vent gas CO2 is targeted for bio-fixation and algal biomass was converted into biogas with anaerobic digestion process, which substitutes the natural gas being utilized in heater treater application in the oil and gas process chain. The pilot scale carbon sequestration using two different algal cultivation methods with Chlorella sp with vent CO2 has compared, and biogas has been suggested as one of the emerging and promising solutions to mitigate climate change and supporting energy security challenges. An integrated hybrid model with algal biomass-solar-natural gas has been developed and analyzed for its techno-economic feasibility as carbon mitigation approach and utilizing solar energy for electricity and biogas based heat requirements. The average biomass productivity was found to be 186.43 kg ha1d1 and carbon sequestration quantum of 151.23 kg ha1d1. The study suggests that the productivity and quantum of algal biomass matches with biogas heat equivalent requirement for crude oil heating system and hybrid model is technically viable. The economic feasibility study is based financial modeling and recent Indian government regulations (EMRETR-2017) on the promotion of renewable energy with Renewable Purchase Obligations-2010. The study results and financial modeling derived a reasonable internal rate of return of 24% and payback time of 5.1 years, besides the carbon credits as 191 M$ and 125 $ renewable energy certificate equivalent could further reduce the rate of return and makes better environmental sustainable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass levulinic acid to biorefinery platform organic component n-butyl levulinate is done by an eco-friendly process. The catalyst used for this reaction was prepared by an innovative strategy of impregnating CeO2 and Sm2O3 on silica derived from rice husk, biomass of low economic value, using different methods. The impregnation of ceria and samaria into the silica framework led to a change in the textural properties which was confirmed by various spectroscopic methods. A comprehensive study of the influence of reaction parameters on the esterification of levulinic acid with n-butanol revealed the optimum conditions for maximum yield and selectivity. In the solvent-free condition, the reaction achieved 94.9% conversion of levulinic acid and 97.2% selectivity of n-butyl levulinate within a duration of 1.5 h. The regenerated catalysts were stable and efficient up to four cycles. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Currently, there is an effort to achieve a more widespread use of biofuels, which are an alternative to conventional, petroleum-based fuels in mobile and stationary applications. The conversion of vegetable oils via catalytic hydrotreating to hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) is one of the most promising alternatives to produce high-quality biofuels. In this work, the composition and properties of rapeseed oil hydrotreating products gained over sulfided CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were studied. The experiments were carried out in a laboratory trickle bed reactor in a temperature range of 320-380 °C and pressures of 4 and 8 MPa. The mixture of a rapeseed oil and isooctane was hydrotreated to simulate the coprocessing of rapeseed oil and petroleum fractions. Small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons and, at higher reaction temperatures, considerably high contents of cycloalkanes and isoalkanes were found in the obtained liquid products. These were specifically alkylated cyclopentanes, cyclohexanes, decalines, benzenes, indanes, tetralines, and naphthalenes. The content of isoalkanes and aromatics in the liquid hydrotreating products gained over both catalysts increased with an increasing reaction temperature. A higher total amount of aromatics was found in the products of the NiMo catalyst because of its higher dehydrogenation activity compared with the CoMo catalyst. The liquid products with a high content of n-alkanes had a very high cetane index and cold filter plugging point, which decreased with an increasing reaction temperature due to the increasing content of isoalkanes and aromatics.

AB  - Thermochemical process routes are promising technological routes to convert lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels with similar properties as fossil fuels. In a previous work (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2018 57, 9925-9942), we have studied five base case processes for biofuel production with fixed process structures. This work presents an integrated methodology to consider new process structures for the optimal synthesis of lignocellulosic biomass-to-liquid (BtL) fuel production processes. Given that the five base cases showed not only a significant difference of production costs among the process sections but also distinct biofuel product profiles in terms of gasoline and diesel productivity, the current methodology is developed in two parts: part 1 presents the superstructure synthesis through the step-by-step definition of unit operations' possible interconnections to include all possible new process alternatives than base cases. The superstructure is developed based on the data collected from unit operations' rigorous simulation of the base cases. Part 2 presents the superstructure algorithm setup and optimization for the optimal synthesis of BtL process flowsheets with specified product profiles of gasoline and diesel productivity. Rigorous simulation results for process units and process sections are used in the superstructure formulation and its algorithm development. Three case studies have shown that the integrated methodology can generate new production processes with specified product profiles while having lower total manufacturing costs than base cases.

AB  - Degradation of saccharides is relevant to the design of catalytic therapeutics, the production of biofuels, inhibition of biofilms, as well as other applications in chemical biology. Herein, we report the design of multinuclear Cu complexes that enable cleavage of saccharides under physiological conditions. Reactivity studies with para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-conjugated carbohydrates show that dinuclear Cu complexes exhibit a synergistic effect and promote faster and more robust cleavage of saccharide substrates, relative to the mononuclear Cu complex, while no further enhancement is observed for the tetranuclear Cu complex. The use of scavengers for reactive oxygen species confirms that saccharide cleavage is promoted by the formation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals through CuII/I redox chemistry, similar to that observed for native copper-containing lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LMPOs). Differences in selectivity for di- and tetranuclear Cu complexes are modest. However, these are the first reported small multinuclear Cu complexes that show selectivity and reactivity against mono- and disaccharide substrates and form a basis for further development of metalloglycosidases for applications in chemical biology. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable biofuel suitable for diesel replacement. Biodiesel has in its composition unsaturated fatty esters making it easily degraded. The objective of the present work was to investigate biodiesel thermal-oxidation by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Using the NMR was possible to analyze the signal intensities of the olefinic, bis-allylic and allylic protons of the chemical bonds, obtain the oleic, linoleic, linolenic and saturated acyl groups proportions, observe and classify some oxidation products. Two sets of biodiesel were analyzed, the first was oxidize in the Rancimat equipment at 110 °C during 8 h, and the second was oxidized in an oven at 50 °C during 17 days. The biodiesel oxidized at 110 °C had a more expressive degradation when compared to the samples oxidized at 50 °C. The samples presented an increase in the saturated proportion. It was possible to observe the formation of oxidation products as hydroperoxides and aldehydes as propanal and 2-propenal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Lignocellulose is the most abundant and renewable biomass resource on the planet. Lignocellulose can be converted into biofuels and high-value compounds; however, its recalcitrance makes its breakdown a challenge. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) offer tremendous promise for the degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides. Chaetomium thermophilum, having many LPMO-coding genes, is a dominant thermophilic fungus in cellulose-rich and self-heating habitats. This study explores the genome, secretomes and transcript levels of specific genes of C. thermophilum. Results: The genome of C. thermophilum encoded a comprehensive set of cellulose- and xylan-degrading enzymes, especially 18 AA9 LPMOs that belonged to different subfamilies. Extracellular secretomes showed that arabinose and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) could specifically induce the secretion of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), especially AA9 LPMOs, by C. thermophilum under different carbon sources. Temporal analyses of secretomes and transcripts revealed that arabinose induced the secretion of xylanases by C. thermophilum, which was obviously different from other common filamentous fungi. MCC could efficiently induce the specific secretion of LPMO2s, possibly because the insert in loop3 on the substrate-binding surface of LPMO2s strengthened its binding capacity to cellulose. LPMO2s, cellobio hydrolases (CBHs) and cellobiose dehydrogenases (CDHs) were cosecreted, forming an efficient cellulose degradation system of oxidases and hydrolases under thermophilic conditions. Conclusions: The specific expression of LPMO2s and cosecretion of hydrolases and oxidases by the thermophilic fungus C. thermophilum play an important role in cellulose degradation. This insight increases our understanding of the cellulose degradation under thermophilic conditions and may inspire the design of the optimal enzyme cocktails for more efficient exploration of biomass resources in industrial applications. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrogen (H2) is an effective additive to improve the issue of low laminar burning velocity of some biofuels. In order to better understand the laminar burning characteristics of ethyl acetate (EA) with or without H2 addition, experimental investigations of laminar burning characteristics were carried out by using the high-speed Schlieren photography technique in a constant volume combustion chamber. Tests were conducted under various equivalence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.4 with an initial temperature of 358 K, an initial pressure of 0.1 MPa and a H2/air proportion of 0%, 4%, 8% and 12% by volume. Laminar burning velocities, together with other parameters such as laminar burning flux, flame thickness, Markstein length and Markstein number, were calculated and discussed. In addition, the experimental data were compared with numerical simulations based on the Dayma model. Results showed that the laminar burning velocity of EA was enhanced with the increase of H2 addition, and the maximum value reached 95.09 cm/s at φ = 0.6 with 12% H2, a value more than twice as fast as that of pure EA (39.3 cm/s). Moreover, H2 was found to extend the lower flammability limit of EA. The laminar burning velocities simulated with the Dayma model agreed well with the experimental results of EA at various H2 additions. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Hydropyrolysis is a vital step in IH2® technology for the production of fungible drop-in biofuels from biomass and waste feedstocks. Hydrogen at high pressures in fast hydropyrolysis aids in improving the H/C ratio of bio-oil through deoxygenation pathways such as dehydration, decarboxylation and decarbonylation. The main objectives of this study are to understand the composition of organics and the time evolution of various functional groups during fast hydropyrolysis of pine sawdust at different temperatures, pressures, and in the presence of a catalyst. Analytical fast pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a Pyroprobe® reactor interfaced with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. At high hydrogen partial pressures (10 and 20 bar), significant production of hydrocarbons, in contrast to undesirable oxygen-containing compounds at low pressures, was observed. Moreover, it resulted in a minor increase in the yield of pyrolysates and char, while the yields of pyrolysates and char increased and decreased, respectively, as the temperature was increased at high hydrogen partial pressures. The overall yield of condensable pyrolysates from hydropyrolysis was notably higher as compared to that from pyrolysis in inert atmosphere. The use of a stainless steel catalyst tube in the Pyroprobe® improved the formation of hydrocarbons as compared to that of a quartz tube at high pressures. Upgradation of pyrolysis vapors evolved from hydropyrolysis of pine sawdust at 500 °C and 20 bar over the catalyst bed maintained at 500 °C resulted in selective production of aromatic hydrocarbons (12% C6, 32% C7, 20% C8, 9% C9, 7% C10, and 4% C11). The isothermal mass loss data at short residence times were obtained using the analytical Pyroprobe®, and the apparent rate constants were determined using a 3D-diffusion model. Pyrolysis-FTIR data substantiate the significant increase in methane production with the increase in pressure. Pyrolysate composition data from Py-FTIR and Py-GC/MS techniques at various pressures were assimilated to develop a reaction scheme to describe non-catalytic and catalytic hydropyrolysis of biomass. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The ubiquitous nature of lignocellulosic biomass on planet earth and its economic viability attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and becomes foremost feedstock for biofuel production particularly bioethanol. However, due to complexity in structure, its pretreatment is essentially required prior to actual use. In the present study, a promising approach has been proposed through the development of acid-functionalized magnetic nanocatalysts. Two different acid-functionalized magnetic nanocatalysts i.e. alkylsulfonic acid functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4-MNPs-Si-AS) and butylcarboxylic acid functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4-MNPs-Si-BCOOH) were developed and their efficacy was studied in the pretreatment of sugarcane straw at varying concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 mg/g of straw). The enhanced concentration dependent production of sugar (xylose) was reported in case of both the nanocatalysts. The maximum 17.06 g/L for Fe3O4-MNPs-Si-AS and 15.40 g/L for Fe3O4-MNPs-Si-BCOOH sugar was reported at 500 mg which is comparatively higher than normal acid (H2SO4) (14.63 g/L) and non-treated (0.24 g/L) sugarcane straw. Further, both the nanocatalysts were recovered by applying an external magnetic field and reused for the next two subsequent cycles of pretreatment. It was observed that with every reuse of nanocatalysts the concentration of sugar production was reduced. Moreover, generation of very less amount of toxic inhibitors was reported in the hemicellulosic hydrolyzate obtained in the present study. Considering these facts, it is believed that such nanocatalysts can be used as an effective, eco-friendly and economically viable alternative to the conventional pretreatment agents like mineral acids. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is an intriguing technology that combines thermal deconstruction of the feedstock with upgrading of the vapour and liquid intermediates. To date, in contrast with the current fossil fuel-based industrial processes, several fundamental challenges still impede its widespread deployment to generate renewable, cost-competitive biofuels and/or value-added chemicals. Catalyst improvements and process development offer a substantial opportunity to advance the technology. In this work, a novel zeolite catalyst SiC@MZSM-5 was successfully synthesized by growing ZSM-5 on SiC nanowires. The improved thermal conductivity was envisioned to minimize adverse effects of the downstream fixed-bed temperature fluctuation resulting from strong exothermic reactions during catalytic upgrading, hence fostering product distribution regulation. Concurrently, the pyrolysis process was managed to remove the heavy fractions from pyrolysis vapours by its internal recycling and forced secondary degradation, alleviating catalyst deactivation risk and thus extending the regeneration interval. The co-optimization of catalyst and process strategy improved the catalyst lifetime, optimized fixed-bed temperature distribution, and preserved the catalytic performance. © 2020

AB  - Change in the climatic conditions due to uncontrolled emission of carbon dioxide is continuously encouraging to search alternative renewable energy sources. Corn stover is one of the several feedstocks being considered as growth medium for oil producing bacteria. India ranks third in the production of corn in the world. The present study focused on biodiesel synthesis from microbial oil, chemical profiling and evaluation of physicochemical properties of produced biodiesel. The bacterium was isolated from food waste resources and identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (MF510169) on the basis of morphological‚ biochemical characters and 16S rRNA sequencing. The bacterium B. amyloliquefaciens (MF510169) was grown on corn stover as an ideal agro-waste feedstock. The bacterium grown on corn stover peels revealed maximum lipid production after acid hydrolysis (0.25% HCl) over other feedstocks used under study. The bacterium produces 3.8% oil under operating parameters, i.e. inoculum size, density, carbon and nitrogen source, C/N ratio, temperature, pH, rotational speed and fermentation period. The oil was transesterified using sulphuric acid (0.12%) as a catalyst to form fatty acids methyl esters. Transesterification reaction was optimised at various parameters like catalyst type, catalyst loading, oil: methanol ratio, temperature and reaction time. The chemical profiling of FAMEs revealed hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, 9-1, 2 octadecanoic acid methyl ester, octadecanoic acid methyl ester and methyl stearate as characterised by using GC–MS, GC-FID, FTIR and NMR techniques. The physicochemical properties of transesterified biodiesel revealed 85% similarity with the ASTM International Standards. The produced biodiesel from Bacillus could be exploited at commercial level after successful engine trial tests. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Biodiesel quality is dependent upon the fatty acids distribution of the raw material used in the trans/esterification reactions. While microalgae cells are regarded as potential oil suppliers for the biodiesel production chain, a common criticism is related to the low lipid productivities and often to a poor fatty acid distribution. In the present work we propose to submit microalgal cultivation to a second stage with nutritional stress by a simple addition of a 70% nitrate source depleted medium at the beginning of stationary phase, without harvesting cells, saving time and water. Chlorella minutissima was cultivated in a novel unconventional photobioreactor, named Internally Illuminated Integrated Photobioreactor (ILI-PBR), to verify the efficiency of the proposed strategy. Biomass concentration, lipid content and volumetric lipids productivity increased 24.9%, 120.7% and 55.6%, respectively, from Stage 1 to Stage 2, when ILI-PBR was illuminated by constant blue LED and 0.5 vvm of aeration. The fatty acid profiles, evaluated in terms of LED illumination (white, red and blue), showed a predominance of palmitic acid in all cases (59.49%, 57.28% and 46.51%, respectively), which allowed to enhance some biodiesel properties such as cetane number, cold filter plugging point, density and kinematic viscosity, according to international specifications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The proposed research intended to acquire the perception of proficient biomethane generation enhanced by TiO2 embedded chitosan thin film (TCTF) mediated enzyme secreting bacterial pretreatment of sludge. Impregnates 0.05 g/g SS TiO2 dosage on chitosan solid matrix effectively disperse sludge flocs and induces deflocculation of 99.35%. This TCTF enhances the enzyme secreting bacterial disintegration by increasing the hydrolytic activity. A higher solubilisation of 16% achieved in TCTF mediated bacterial disintegration while related to enzyme secreting bacterial disintegration alone. The high specific growth rate of 0.2 h−1 for enzyme secreting bacterial growth rate is attained at 42 h. Deflocculation and enzyme secreting bacterial pretreatment has a major impact on methane potential assay. The sludge sample TCTF mediated bacterial disintegration yields 140.40 mL/g COD higher methane than the other samples. The energetic and cost analysis of the proposed work confirms the feasibility of this sludge management process having profitable net cost of 89.92 USD/Ton of sludge. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advancement in the field of biomass and bioenergy has pulled in researchers to produce biofuels derived from naturally accessible feedstock by adopting diverse innovative approaches in biomass pretreatment. In this study, pyrolysis of micro algae with downstream processing of biomass from the resonator cavity under atmospheric pressure was conducted and hydrogen production produced under different microwave power was analyzed. With the increase in microwave power, the hydrogen gas yield accounted to be as twice as that at lower power, where the concentration of produced hydrogen accounts for about 30.80%, 33.20%, and 37.58% at microwave power levels of 800, 900 and 1000 W. It was also observed that no methane was produced in this study since most of the methane produced from microwave plasma conversion has reacted with CO2 and produced CO and H2, hence dropped in the concentration of CO2 with decline in power intensity. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Scale-up and commercialization of biodiesel is often delimited by costly feedstock that adds up to the process costs. These underlying issues demand the exploration of unconventional cheap feed to improve the process economics. Conversion of waste cooking oil (WCO) into biodiesel could reduce the process costs by 60–70%. However, the continuous exposure to heat during frying leads to oxidation as well increase in the free fatty acid (FFA) content which intensifies the time and energy required for transesterification. The present study analyzes the effect of parameters over the conversion of WCO (with 8.17% FFA) into biodiesel via two-step acid-alkali-based microwave-assisted transesterification. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the oil:methanol volume ratio, microwave power, and reaction time during the acid-catalyzed esterification to bring down the FFA below 1%. Microwave irradiation of 250 W, with methanol:oil molar ratio of 19.57:1 [oil:methanol volume ratio of 1.31 (expressed as decimal)] and reaction time of 35 s, resulted in 0.082% of FFA. Alkali-catalyzed transesterification with methanol:oil molar ratio of 5:1 with 2% sodium hydroxide at 65 °C thereby produced fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with the volumetric biodiesel yield of 94.6% in 30 min. Physiochemical properties of the transesterified WCO were well comparable with the biodiesel standards. The study highlights the essentiality of multivariate optimization for the esterification process that could aid in understanding the interactive effects of variables over FFA content. Such studies would benefit in scaling up of the transesterification process at industrial level by improving the economics of the overall bioprocess. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Abstract: Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH, EC 1.1.99.18) from white rot fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium can be used for constructing biosensors and biofuel cells, for bleaching cotton in textile industry, and recently, the enzyme has found an important application in biomedicine as an antimicrobial and antibiofilm agent. Stability and activity of the wild-type (wt) CDH and mutants at methionine residues in the presence of hydrogen peroxide were investigated. Saturation mutagenesis libraries were made at the only methionine in heme domain M65 and two methionines M685 and M738 in the flavin domain that were closest to the active site. After screening the libraries, three mutants with increased activity and stability in the presence of peroxide were found, M65F with 70% of residual activity after 6 h of incubation in 0.3 M hydrogen peroxide, M738S with 80% of residual activity and M685Y with over 90% of residual activity compared to wild-type CDH that retained 40% of original activity. Combined mutants showed no activity. The most stable mutant M685Y with 5.8 times increased half-life in the presence of peroxide showed also 2.5 times increased kcat for lactose compared to wtCDH and could be good candidate for applications in biofuel cells and biocatalysis for lactobionic acid production.

AB  - The present article demonstrates designing of novel catalyst, 12-tungstosilicic acid (TSA) anchored to ordered nano-porous MCM-48 (nMCM-48); TSA/nMCM-48, characterization and evaluation for synthesis of bio-fuel additives via glycerol valorisation with aromatic aldehydes. The nanopores of support were confirmed by BET and TEM while the interaction between TSA and nMCM-48 was confirmed by decrease in the surface area and pore volume of the catalysts. Assessment of vital reaction parameters (% loading of active species, mole ratio of reactants, catalyst amount, temperature and time) were performed to achieve maximum conversion of glycerol. The catalyst showed noteworthy performance at 30 °C towards conversion (>85 %) and thermodynamically stable dioxane derivative (>60 %) with remarkable TON (5945 for benzaldehyde and 7355 for furfural). The catalyst was regenerated and used for successive four catalytic runs with almost same activity. The superiority of novel catalyst is because of its geometry and nano porosity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel robust diphosphine-ruthenium(ii) complex has been developed that can efficiently catalyze both the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and its in situ condensation with carboxylic acids to form methyl esters; a TON of up to 3260 is achievable for the CO2 to methanol step. Both aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids can be transformed to their corresponding methyl esters with high conversion and selectivity (17 aliphatic and 18 aromatic examples). On the basis of a series of experiments, a mechanism has been proposed to account for the various steps involved in the catalytic pathway. More importantly, this approach provides a promising route for using CO2 as a C1 source for the production of biofuels, fine chemicals and methanol. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The deployment of low-carbon energy (LCE) technologies and management of installations represents an imperative to face climate change. LCE planning is an interminable process affected by a multitude of social, economic, environmental, and health factors. A major challenge for policy makers is to select a future clean energy strategy that maximizes sustainability. Thus, policy formulation and evaluation need to be addressed in an analytical manner including multidisciplinary knowledge emanating from diverse social stakeholders. In the current work, a comparative analysis of LCE planning is provided, evaluating different multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies. Initially, by applying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, the available energy alternative technologies are prioritized. A variety of stakeholders is surveyed for that reason. To deal with the ambiguity that occurred in their judgements, fuzzy goal programming (FGP) is used for the translation into fuzzy numbers. Then, the stochastic fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (SF-AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (F-TOPSIS) are applied to evaluate a repertoire of energy alternative forms including biofuel, solar, hydro, and wind power. The methodologies are estimated based on the same set of tangible and intangible criteria for the case study of Thessaly Region, Greece. The application of FGP ranked the four energy types in terms of feasibility and positioned solar-generated energy as first, with a membership function of 0.99. Among the criteria repertoire used by the stakeholders, the SF-AHP evaluated all the criteria categories separately and selected the most significant category representative. Finally, F-TOPSIS assessed these criteria ordering the energy forms, in terms of descending order of ideal solution, as follows: solar, biofuel, hydro, and wind. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) is widely used in the industry and is mainly produced from petroleum. Some works have projected MEK as a possible fuel since its performance in spark engines has overcome the performance of gasoline in certain indexes. Two intensified alternatives to produce MEK are introduced here, consisting of a reactive distillation column, an extractive distillation column, and three conventional distillation columns. The direct alternative resulted as the most promising when it was evaluated based on energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and an environmental index. The obtained energy consumption for MEK production was 11.62 MJ kgMEK−1 for the entire process. Moreover, those intensified alternatives showed better performance indexes in comparison with a conventional process. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Fuel composition is proved to have a significant influence on the performance of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems. In the present research, the effect of hydrogen injection to biogas-fed SOFC power systems is investigated. Hydrogen production is performed through implementing a Photovoltaic-based solar system to electrolyze water by means of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. In the present research, waste water as the primary source of energy is chosen to drive a novel integration of photovoltaic with SOFC systems. For comparison reasons, two cases depending on the hydrogen storage scenario or hydrogen utilization in the SOFC system are developed. Thermodynamics and exergoeconomic models have been developed to analyze the performance of proposed systems. Results indicate that increasing the molar ratio of hydrogen in the biofuel mixture up to 0.35 increases the SOFC cell voltage and the system net output power up to 4%. Also, due to the certain advantages of hydrogen, blending hydrogen with biogas results in a reduction of CO2 emission by 16%. The overall efficiency of the system, when the produced hydrogen is totally stored in the storage tank, would be higher than that of the system where the produced hydrogen is partially utilized in the SOFC system. The economic analysis revealed that the unit product cost of the system shows approximately a linear reduction with an increase in the hydrogen amount of the fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mixtures with high fatty acid content are produced during vegetable oil and animal fat purification and paper production. These waste fractions can be converted into alternative fuels through several steps. The co-hydrogenation of waste polypropylene thermal cracked fraction or waste fatty acid mixture with unrefined gas oils is a potential solution for their conversion into hydrocarbons. The co-processing of these three different fractions was not yet investigated in these ratios. So the aim of the research work was to produce high quality diesel fuels and to study the occurring reactions and the interaction among these different compounds. The catalytic conversion of the mixture of unrefined gas oil, waste polypropylene cracked fraction (20 wt %) and waste fatty acid mixture (10, 20 and 30 wt %) was carried out on a commercial sulphided nickel-molybdenum-alumina catalyst. The effect of the feedstock compositions and the process parameters on the quantity and quality of the products was studied. The favourable process conditions to produce high quality diesel fuel blending components were selected (e.g., 10 wt % fatty acid waste, 360 °C temperature, 1.0 h−1 liquid hourly space velocity). The performance properties of this fuel were better than the conventional diesels’, so their usage can be more environmentally friendly and lead to lower pollutant emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, MgO/MgFe2O4 heterogeneous magnetic nanocatalyst was used in biodiesel production and to study its structural and morphological characteristics, various methods have been used in MgO addition on the support. Impregnation, Precipitation, Precipitation – Hydrothermal, Precipitation – Ultrasonic and Combustion methods were utilized to add the MgO on the MgFe2O4 to find the suitable surface structure and catalytic activity. Combustion synthesis was used as a facile and low cost preparation route for fabrication of all nanocatalysts’ support because of suitable porosity for the biodiesel production reaction. For this purpose, the samples were analysed by XRD, FESEM, EDX, BET-BJH, and FTIR and then used in the transesterification reaction. Results indicate the sheet like morphology in precipitation and precipitation-hydrothermal methods and lower particle size in combustion synthesized nanocatalyst. Suitable surface structure and proper pore size and volume caused the combustion prepared sample to score the highest yield of 92.9% in biodiesel production from sunflower oil. This sample showed proper stability and reusability potential while the structure remained intact after five times being used in the reaction. Due to the magnetic characteristic of the support the catalyst separation was easy and this caused negligible catalyst loss. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing the content of biodiesel in the diesel fuel mixture faces some challenges due to the presence of steryl glucosides (SG) compounds, which causes the filter clogging and the reduction of engine power. In this study, coarse filter paper-based nanocrystalline cellulose (CFP-based NCC) with the crystallinity of 85.73% is selected as a potential adsorbent to separate SG compounds in palm-based biodiesel (PO–B100). The adsorption experiments were carried out at various CFP-based NCC to PO-B100 mass ratio (1:50, 1:75, 1:100, 1:125, 1:150, 1:175, 1:200) and temperature (65, 75, 85 °C). The maximum SG removal was 91.81%, obtained at 75 °C for CFP-based NCC to PO-B100 mass ratio of 1:50. The adsorption treatment also improves the cold stability of PO-B100 by reducing the cloud point from 13.2 °C to 11.5 °C. Langmuir isotherm model is best-fitted to the equilibrium adsorption data and thermodynamic studies suggested that the adsorption of SG onto the CFP-based NCC surface is spontaneous and endothermic. The isotherm and thermodynamic study showed that the mechanism governing the adsorption process may be driven by both dipole-dipole interactions and ion exchange. The adsorption results showed that CFP-based NCC has great affinity and selectivity to SG and can be considered as a promising adsorbent of SG. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The valorization of biorefinery downstream lignin fractions is a key issue in increasing the sustainability of second-generation biofuels. The development of reliable methodologies for the selective determination of the apparent masses of the poly(hydroxy)-aromatic ethers arising from lignin depolymerization reaction is crucial. Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) has been tested to estimate the molecular weight in downstream biorefinery lignins and base-catalyzed depolymerization reaction mixtures. Excellent correlation was found in the calibration of molecular weight and diffusion coefficients with standards. DOSY permitted the selective estimation of the apparent masses of different fractions in the lignin and in the depolymerization reaction mixtures, providing a more profound knowledge of the reaction mixture composition than that obtained with traditional size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Excellent correlations have been achieved in the estimation of the apparent masses of poly(hydroxy)-aromatic ethers between SEC and DOSY. This permits a reliable estimation of the molecular weight of different fractions in the lignin and in the depolymerization product, which is essential for their further applications. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This work investigates the catalytic activity of geopolymers produced using two different alkali components (sodium or potassium) and four treatment temperatures (110 to 700 °C) for the methyl transesterification of soybean oil. The geopolymers were prepared with metakaolin as an aluminosilicate source and alkaline activating solutions containing either sodium or potassium in the same molar oxide proportions. The potassium-based formulation displayed a higher specific surface area and lower average pore size (28.64–62.54 m2/g; 9 nm) than the sodium formulation (6.34–32.62 m2/g; 17 nm). The reduction in specific surface area (SSA) after the heat treatment was more severe for the sodium formulation due to the higher thermal shrinkage. The catalytic activity of the geopolymer powders was compared under the same reactional conditions (70–75 °C, 150% methanol excess, 4 h reaction) and same weight amounts (3% to oil). The differences in performance were attributed to the influences of sodium and potassium on the geopolymerization process and to the accessibility of the reactants to the catalytic sites. The Na-based geopolymers performed better, with FAME contents in the biodiesel phase of 85.1% and 89.9% for samples treated at 500 and 300 °C, respectively. These results are competitive in comparison with most heterogeneous base catalysts reported in the literature, considering the very mild conditions of temperature, excess methanol and catalyst amount and the short time spent in reactions. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The cytochromes P450 are versatile enzymes found in all forms of life. Most P450s use dioxygen on a heme center to activate substrates, but one class of P450s utilizes hydrogen peroxide instead. Within the class of P450 peroxygenases, the P450 OleTJE isozyme binds fatty acid substrates and converts them into a range of products through the α-hydroxylation, β-hydroxylation and decarboxylation of the substrate. The latter produces hydrocarbon products and hence can be used as biofuels. The origin of these product distributions is unclear, and, as such, we decided to investigate substrate positioning in the active site and find out what the effect is on the chemoselectivity of the reaction. In this work we present a detailed computational study on the wild-type and engineered structures of P450 OleTJE using a combination of density functional theory and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods. We initially explore the wild-type structure with a variety of methods and models and show that various substrate activation transition states are close in energy and hence small perturbations as through the protein may affect product distributions. We then engineered the protein by generating an in silico model of the double mutant Asn242Arg/Arg245Asn that moves the position of an active site Arg residue in the substrate-binding pocket that is known to form a salt-bridge with the substrate. The substrate activation by the iron(IV)-oxo heme cation radical species (Compound I) was again studied using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods. Dramatic differences in reactivity patterns, barrier heights and structure are seen, which shows the importance of correct substrate positioning in the protein and the effect of the second-coordination sphere on the selectivity and activity of enzymes. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass conversion into biofuels and biogas is a promising way for power and heat generation. Lately, research has focused on the production of biomethane based on biomass gasification followed by methanation as an alternative to fossil natural gas. The challenge of this process remains in the intensive gas cleaning and required tar removal. In order to study tar removal from the producer gas downstream biomass gasification, solid–vapor and liquid–vapor equilibrium must be known for different tar concentrations, ranging between 0.001 and 100 g.Nm−3. To assess tar removal by condensation at low temperatures, psychrometric charts are developed. Since the composition of tar is complex, toluene, phenol, indene, naphthalene and fluoranthene are selected as tar representatives. Each component is studied separately in four different producer gas compositions formed mainly of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane in addition to water and nitrogen. Methods for calculating saturation, isenthalpic and constant relative concentration lines are presented. Psychrometric charts of the different tar components are finally plotted at atmospheric pressure. Results show that temperature of 196.15 K is required to reduce the tar content to 0.001 g.Nm−3. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In view of the fast depletion of fossil fuels, biodiesel seems to be a possible new alternative to counter the fuel crisis. In order to avoid excessive exploitation of agricultural land for the production of food crop feedstock, the main focus has been on the usage of waste cooking oils meant for disposal to be used in biodiesel production. However, the high free fatty acid (FFA) content in waste oils has been an issue and it is envisaged that heterogeneous acid catalysts can be utilised as they would have a higher tolerance of FFAs and water. In this study, we report the synthesis and the utilisation of an inexpensive heterogeneous acid catalyst, namely ammonium ferric sulphate-calcium silicate (AFS-CS) synthesised via the impregnation method in 2:1 mass ratio in biodiesel production. The reaction conditions for esterification of lauric acid (LA) was optimised by using both standard and statistical analysis method which gave maximum methyl esters conversion of 100% within 2 h reaction time, 4 wt% of AFS-CS catalyst amount and 15:1 molar ratio of methanol to LA at 65 °C. Palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) was esterified by using the same optimised conditions, which gave 72.6% of methyl esters conversion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass derived from non-food crops cultivated on lands that are increasingly marginal for more favoured major crops is a potential source of sustainable renewable energy. This study explores the transformation of crude organic phase pyrolytic oil derived from Napier grass biomass into high-grade biofuel precursors via hydrodeoxygenation reaction over platinum and palladium catalysts with in-situ hydrogen generation from methanol. The reaction was conducted in a high-pressure stainless steel batch reactor at 350 °C, 20 wt% methanol ratio, 2 wt% catalyst loading and 60 min reaction time. The result of physicochemical analysis showed that the higher heating value of the organic liquid products collected over the catalysts increased by 35–40% relative to the raw sample. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results revealed significant reductions in the oxygenated compounds such as methoxyaromatics, methoxyphenols, acids, aldehydes. The degree of deoxygenation and overall extent of upgrading observed was 50–54% and 56–60%, respectively. The gas products collected were mainly carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Hydrodeoxygenation, hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, dehydration, demethylation, hydrocracking, decarbonylation and decarboxylation were the main upgrading reactions, and a multiple reaction network was proposed. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The phase-out of fossil fuels in the heavy transportation sector will require energy-dense biofuels like methanol, and will likely require that a wide range of biomasses are utilized. In this framework, gasification of straw and subsequent upgrading to methanol represents a potentially advantageous conversion route. In this study, the established low-temperature circulating fluid bed (LTCFB) gasifier is coupled to a partial oxidation (POX) and char bed reactor, which enables a relatively robust and effective conversion of tars - making the product gas suitable for methanol synthesis. Five scenarios producing methanol via traditional air-separation units and electrolysis were thermodynamically modeled and analyzed in Aspen Plus. The analysis showed state-of-the-art biomass-to-methanol energy efficiencies up to 54–56% and overall carbon conversions above 57%. A parametric analysis on the POX temperature revealed the potential to increase efficiency and the carbon conversion up to 58% and 68%, respectively. The proposed systems outperform alternative systems framed on straw gasification, and exceed in terms of efficiency and overall carbon conversion other solutions based on wood-gasification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The paper describes transesterification of oil by methanol with use of cosolvents such as ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, hexane, acetone and diethyl ether at catalyst homogeneous (potassium hydroxide) and heterogeneous (mixed oxides). The cosolvents dissolve oil and methanol to form a single (homogeneous) phase, which increases the reaction rate. Therefore, the biodiesel production will be environmentally friendly because less energy is consumed, which increases sustainability. The whole binodal curve of ternary plots of oil, methanol and cosolvent was determined to find the molar ratio, in which the reaction mixture forms a single phase. The ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran have relatively small heterogeneous region, because of the similarity of their electric dipole moment with methanol. After transesterification, the detailed analysis of ester and also glycerol phase was carried out. For homogeneous catalyst, the highest esters content in the ester phase was achieved with tetrahydrofuran. For heterogeneous catalyst, the ester content was lower with cosolvent than without cosolvent, probably due to dilution of reaction components by cosolvent or bonding of cosolvent to the active sites of the catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports an experimental investigation into the pyrolysis of acid-impregnated levoglucosan at 80–140 °C to understand the fundamental reaction mechanism of acid-catalysed levoglucosan pyrolysis. Glucose, anhydro-disaccharides and disaccharides of various linkages have been successfully identified as major primary products during acid-catalysed levoglucosan pyrolysis at such low temperatures. Among all identified primary products, glucose has the highest initial selectivity of ~20%, indicating hydrolysis reaction plays an important role during acid-catalysed levoglucosan pyrolysis. The formation of anhydro-disaccharides of various α and β linkages (including 1,4-, 1,3-, and 1,2-glycosidic bond) clearly demonstrates the importance of polymerisation reactions during acid-catalysed levoglucosan pyrolysis. In addition, disaccharides of various α and β linkages (including 1,6-, 1,4-, 1,3-, 1,2-, 1,1-glycosidic bond) are also minor primary products from acid-catalysed levoglucosan pyrolysis. Once those primary products are formed, they are easily polymerised into high-DP anhydro-sugar and sugar oligosaccharides, with a highest DP of up to ~10 at 120 °C. At 140 °C, the oligosaccharides are also easily condensed to form char, as evidenced by post-hydrolysis results. Increasing acid loading level enhances the formation of glucose and disaccharides, but has negligible effect on the formation of anhydro-disaccharides. These results provide new insights into the fundamental mechanism of acid-catalysed levoglucosan pyrolysis for producing biofuels and biochemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Invertase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was entrapped in Ca-alginate and Ca-alginate-kappa-carrageenan matrix. Optimum pH for the free and immobilized invertase was found to be 4.5 and 5.5, respectively. The optimum hydrolysis temperature was 55 °C for both the free and immobilized forms. Km values for free invertase and invertase entrapped in Ca-alginate and Ca-alginate-kappa-carrageenan beads were 15, 21, and 19 mM, respectively. Values of Vmax for free invertase and invertase entrapped in Ca-alginate and Ca-alginate-kappa-carrageenan beads were 238, 186, and 197 mM min−1, respectively. Invertase entrapped in Ca-alginate-kappa-carrageenan matrix had the highest pH and thermal stability, higher reusability with 71% retention in activity after nine batches of reuse and higher storage stability with 86% activity retention after 12 weeks at 4 °C, pH 4.5. Fermentation of cane molasses by yeast for bioethanol formation in the presence of free invertase at 30 °C, pH 5.0, led to an increase in ethanol production by 3%. However, the production increased by 9% when invertase entrapped in Ca-alginate-kappa-carrageenan was used as a catalyst.Highlights Invertase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was entrapped in Ca-alginate beads. For efficient encapsulation of invertase, kappa-carrageenan was used in combination with alginate as a matrix. Entrapment in Ca-alginate-kappa-carrageenan increased pH and thermal stability of invertase. Invertase entrapped in Ca-alginate-kappa-carrageenan was used for bioethanol production from cane molasses. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Jojoba is one of the main two known plant source of natural liquid wax ester for use in various applications, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and biofuel. Due to the lack of transcriptomic and genomic data on lipid biosynthesis and accumulation, molecular marker breeding has been used to improve jojoba oil production and quality. In the current study, the transcriptome of developing jojoba seeds was investigated using the Illunina NovaSeq 6000 system, 100 × 106 paired end reads, an average length of 100 bp, and a sequence depth of 12 Gb per sample. A total of 176,106 unigenes were detected with an average contig length of 201 bp. Gene Ontology (GO) showed that the detected unigenes were distributed in the three GO groups biological processes (BP, 5.53%), cellular component (CC, 6.06%), and molecular functions (MF, 5.88%) and distributed in 67 functional groups. The lipid biosynthesis pathway was established based on the expression of lipid biosynthesis genes, fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, FA desaturation, FA elongation, fatty alcohol biosynthesis, triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, phospholipid metabolism, wax ester biosynthesis, and lipid transfer and storage genes. The detection of these categories of genes confirms the presence of an efficient lipid biosynthesis and accumulation system in developing jojoba seeds. The results of this study will significantly enhance the current understanding of wax ester biology in jojoba seeds and open new routes for the improvement of jojoba oil production and quality through biotechnology applications. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The production of oil from microalgae is a process with a long way to go before reaching commercial viability. High costs associated with harvesting and solvent extraction make it difficult to compete with fossil fuel. The in-situ, non-destructive, repetitive extraction of lipids from Botryococcus braunii (milking) offers an alternative to the conventional microalgal-oil production process, with significantly reduced nutrient, dewatering and cultivation costs. Here, we compare low shear column solvent extraction with high shear stirred tank solvent extraction to ascertain which is better suited to a repetitive extraction process using B. braunii and carry out a preliminary economic analysis on the nutrient costs and raceway pond area requirements once scaled to industrial production. Stirred tank extraction with heptane resulted in five times higher productivities than that of column solvent extraction. Using this to generate an extraction model we found a lipid productivity of 104 mg L-1 day-1 was possible, six times greater than that of previous repetitive extraction studies. Thanks to the high lipid content of the B. braunii biomass generated in the recovery phase, when scaled to open raceway ponds, a lipid productivity of 13.4 g m-2 day-1 can be predicted. With this productivity, an estimated combined carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cost of $2.52 L-1 of oil produced and a cultivation pond area of 3.53 km2 (assuming an annual oil production of 15,900 m3 year-1) is predicted, corresponding to reductions when compared to conventional extraction of 40% and 50% respectively. This repetitive extraction process provides an alternative method for the production of 3rd generation biofuels without the need to harvest and dewater algal biomass with significant reductions in nutrient and pond area requirements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the current work, Lean Pre-vaporized Premixed (LPP) combustion concept was used to investigate the flame characteristics of blended fuels using 5, 10, 15, and 20% blending ratios of Waste Cooking Oil Methyl Ester (WCOME) with Jet A-1 (symbolized as B5, B10, B15, and B20). Here, WCOME was produced from raw waste cooking oil by transesterification process with the help of ultrasonicator to reduce the production time. The flame was stabilized using a swirl burner characterized by the formation of central recirculation zone with Swirl Number (SN) equal 0.55; commonly called High Swirl Burner (HSB). The incoming air was preheated to a constant temperature of 250 °C and mixed with air at equivalence ratio φ of 0.75 for all tested fuel blends. Comparing to neat Jet A-1 fuel flame, flames of WCOME/Jet A-1 fuel blend revealed great effect of adding biodiesel to Jet A-1 on local and global emission characteristics of LPP combustion with comparable temperature distributions. Results showed a significant reduction in CO and NOx emissions indices for B20 at combustor exit by 41% and 30%, respectively, compared to those for pure Jet A-1 fuel. Aiming to increase the share of biofuel in fuel combustion, it can be concluded that, Jet A-1 fuel can be replaced by B20 without any modifications in the combustor design as they have similar temperature distribution with potential to remarkably reduce emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The experimentally obtained biodiesel from used vegetable oil is used as an alternative energy source that has been synthesized from reactions directed by a solid acid catalyst. The solid acid catalyst was prepared by sulfonating rubber from rubber for used tires. For the realization and analysis of biodiesel tests in the internal combustion engine, an experimental design was applied in which the type of biofuel feed was used as the main control, namely pure commercial diesel (DIEP), a mixture of 50/50% biodiesel-diesel (MEBD) and pure biodiesel (BIOP). The performance values and the emission and combustion characteristics of the fuel feed were investigated and compared under the same experimental conditions. During gas combustion, a considerable reduction of CO, unburned hydrocarbon and NOx emissions was achieved by using BIOP obtained in the laboratory compared to DIEP. © 2020, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered as a platform chemical derived from C6 sugars, which can be transformed into various important biochemicals and biofuels. The preparation of HMF in an efficient and green way is of great significance for its large scale production. Attapulgite modified by phosphoric acid (ATP-P) has been used to transform saccharides (fructose, glucose, inulin and starch) into HMF in a 2-butanol-water biphasic system with satisfactory results, in which HMF yields of 96.3% and 50.4% were obtained from fructose and starch, respectively. The amount of Brønsted acid sites of ATP notably increases after modification by phosphoric acid, which endows ATP with a proper B/L ratio (Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites) for HMF production. This B/L ratio is necessary because the production of HMF from saccharides is a multistep mechanism that involves isomerization catalyzed by Lewis acid sites and dehydration by Brønsted acid sites. Moreover, the catalyst provides good stability because the catalytic activity remained nearly unchanged after it was used 4 times. This work provides a green and economic alternative for biomass conversion using natural clays as catalysts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Barley straw from brewing process is an attractive and renewable raw material for the production of biofuel and useful chemicals, such as xylitol. It is necessary to determine the best conditions of biomass hydrolysis and fermentation for boosting the incorporation of this biomass in a biorefinery. Methods: We optimized the conditions for acid hydrolysis of barley straw to obtain a hemicellulosic hydrolysate rich in xylose with low energy consumption. Moreover, the energy consumption was simulated per quantity of xylose extracted. In order to obtain a hydrolysate with the highest xylose extraction efficiency (99%), low inhibitors concentration and energy consumption (8.41 KW/Kg Xylose), we used 1.0% H2SO4 (w/v) at 120 °C, with 1:10 dry-weight/acid solution for 40 min. We also optimized the medium composition to improve xylitol production by Candida guilliermondii. Results: The hemicellulosic hydrolysate was used as a fermentation medium and the best condition showing the highest xylitol volumetric productivity (0.69 g L−1 h−1) by C. guilliermondii was found to be 60 g L−1 initial xylose supplemented with 1.5 g L−1 (NH4)2SO4, 0.75 CaCl2 and 8.75 g L−1 rice bran extract. Conclusions: It can be concluded that barley straw can be used in biorefinery, wherein the hemicellulose fraction would be utilized to produce xylitol and the cellulosic fraction (more accessible to enzymatic hydrolysis after pre-treatment) would be used for the production of cellulosic ethanol.

AB  - Background: Nannochloropsis gaditana is a photosynthetic unicellular microalgae considered one of the most interesting marine algae to produce biofuels and food additive due to its rapid growth rate and high lipid accumulation. Although microalgae are attractive platforms for solar energy bioconversion, the overall efficiency of photosynthesis is reduced due to the steep light gradient in photobioreactors. Moreover, accumulation of lipids in microalgae for biofuels production is usually induced in a two-phase cultivation process by nutrient starvation, with additional time and costs associated. In this work, a biotechnological approach was directed for the isolation of strains with improved light penetration in photobioreactor combined with increased lipids productivity. Results: Mutants of Nannochloropsis gaditana were obtained by chemical mutagenesis and screened for having both a reduced chlorophyll content per cell and increased affinity for Nile red, a fluorescent dye which binds to cellular lipid fraction. Accordingly, one mutant, called e8, was selected and characterized for having a 30% reduction of chlorophyll content per cell and an almost 80% increase of lipid productivity compared to WT in nutrient-replete conditions, with C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids being more than doubled in the mutant. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in 234 genes in e8 mutant among which there is a non-conservative mutation in the dgd1 synthase gene. This gene encodes for an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of DGDG, one of the major lipids found in the thylakoid membrane and it is thus involved in chloroplast biogenesis. Lipid biosynthesis is strongly influenced by light availability in several microalgae species, including Nannochloropsis gaditana: reduced chlorophyll content per cell and more homogenous irradiance in photobioreactor is at the base for the increased lipid productivity observed in the e8 mutant. Conclusions: The results herein obtained presents a promising strategy to produce algal biomass enriched in lipid fraction to be used for biofuel and biodiesel production in a single cultivation process, without the additional complexity of the nutrient starvation phase. Genome sequencing and identification of the mutations introduced in e8 mutant suggest possible genes responsible for the observed phenotypes, identifying putative target for future complementation and biotechnological application. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Herein, we developed an efficient anode catalyst for alcohol biofuel cell by integrating multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into an isoreticular metal organic framework derived porous carbon. The derived porous carbon (PC) intercalated by MWCNTs (PC/MWCNTs) serviced as the anode component in catalyzing the electrooxidation of reduced β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), enabling catalysis to ethanol electrooxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase with NAD+ as both free coenzyme and electron transfer mediators (onset potential, 0.14 V vs. SCE, pH 8.0). Hierarchy of PC/MWCNTs with micro-, meso-, and macropores provides improved immobilization of electroactive enzymes, aids the facile transportations of electrolyte and increases the conductivity and specific surface areas of anode and results in a much higher catalytic current density for NADH (1.17 mA cm−2 for 10 mM NADH, pH 9.0) and alcohol bioanode (maximum steady-state current density, 0.25 ± 0.03 mA cm−2, pH 8.0) than its singular component analogues (PC and MWCNTs). The high Michaelis-Menten constant (166 ± 16.8 mM) favorites the detection of ethanol at high concentrations. The linear range of ethanol is 10–300 mM, with the sensitivity and detection limit as 24 nA mM−1 and 3 mM. The study applies porous carbon nanomaterials as both electrocatalysts for coenzyme and scaffolds for enzymes, benefiting to feasible constructions of bioelectrodes with notable current densities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New surfactant-free microemulsion biofuels are synthesized and characterized in this work. Moringa and safflower plants have been used for providing the required oils because of their excellent resistance in dry and harsh environmental conditions. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, oleic acid, 1,4-dioxane, and dibutyl ether have been used as biofuel additives. The obtained phase behavior results show that the microemulsion region of ternary phase diagrams in these systems decreases as follows: oleic acid > 1-octanol > 1-heptanol > MTBE > dibutyl ether >1,4-dioxane. The nanostructures formed in these types of ternary mixtures are investigated by conductivity, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. Three different micro regions, including ethanol in oil (E/O), bicontinuous (B.C.), and oil in ethanol (O/E), have been recognized using electrical conductivity experiments along ethanol dilution lines. According to the presented results, the E/O region regarding the studied microemulsions is wider than the B.C. and O/E regions. Thus, the proposed formulation according to the reverse micelle microemulsion formation can be considered as a useful approach for biofuel production. It is also shown that the kinematic viscosities and densities of the formulated biofuels in this article satisfy the approved biofuel standards. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Efficient synthesis of promising biofuel 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) directly from starch was developed over a mixed-acid system composed of Al2(SO4)3 and H3PO4 in ethanol−DMSO co-solvent medium. The reaction proceeds through the depolymerization of starch to form glucose over Brønsted acidic H3PO4, which is then isomerized to fructose by Al2(SO4)3, a Lewis acid catalyst. The mixed-acid system then synergistically catalyzes the formation of EMF. At 170 °C, 36.9%, 39.8%, and 34.7% yields of EMF can be captured from corn starch, amylose and amylopectin, respectively. Moreover, the conversion of cellobiose and wood pulp cellulose produces 38.5% and 9.5% yields of EMF. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to overcome the depletion of energy resources, the production of fuel from a renewable source (green fuel) has aroused attention. The present work serves as a comparative study for green fuel production by utilizing monometallic Ni and bimetallic NiMo loaded on amine-functionalized mesoporous silica (MS). Two types of catalysts, denoted as Ni/NH2-MS and NiMo/NH2-MS, were prepared and evaluated for its catalytic activity in the hydrotreatment of waste coconut oil (WCO) at 450 °C under the flow of H2 gas (20 mL.min-1). Each catalysts were characterized by using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR). Study of selectivity by GC-MS showed that gasoline-range hydrocarbon, especially n-undecane, was the major compound in the liquid products generated by the two amine-functionalized catalysts prepared in this study. The result showed that monometallic Ni/NH2-MS with surface area, total pore volume, nickel loading and average pore diameter 328.68 m2.g-1, 0.25 cm3.g-1, 1.90 wt%, 3.10 nm, respectively, exhibited the best performance in producing liquid hydrocarbon and generated higher level of liquid product (77.9 wt%) than bimetallic NiMo/NH2-MS (76.3 wt%). However, it is highlighted that adding 1.08 wt% of Mo in bimetallic NiMo/NH2-MS comprising 0.83 wt% of Ni improved the catalyst selectivity towards producing higher level of gasoline-range hydrocarbon (43 wt%). The bimetallic NiMo/NH2-MS prepared was found to have surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter of 325.13 m2.g-1, 0.14 cm3.g-1, 3.22 nm, respectively. Copyright © 2020 BCREC Group.

AB  - The present study investigated honne oil methyl esters (HOME) production from crude honne seed oil (HSO) using a novel catalyst synthesized from a blend of cocoa pod husk and plantain peel. A two-step esterification-transesterification method was used for the HOME production. For the esterification, the crude HSO was pretreated with H2SO4 to reduce its very high acid value to an acceptable level prior to transesterification to biodiesel. Characterization of the calcined cocoa pod husk-plantain peel ash (CCPA) showed that K (50.95%), Mg (2.49%) and Ca (2.30%) were the major metals present, thereby confirming its heterogeneity. Physisorption isotherms obtained for the CCPA indicate it is composed of nanoparticles that are mesoporous in nature. The initial high acid value of the oil (35.5 g KOH/g oil) was reduced to 1.68 ± 0.57 g KOH/g oil via esterification at a temperature of 65 °C, MeOH:HSO molar ratio of 50:1 and H2SO4 of 2 vol% after 2.5 h. The best operating condition that gave maximum HOME yield (98.98 ± 0.04 wt%) was CCPA amount of 4.5 wt%, reaction temperature of 65 °C, time of 2.5 h and MeOH:pretreated HSO molar ratio of 15:1. The HOME produced satisfied standard limits set for biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chemical and physical analysis was performed to identify the molten slag composition and its ability to be used as alternative catalyst in pyrolysis of waste cooking oil. The implementation such type of cata-lytic material could be useful in reducing the process cost. To increase the efficiency (increase the ac-tive site) of molten slag, it was modified by acid washing that resulted in an increase in the acidity from 159 to 1224 μmol/g. The results showed that the yield of bio-fuel was increased and the product selective to n-C15 upon the modification of molten slag by acid treatment. Copyright © 2020 BCREC Group.

AB  - Cookstove researchers are paying more attention to the improvement in the combustion performance of a biomass cookstove, which requires an understanding of the effects of different parameters on pollutant emissions. Five such important parameters were identified namely, Inlet area ratio, Primary air ratio, Pot gap, Fuel surface to volume ratio and Pot diameter. The work presented here comprises estimating the effects of these five parameters on the energy and emissions performance of natural draft biomass cookstove. A prototype stove was tested to quantify the effects of these parameters on chosen performance parameters like overall efficiency, CO and PM2.5 emissions per MJ of energy delivered to the pot. The data obtained from a proper sequence of designed experiments were coupled with RSM (Response surface Methodology) technique to fit second-order models for predicting the performance of the stove under different conditions. The RSM models were then used with desirability function for robust parameter optimization of stove and confirmation trials were performed for validating the findings. The CCD (Central composite design) combined with RSM and the desirability function was found to be an effective tool for performance optimization of a natural draft biomass cookstove. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electro-selective fermentation (ESF) can improve lipid extraction from Scenedesmus acutus biomass using green solvents like hexane and 1:1 hexane: isopropanol, but accumulation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) wastes useable electrons. To eliminate the electron loss, we designed a flat-plate microbial electrolytic cell (MEC) to have a large anode area for a biofilm of anode respiring bacteria (ARB) that oxidize the SCFAs and generate current that produces H2 gas at the cathode. In 9-day batch tests of ESF in the flat-plate MEC, 18% of the total electrons in the feeding biomass were scavenged by the ARB biofilm and converted to current, leaving minimal concentrations of SCFAs. Extraction with two solvents — 1:1 hexane:isopropanol and 100% hexane – was evaluated at the end of the 9-day experiments. 30% of the total lipids became hexane-extractable with ESF, compared to &lt;1% in the feeding biomass. Furthermore, hexane had 100% selectivity towards saturated long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), which are superior for biofuel production. Thus, ESF improved the quantity and quality of extractable FAME-based biofuel from S. acutus, while directing electron equivalents in SCFAs to current and H2 generation at the cathode. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived phenols and dimeric ethers to biofuels has great significance for advanced utilization of renewable lignocelluloses and the future biobased economy. Herein, we find that the deoxygenation process during the lignin-derived model compound HDO process could efficiently be catalyzed by low-cost protic ionic liquids under mild conditions. 2-Hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methylethanaminium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([BHEM]CF3SO3) shows the highest catalytic activity for the deoxygenation reaction during the lignin-derived compound HDO process with Rh/C as the hydrogenation catalyst. The conversion of phenol is 100% under 4 MPa H2 at 130 C for 6 h, and the yield of cyclohexane is 93.3%. Furthermore, the catalytic system with [BHEM]CF3SO3 as the deoxygenation catalyst and Rh/C as the hydrogenation catalyst demonstrates efficient catalytic activity for various lignin-derived phenols and dimeric ethers with ≥99.0% conversion and &gt;90.0% selectivity. The catalytic system is reused five times for HDO of phenol to test its stability. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Herein, we present the C-14 levulinate ester of 2,3-butanediol as the product of sugar fermentation liquors. The designed Brønsted acidic ionic liquid (BAIL) catalysts enable self-induced phase separation with ester products, and the role of anions has been investigated. Esterification reactions were carried out by 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) and levulinic acid in solvent-free media and low temperatures (60-105 °C). For comparison, sulfuric acid, amberlite IR-120, and sulfonic acid-functionalized pyridinium ionic liquids with different anions were utilized as a catalyst upon esterification reaction. The diester product, namely, butane-2,3-diyl bis(4-oxopentanoate), was formed with a good yield (85%) and selectivity (85%) after complete conversion of 2,3-BDO in 24 h at 80 °C. The low yield (8%) of the monoester was observed. The monoester and diester were separated by a liquid-liquid extraction method. The ester products were characterized by various instrumental techniques such as 1H and 13C NMR, GC-FID, LC-MS, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The Hammett acidity functions of BAILs were determined from UV-vis spectroscopy. The catalyst was successfully recycled and reused in the processes. The spent BAILs were reused in six consecutive cycles with only a ∼7% diminished diester yield and selectivity. The produced levulinate ester will be useful as biofuel additives, solvents, plasticizers, and other applications. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to optimize the processing conditions (temperature, pressure, process time, yield rate) for the conversion of biomass to a high-energy density biofuel. The hydrothermal polymerization (HTP) catalytic process has been developed for production of biofuel via hydrothermal processing using an acid-based catalyst. This study has shown that the HTP catalytic process for a reference feedstock lowered the temperature by 10 to 40 °C, reduced the pressure requirement by 1 to 2 MPa, increased the rate of yield by 22%, and shortened the total processing time by up to 3 h when compared to the conventional hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process. FTIR spectrum analysis of the HTP catalytic biofuel has shown that lignin in the biomass is preserved, while the pure HTC process destroyed the lignin in the biomass. GC/MS analysis of the process liquid determined the changes of the intermediate soluble components as a function of time. By measuring the 2,5-hydroxymethyl furfuralde concentration in solution, an endpoint determination could be made. This study also determined the approximate analysis of the HTP biofuel from various organic wastes such as cotton, cow manure, wood waste, paper waste, sugarcane bagasse waste, and food waste. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Gasification of wheat straw, an agricultural residue with high ash content, was investigated in a low temperature circulating fluidized bed (LT-CFB) gasifier in combination with catalytic tar upgrading as a flexible process to co-produce high quality bio-oil, nutrient rich char, and utilize the producer gas for heat and power production. The change in product distribution and bio-oil quality was studied when conducting the catalytic treatment with HZSM-5/γ-Al2O3 and lower-cost γ-Al2O3. The fuel properties of the raw and upgraded bio-oils were analyzed by elemental composition, moisture, total acid number, size exclusion chromatography, basic nitrogen content, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry with flame ionization detection (GC–MS/FID), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR, and two-dimensional heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (2D HSQC) NMR. The operating temperature of the LT-CFB pyrolysis chamber determined the tar yield and quality in the producer gas. With decrease in pyrolysis temperature from 690 to 570 °C, the tar concentration in the producer gas increased, while the higher heating value of the condensed oil phase decreased from ~35 to 30 MJ/kg and the oxygen content, moisture content, and acidity of the bio-oil increased. Both HZSM-5/γ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 were effective catalysts as the tar treatment improved the bio-oil quality in terms of increased heating value and revaporization efficiency, and a reduction in oxygen content, moisture content, total acid number, and basic nitrogen content. Catalytic vapor treatment, e.g. using HZSM-5/γ-Al2O3 at 500 °C, decreased the energy content in the condensed bio-oil slightly from ~22% to ~20%. The oil quality improved significantly, as the oxygen content (water-free) and TAN of the bio-oil decreased from 13 wt% O and 34 mg KOH/g to 11 wt% O and 3 mg KOH/g, respectively. The catalytically treated bio-oils are thus better suited for further processing in existing oil refineries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An application of hydro-processed renewable diesel (HRD) intended to reduce non-regulated emissions, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), is proposed in this study, in association with the emissions from a turbo-charged common-rail direct-injection diesel engine under steady-state operation. Three types of fuel, pure petro-diesel, 20% HRD blended fuel (H20), and 20% biodiesel blended fuel (B20) were tested under various engine loads and engine speeds. According to the emissions analysis, in which the samples were collected and analyzed through the solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) technique adapted with a derivation method, a 20% addition of HRD reduced the emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and xylene, as compared to D100 and B20. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can be widely used to reduce the oxynitride (NOx) pollution in Low-Speed Two-Stroke Marine Diesel Engines. In this paper, two EGR systems (HP EGR1 and LP EGR2) were investigated in terms of the influence of different rates on the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and the NOx emissions. As for this simulation, the exhaust gas cleaning water treatment was not concluded. Besides, Miller Cycle was used to determine the influence of its valve timing on BSFC and NOx emissions. The combination of Miller Cycle and HP EGR system decreased the NOx emissions, which could meet the IMO3 Tier III standard, 3.4 g/kWh. Moreover, the influence of the EGR cooling temperature was discussed. Finally, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model was developed to evaluate the two EGR systems. The results showed that when the HP EGR system and the LP EGR system were all operating at a maximum EGR rate, LP EGR system showed more advantages. © 2019

AB  - Preparation of methyl palmitate, isopropyl palmitate, isobutyl palmitate, and isoamyl palmitate was carried out using pyridine n-butyl bisulfate ionic liquid as catalyst in a self-designed reactor to catalyze esterification reaction of palmitic acid with methanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol, respectively. According to the single-factor experimental results, an orthogonal test of four factors and three levels was carried out for branched-chain alkyl esters of palmitic acid under different reaction time, reaction temperature, and catalyst dosage. Verification test was conducted under the optimal conditions, and the conversion in all the cases was up to 97%. Analysis of the reaction kinetics of methyl palmitate, isopropyl palmitate, isobutyl palmitate, and isoamyl palmitate was carried out by the integral method. Reaction order, frequency factor, activation energy, and reaction kinetic model were determined. Compared to methyl palmitate, the kinematic viscosity of the branched-chain alkyl esters of palmitic acid was slightly higher; however, the solidifying point (SP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) decreased with increasing degree of branched-chain. The CFPP reduced by up to 15 °C. Therefore, the use of branched-chain alcohol instead of methanol ester exchange descaling method can effectively reduce the SP and CFPP of biodiesel to improve its cold flow properties. © 2019

AB  - Artificial intelligence approach can be used to solve complicated process problems. A hybrid methodology comprising artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithms (GA) was utilized to model and optimize the methanolysis process of waste peanut shells. Acid catalytic methanolysis of waste peanut shells into liquid biofuel-methyl levulinate (ML) was investigated. The combination of sulfuric acid with extremely low concentration and Al2(SO4)3 was identified as the efficient mixed acid catalytic system. The ML yield under optimal conditions optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) was 16.49%, while the ML yield optimized by ANN-GA was 17.61%. The results showed that ANN-GA had a higher optimizing ability than the RSM model. Meanwhile, the methanolysis kinetics provided insights into the reaction routes for ML production. Moreover, Al2(SO4)3 can be recycled and reused five times without much decrease of the ML yield. This study suggested that waste peanut shells can be used as potential raw materials for ML production and ANN-GA can serve as a powerful tool for biofuel processing technology. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - β-Glucosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of cellobiose to glucose, which is often the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cellulose into fermentable sugars during bioethanol production. Thus, the structure and function of β-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger were examined in response to a photoresponsive azobenzene-based surfactant (4-ethyl-4′(trimethylamino-butoxy)azobenzene bromide, azoTAB) as a means to enhance the enzyme activity. Light and neutron scattering data indicate that pure β-glucosidase exists as dimers or higher aggregates in solution that are progressively converted to monomers with an increasing azoTAB concentration. This transition is accompanied by a 60% increase in catalytic activity. In contrast, the enzyme is simply deactivated in the presence of conventional straight-chain hydrocarbon surfactants. Shape-reconstructed images obtained from SANS data demonstrate that azoTAB causes selective unfolding in the α/β sandwich domain that comprises the crystallographic dimer interface, consistent with the observed transition to monomers. Furthermore, this domain forms one side of a long cleft that begins at the active site and facilitates the nonproductive binding of substrate or longer oligosaccharides, which at times can block the active site. Indeed, kinetic data indicate that the azoTAB-induced increase in β-glucosidase activity is a result of diminished substrate inhibition, thus providing a unique means of obtaining glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases.

AB  - Ketonization is a promising way for upgrading bio-derived carboxylic acids from pyrolysis bio-oils, waste oils, and fats to produce high value-added chemicals and biofuels. Therefore, an understanding of its mechanism can help to carry out the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass more efficiently. Here we show that temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) together with linear free energy relationships (LFERs) can be used to identify catalytic pyrolysis mechanisms. We report the kinetics of the catalytic pyrolysis of deuterated acetic acid and a reaction series of linear and branched fatty acids into symmetric ketones on the surfaces of ceria-based oxides. A structure–reactivity correlation between Taft’s steric substituent constants Es* and activation energies of ketonization indicates that this reaction is the sterically controlled reaction. Surface D3-n-acetates transform into deuterated acetone isotopomers with different yield, rate, E≠, and deuterium kinetic isotope effect (DKIE). The obtained values of inverse DKIE together with the structure–reactivity correlation support a concerted mechanism over ceria-based catalysts. These results demonstrate that analysis of Taft’s correlations and using simple equation for estimation of DKIE from TPD-MS data are promising approaches for the study of catalytic pyrolysis mechanisms on a semi-quantitative level. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Ni–Mo–N precursor was synthesized via a complexation reaction using nickel acetate, ammonium molybdate and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as starting materials and then heat-treated at high temperature in hydrogen atmosphere to obtain the final catalyst. The effects of preparation conditions such as Ni/Mo molar ratio and treatment temperature on the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity were studied by taking acetophenone as a carboxide in bio-oil. 100% Conversion with a 99.1% selectivity of ethylbenzene was achieved after reaction at 150 °C for 1 h. The deoxygenation degree was further enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure. The high activity of Ni–Mo–N catalyst was attributed to the formation of Ni2Mo3N phase. During the reusability test, acetophenone conversion on Ni–Mo–N catalyst was almost unchanged, but the deoxygenation degree was slightly lowered with the increase of recycle number, which was mainly caused by the nitrogen loss. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Products from waste streams can reduce the amount of materials going to landfills or being incinerated. Brown grease captured from grease traps or wastewater facilities is produced at approximately 1,500,000 metric tons annually in the United States. Two brown grease samples were characterized from a local collector. Raw brown grease was fermented using Clostridium butyricum to produce butyric acid, achieving a yield of 0.55 butyric acid/g sugars indicating that glycerol and lactic acid were also converted. Hexane extraction of the fermentation broth gave an 81.3% recovery of lipids. Techno-economic analysis calculated a minimum fuel selling price of $1.81 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE) for a facility based on a city the size of Denver and a brown grease delivery price of $100 per dry metric ton. Exploiting waste streams as feedstocks can significantly reduce costs to produce fuels and can be brought to scale more rapidly due to their ready availability. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Citrus wax is a waste generated during the purification process of the citrus essential oil. A lot of citrus wax wastes are globally produced, despite this, its composition and properties are not well known. Here we present comprehensive results proving the chemical composition and the physical properties of citrus wax. Additionally, our study provides the basis for obtaining value-added products from citrus wax wastes. The qualitative/quantitative analysis revealed the presence of different compounds, which range from flavonoids, saponins, carbohydrates, unsaturated compounds, phenolic hydroxyls, and long-chain fatty acid esters. Given that citrus wax is a source of many bioactive compounds, they were preferably extracted with ethanol. The ethanolic extracts demonstrated the presence in citrus wax of different bioactives, such as 5–5′-dehydrodiferulic acid, 3,7-dimethylquercetin, 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, tangeretin, and limonene. After the extraction of bioactives from citrus wax, a washed waxy material with high content of long-chain fatty acid esters was obtained. It was shown that this washed wax can be used for the production of biodiesel. The transesterification reactions in acid media was the preferred process because higher content of fatty acid methyl esters (such as hexadecanoic acid methyl ester and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-, methyl ester) were obtained. Currently, citrus wax does not have any industrial application, here we shown that under the concept of waste biorefinery, the citrus wax wastes are useful sources for producing value-added products such as bioactive compounds and biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oil-laden biofuel intermediate (BI) from flash-hydrolyzed microalgae was characterized, pyrolyzed, and subjected to catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) to produce both gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The BI was characterized by TGA and FTIR that revealed significant triglyceride, evidenced by C[dbnd]O bond with insignificant level of carbohydrates and proteins. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the BI could be thermally decomposed at 400 °C. Pyrolysis of the BI engendered mainly gaseous hydrocarbon (alkenes) with high heating value (HHV) of 48.5 kJ/mol at 850 °C. Energy of activation for the pyrolytic process was estimated to be 115–300 kJ/mol. Optimization of oil extraction from the BI was performed via design of experiment. The oil was subjected to CTH over NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor in a 30-ml batch reactor at a temperature range of 390–420 °C and autogenic pressure of 24–27 bar, leading to fatty acid conversion of 99–100%. The main liquid products obtained from the CTH were iso-alkanes (41%), cyclo-alkanes (35%), aromatics (5%), n-alkanes (14%), and alkenes (5%). Kinetics of the CTH showed first order with activation energy of 176 kJ/mol. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunaeur-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption and desorption, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and TGA. The catalyst revealed cubic structure, which was maintained after 5 h of CTH reaction. Present in both the fresh and the used catalysts were oxides of alkali and transition metals. The active sites of the catalyst were dominated by Co3+, Ni2+, and Mo6+. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The focus of this work is physico-chemical study of model mixtures containing butanol – a component of perspective biofuel. New detailed data on liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE), solubility and critical compositions were obtained at 293.15 K and atmospheric pressure for quaternary propionic acid – n-butanol – n-butyl propionate – water system. Research methods: gas chromatography, “cloud-point technique”. A brief review of the available data on the mutual solubility and LLE in this system is presented. The regularities of phase diagrams evolution with temperature changes are discussed. The compositions of critical phases were determined at 293.15 and 303.15 K. These data gave opportunity for the construction of polythermal critical surface in a 3D composition space. Correlation of LLE results with the use of NRTL indicates sufficient agreement with the calculated data. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The high acid value of pyrolysis oil obtained from biologic oil is the main drawback that not only affects the properties of pyrolysis oil, but also leads to the corrosion of equipment. Herein, pyrolysis oil obtained from rubber seed oil was upgraded via esterification using ZrO2/SBA-15 as a solid acid catalyst. Using ZrO2/SBA-15 as a catalyst, the acid value of the esterified pyrolysis oil obtained from rubber seed oil was only 1.2 mg KOH•g−1. The density and kinematic viscosity both reached the standard range of 0# diesel oil. The excellent catalytic activity of ZrO2/SBA-15 was studied using NH3-TPD and Py-IR. Furthermore, the conversion reached 96.7% when the ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst was re-used three times, which shows the ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst possessed excellent catalytic activity and stability for upgrading pyrolysis oil via esterification. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electrochemical valorization of non-food biomass-derived carboxylates into fuels is promising for the conversion, storage, and distribution of renewable electricity. Herein, we demonstrate that biofuels, hydrogen, and bicarbonate can be simultaneously produced in an electrochemical cell by one-step electrolysis of free fatty acids under ambient conditions on 3D self-supported ultralow Pt loading (2 wt %) electrode. The three valuable products can naturally separate from each other during the electrolysis in the alkaline aqueous solution. The experimental suggests that Pt(100) and Pt(110) are favorable for the production of non-Kolbe and Kolbe hydrocarbons, respectively. DFT calculation further clarifies the adsorption and stabilization of the reaction intermediates on Pt(100) and Pt(110). © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Lipases from various origins such as fungi and bacteria have been largely explored for various applications including biofuel production. Keeping the environmental and health concerns into consideration, we employed lipases derived from probiotic sources like L. plantarum and L. brevis for biodiesel production from the gold standard fresh and used olive oil. These lipases have been used to optimize various parameters such as molar ratio of methanol to oil, enzyme loading, reaction temperature, and stirring rate that determine the biodiesel yield. The lipases have been explored in their native and immobilized forms in order to obtain maximum biodiesel conversion. Among the two sources of enzymes, lipase derived from L. plantarum is found to be more efficient in biodiesel production. With the optimal reaction conditions, the maximum biodiesel production using immobilized lipase from L. plantarum with fresh and used olive oil is found to be 81% and 67%, respectively. The biodiesel thus obtained has also been studied for its suitability to be used as a fuel in diesel engine that could meet the viscosity and density limits set by ASTM D 6751. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Developing highly efficient biocatalyst is a pertinent requirement for biofuels production, in particularly biodiesel/bioethanol. To circumvent the minimal efficiency of conventionally used biocatalysts, nanotechnology paves a way by indulging nanoparticles as carriers of biocatalysts. The nanobiocatalysts so formed are applied as a tool for utilizing wide set of biomass related molecules into biofuels. The disadvantages of conventional biocatalysts such as catalyst deactivation, mass transfer, poisoning, and long reaction time can be outstripped by novel nanobiocatalysts. Nanobiocatalyst increases the catalytic activity; and this higher activity is because of the increased surface to volume ratio and hence it can act as a deoxygenation catalyst too. In recent years, exploiting modern tools for nanoparticles synthesis and characterization yielded high quality optimized and conditioned nanocatalyst systems such as metal oxide nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes to increase the biofuel productivity. Nanomaterial immobilized lipases and cellulases are predictably innovative catalysts having remarkable properties. The present article is critically discussed various nanomaterial immobilized enzyme development and its influence over production of biofuel. Continuous research and development and novel nanobiocatalyst engineering is essential for stabilization of biofuel producing companies. © 2020

AB  - Carrot (Daucus carota L.) is among the richest source of carotenoids with the highest concentration of β-carotene and a source of vitamin K, fiber, and minerals. β-carotene, also known as a Vitamin A precursor, is a proven anticarcinogen reported for its activity against life-threatening diseases. Of the total production, about 20–30% is separated during primary processing as carrot rejects and waste (CRW). CRW comprised out-graded carrots (separated due to their uniqueness in shape, size, color, or mechanical injury) and processed discards (crowns and tips generated during grading). These are partially utilized towards animal feed and the remaining ends up in landfills. It is estimated that 90,000 lbs of CRW in the landfills released 6988.38 kg of methane, equivalent to 174,709.5 kg of carbon dioxide, causing a detrimental effect on the environment. To reduce the carbon footprint, the study was planned to evaluate the properties (physical, mechanical, carotenoid content, proximate composition, ultimate analysis, high heating value (HHV)) of CRW for its potential utilization in bioenergy and food product development. It was observed that the presence of low carbon (38.55–40.10%), high moisture (86.93–89.35%), and high oxygen (44.66–46.95%) content resulted in low HHV (15.19–15.64 MJ/kg). Hydrothermal liquefaction could be a promising approach to valorize CRW into biofuel. The availability of β-carotene (80–87 μg/g) in CRW samples indicated prospective application in the field of food and nutraceuticals. This study provides a direction for future utilization of CRW, boosting economic gain to processors and producers while reducing the carbon footprint. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The development of biofuels from oleaginous biomass has attracted a great deal of interest not only because of the environment pollution but also because of the rapid depletion of the fossil fuel reserves. Among the biomass conversion processes, the solvolysis reaction has shown to be an interesting solution which allows the direct conversion of raw materials into biofuel. In the present work, a solvolysis process is applied on Pistacia lentiscus (PL) seeds using ethanol as solvent for bio-oil production. Several temperatures varying from 270 to 330 °C, reaction time in the range 15–45 min and ethanol:PL seed ratio values from 0.5–1.5 ml/g were considered. The response surface methodology (RSM) combined with Box-Behnken design (BBD) is used for modeling and optimizing both the process yield and bio-oil viscosity. The results show that the optimum conditions are obtained for a reaction temperature of 304.91 °C, a reaction time of 35.24 min, and an ethanol:PL seed ratio of 1.16. Under these conditions, the predicted PL bio-oil yield is around 63.5% with a bio-oil viscosity of 5.88 mm2/s. The PL bio-oil physicochemical properties showed a good agreement with those of diesel fuel and in conformity with the international requirements except for the viscosity, whose value was found to be slightly higher than the standard. The engine tests show that the fuel specific consumption increases around 9% with a mixture containing bio-oil up to 30%. On the other hand, slight increases in CO (13%), HC (25%) and particulate (30%) emissions were recorded. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Catalytic application of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for the production of high-value chemicals from the lignocellulosic biomass is investigated for the first time. In particular, the synthesis of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from biomass-derived resources in the presence of inexpensive and readily available MoS2 catalyst via microwave-assisted heating has been studied. The experiments were performed at 100 to 160 °C temperature for 2 to 30 min reaction time in a microwave reactor. Accordingly, the experimental conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst concentration, and feed concentration were optimized for the maximum yield of EMF from the fructose. As a result, maximum 93.3 mol% EMF yield was measured at 160 °C reaction temperature in 30 min when experiments were performed in the presence of 0.3 mmol MoS2 for fructose conversion. It was also observed that the molybdenum disulfide selectively produces EMF in a higher amount with negligible byproducts under optimum operating conditions. Post this, a range of alcohols such as methanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and 1-pentanol were tested for the production of different alkoxymethylfurfurals, which showed more than 95% fructose conversion in all cases. Similarly, a wide range of substrates such as glucose, galactose, mannose, and cellulose were tested, which resulted in significant production of EMF. Notably, the EMFs obtained from the experiments can be used as a precursor to producing a vast range of chemicals like polymers, fragrance, plasticizer, resins, fuel additives, and fuel. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Interest in biofuels is growing, and ethanol has been the most used biofuel as an additive and as a gasoline substitute and, it is considered a potential alternative to traditional fuels. Ethanol represents 17% of energy consumption in transportation in Brazil, the transport sector's share in the energy matrix is 32.4%, which is the second most energy-consuming sector. The production of first and second-generation ethanol in the same industrial plant presents better financial results compared to the isolated processes. Also, ethanol obtained from the sugarcane has renewability, biodegradability and provides CO2 emissions mitigation. The objective of the work is to perform an analysis of the ethanol with several levels of hydration in terms of energetic, economic, environmental and safety. The results showed that each 10% of water in ethanol dilution the temperature in the flame surround decreases by 4%. Besides, the ethanol with 20% of water dilution emits 20% less radiation compared to 10% of water dilution. Indeed, the energy consumed in the distillation to produce ethanol with 10% of water is double. On the other hand, this energy difference in the production of ethanol diluted with 30% of water is not enough to compensate for the losses in the energy use process. Also, large amounts of water in ethanol dilution might be unfeasible the use due to the total cost of transportation. Therefore, ethanol with 20% of water represents the more efficient, cleaner and safe fuel in free flame applications. © 2020 Tche Quimica Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a total of six fungal samples were isolated from apple, strawberry and orange pulp. DNA sequence analysis was used as molecular identification method. ITS region was aligned in DNA sequence analysis, and an algorithm sequence similarity was done using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program to identify these isolates. All the six isolates were identified as Aspergillus fumigates. The total lipid content was varied in the isolates which were ranged from 29.4 to 21.0 mg/100 ml. Moreover, the obtained lipid form mycelium biomass of the isolates was transesterified by a base catalyst. The methyl esters were analyzed by using GC-MS. GC-MS Spectrometry revealed the presence of different fatty acids with long chain (C11:0, C15:0, C17:1, C18:2, C16:1). High efficiency biodiesel can be obtained using long-chain fatty acids. Fatty acid profiles of A. fumigatus isolated from different fruit pulps have confirmed its potentiality as well as showed the beneficial utilization of these fatty acids for biodiesel production. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The current work aims to investigate the compatibility of n-Amyl alcohol in a mini-truck common rail direct injection (CRDI) compression ignition (CI) engine with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) as a DeNOx technique. The n-Amyl alcohol is a renewable biofuel it effectively mitigates the demand for fossil fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emission. Palladium and Rhodium coated SCR catalyst was used to reduce the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission. For SCR of NOx ammonia was used as a reductant. From the experimental results, it was noted that with an increase in the percentage of alcohol in the blends, a slight drop in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and higher brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) was observed. Both NOx and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions could be reduced with the use of n-Amyl alcohol and a combination of SCR and EGR techniques. The maximum reduction of NOx can be successfully achieved with the use of 40N60D (40% n-Amyl alcohol &amp; 60% Diesel v/v) blend with SCR and 20% EGR at the slight cost of BTE. The engine can be successfully worked up to 40% of n-Amyl alcohol/diesel blends without causing any visible damage to the engine, with less NOx emissions. It is concluded that n-Amyl alcohol will be a sustainable next-generation biofuel for commercial vehicles. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper deals with the hydroprocessing of Fish Oil (FO) as a source to produce biofuel. The hydrotreating experiments were performed at 380°C and 50bar pressure over the CoMo/Al2O3 and CoMoRe/Al2O3 catalysts. Through hydrogenation of double bonds and carboxyl groups of Fatty Acids (FAs), accompanied by secondary hydrocracking and isomerization reactions, there results a mixture of normal &amp; isoparaffin with 13-22 carbon atoms per molecule with physicochemical characteristics similar to diesel fuel. The hydrotreatment of Straight Run Gas Oil (SRGO) mixed with 5% and 10% (FO) was also studied. The research focuses on the influence of the SRGO-FO ratio and of the catalyst type on the yields and the physiochemical properties of the obtained biofuel. The results show that the hydrotreatment of FO and of SRGO-FO mixtures is an alternative for biofuel production with characteristics similar to diesel fuel. © 2020 SYSCOM 18 S.R.L..

AB  - The objective of this study is to upgrade the pyrolysis oil obtained from coconut shells via thermal deoxygenation and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and compare the elemental properties of the upgraded bio-oil samples. The crude coconut shell pyrolysis oil (cr-CSPO) was obtained in 33% yield by intermediate pyrolysis (575°C) of pre-dried coconut shells. The higher heating value (HHV) of cr-CSPO was found to be 16.46 MJ/Kg. The thermal and catalytic upgrading was done at 250°C, 30 bar of hydrogen pressure, a reaction time of 3 h, and a stirring speed of 350 rpm. In the case of catalytic upgrading, 10% Pd/C (10 wt% of cr-CSPO) was used as the catalyst. Thermally heating the cr-CSPO under identical conditions without the catalyst provided oil of HHV 25.94 MJ/kg. Catalytic HDO of the cr-PCSO showed a noticeable increase in the HHV value to 30.57 MJ/kg. The results indicate significant improvement in the combustion properties of cr-CSPO by thermal treatment and more so by the catalytic HDO chemistry. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - One of the bottlenecks to commercialize microalgae-based biofuel production is harvesting of microalgae biomass from high dilute culture broth. Meanwhile, flocculation is identified as a low cost and promising technique to address this challenge. In this study, the flocculating potential of agricultural waste derived bio-based alkali from plantain peel ash was evaluated. The plantain peel ash and the produced bio-based alkali were characterized using inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Results showed that more than 90% harvesting efficiency of microalgae biomass were obtained for both Nannochloropsis oculata and Dunaliella salina at 1, 2 and 3% v/v flocculant (bio-based alkali) dose, while the maximum biomass concentration factors were 20 and 14 at 1% v/v flocculant dose for N. oculata and D. salina respectively. The positive effect of calcium ion concentration on alkaline flocculation of freshwater microalgae species Neochloris conjuncta was demonstrated. Also, the characterization of the produced bio-based alkali indicates that the concentration of K+ (61,630 ppm) is highest, followed by Ca2+ (1,569 ppm) and Na+ (582 ppm), which clearly support the alkaline nature of the flocculant. The chromatogram obtained from SEM-EDS of the ash also corroborates the highest proportion of potassium in the ash sample. This study shows that the plantain peel-derived alkali can be used to effectively and efficiently harvest microalgae biomass from very dilute microalgae culture media. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is a promising compound in the production of biofuel with high-quality properties. In this study, it is aimed to develop new efficient catalysts to synthesize DMF from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Co, Mn/Co, and Ru/Co catalysts were prepared using the NaBH4 reduction method. The catalysts were subjected to activity tests for the hydrogenation of HMF to DMF by changing the reaction parameters, such as temperature and time. Mn/Co catalysts prepared from metal precursors at various molar ratios of Mn/Co were found to be effective in hydrogenation reactions of HMF to DMF. A 91.8% DMF yield was achieved in the presence of a Mn/Co (50/50) catalyst without noble metal at 180°C for 4 hours. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method, x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and induction coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) techniques were used to characterize the efficient Mn/Co catalyst. © 2019 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering

AB  - Phosphine-free pincer-ruthenium carbonyl complexes based on bis(imino)pyridine and 2,6-bis(benzimidazole-2-yl) pyridine ligands have been synthesized. For the β-alkylation of 1-phenyl ethanol with benzyl alcohol at 140 °C under solvent-free conditions, (Cy2NNN)RuCl2(CO) (0.00025 mol%) in combination with NaOH (2.5 mol%) was highly efficient (ca. 93% yield, 372 000 TON at 12 000 TO h-1). These are the highest reported values hitherto for a ruthenium based catalyst. The β-alkylation of various alcohol combinations was accomplished with ease which culminated to give 380 000 TON at 19 000 TO h-1 for the β-alkylation of 1-phenyl ethanol with 3-methoxy benzyl alcohol. DFT studies were complementary to mechanistic studies and indicate the β-hydride elimination step involving the extrusion of acetophenone to be the overall RDS. While the hydrogenation step is favored for the formation of α-alkylated ketone, the alcoholysis step is preferred for the formation of β-alkylated alcohol. The studies were extended for the upgradation of ethanol to biofuels. Among the pincer-ruthenium complexes based on bis(imino)pyridine, (Cy2NNN)RuCl2(CO) provided high productivity (335 TON at 170 TO h-1). Sterically more open pincer-ruthenium complexes such as (Bim2NNN)RuCl2(CO) based on the 2,6-bis(benzimidazole-2-yl) pyridine ligand demonstrated better reactivity and gave not only good ethanol conversion (ca. 58%) but also high turnovers (ca. 2100) with a good rate (ca. 710 TO h-1). Kinetic studies indicate first order dependence on concentration of both the catalyst and ethanol. Phosphine-free catalytic systems operating with unprecedented activity at a very low base loading to couple lower alcohols to higher alcohols of fuel and pharmaceutical importance are the salient features of this report.

AB  - The present examination explores the impact of utilizing palm biodiesel and decanol blends as a ternary blends in compression ignition engine. Artificial Neural network (ANN) and Response surface methodology (RSM) model is developed to predict and optimize decanol proportion in ternary blends. Test engine was operated with decanol mixing of 10%, 20%, and 30% by volume while the diesel percentage was kept 50% in all the samples at different load conditions. With the support of obtained data, regression equation for all the responses are generated based on RSM model with R2 &gt; 0.95. Further to improve the regression model, feed-forward back propagation ANN model is developed to replica the output of brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbon, smoke opacity and ignition delay period, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and exhaust gas temperature and MFB@90%. Based on the results, ANN predicts all the responses with R &gt; 0.99 and the maximum mean absolute average error is 1.879%. The RSM based optimization study prescribes 30% decanol, biodiesel 20% and diesel 50% sufficiently improve performance and decrease emission parameters. Even, the confirmation study with desirability level of 75.4% was carried at 3 trials for the purpose of authentication, maximum error of 5.27% and minimum of 1.33% error was observed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alka(e)nes are ideal fuel components for aviation, long-distance transport, and shipping. They are typically derived from fossil fuels and accounting for 24% of difficult-to-eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. The synthesis of alka(e)nes in Yarrowia lipolytica from CO2-neutral feedstocks represents an attractive alternative. Here we report that the high-titer synthesis of alka(e)nes in Yarrowia lipolytica harboring a fatty acid photodecarboxylase (CvFAP) is enabled by a discovered pathway. We find that acyl-CoAs, rather than free fatty acids (FFAs), are the preferred substrate for CvFAP. This finding allows us to debottleneck the pathway and optimize fermentation conditions so that we are able to redirect 89% of acyl-CoAs from the synthesis of neutral lipids to alka(e)nes and reach titers of 1.47 g/L from glucose. Two other CO2-derived substrates, wheat straw and acetate, are also demonstrated to be effective in producing alka(e)nes. Overall, our technology could advance net-zero emissions by providing CO2-neutral and energy-dense liquid biofuels. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel is the most widely accepted complement fuel for diesel engines due to its characteristic properties, environmental and strategic advantages. In recent years, the high cost of biodiesel and the competition with food has been reduced by using non-edible feedstocks. However, if further cost reduction is to be achieved, new methods of production should be adopted. In this study, an attempt has been made on the cost reduction by producing biodiesels from non-edible oils (hemp seed oil and tobacco seed oil) in the laboratory using a domestic blender. Parametric studies were conducted to determine the optimal conditions such as KOH dosage (0.5–1.5 wt%), reaction duration (50–100 min) and methanol to oil molar ratio (4.0–8.0) for low fatty acid hemp seed oil methyl ester (HSOME) and tobacco seed oil methyl ester (TSOME) production and to establish density and viscosity correlation for the HSOME and TSOME with diesel blends. Regression models were adopted in predicting the basic properties of HSOME and TSOME, and their blends with diesel fuel. Optimum conditions of 0.9 wt% of KOH and 1.1 wt% of KOH and reaction time of 70 and 80 min were obtained with more than 95% conversion for both HSOME and TSOME with methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1. The cost estimation for HSOME and TSOME was conducted and the commercial value detected as ($1.35 per litre) and TSOME ($1.36 per litre). The respective energy efficiencies for HSOME and TSOME were 0.044 × 10−3 g/J and 0.0396 × 10−3 g/J. The fuel properties correlated with a high regression coefficient with biodiesel fraction and were similar to those found in literature and complied with both ASTM D6751 and EN 1421 standards. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metal oxide modified nickel catalysts are highly desirable for the conversion of biomass-derived compounds to biofuels and valuable chemicals because of their low-cost and unique synergistic effects in catalytic reaction. Herein, a series of metal oxide modified nickel catalysts were scrutinized in the hydrodeoxygenation of steatic acid to diesel-range alkanes without any carbon loss as a model reaction. The results showed that MoOx modified Ni/SiO2 catalyst was the most active and selective for the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid under mild reaction conditions (260 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 partial pressure). The catalyst with an Ni/Mo molar ratio of 1, and that was reduced at an optimized temperature (500 °C), exhibited the best performance; this catalyst achieved a high selectivity (&gt;95%) to diesel-range alkanes at 100% stearic acid conversion. A high selectivity (&gt;60%) to C18 alkane and a less than 30% selectivity to C17 alkane were observed at 260 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 partial pressure. By selecting an appropriate support, the selectivity to C18 alkane can reach 95% at 100% stearic acid conversion over Ni–Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. In contrast to Ni/SiO2, Ni–Mo/SiO2 was more efficient for C[dbnd]O hydrogenation and less active for C–C bond cleavage, which afforded a higher selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons without any carbon loss. Detailed characterization, control experiments, and kinetic studies indicate that the high activity and selectivity to the C18 alkane arises from a synergy between Ni and MoOx. The Ni sites at the interface between the Ni metal and MoOx species play a role in the generation of hydride (Hδ−) species from H2 dissociation, and MoOx plays a role in promotion of fatty acids adsorption through adsorbing carboxylic groups at the oxygen vacancy of MoOx. The deep understanding of such synergic catalysis will provide significant clues for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts towards the production of diesel-range alkanes without any carbon loss from the hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids/esters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study provided a comparison of two species of microalgae growth in dairy wastewater treatment plant effluents. In optimum conditions their operation to biomass production, lipid accumulation and fatty acids methyl ester composition so as to biodiesel production is studied. For the first time, the not sterilized effluents of dairy wastewater treatment plant was used as the culture mediums of native microalgae, Chlorella sorokiniana strain pa.91, and another one Chlorella vulgaris. They were cultured under 5 light intensity levels so as to find optimum conditions to observed high biomass and lipid production. At the optimum light intensity the composition of fatty acids methyl ester in their lipids was analyzed by GC-MS. The light intensity of 7500 Lux was obtained as the optimum for both microalgae to produce high biomass. The biomass productivity of C. sorokiniana pa.91 and C. vulgaris in preliminary treated effluent at this light intensity was obtained 0.233 and 0.214 g L−1 day−1, respectively. This parameter in secondary treated effluent was achieved 0.185 and 0.166 g L−1 day−1, respectively. Moreover, the highest lipid content of their biomass was observed at the light intensity of 2500 Lux. At this light intensity and at the preliminary effluent the maximum lipid content of C. sorokiniana pa.91 and C. vulgaris was observed 31% and 34%, respectively and at the secondary one it was obtained 35% and 36.67%, respectively. Based on the results, the fatty acids composition in the lipids of microalgae C. sorokiniana pa.91 and C. vulgaris cultured in both effluents had the high amount of cetane number which is really useful for high quality biodiesel production. Also, the other valuable properties which produce the high quality biodiesel were the obtained amounts of CFPP and CP which shown a high performance potential biodiesel even at low temperatures. This feature was obtained, on the grounds that the unsaturated fatty acid was obtained more than saturated fatty acid. The nutrients-rich media of dairy wastewater effluents were applicable to growth both microalgae and useful biomass production, lipid accumulation and fatty acids profiling. Furthermore, the compounds of fatty acids had the best conditions to biodiesel production especially in cold weather areas. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this study, red mud (RM), a highly alkaline waste generated from alumina production industries, was used as a catalytic material for both fast copyrolysis of organosolv lignin (OL) and polypropylene (PP) and toluene removal under ozone at room temperature. The RM was pretreated with HCl to investigate the effect of alkalinity. In the catalytic fast copyrolysis of the OL and PP, the acid-treated RM (HRM) produced more aromatics, phenolics, and light olefins (C3 to C5) but less oxygenates and heavy olefins (C6 to C46) than the RM. The difference in pyrolytic performance between the RM and HRM was likely attributed to the concentrated Fe2O3 species in the HRM catalyst. In addition, more efficient toluene removal was observed over MnOx/HRM than over MnOx/RM owing to the large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, high amounts of Al and Fe, and optimal Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio. This study demonstrates that the RM, an industrial waste, can be reused as an effective catalytic material for not only biofuel production but also pollutant removal. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Microbial electrosynthesis is a biocathode-driven device for chemicals production from carbon dioxide reduction and has been a promising carbon-consuming technology to alleviate the greenhouse effect and acquire the renewable energy. However, previous studies primarily focused on the effect of the operating parameters on the biocathode with an indirect electron transfer (IDET) pathway instead of a direct electron transfer (DET) pathway for CO2 reduction. In this work, we aim to study the effect of the operating parameters, including temperature, inorganic carbon source, and initial pH value, on the biocathode with a DET pathway for CO2 reduction to CH4. The CH4-producing biocathodes showed the respective optimum performance at the condition of 35 °C temperature, 4 g L−1 bicarbonate concentration, and pH 7.5 catholyte. This work provides an important guidance for the operation and development of microbial electrosynthesis for CO2 reduction to chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgal biomass is a potential feedstock for biofuel production because of its oleaginous nature and fast growth rate. Furthermore, its cultivation does not compete with crop producing land and thereby eliminating food vs. fuel dilemma. This study describes a low-cost nutrient mediated cultivation method for growing lipid enriched algal biomass from Scenedesmus quadricauda in BG11 media in a raceway pond. A renewable heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized using calcium oxide obtained from calcination of waste egg shells and modified using cobalt nitrate hexahydrate by co-precipitation method. The synthesized catalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, FTIR, TEM techniques. Lipid extracted from the biomass is converted to biodiesel using the synthesized catalyst. The formation of biodiesel is confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and GC-MS techniques. The result demonstrated that the CaO–Co catalyst has very high catalytic activity for biodiesel production. The integrated process described in this study has potential for producing environmentally benign fuels and a heterogeneous catalyst from renewable sources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, an emerging and efficient strategy for the preparation of lignin samples with different acetylation degree by choline chloride/acetic anhydride (ChCl/Aa) treatment of pine kraft lignin (PKL) is reported, and the effects of efficient pre-acetylation of hydroxyl functional groups on subsequent lignin pyrolysis are also systematically investigated. The results show that the ChCl/Aa displays a high acetylation efficiency towards the aliphatic hydroxyl (~99.1%) and phenolic hydroxyl (~94.0%) of PKL, which enhances the hydrogen to carbon effective ratio of PKL. Noticeably, the ChCl/Aa has a slight effect on β-O-4 of PKL, and the acetylation of hydroxyl is beneficial for the improvement of the maximum degradation rate of PKL. In addition, the acetylation of hydroxyl is also significantly contributed to the increment of the pyrolysis bio-oil yield. Importantly, the relative content of the H-phenols obtained from acetylated lignins pyrolysis shows a positive correlation with the acetylation degree of hydroxyl. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignin is utilized as a carbon precursor to produce microporous lignin-derived carbon-based solid acid (MLC-S) ZnCl2 activation and sulfonation with concentrated sulfuric acid. The effects of reaction conditions, namely the ratio of methanol to oleic acid, carbonization temperature, and catalyst dosage, on the efficiency of the esterification of oleic acid with methanol are investigated. As a carbon-based solid acid, the MLC-S offers high catalytic activity in the esterification, which is a crucial reaction in the synthesis of biodiesel. Compared with nonactivated lignin-derived carbon-based solid acid (LC-S), the highly porous structure of the MLC-S makes its active sites more accessible and ensures its excellent catalytic performance. Under the optimal conditions, the esterification of oleic acid with methanol reaches a conversion of 92.3%. Moreover, after recycling the MLC-S for five times, the extent of the esterification reaction is still as high as 72.9%. Obviously, the synthesized MLC-S has considerable potential for the esterification of oleic acid with methanol and thus for biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hollow zeolites were investigated for catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of biomass to produce hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil. A series of hollow ZSM-5 catalysts were synthesized via a dissolution-recrystallization strategy. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, N2 sorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption experiments. The hollow zeolite was effective for increasing the hydrocarbon fraction in bio-oil. In particular, hollow HS-ZSM-5(50) afforded the highest hydrocarbon yield (6.8 wt%), which was ~3 times of that achieved with solid ZSM-5(50). The hollowness, acidity, and the presence of secondary wall mesopores in the hollow zeolite were found to affect bio-oil production. The hollow regions stabilized more active biomass intermediates and inhibited their repolymerization to coke, while the interior acid sites continually converted these intermediates to aromatic hydrocarbons. Secondary wall mesopores compromise the hollow space and hinder consecutive catalysis, resulting in phenols as the main product. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to quantify life-cycle fossil energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) derived renewable diesel (RD) taking into consideration different feedstock classifications that are applicable to PFAD (residue, byproduct, or coproduct), and incorporating updated data for key processes. Under the three classifications, the PFAD to RD pathway was modeled using the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET®) model. PFAD-derived RD could reduce fossil energy consumption by 77%–88%, relative to petroleum diesel. GHG emissions are very sensitive to PFAD classification and coproduct handling methods. Considering the production of palm oil and PFAD and economic value, we maintain that PFAD should be treated as a byproduct in palm oil refineries. With this treatment, PFAD-derived RD could achieve 84% GHG emissions reductions, compared to the emissions of petroleum diesel. We also employed a substitution method to address the substitution of PFAD by other materials in the marketplace. Compared to coproduct allocation results, we found substituting PFAD by tallow, soy oil, barley, and canola oil results in lower GHG emissions. Due to high induced land-use change emissions associated with palm farming, if PFAD is treated as a coproduct with refined palm oil, PFAD-derived RD may not deliver GHG reductions. A sensitivity analysis identified key parameters such as palm fruit yield, oil extraction efficiency in oil mills, and energy use intensity for RD production affects LCA results significantly; future efforts to improve these parameters could result in further GHG reductions. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The aim of this work was to enhance the biodiesel quality and hydrocarbon content of green microalga B. braunii strain KMITL 2 cultivated outdoor under several salinity conditions in a batch production. The enhancement would be such that the microalgal biodiesel qualities met or exceeded the current standard so that it would be a good raw material for biodiesel production. The microalga production was in 300 L open oval ponds, among various salinity levels tested (0–20 ppt), 5 ppt was the best for hydrocarbon production, yielding 54.2 ± 0.9% hydrocarbon content and 5.1 ± 0.4 g L−1 biomass. As the microalga production was scaled up by cultivation in 3,675 L open raceway pond under the 5 ppt condition, the microalga yielded a bit higher hydrocarbon content (58.8 ± 2.9%) but much lower biomass (2.5 ± 0.5 g L−1). The production in both oval and raceway ponds yielded a nearly identical biodiesel property (61.06–67.42 cetane number) which exceeded the value specified in international standards. Therefore, it was concluded that B. braunii strain KMITL 2 can be batch cultivated in an open pond at optimum salinity to yield sufficient hydrocarbon and biomass for biodiesel production. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, the exergy analysis and environmental assessment are performed to the biodiesel and diesel-fueled engine at full 294 Nm and 1800 r/min. The exergy loss rates of fuels are found as 15.523 and 18.884 kW for the 100% biodiesel (BDF100) (obtained from cooking oil) and Japanese Industrial Standard Diesel No. 2 (JIS#2) fuels, respectively. In addition, the exergy destruction rate of the JIS#2 fuel is found as 80.670 kW, while the corresponding rate of the BDF100 is determined as 62.389 kW. According to environmental assessments of emissions and nanoparticles of the fuels, the biodiesel (BDF100) fuel is more environmentally benign than the diesel (JIS#2) fuel in terms of particle concentration and carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. So, it is better to use this kind of the 100% biodiesels in the diesel engines for better environment and efficiency in terms of the availability and environmental perspectives. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Development and implementation of strategies targeting downstream steps to convert spent mushroom substrate into energy or bioproducts are an urgent matter. This may ensure that edible mushrooms are both sustainable to cultivate and also are able to be competitive with conventional sources of proteins. Accordingly, this study aimed at developing an integrated system to firstly produce oyster mushroom on sugarcane bagasse shaped into briquettes, then, recycle its spent material into fuel grade biosolids. To make special briquettes for production of P. ostreatus var. florida, sugarcane bagasse, corn meal, wheat bran, and calcitic limestone at the ratio of 30: 2.5: 2.5: 1 m m−1 (dry matter) were placed together in polyethylene bags, water added to 40, 60 and 80% moisture, then, pressed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 MPa using a pilot-scale hydraulic piston presser. At the end of thirty days of axenic cultivation, the spent material was dried and milled, then, reconverted into briquettes at the standard-pressure of 120 MPa. Production briquettes of 45 MPa, with 60 and 80% moisture, had the greatest productivity of mushrooms, 28.30% and 30.40%, and generated the lowest quantities of spent substrate, 46.70% and 44.80%, respectively. The relative energy density in solid biofuels from recycling the highest producers was the lowest, 2865.40 MJ kg−3 and 2573.05 MJ kg−3, respectively. In conclusion, a complete system of cultivating P. ostreatus var. florida and producing briquettes was successfully developed. This concept technically was efficiency in converting lignocellulosic residues into high-performance substrates for protein-rich food production. As well, this recycled the spent mushroom substrates into medium-quality fuel grade biosolids. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Esterification of free fatty acids in a low-grade oil with glycerol, the by-product of transesterification, has been proposed as one possible method to reduce the cost of raw materials for biodiesel production. The glycerolysis reaction recycles the byproduct glycerol to create a much more efficient and cost-effective process. However, the glycerolysis reaction involves challenges, including its requirement of high temperature. This study is the first to apply the deep eutectic solvent (DES) as a catalyst for glycerolysis reaction to convert free fatty acid (FFA) in vegetable oil deodorizer distillate (VODD) being a waste product from the oil refining process into glycerides. The effects of temperature, catalyst dosage, and time on the esterification efficiency of fatty acid conversion were explored. The reaction progress and product solubility were studied by FT-IR and GC. The results revealed that the reaction reached equilibrium at an approximate free fatty acid (FFA) conversion of 90%. The reaction was a second-order reversible reaction, using 8 wt% catalyst loading lowered activation energy to 58.80 J/mol. The optimum condition was determined as 160 °C, 5 wt% DES loading, and 10 min reaction time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production from algae feedstock has become a topic of interest in the recent decades since algae biomass cultivation is feasible in aquaculture and does therefore not compete with use of arable land. In the present work, hydrothermal liquefaction of both microalgae and macroalgae is evaluated for biofuel production and compared with transesterifying lipids extracted from microalgae as a benchmark process. The focus of the evaluation is on both the energy and carbon footprint performance of the processes. In addition, integration of the processes with an oil refinery has been assessed with regard to heat and material integration. It is shown that there are several potential benefits of co-locating an algae-based biorefinery at an oil refinery site and that the use of macroalgae as feedstock is more beneficial than the use of microalgae from a system energy performance perspective. Macroalgae-based hydrothermal liquefaction achieves the highest system energy efficiency of 38.6%, but has the lowest yield of liquid fuel (22.5 MJ per 100 MJalgae) with a substantial amount of solid biochar produced (28.0 MJ per 100 MJalgae). Microalgae-based hydrothermal liquefaction achieves the highest liquid biofuel yield (54.1 MJ per 100 MJalgae), achieving a system efficiency of 30.6%. Macro-algae-based hydrothermal liquefaction achieves the highest CO2 reduction potential, leading to savings of 24.5 resp 92 kt CO2eq/year for the two future energy market scenarios considered, assuming a constant feedstock supply rate of 100 MW algae, generating 184.5, 177.1 and 229.6 GWhbiochar/year, respectively. Heat integration with the oil refinery is only possible to a limited extent for the hydrothermal liquefaction process routes, whereas the lipid extraction process can benefit to a larger extent from heat integration due to the lower temperature level of the process heat demand. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Feeding or cofeeding bio-oil (biomass pyrolysis oil) into the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) has a direct impact on product distribution, reaction kinetics and deactivation of this key catalytic valorization strategy. In this work, we have analysed the impact in terms of the catalyst regeneration kinetics and energy balance of the unit. These factors are linked to the holistic viability of revamped refineries turned into biorefineries. Deactivated catalysts were obtained in FCC experiments using vacuum gasoil and raw bio-oil. The regeneration kinetics of coke combustion were analysed in a thermobalance, whereas the heats dissipated throughout the combustion (high heating values) were analysed in a calorimeter. Overall, the regenerator does not require major design amendments to treat bio-oil. We found a linear correlation between the higher heating value of the reactants and the coke produced, which enables to predict possible scenarios in the FCC unit. When incorporating higher amounts of bio-oil, the heat balance of the unit changes significantly: the temperature in the regenerator rises up to +36 K, requiring significant energy input for heating the bio-oil but offering the chance to recover more (electrical) energy when the proportion of bio-oil is greater than ca. 50%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study of an anion-exchange resin (Amberlyst A26 (OH)) catalyzed transesterification of Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) oil was conducted to determine the effects of three variables: reaction temperature, ethanol: oil molar ratio and catalyst amount, on Jatropha oil conversion (XJO) and fatty acid ethyl esters yield's (YFAEEs). The modified central composite design that involved three independent factors (temperature, ethanol: oil molar ratio and the catalyst present) with two levels, but not included the non-linear stage, was employed to optimize the process. From the main factors and their interactions, the ethanol: oil molar ratio was found to highly affect the XJO and YFAEEs. In this study, the statistical analysis showed that curvature is not significant (p ≤ 0.05), and thus, from the model regression equations, linear model was found to be more suitable to optimize the responses. By using the regression analysis and the response surface plots, the optimum XJO and YFAEEs of 37.63% and 36.31%, respectively were predicted to be obtained at the optimum temperature of 55 °C, ethanol: oil molar ratio of 35:1 and catalyst amount of 15%. Employing higher amount of catalyst reduced the XJO and YFAEEs, particularly, when the variable interacted with the reaction temperature. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - A simple, cost-effective and green mucilage-capped silver nanoparticles (Mucilage-AgNPs) modified glassy carbon electrode (GC) composite was constructed for efficient and facile electrochemical oxidation of glucose for the first time. Mucilage-AgNPs were synthesized through the direct chemical reduction of Ag+ by mucilage extracted from Opuntia ficus-indica. Mucilage-AgNPs were identified and characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and square wave voltammetry. Modification of the GC with AgNPs was carried out via a transfer-sticking technique with an immobilization time of 1 h. The Mucilage-AgNPs/GC composite was studied as a possible anode for glucose oxidation in a biofuel cell. The composite resulted in glucose oxidation with a current density and power density of 85.7 μA cm-2 and 25.7 μW cm-2, respectively. Glucose sensing using the Mucilage-AgNPs/GC composite was achieved successfully via two pathways: glucose oxidation and AgNP inhibition. The glucose oxidation-based sensor showed a lower detection limit of 0.01 mM and a linear range of 0.01 to 2.2 mM. The AgNPs inhibition-based sensor provides an indirect determination pathway of glucose with a detection limit of 0.1 mM and a linear range of 0.1 to 1.9 mM. AgNP inhibition is a novel pathway that could be used for determining a large number of organic and inorganic molecules. Overall, the Mucilage-AgNPs/GC is considered a pioneering composite for glucose sensing and fuel cell applications. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The bioaqueous phase generated during biomass conversion to biofuel and biochemicals, e.g., fast pyrolysis and ex situ catalytic pyrolysis, contains a large number of organics, leading to a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) for its treatment. In this study, we demonstrate its catalytic conversion to bioacetic acid solution and propose a recycling strategy thereof. We found that the diluted bioaqueous phase (e.g., C content <0.5 wt %) can be selectively (>90%) converted to acetic acid with nondetectable impurities in solution. The solution contains 1.3-1.5 wt % acetic acid and can be directly used for demineralization of biomass in the biorefineries. This recycling strategy enhances the sustainability of the biobased economy and sheds light on production of biobased acetic acid, which has been recognized as a smart drop-in chemical. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that has been used to replace petroleum diesel and to generate a positive impact on the economy and the environment. The aim of this paper was at identifying the variety of castor oil plant that could be cultivated and harnessed as bioenergy crops in Tlaltenango (Zacatecas, Mexico). Different varieties of wild castor (Ricinus communis L.) were studied, obtaining oil from its seeds and producing biodiesel from the variety with higher oil content by transesterification reaction at laboratory scale. Both oil and biodiesel were characterized physicochemically, and biodiesel quality was evaluated and compared with biofuels standards ASTM-D6751 (USA) and EN-14214 (European Union). Three varieties were identified; the denominated “green stem with wax, ashen fruit” showed the highest oil content (51.7 ± 5.6%), presenting a yield of the transesterification reaction of 61.44 ± 0.44%. The produced biodiesel complies with recommended value by both standards, except for the viscosity and the moisture, so its use is only suggested in blends with petroleum diesel. In conclusion, the variety “green stem with wax, ashen fruit” has the basic physicochemical characteristics for being considered an option in the industrial production of biodiesel in this city, being safe to use it in diesel engines. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study is focused on the possibility of using crustacean waste shells for sustainable biofuels and chemical production. We investigated the synthesis of ethyl levulinate (EL) from glucosamine by the methanesulfonic acidcatalyzed hydrothermal reaction using Box-Behnken design. In the ethyl levulinate synthesis, higher water content highly inhibited the formation of EL. Among the reaction factors, reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, and reaction time positively affected the outcome more than substrate concentration. The optimized reaction conditions were 200 °C reaction temperature, 60 g/L substrate concentration, 0.75 M catalyst concentration, and 44.9 min. Under these conditions, a 22.76 mol% EL yield was achieved. These results suggest that crustacean waste shells can be used for renewable feedstocks to produce valuable chemicals and biofuels. © 2020, The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The influence of glyphosate herbicide stress was investigated in the freshwater green microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana for metabolic growth and lipid induction. Glyphosate herbicide concentration at 30.10 ppm (IC50) elicited half-maximal inhibition during 96 h of incubation. After 24 days of harvest, C. sorokiniana produced 442.18 ± 9.1 mg/L and 427.73 ± 5.0 mg/L dcw of biomass in the control media and glyphosate IC50, respectively. A nominal reduction in biomass production was observed (~ 3.26%) due to stress in metabolic biosynthesis in glyphosate IC50 media. However, in contrast to biomass production, glyphosate IC50 stress aided in the induction of lipid biosynthesis in microalgae cells. The improvement in lipid synthesis was found to be ~17% higher in glyphosate IC50 compared to control. The chemical construction of the biomass, metabolites, and lipids of C. sorokiniana was analyzed via FTIR spectroscopy. The lipids extracted from C. sorokiniana were used for methanolic-H2SO4 catalyzed transesterification for the production of biodiesel. The synthesized biodiesel was analyzed by FTIR and 1H NMR. The conversion efficiency of microalgae lipids into biodiesel was estimated at ~77%. This study insights the use of glyphosate in lipid induction in microalgae to produce renewable and sustainable biofuels for the clean environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion of biomass is a promising option to produce energy-dense liquid biofuels, aiming to phase out fossil fuels from the transportation sector. Integration of renewable electricity boosts biofuel yield and carbon conversion from the scarce biomass resource, creating an indirect electrification of the transportation sector. Coupling biomass gasification and solid oxide cells (SOC), able to run in both electrolysis and fuel cell mode, constitutes the framework for flexible biofuel production. This paper compares the performance of five novel plant configurations for flexible biomass conversion to methanol and power. The plant performance is evaluated at five different operation modes: high production of methanol at low/intermediate electricity prices, co-production of electricity and methanol at high prices, and production of electricity without methanol co-production at price peaks. A TwoStage gasifier, a bubbling fluidized bed and an entrained flow gasifier are chosen as gasification technologies. The systems are thermodynamically modeled, and analyzed in terms of efficiency and carbon conversion. The highest efficiencies are achieved with the systems based on TwoStage Electro-gasifier (71%) and entrained flow gasification with pyrolysis as fuel pre-treatment (72%). The flexibility achieved by this technology combination enables high capacity factors, important for an accelerated commercialization of thermochemical biomass conversion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, hydrothermal liquefaction experiments of iron impregnated water hyacinth were performed with a motive to enhance bio-oil yields along with generation of nanometal carbon hybrids. Iron nanoparticles were impregnated and its metal loading was determined by ICP-MS. The impact of operating parameters like temperature, biomass to water ratio and reaction time on bio-oil yields was studied. During hydrothermal liquefaction a maximum total bio-oil yield of 38.1% was obtained at 280 °C along with formation of nanometal carbon hybrids. The light oil and heavy oil fractions were characterized by GCMS and NMR for determining the key components. The light oil mainly comprises of alkanes, alcohols and esters whereas heavy oil contains esters, ethers, carboxylic acids and phenols. XRD and XPS of Fe-impregnated water hyacinth and residues confirmed the transition of Fe+3/+2 to Fe0. TEM analysis resulted an average particle size of Fe nanoparticles around 19.6 nm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work is aimed at the development of a semi-continuous mechanochemical process for biodiesel production and the subsequent valorization of glycerol, its by-product, via its conversion into calcium diglyceroxide using the same mechanochemical reactor. This basic solid catalyzes the methanolysis of vegetable oils. The implementation of a semi-continuous process allows both the preparation of the solid catalyst and the methanolysis process, overcoming the miscibility problems of methanol and oil. Thus, a biodiesel yield higher than 90% is reached using a methanol:oil molar ratio close to stoichiometric value and 1.5 wt. % catalyst, after passing through the reactor with a flow rate between 4 and 45 L/h. This new process for biodiesel production can easily be scaled up and applied to the conversion of used cooking oils, without any significant yield decrease. A cost study was also performed, demonstrating that this is more economical than the conventional batch stirring-based process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulose is a widely available carbon source and a promising feedstock for the production of advanced second-generation biofuels. Nonetheless, lignin, one of its major components, is largely underutilized and only considered an undesired byproduct. Through catalytic hydrotreatment, the highly condensed lignin can be partially depolymerized into a range of monomers. However, its recalcitrance and the presence of aromatic fragments linked by C-C bonds require extensive cracking, which is challenging to achieve. Here, a two-step strategy is reported in which an initial pretreatment step with ozone is used prior to catalytic hydrotreatment to boost lignin depolymerization. Three types of lignin (Kraft, pyrolytic, and Fabiola organosolv) are used as feedstocks and the ozonation step is performed under ambient conditions with either methanol or ethanol as the solvent. The pretreatment is shown to have a positive effect on the subsequent hydrotreatment reaction (Pd/C, 350 °C, 100 bar H2) and gives product oils with significantly lower Mw (up to 43% lower), higher volatility, and improved calorific values (up to 45.3 MJ kg−1) compared to a direct hydrotreatment. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Terpenoids have drawn much attention to scientists in synthesizing high-performance bio- jet fuels due to their ring structures, which feature potential high densities. Here, a facile biphasic catalytic process has been developed for the production of high-density tricyclic hydrocarbon biofuels from a monoterpenoid, 1,8-cineole, using sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as the homogeneous catalyst. A ~100% conversion of 1,8-cineole and a &gt; 40% carbon yield of cyclic dimers were achieved at 100 °C within two hours. The mechanism for the acid-catalyzed conversion of 1,8-cineole to cyclic hydrocarbon dimers were explored. In particular, the formation of the diene intermediates and the following dimerization of dienes was essential to synthesize tricyclic terpene dimers. The biphasic catalytic process accelerated the deoxygenation rate and enabled the dimerization with the aid of organic solvent while controlling the reaction rates to avoid the formation of solid residues. Moreover, this process also facilitated the product separation by organic solvent extraction while enabling easy recycle of the homogenous catalysts. © 2020

AB  - This study explored the potential of triticale feedstock for biofuel biorefining scenarios that included (i) producing ethanol, (ii) biochemically producing acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE), and annexing catalytic processes to ethanol production for (iii) butanol and (iv) hydrocarbons (liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel). Based on simulations in Aspen Plus, the net greenhouse gas reduction (GHG) and minimum fuel energy price (MFEP) were determined. The maximum contracting prices of triticale (MCP) were then determined and benchmarked against historic animal feed prices to ascertain market competition. Thus, producing ethanol had the lowest MFEP of 18.3 US$/GJ and highest GHG reduction of 81%, while ABE had the highest MFEP of 27.3 GJ/kg and lowest GHG reduction of 63%; therefore, catalytically producing butanol was preferable (MFEP = 22 US$/GJ). If a CAPEX rebate of 30% is applied to the ethanol and butanol scenarios, the chances that existing animal feed prices outcompeted the MCPs were 50-98%. For the hydrocarbon fuels, the MFEPs were 60% higher than the fossil equivalent, though the GHG reduction was 75%. If the jet fuel product received a carbon tax rebate, the chances of the animal feed market outcompeting the MCP were only 22%. Thus, the need for incentivizing mechanisms for biofuels was further emphasized. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) has been considered as a promising implantable energy generator because it can extract energy from a living body without any harm to the host. However, an unprotected enzyme will be destabilized and even eventually be deactivated in human blood. Thus, the performance of implantable EBFC has received barely any improvement. It is therefore a breakthrough in realizing a superior efficient EBFC that can work stably in human blood which relies in protecting the enzyme to defend it from the attack of biological molecules in human blood. Herein, we innovatively created a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and cascaded enzyme-glucose oxidase (GOx)/horseradish peroxidase (HRP) coembedded hydrophilic MAF-7 biocatalyst (SWCNT-MAF-7-GOx/HRP). The SWCNT-MAF-7-GOx/HRP is highly stable in electrocatalytic activity even when it is exposed to high temperature and some molecular inhibitors. In addition, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the electrocatalytic activity of GOx/HRP in hydrophilic SWCNT-MAF-7 far surpasses that of the GOx/HRP in hydrophobic SWCNT-ZIF-8. In human whole blood, the SWCNT-MAF-7-GOx/HRP catalytic EBFC exhibits an eightfold increase in power density (119 μW cm-2 vs 14 μW cm-2) and 13-fold increase in stability in comparison with the EBFC based on an unprotected enzyme. In this study, the application of metal-organic framework-based encapsulation techniques in the field of biofuel cells is successfully realized, breaking a new path for creating implantable bioelectrical-generating devices.

AB  - The efficient depolymerization of technical lignin to produce high-quality and phenolic monomer-rich bio-oil is challenging owing to the inherent recalcitrant structure of lignin. In addition, the phenolic fragments formed during lignin depolymerization are highly reactive and easily undergo rapid repolymerization to yield undesired heavy oils or char. In the present work, we report a new hybrid catalyst of Ru/C combined with MgO/ZrO2 that is highly effective at depolymerizing lignin to high-quality bio-oil by a cooperative catalysis of Ru-catalyzed reductive depolymerization and MgO/ZrO2-catalyzed stabilization of the reactive phenolic monomers through in-situ capping of the phenol repolymerization initiator, i.e., formaldehyde, by reaction with ethanol. A screening study of various catalyst combinations, including transition metal catalysts such as Pd, Ni, and Ru supported on carbon or Al2O3 as well as basic oxide catalysts such as MgO, MgO/ZrO2, ZrO2, and Mg-Al mixed oxides, revealed that Ru/C–MgO/ZrO2 was the only combination that had a significant positive synergistic catalytic effect on lignin depolymerization, thereby highlighting its unique and exceptional activity. To elucidate the synergistic roles of Ru and MgO/ZrO2 in lignin depolymerization, their individual and integrated catalysis as well as the effect of the Mg/Zr ratio were systematically investigated through a comprehensive analysis of the bio-oil products using several techniques, including 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HSQC-NMR). A high bio-oil yield of 76.2 wt% with a low molecular weight of 401 g/mol, large HHV of 34.47 MJ/kg, and high phenolic monomer yield of 31.44 wt% was successfully obtained over the integrated catalyst of Ru/C and MgO/ZrO2 (Mg/Zr = 3) at 350 °C and 30 bar-H2 after 4 h. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fruits-and-vegetables wastes (FVW) and corn stover (CS) are two of the most recurred lignocellulosic biomasses used for biofuel production. In this work, the co-processing of FVW and CS for biohydrogen production was proposed and evaluated through a set of experimental designs. First, a 5 × 2 general factorial was applied on the dilute acid pretreatment at five levels of FVW:CS ratios (0:1, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1 and 1:0 dry mass basis) and two levels of the type of catalyst (HCl or H2SO4 at 0.5% in volumetric basis). Then, biohydrogen production using the dilute acid hydrolyzates was carried out in batch mode at 35 °C in a 32 factorial design, the factors being the inoculum to substrate ratio (0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 g g−1) and the initial concentration of reducing sugars (10, 13 and 16 g L−1). The effects of the type of acid catalyst and the FVW:CS ratio were significant in terms of sugars production and yield. The best catalyst was HCl for the 3:1 FVW:CS ratio, which produced monomeric sugars concentrations of 10.0, 3.7 and 2.9 g L−1 for glucose, xylose and arabinose, respectively. The hydrolyzates were suitable for biohydrogen production, reaching yields of 2.31 mol H2 mol−1glucose and hydrogen production rates of 8.83 mL H2 h−1. An economic prospection at lab scale demonstrated that hydrogen production presented net revenues of 0.009 USD per kg of co-substrates, resulting in 24% profitability of hydrogen production over its production costs. Therefore, this co-processing is an interesting proposal with further applications on biorefinery models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The MnO2 nanoparticles, when used as catalyst, determine an enhanced reaction rate of the transesterifications process thus being very attractive for biodiesel production. One of the current limitations of the biofuel production by using MnO2 nanoparticles as catalyst is given by the reaction conditions. This work intends to improve the transesterification reaction efficiency through the use of a microwave field. It can generate large quantities of energy that lead to a good molecular motion thus favoring the transesterification process without altering the molecular structure. The aim of the present research is to explore the possibility of carrying out the microwave-assisted transesterification of grapes residues and seeds oil through the use of MnO2 nanoparticles as catalysts, as well as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), to efficiently obtain biofuel end product. Methods: Both chemically and biochemically (using plant extracts) synthesized MnO2 nanoparticles were produced and characterized by different techniques like TEM, XRD, BET, XPS, VSM. The analysis of obtained biofuel was performed by GC–MS. Results: The comparison of results revealed that the samples prepared using plant extracts have morphologic properties higher than chemically prepared sample. MnO2 nanoparticles obtained by the use of oregano extracts were further tested for microwave assisted transesterification studies. Conclusions: The surface area of the MnO2 nanoparticles biochemically synthesized was four times higher than the nanoparticles synthesized by chemical method. The MnO2-oregano nanoparticles presented the best catalytic activity for biodiesel production as compared to the yeast catalyst. The use of microwave field for transesterification further enhances the efficiency of the process. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Coconut meal, a waste product left after coconut milk processing, was collected and utilized as raw substrate for biofuel production. Biofuel production was produced via two steps. Biodiesel was first produced from coconut meal’s oil. Afterward, bioethanol was produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using coconut waste after oil extraction as the sole carbon source. In this study, oil extraction methods, including chill and centrifugation, fermentation, and dry processing, were determined. The highest yield was obtained from dry processing (42.2%). The moisture and free fatty acid content of waste coconut oil (WCO) was 0.1% and 0.3–0.5%, respectively. Therefore, WCO was favourable to use as a substrate for biodiesel production. The highest biodiesel yield (98.1%) was observed from an alkali catalyst. Fuel properties of biodiesel from WCO met the biodiesel standard of the USA (ASTM D6751-07) and Europe (EN 14214). Thereafter, solid coconut waste (SCW) after oil extraction was collected and pre-treated using 50% NaOH. Cellulose content (62.1%) significantly increased after alkali pre-treatment. Thereafter, pre-treated SCW was hydrolysed with cellulase derived from Trichoderma viride and Aspergillus niger. Glucose (20.3 g/L) was a major end product in enzymatic hydrolysate. SCW hydrolysate was utilized as fermentation medium without nutritional supplementation. The production of ethanol constantly increased and reached 8.5 g/L (equivalent to 82.4% of theoretical yield) after 60 h. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Akebia trifoliata (Thunb.) Koidz may have applications as a new potential source of biofuels owing to its high seed count, seed oil content, and in-field yields. However, the pericarp of A. trifoliata cracks longitudinally during fruit ripening, which increases the incidence of pests and diseases and can lead to fruit decay and deterioration, resulting in significant losses in yield. Few studies have evaluated the mechanisms underlying A. trifoliata fruit cracking. Results: In this study, by observing the cell wall structure of the pericarp, we found that the cell wall became thinner and looser and showed substantial breakdown in the pericarp of cracking fruit compared with that in non-cracking fruit. Moreover, integrative analyses of transcriptome and proteome profiles at different stages of fruit ripening demonstrated changes in the expression of various genes and proteins after cracking. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of 20 differentially expressed genes were analyzed, and parallel reaction monitoring analysis of 20 differentially expressed proteins involved in cell wall metabolism was conducted. Among the molecular targets, pectate lyases and pectinesterase, which are involved in pentose and glucuronate interconversion, and β-galactosidase 2, which is involved in galactose metabolism, were significantly upregulated in cracking fruits than in non-cracking fruits. This suggested that they might play crucial roles in A. trifoliata fruit cracking. Conclusions: Our findings provided new insights into potential genes influencing the fruit cracking trait in A. trifoliata and established a basis for further research on the breeding of cracking-resistant varieties to increase seed yields for biorefineries. © 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are bioelectrochemical devices, which produce electrical energy from wastewater through degradation of biodegradable organic substrates. The use of MFCs for energy generation from wastewater biofuels through electrochemically active bacteria as biocatalysts has been accepted in the recent past. The power output of MFCs depends upon the electrode material, pH of the medium, temperature, internal and external impedance, and redox potentials of cathodic and anodic chambers. The current review highlights the importance of tuning these parameters for improving the energy generation efficiency of MFCs. Because every technology has associated merits and demerits, thus, to avoid offering details of only success stories, here an effort has been made to critically discuss the recent progress and challenges in the applicability of MFCs as an energy generation source and water purification technology. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The real-world application of an enzyme-based biofuel cell (EBFC) requires the desirable immobilization of enzymes on the electrode surface, offering the feasibility of addressing its short lifetime and low-power density. Nevertheless, an efficient immobilization of enzymes strongly relies on the preferred scaffolding between the enzyme and the electrode. Accordingly, the development of a promising route to attain a tunable scaffold structure is urgently required. Herein, we present a facile and ecofriendly route for efficiently controlling the scaffold structure by investigating the interplay of tripolyphosphate (TPP), chitosan (CS), and Na. A series of glucose oxidase (GOx)-based anodic electrodes, GOx[CS/TPP]CC, GOx[CS/Na]CC, and GOx[CS/TPP/Na]CC, are synthesized using CS/TPP, CS/Na, and CS/TPP/Na as the scaffolding on carbon cloth (CC) followed by the immobilization of GOx for a comparative study of the microstructure, enzyme loading, and electrochemical property. It is revealed that the self-pumping EBFC, driven by capillary force, utilizing GOx[CS/TPP/Na]CC can deliver a higher peak power density (1.077 mW cm-2) than that utilizing GOx[CS/TPP]CC (0.776 mW cm-2) and GOx[CS/Na]CC (0.682 mW cm-2). The self-pumping EBFC utilizing GOx[CS/TPP/Na]CC can retain 89.2% of its beginning performance even after 240 h of testing, as compared with that utilizing GOx[CS/Na]CC (61.1%). This enhancement can be attributed to the formation of a desirable scaffold structure via the cross-linked CS/TPP matrices combined with Na polymers for the hybrid enzyme immobilization, simultaneously offering the capability of improving the enzyme-loading efficiency, facilitating the interaction between the surface electrode and the enzyme, and preventing the release of the enzyme during the cell operation. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Rheology is known to have an impact on the performance of digesters, but the effect of additional substrates (co-digestion) is poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the addition of cellulose, protein and lipids to substrates on the rheological behaviour and biogas production of the mixture of primary sludge (PS) and waste-activated sludge (WAS) in a batch system. A mixture of PS and WAS to form the main substrate was anaerobically co-digested with different types of organic matter (cellulose, protein and lipids) as co-substrates at different co-substrate to main substrate ratios of 2–8 (wt%) under mesophilic conditions and below ammonia inhibition levels. Yield stress (τy) and the flow consistency index (k) of the combined feed in the case of cellulose and protein were significantly dependent on the amount of co-substrate added, while there was an insignificant impact on these properties when lipids were added. Cellulose significantly increased τy and k in the feed, which resulted in poor fluidity and the improper homogenisation of the digester content, and consequently decreased the biogas yield. In contrast, the biogas yield was improved through the addition of 2% to 6% protein despite an increase in τy and k of the feed, but the methane yield decreased at 7% and 8% levels of protein concentration. This observation indicates that the threshold for τy and k of the digester media depends on the organic nature and digestibility of the substrate. There was no significant impact on the flow properties of the initial mixture when lipids were added, and their addition increased the biogas yield. A first-order kinetic reaction model was used for predicting the yield of methane from these digesters. The rate constant values revealed an increasing trend, with the highest for protein then lipids then cellulose. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an ecofriendly remediation practice for contaminated soils. This study evaluated the efficiency of cockspur grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) as a phytoremediation plant species by measuring the heavy metal(loid) uptake. In addition, for determining a viable route to valorize the phytoremediation byproduct, biodiesel was produced by the conversion of contaminated cockspur grass seeds through noncatalytic transesterification with a porous medium. From a series of experimental studies, this study confirmed that a substantial amount of heavy metal(loid)s was translocated into cockspur grass, and their removal efficiency after 3 weeks was as follows: Ni ≥ Cu > Co > Zn > Mn > Fe > As. Prior to the transesterification study, lipid content (11.6 wt %), a feedstock for biodiesel production, in cockspur grass seeds was estimated by the thermogravimetric analysis and the Soxhlet extraction test. Because the lipid extract from cockspur grass seeds contained a substantial amount of organic and inorganic impurities, biodiesel synthesis from a conventional transesterification method was negligible. However, biodiesel yield from noncatalytic transesterification using a porous medium reached 98% at 390 °C. The yield of biodiesel decreased at ≥400 °C due to biodiesel thermal cracking. This study also revealed that the noncatalytic transesterification of cockspur grass seeds into biodiesel was affected by the steric factors (collision frequency), evidenced by the carbon chain length of the acyl acceptor that was inversely proportional to the biodiesel yield.

AB  - An advanced thermal conversion system involving high-temperature gasification of biomass and municipal waste into biofuel, syngas or hydrogen-rich gas is presented in this paper. The decomposition of solid biomass and wastes by gasification is carried out experimentally with a modern and innovative regenerator and updraft continuous gasifier, among others. A ceramic high-cycle regenerator provides extra energy for the thermal conversion of biomass or any other solids waste. Highly preheated air and steam gas (heated up to 1600 ◦C) was used as an oxidizing or gasification agent (feed gas). Preheated feed gas also enhances the thermal decomposition of the gasification solids for fuel gas. However, the main objective of this work is to promote new and advanced technology for the thermochemical conversion of biomass for alternative energy production. Selected results from experimental and numerical studies are also presented. © 2020 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to secure the feed, a bio-based chemical production plant shall be designed to process more than one bio-based feedstock. However, the process usually requires costly H2 supply. Without H2 feeding, the effects of Cu on Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDO catalysts were investigated on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol with and without bio-ethanol co-feeding. As a result, the reduced catalyst dramatically increased the glycerol conversion and gave an apparently-high selectivity of chemicals such as 1,2-propandiol, ethyl lactate, and lactic acid. Apparently, besides as a hydrogen donor, ethanol also acted as a reactant that produced ethyl lactate via the esterification with lactic acid. In summary, Cu2+ and Cu+ sites promoted glycerol dehydration, the oxidation to lactic acid, and the esterification with ethanol to ethyl lactate whereas Cu0 was believed to promote the in-situ hydrogen formation from glycerol reforming. The integrated reaction pathways were also proposed and discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The demand for renewable resources, surplus availability, low cost and lower environmental impact has led to the utilization of bio-glycerol into high-value derivatives and functional chemicals for sustainability of the bio-diesel industry. The production of bio-fuel additives is of great interest as there is a gradual shift from petro-based chemicals to green chemicals. This work involves the direct synthesis of oxygenated fuel additives, 1,3-dioxalane and 1,3-dioxane from glycerol and benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst. The reaction progresses successfully to produce 1,3-dioxalane primarily by in-situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and subsequent condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with glycerol. Glycerol primarily acted as green solvent to facilitate the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and as a fuel additive precursor to produce 1,3-dioxalane in the preceding reaction. FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst presented high performance achieving 92% glycerol conversion with 75% selectivity to 1,3-dioxalane in a reaction performed at 100 °C for 60 min. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The high value usage of waste biomass-based resources is highly demanded. Here we synthesized an acid and base based on SBA-15 bifunctional catalyst, SBA-15@MgO@Zn, for the catalytic pyrolysis of waste cooking oils (WCO) into hydrocarbon rich biofuel with deoxygenation. First, C[sbnd]C bond broke at Lewis acid sites to form hydrocarbons and short-chain fatty acids, and then these short-chain fatty acids deoxidized at the basic sites to form hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, the acid and base coexist bifunctional catalyst overcomes not only the shortcomings for the acidic catalysts that easily produce coke, but also for the basic catalysts that induces saponification during the catalytic pyrolysis of high acid value WCO. At the same time, this kind of high efficient catalyst makes deoxidation in the process of the pyrolysis, which not only improves the quality of biofuel, but also simplifies the production process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The kinetics, thermodynamics, and volatile products of camphorwood pyrolysis were investigated via thermogravimetry coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy at multiple heating rates. The kinetic triplets and thermodynamic parameters were estimated via model free combined with the model-fitting approach. The results showed that the pyrolysis of camphorwood in the conversion rate range from 0 to 0.85 might be considered as one-step process. The mean value of the activation energy and pre-exponential factor was 192.63 kJ/mol and 2.38 × 1013 s−1, respectively. The pyrolysis process (0 ≤ α ≤ 0.85) can be described by the three-dimensional diffusion model g(α) = [(1−α)−1/3 – 1]2. Furthermore, the predicted curves of the conversion rate α showed good agreement with the experimental curves. The values of ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS varied little with α and remained positive. In addition, the major gas products released from the camphorwood waste pyrolysis were H2O, methane, CO2, CO, C=O, O–H, C–O–C, and NH3, whose concentration in the order from highest to lowest was C=O &gt; CO2 &gt; O–H &gt; H2O &gt; methane &gt; NH3 &gt; C–O–C &gt; CO. The main conclusions in the present study can provide guidance for the design and optimization of industrial reactor and selection of target biofuels or chemical raw materials. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present work, locally available clay has been utilized to develop cost effective catalyst for biodiesel production from low cost feedstock. The selected clay was modified with different concentrations (5 wt%, 10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt% and 40 wt %) of 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) to enhance the capability of the selected clay in biodiesel production from spent frying oil. The synthesized catalyst was characterized with different analytical techniques to evaluate its physiochemical properties. The result suggested that the catalyst containing 10 wt% 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) loading exhibited good trans-esterification activity to produce maximum biodiesel yield of 96% under the best reaction conditions: oil/methanol molar ratio, 1:10; catalyst amount, 0.7 g; reaction time, 4.5 h and reaction temperature, 85 °C. Moreover, the catalytic reusability of the synthesized catalyst was investigated to study its economic viability. The results suggested that the synthesized catalyst could be reused up to 6 times for biodiesel production without any high temperature treatment. Thus, the selected clay has the potential to be used as a starting material to develop an efficient catalyst for biodiesel production from low cost feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Refined pyrolysis bio-oil was produced via the pretreatment and esterification of pyrolysis bio-oil over 732-type ion-exchange resin. The main parameters of fuel property such as components, low calorific value and viscosity of refined pyrolysis bio-oil were analyzed. Different volume fractions of refined pyrolysis bio-oil were added to neat diesel to prepare bio-fuel blends. Combustion performances and emission characteristics of engine fueled with bio-fuel blends were analyzed at various loads. The results show that after esterification, the amount of esters and ketones in the crude pyrolysis bio-oil was significantly increased while the contents of acids, phenols and ethers were reduced. Compared with crude pyrolysis bio-oil, the pH value of refined pyrolysis bio-oil was improved to 5.6, the low calorific value increased by 14.89%, and the kinematic viscosity decreased by 10.13%. At the same load, the equivalent brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of bio-fuel blends was increased, the maximum cylinder pressures and the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) were both decreased but the peak of instantaneous heat release was increased slightly, and the exhaust gas temperatures also rose up. With the increase of refined pyrolysis bio-oil in bio-fuel blends, the difference between bio-fuel blends and neat diesel in the above indicators was more obvious. Besides, bio-fuel blends produced more HC, CO and smoke emissions but less NOx emissions than neat diesel. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Integration of renewable raw materials in existing refineries is most likely the shortest way for the successful, large-scale introduction of biofuels in the transport sector in the short term and medium term. One possible renewable raw material for this application is fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO), which in this study has been coprocessed (at 0 and 20 wt %) with vacuum residue (VR, 50 wt %) and vacuum gas oil (VGO, balance) in a continuous, as well as a semibatch, slurry hydrocracking process. Experiments both with and without FPBO were performed at 450 °C and 150 bar with a continuous hydrogen flow through the reactor. Oil-soluble molybdenum hexacarbonyl and molybdenum 2-ethylhexanoate were used as catalyst precursors, to be sulfided in situ. The continuous trials resulted in reactor walls completely free of coking, and they resulted in a low overall coke yield (about 1 wt %). The hydrodeoxygenation reached almost 92%, and the total acid number was reduced by nearly 99% in the FPBO experiment. A mass balance of the renewable carbon from FPBO, based on the performed experiments, showed that the fossil CO2 emissions can be lowered by 1.35 kg per kilogram of processed FPBO if all renewable carbon in gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons is used to replace its fossil counterparts, and all methane formed from FPBO is used to produce hydrogen. Semibatch experiments gave less successful results when upgrading FPBO-containing feedstock, with a high coke yield (8 wt %) as well as a high gas yield (24 wt %). The results of this study demonstrate that FPBO can be successfully coprocessed with heavy fossil oils in a continuous slurry hydrocracking process without negatively affecting the processing of the fossil components of the feed and that a continuous process is preferred over batch or semibatch processes when studying coprocessing of bio-oils.

AB  - Effective hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose is a crucial step to utilize lignocellulosic biomass for fuels and chemicals. In this study, we adopted the simple Blanc chloromethylation of commercially available Amberlyst-15 to fabricate enzyme-mimic solid acid (A-15-Cl) for cellulose hydrolysis. The results indicated that the chlorine group in A-15-Cl adsorbed cellulose and particularly oligosaccharides through hydrogen bonding while the sulfonic acid group cleaved the β-1,4 glycosidic bonds in cellulose and oligosaccharides. Due to the synergistic effect between the chlorine (adsorbing cellulose) and sulfonic acid (hydrolyzing cellulose) groups, A-15-Cl effectively hydrolyzed cellulose in water achieving a 67.2% glucose yield at 170 °C in 2 h. Moreover, A-15-Cl can be readily separated from the reaction medium by an 80-mesh screen for reuse at least five times without significant loss of catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are appraised as the renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. With this view, the current study examines the possibility of a locally isolated microalga, Chlorella minutissima for production of biodiesel, under batch and fed-batch cultivation modes, being subjected to seasonal variations. Effects of different culture depths (5, 10, 15, and 20 cm) on the biomass yield and lipid accumulation were investigated using the mini pond system, and alterations in different physicochemical factors were documented. Both the batch as well as the fed-batch cultivations recorded the 15 cm culture depth to be optimum for obtaining the maximum biomass and lipid production. Consequently, this optimal depth was chosen for further experimentation integrating low-dose sequential phosphate addition (LDSPA) under both batch and fed-batch modes. For batch cultivation under LDSPA mode, the estimated annual biomass productivity was 10.04 ton hectare−1 year−1, with the lipid productivity of 1.37 ton hectare−1 year−1, considering 11 cycles of cultivation per year. On the other hand, the fed-batch cultivation under LDSPA mode projected the annual biomass productivity of 15.4 ton hectare−1 year−1 and lipid productivity of 2.29 ton hectare−1 year−1, even with 10 cycles of cultivation yearly, thus, certifying the supremacy of the fed-batch cultivation with LDSPA for obtaining a higher productivity of lipid. The biodiesel generated from the produced biomass demonstrated a greater prevalence of monounsaturated and saturated fatty acid methyl esters. Additionally, the fuel characteristics of the biodiesel samples were analyzed and recorded to be at par with the national (Indian) as well as international (European and American) biodiesel standards, hence, indicating its suitability as an alternative to petroleum-based fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study the non-conventional yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus X19, was evaluated as biocatalyst for direct, low cost bioethanol production, using natural date palm sap (DPS) as substrate. Initial experiments were conducted with synthetic media in order to characterize the strain in terms of its nitrogen requirements, the effect of initial substrate concentration on the ethanol yields and the main kinetic constants during alcoholic fermentation. Subsequently, the effect of aerobic or anaerobic conditions was assessed with DPS as substrate, in batch mode and the possible improvement of ethanol yields was further investigated via fed batch experiments. It was shown that W. anomalus X19 was not inhibited by low pH (<3) and high initial sugar concentrations (up to 160 g/L), leading in all cases to ethanol yields that exceeded 80% of the theoretically estimated values. The highest ethanol concentration from DPS fermentation was achieved in fed batch experiments, reaching 73.11 g/L and the ethanol yield was 0.46 g/g sugars, which corresponded to more than 90% of the theoretical maximum. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermochemical biomass conversion technologies use renewable feedstocks to produce gaseous, liquid and solid fuels to produce electric power, heat, chemicals or other types of fuel. Biomass gasification has emerged as a promising conversion technology to meet increasing global energy demands. In this study, a thermodynamic model programmed with MATLAB and CANTERA was used to study the effect of equivalence ratio on reaction temperature and producer gas during the decomposition of woody biomass in a downdraft gasifer. The composition of the producer gas was estimated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy for calculation of the equilibrium constants. A Newton–Raphson algorithm was used to find the final equilibrium state. This process began with an initial estimate for temperature of the chemical composition at equilibrium. The results of the modeling were reported based on the variation in the main indicators of the process such as cold gas efficiency and higher heating value Higher heating value. As such, variations in equivalence ratio were calculated for various moisture contents and the temperature of the reactor. Cold gas efficiency and higher heating values were maximized at optimum equivalence ratio 0.31. Gibbs free energy change through the main parts of the reactor was found to be negative and ranged from − 95 to − 280 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of oxidation was also found to be native at around − 250 kJ/mol indicating exothermic exothermic nature of the reactions in oxidation zone. However, the total enthalpy of the system increased with an increase in the temperature directing the system to be more endothermic in reduction zone (105 kJ/mol). Model predictions were satisfactorily consistent with experimental data in this study and the literature. The results of this study can be directly applied to develop gasification reactors in biorefineries to enhance process efficiency. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - We are reporting the novel cellulase named Cel-5M from rumen metagenome. The deduced amino acid sequence and biochemical characterization suggested that Cel-5M is endoglucanase from the GH5 family with multifunctional potential. Cel-5M showed similarity to non-characterized proteins and the genus Prevotella as parental organism. The 957 bp ORF encoding Cel-5M was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli and purified. The recombinant Cel-5M showed maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 40 °C. It retained more than 80% activity between 4 and 7 pH and 65% thermostability between 30 and 70 °C. Cel-5M showed activity on various substrates like CMC, Filter paper, Avicel, Xylan, β-Mannan, and Glucopyranoside, which confirmed its multifunctional characteristics and classifies as member of subfamily 4 of GH5 (GH5_4). LCB hydrolysis potential of Cel-5M was studied using wheat straw (10% w/v). Alkali-treated and steam-exploded wheat straws were inoculated with 1 mg/g Cel-5M, 2% yeast in a reaction mixture and SSF at 10% w/v loading rate. The ethanol yield 0.46 g/g and 0.43 g/g of cellulose obtained after 72 h fermentation in alkali-treated and steam-exploded wheat straw, respectively. Cel-5M is novel multifunction cellulase belongs GH-5 endoglucanase from rumen origin can be employed for bioethanol based biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrogenases (H2ase) catalyze the oxidation of dihydrogen and the reduction of protons with remarkable efficiency, thereby attracting considerable attention in the energy field due to their biotechnological potential. For this simple reaction, [NiFe] H2ase has developed a sophisticated but intricate mechanism with the heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen, where its Ni−Fe active site exhibits various redox states. Recently, new spectroscopic and crystal structure studies of [NiFe] H2ases have been reported, providing significant insights into the catalytic reaction mechanism, hydrophobic gas-access tunnel, proton-transfer pathway, and electron-transfer pathway of [NiFe] H2ases. In addition, [NiFe] H2ases have been shown to play an important role in biofuel cell and solar dihydrogen production. This concept provides an overview of the biocatalytic reaction mechanism and biochemical application of [NiFe] H2ases based on the new findings. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The aim of the paper is the techno-economic analysis of innovative integrated combined heat and power (CHP) systems for the exploitation of different renewable sources in the residential sector. To this purpose, a biofuel-driven organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is combined with a wind turbine, a photovoltaic system and an auxiliary boiler. The subsystems work in parallel to satisfy the electric and heat demand of final users: A block of 40 dwellings in a smart community. A 12.6 kWel ORC is selected according to a thermal-driven strategy, while wind and solar subsystems are introduced to increase the global system efficiency and the electric self-consumption. The ORC can be switched-o_ or operated at partial load when solar and/or wind sources are significant. A multi-variable optimization has been carried out to find the proper size of the wind turbine and photovoltaic subsystems and to define the suitable operating strategy. To this purpose, several production wind turbines (1.0-60.0 kWel) and photovoltaic units (0.3-63.0 kWel) have been considered with the aim of finding the optimal trade-off between the maximum electric self-consumption and the minimum payback period and electric surplus. The multi-objective optimization suggests the integration of 12.6 kWel ORC with 10 kWel wind turbine and 6.3 kWel photovoltaic subsystem. The investigation demonstrates that the proposed multi-source integrated system offers a viable solution for smart-communities and distributed energy production with a significant improvement in the global system efficiency (+7.5%) and self-consumption (+15.0%) compared to the sole ORC apparatus. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Developing sulfonic-acid-supported catalysts with superacidity and hydrophobicity is of great importance for many acid-catalyzed reactions where H2O is generated. Herein, a novel hydrophobic superacidic biochar is first reported via a diazo grafting method using halogen-substituted amino-benzenesulfonic acids and 4-tert-butylaniline as sulfonating and hydrophobic reagents, respectively. The resultant biochar has a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (400-700 m2·g-1), acid concentration (up to 1.5 mmol·g-1), and H2O contact angle (above 134°). The synergistic effect of superacidity and hydrophobicity greatly improves the catalytic alkylation reactions of 4-ethylphenol-phenylmethanol and 2-methylfuran-cyclic ketones for the synthesis of renewable high-density fuels. The hydrophobic superacidic biochar shows higher catalytic conversion and selectivity than those of its counterparts without hydrophobicity or superacidity. Meanwhile, it is also far superior to commercial Amberlyst-15 and the traditional sulfonated biochar. Finally, the catalyst is stable without obvious activity reduction after cycling. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Natural microalgae (NM,Scenedesmus) cultivated by utilization of exhaust gas from a municipal solid waste combustion power plant were used for the biofuel production through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The high-ash NM underwent acid-washing to obtain deashing microalgae (DA). HTL experiments were carried out at different temperatures from 260 °C to 340 °C with NM and DA. Products derived from NM and DA were examined by various techniques in order to identify the influence of the ash on the hydrothermal decomposition behavior. The results show that the ash inhibits the transformation of microalgae. The bio-oil yield including heavy oil and light oil is in the range of 17.59-22.09% for NM and 24.30-31.14% for DA, respectively. Calcium carbonate in the ash promotes deamination, resulting in an increase in the relative content of ketones in the NM-derived light oil. The concentration of NH4+in the aqueous phase derived from NM is in the range of 1373-1860 mg L−1, and PO43−is undetected due to the precipitation reaction between phosphorus and calcium ions. The HHV values of NM-derived hydrochars are low, ranging from 8.83 MJ kg−1to 9.88 MJ kg−1, compared with those of DA-derived hydrochars,. For natural microalgae, the deashing pretreatment before HTL is of great significance for improving the biocrude yield and quality, as well as the biomass conversion efficiency, nitrogen utilization and the hydrochar quality. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - The ever-increasing demand on highly efficient decentralized power generation with low CO2 emission has made microturbines for power generation in micro gas turbine (MGT) systems popular when running on biofuels as a renewable source of energy. This document presents a state-of-the-art design, and optimization (in terms of design, performance and emission control) of a micro-turbine renewable energy combustor that fits into the existing Bladon 12kWe recuperated microturbine plenum while running on a range of biofuels as it can successfully provide the required power of the MGT. Governing equations for in-depth analysis of the combustor consist of manufacturer empirical data to simulate system-level operation with respect to replacement of the fossil with biofuels. The Model developed and validated at the company's ISO conditions confirms the output power of the new combustor fits the conventional system with slight eco-energy improvements. The modeling of the combustor in a complete microturbine assembly system is performed, then was utilized to further analysis of the microturbine with the designed combustor. The results gave on average 46.7% electrical efficiency, 83.2% system efficiency, 12 kWe electrical power, and 90% recuperator effectiveness at nominal operating conditions of microturbine (MT). Sensitivity analyses evaluate changes in performance with respect to fuel phase (e.g., liquid or gaseous) and design variables (e.g., orientation, shape, and dimensions of combustor), leading to energy optimization of the unit. Findings demonstrate that the combustor in microturbine can meet the target performance specifications of a company conventional diesel microturbine with significant savings. An objective function including both combustor and recuperator technical energy data is defined for finding the best ratio of fuel and air and their flow rates to find the most effective operating points for the operation of MT. Annual time series simulations completed for Coventry, West Midlands, United Kingdom indicate a new combustor can reduce operational costs of diesel fuel combustor by 8%, 2%, 36%, and 25% when supplying bioethanol, DME, biogas, and NG, respectively. Annual operating time of the renewable microturbine combustor at rated capacity included an 11% reduction in exergy loss with biogas fuel relative to diesel fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To promote hydrocracking and isomerization activities of bifunctional catalyst for the conversion of methyl palmitate into jet biofuel, phosphotungstic acid (HPW) loaded on Ni/MCM-41 catalyst enhanced strong acidity to strengthen conversion pathways of hydrocracking and isomerization. In the bifunctional catalytic system, Ni catalyzed hydrodeoxygenation and dehydrogenation of methyl palmitate to produce 1-pentadecene, while acid sites catalyzed further conversion of 1-pentadecene to produce jet fuel range hydrocarbons. Quantum chemistry calculation showed that activation energy in chemisorption process of 1-pentadecene onto acid sites significantly reduced from 203.9 kJ/mol with MCM-41 to 81.6 kJ/mol with HPW. Since bond order of β-scission site in 1-pentadecene over HPW was 0.93% lower than that over MCM-41, and Hirshfeld atomic charge of carbenium ion in 1-pentadecene over HPW (0.0722) was much higher than that over MCM-41 (0.0473), HPW showed better catalytic activities than MCM-41 in both hydrocracking and isomerization processes. The overall selectivity of jet biofuel increased to 86.1% with 47.1% n-alkane selectivity and 8.3% iso-alkane selectivity, due to improved strong acid density from 0.563 to 0.730 mmol/g over 20% HPW-Ni/MCM-41 catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The adverse effects of fossil fuels on the environment and the rapid exhaustion of oil reserves are major concerns in the current global energy demand scenario. As a result, biofuels have emerged as promising alternate fuel due to their renewability, clean emissions and economic advantages over petroleum diesel. Biofuels are obtained from renewable sources such as vegetable oils, animal fat, microalgae, etc. Amongst these, waste cooking oil is considered to be an economical feedstock. This review focuses on different pretreatment methods for waste cooking oil and its lab-scale catalytic transesterification to biodiesel. Homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysts are compared based on reaction conditions, method employed and product yield. The purification steps, biodiesel properties and engine emissions profile are also discussed. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The bio-conversion of fatty oils recovered from chicken waste and Karanja by both enzymatic and microwave-assisted transesterification (MATE) into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were performed in the present investigation. Evaluation of physicochemical properties and yield of biodiesel produced reveals the production of esters from chicken waste oil to be effective than the counterparts obtained from karanja oil. Intensification of transesterification process with chicken waste oil was carried out by employing protic deep eutectic solvents (pDES) for production of high octane methyl esters (HOME). The thermophysical evaluation of synthesized pDES show low values of density, viscosity and refractive index which decrease with the further increase in temperature. The use pDES reduces the mass transfer limitation in formation of biodiesel formation at the lowest acyl acceptor ratio of 1:4. Response surface methodology based optimization for microwave-assisted biodiesel production indicate the usage of the lowest power of 1.4 kW with a minimum volume of pDES (8%) at the optimal time of 25 min yields 96.4% pure biodiesel. The composition of obtained biodiesel was evaluated with GC–MS. The resulting biodiesel obtained is suitable additive to mineral based fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The limited quality of liquid product from the fast pyrolysis of biomass resources is a great obstacle to its large-scale application. Herein, a distributed–centralized agricultural straw pyrolysis (DCP) system with products of high market acceptance was implemented based on the design of a pilot plant and previous research. The system consisted of distributed pyrolysis workshops and a centralized upgrading factory that involved crude oil separation, hydrogen production, and hydrorefining. The crude fuel was separated by distillation before hydrotreatment, which avoids external hydrogen and energy consumption compared with direct hydrotreatment, and the hydrotreatment unit is independent of external hydrogen supply. The environmental impacts of a specific case designed for the northern region of Shandong province in China were evaluated using a life cycle assessment (LCA) method. LCA results indicated that abiotic depletion potential, acidification potential, global warming potential, ozone layer depletion potential, and human toxicity potential were primarily from fuel combustion, electricity, and N fertilizer. Eutrophication potential was primarily from the biomass production stage. Results demonstrated that the GWP of the system was −0.62 kg CO2,eq per kg crop straw. Comparison with the conventional straw incorporation method indicated the economic and social benefits of the DCP system, which is thus expected to be a promising option for crop residue disposal. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Macaw palm is a highly oil-producing plant, which presents high contents of free fatty acids, being a promising feedstock for biofuel production. The current chemical routes are costly and complex, involving highly harsh industrial conditions. Enzymatic processing is a potential alternative; however, it is hampered by the scarce knowledge on biocatalysts adapted to this acidic feedstock. This work describes a novel lipase isolated from the thermophilic fungus Rasamsonia emersonii (ReLip), which tolerates extreme conditions such as the presence of methanol, high temperatures, and acidic medium. Among the tested feedstocks, the enzyme showed the highest preference for macaw palm oil, producing a hydrolyzate with a final free fatty acid content of 92%. Crystallographic studies revealed a closed conformation of the helical amphipathic lid that typically undergoes conformational changes in a mechanism of interfacial activation. Such conformation of the lid is stabilized by a salt bridge, not observed in other structurally characterized homologs, which is likely involved in the tolerance to organic solvents. Moreover, the lack of conservation of the aromatic cluster IxxWxxxxxF in the lid of ReLip with the natural mutation of the phenylalanine by an alanine might be correlated with the preference of short acyl chains, although preserving catalytic activity on insoluble substrates. In addition, the presence of five acidic amino acids in the lid of ReLip, a rare property reported in other lipases, may have contributed to its ability to tolerate and be effective in acidic environments. Therefore, our work describes a new fungal biocatalyst capable of efficiently hydrolyzing macaw oil, an attractive feedstock for the production of “drop-in” biofuels, with high desirable feature for industrial conditions such as thermal and methanol tolerance, and optimum acidic pH. Moreover, the crystallographic structure was elucidated, providing a structural basis for the enzyme substrate preference and tolerance to organic solvents. © Copyright © 2020 Rade, da Silva, Vieira, Milan, de Souza, de Melo, Klein, Bonomi, de Castro, Murakami and Zanphorlin.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is generally collected from different sources, e.g., restaurants as an economic feedstock for biodiesel production. The variations of the quality of the collected oil can create uncertainty in the components of the WCO processed in the biodiesel production process. Therefore, the optimal synthesis of an alkali-catalyzed process considering the uncertainty in the WCO components was studied. The uncertain quality of the WCO feed was modeled using a Gaussian random variable. Then, a stochastic optimization approach was proposed for the design of the plant and a chance-constrained based methodology was adopted as the solution technique of the problem. The effects of the proposed approach on the design and operating parameters were studied. It was shown that the stochastic formulation can provide a safety margin to be able to tolerate the feed quality variations. The economic performance of the plant designed using different scenarios was also compared. It was shown that a plant designed using the proposed stochastic approach has 11.9% extra fixed capital investment and revenue as high as the nominal case. The proposed design can handle a range of feed qualities without major constraint violation which was not the case for designs obtained using deterministic formulation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the application of a sequential process for the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and triacetin (TA) from crambe seeds using methyl acetate (MA) under pressurized conditions. In this process, methyl acetate acts as an extraction solvent and an acyl acceptor for the conversion of the oil to the products of interest. The initial step was pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) performed in a semi-continuous experiment (140 °C and 10 MPa) and material resulting from this step (oil+MA) was directed to a continuous reaction unit. The tests were performed with different pressures, temperatures and residence times. Reactions with commercial oil (CO) were evaluated for comparison. According to the data obtained, increasing the pressure to 20 MPa resulted in higher FAME yields (YFAME) and TA contents for both oils tested. In the reaction with the PLE mixture an increase in temperature favored the formation of FAME and a yield of 66.49 % was achieved at 375 °C after 15 min. The TA content was highest at 325 °C and 5.01 wt% of this coproduct was obtained after 35 min. At the other temperatures, an increase in the TA content was not observed after 15 min. The results obtained in the reactions with CO demonstrated lower than those for the oil obtained by PLE and the reduction of polyunsaturated esters was more evident in the reaction products of this oil. At 375 °C, the increase in residence time provided higher conversion of triglycerides and free fatty acids, as well as higher consumption of intermediate reaction compounds, and enhanced levels of thermal degradation. Thus, the results point to the benefits of using the sequential process to obtain FAME and TA in terms of yield and reduction of the decomposed fraction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, Terminalia bellirica methyl ester (TBME)/biodiesel was formed using potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Methyl ester fuel properties were resolved as per ASTM standard. The attribute of compression ignition (CI) engine such as combustion, performance, and released emission qualities of samples, such as diesel and TBME blends (B10, B20, B30, B50, and B100), were deliberated on a single-cylinder CI engine. By varying the load to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, test data were measured. Using AVL DI GAS 444N (five gas) analyzer dissimilarity in the engine emissions were documented. The results of biodiesel test blends show the similar combustion and performance to diesel curves with minor decrement. However, CO and HC emission diminish when engine fueled with TBME test blends whereas NOx amplifies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this work, olive cake was treated by applying the alkali hydrolysis process in order to produce an adsorbent material for biodiesel purification. The treatment was performed with an aqueous solution of 7.5 wt% NaOH in a solid-to-liquid mass ratio of 1:6 at 90 °C followed by filtration, washing, drying, and sieving. The structure and composition of the delignified residue were investigated by XRD, FT-IR, BET, and SEM analysis to better understand its properties as an adsorbent. The study revealed that using an adsorbent of size <90-μm, 2 wt% adsorbent to biodiesel ratio and contact time of 40 min resulted in higher yield and better fuel properties compared to those purified using water washing method. At the same time, such enhanced properties fulfilled the ASTM 6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards. Therefore, the alkali residue can act as a replacement for commercial adsorbents for biodiesel purification. Further, the adsorption isotherm of this alkali residue was adequately described by the Freundlich model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The major challenge in the synthesis of high-density biofuels is to identify the bio-based source for C-C cyclic compounds and C-C coupling reactions with a suitable selectivity. Herein, we selectively synthesize 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BTO) with a yield of 51.4% from cellulose-derived 5-hydromethylfurfural via a ring-rearrangement reaction. The cellulose-derived route is a more meaningful route for the C-C cyclic compounds compared to the traditional hemicellulose- and lignin-derived routes. Furthermore, BTO is very easily dimerized via a C-C oxidative coupling reaction, showing a yield of 94.4% and selectivity of nearly 100% under environmentally friendly reaction conditions. After hydrodeoxygenation, bicyclohexane is obtained with a yield of 87.4%. This work not only provides a promising route to produce C-C cyclic fine compounds based on a cellulose-derived route, but also shows a highly efficient synthesis route for high-density biofuels via the C-C oxidative coupling reaction.

AB  - The work presented herein demonstrates a hybrid bi-catalytic architecture for the complete electrochemical oxidation of ethanol. The new catalytic system contains pyrene-TEMPO (TEMPO = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-N-oxyl) immobilized on the surface of carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-COOH), and oxalate decarboxylase enzyme (OxDc) immobilized onto a carbon cloth electrode. Electrolysis revealed a stable amperometric curve and an excellent current density value over a duration of 10 h. In addition, the hybrid system immobilized on the carbon electrode exhibits outstanding stability after electrolysis. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC) demonstrate that the hybrid electrode system is able to oxidize ethanol to CO2 after 10 h of electrolysis. Overall, this study illustrates the enhancement of an enzymatic biofuel cell through the hybrid multi-catalytic systems, which exhibit high oxidation rates for all substrates involved in complete ethanol oxidation, enabling the collection of up to 12 electrons per molecule of ethanol. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biogas is a renewable biofuel that contains a lot of CH4 and CO2. Biogas can be used to produce heat and electric power while reducing CH4, one of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, it has been getting increasing academic attention. There are some application ways of biogas; biogas can produce hydrogen to feed a fuel cell by reforming process. Urea is also a hydrogen carrier and could produce hydrogen by steam reforming. This study then employes steam reforming of biogas and compares hydrogen-rich syngas production and carbon dioxide with various methane concentrations using steam and aqueous urea solution (AUS) by Thermodynamic analysis. The results show that the utilization of AUS as a replacement for steam enriches the production of H2 and CO and has a slight CO2 rise compared with pure biogas steam reforming at a temperature higher than 800 °C. However, CO2 formation is less than the initial CO2 in biogas. At the reaction temperature of 700 °C, carbon formation does not occur in the reforming process for steam/biogas ratios higher than 2. These conditions led to the highest H2, CO production, and reforming efficiency (about 125%). The results can be used as operation data for systems that combine biogas reforming and applied to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), which usually operates between 700 °C to 900 °C to generate electric power in the future. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Ethyl furfuryl ether (EFE) considered as potential biofuel can replace petroleum diesel up to 100%. EFE also has efficient blending properties with biodiesel to improve its cold flow properties. Herein we demonstrate efficient synthesis of EFE by etherification of renewable furfuryl alcohol (FAlc) with ethanol over heterogenized heteropoly acids. Cs-exchanged heterogenized heteropoly acid (H3−xCsxPW12O40, x = 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5) was prepared using ion exchange method. The H3−xCsxPW12O40 catalysts were well characterized by the XRD, BET, XPS, NH3-TPAD and pyridine IR. The etherification of renewable FAlc with ethanol over H3−xCsxPW12O40; H1Cs2PW12O40 catalyst having moderate acidity of 786 µmol/g; and B/L of 3.6 have shown 65% EFE yield and low humin formation with after 98% FAlc conversion and catalyst was observed to be reusable for four cycles (fresh + 3 recycles). © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Pretreatment is required for the enhancement of the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass. This study aimed to develop an integrated process producing efficient biochemical conversion of rubber wood waste (RW) into co-biofuels, fermentable sugar and methane. The glucan conversion was enhanced to 93.8% with temperature (210 °C) and delignification by organosolv pretreatment (OS). Thereafter, anaerobic digestion of the residue left after enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted which further improved the methane yield (205.5 LCH4/kg VS) by 33% over hydrothermal pretreatment (154.3 LCH4/kg VS). Delignification during OS plays a key role in improving the degradability of RW resulting in efficient energy recovery (11.23 MJ/kg pretreated RW) which was clearly higher than an integrated process based on hydrothermal (HT) or HT plus process water. Scaled up to a biorefinery, the integrated process based on OS would economically produce fermentable sugar while other value-added chemicals might be produced from the process water. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are regarded as a promising feedstock for biofuels and value-added products but still suffer from an inefficient lipid extraction process. In the present study, a simple and energy-efficient extraction method is demonstrated to extract oil directly from the wet cake (260 g/L) of Nannochloropsis sp. with an assist from the high shear mixer (HSM). After the initial solvent screening, the composition of co-solvent and operating conditions were optimized according to lipid composition and extraction yield. The high shear-assisted extraction process was found to achieve 83% lipid extraction yield (94% for EPA) in 5 min and 95% yield (100% for EPA) in 30 min with minimal amounts of solvents (0.9 ml hexane, 0.39 ml ethanol, and 0.057 ml sulfuric acid for 1 g of wet cell) at 8000 rpm, 55 °C. In comparison with various two-step wet extraction methods, the HSM offers the most economical extraction in terms of specific energy consumption of 1.38 MJ/kg dry cell. Therefore, the HSM can be considered as an attractive alternative to conventional extraction methods, providing a new paradigm of wet extraction for microalgae. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work newly employed monoclinic zirconia (ZrO2) as a promoter to improve CO2 pyrolysis of coffee waste (CW). The CO2 pyrolysis of CW presented the high level of CO production (14.3 mol%) during two stages of non-isothermal (280 to 700 °C) and isothermal pyrolysis (kept at 700 °C). At the same condition, the incorporation of ZrO2 improved the CO generation up to about twice that of CW (29.5 mol%) by possibly inducing more conversion of pyrolytic oil into gas. The characterization results exhibited that ZrO2-impregnated biochar (ZrB) possessed the distinctive surface morphology that highly graphitic- and porous carbon layers were covered by ZrO2 nanoparticle clusters. In a series of adsorption experiments, ZrB composite showed pH-dependent As(V) adsorption and pH neutralization ability. The adsorption proceeded relatively rapid with 95% removal during 120 min in the early stage, followed by 5% removal in the remaining 240 min. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 25.2 mg g-1 at final pH 8. The reusability and stability of ZrB were demonstrated in the 6 consecutive cycles of adsorption/desorption. As a result, ZrO2-assisted CO2 pyrolysis can potentially produce fuel gas with high CO fraction and composite adsorbent suitable for As(V) removal in acidic wastewater. © 2019

AB  - This paper aims at investigating the production of high quality briquettes from olive mill solid waste (OMSW) mixed with corn starch as a binder for energy production. For this purpose, different mass percentages of OMSW and binder were considered; 100%-0%, 90%-10%, 85%-15%, and 70%-30%, respectively. The briquetting process of the raw mixtures was carried out based on high pressures. Physico-chemical and mechanical characterizations were performed in order to select the best conditions for the briquettes production. It was observed that during the densification process, the optimal applied pressure increases notably the unit density, the bulk density, and the compressive strength. Mechanical characterization shows that the prepared sample with 15% of corn starch shows the best mechanical properties. Moreover, the corn starch binder affects quietly the high heating value (HHV) which increases from 16.36 MJ/Kg for the 100%-0% sample to 16.92 MJ/Kg for the 85%-15% sample. In addition, the kinetic study shows that the binder agent does not affect negatively the thermal degradation of the briquettes. Finally, the briquettes characterization shows that the studied samples with particles size less than 100 µm and blended with 15% of corn starch binder are promising biofuels either for household or industrial plants use. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Decision-making on the optimum transition pathway to an energy economy that meets agreed carbon reduction goals in the European Union (EU) by 2050 is challenging, because of the size of the infrastructural legacy, technological uncertainties, affordability and assumptions on future energy demand. This task is even more complicated in transportation because of additional issues, such as minimum travel range at acceptable impact on payload and ensuring hazzle-free long-distance driving in case of regionally varying fuel economies. Biofuels were the first viable option for a large-scale partly renewable fuel economy. E10 and B7 fuels have been successfully and remarkably smoothly introduced, owing to the fact that these are liquid and can be used in conventional combustion engines with little impact on full-tank travel range. In contrast, the decision-making process on biofuels in the EU has been particularly turbulent, with an initially favourable assessment changing into controversial. Here the compatibility between the fuel economies of member states and avoidance of disruptive social effects are considered as essential pre-requisite of a viable transition pathway. Rebalancing three different aspects of the social dimension of sustainability is used to demonstrate that a succession of infrastructures based on liquid fuels, with biofuels as an interlock towards an economy that includes methanol-based eFuel, has the potential to bring continuity, reduce dependence on anticipated technological advances and improve cost management. Awareness of this underexposed prospect of biofuel may positively affect the assessment on its role in a low-carbon fuel economy, potentially influencing the current decision-making process on biofuels. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective cellulose hydrolysis has a huge potential for producing high value-added biomass-based platform chemicals, such as glucose, hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid, and total reducing sugars (TRS). Particularly, a magnetic multifunctional solid acid catalyst (Fe3O4/Cl–MCMB–SO3H) was synthesized by loading the active groups on the magnetic mesocarbon microbead (MCMB) derived from the co-calcination of coal tar pitch and ferroferric oxide, which was applied as a catalyst in the conversion of cellulose into TRS. RESULTS: Given the superior properties of MCMB, a novel magnetic MCMB-based solid acid with cellulose-binding domain (–Cl group) and catalytic domain (–SO3H group) was successfully prepared. Results indicated that this catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity, recyclability and regenerability, and easy separation from the reactant. The acidic densities of –SO3H and –Cl in Fe3O4/Cl–MCMB–SO3H reached 1.77 and 1.32 mmol/g, respectively. The 68.6% TRS yield can be obtained from cellulose at 140 °C for 3 h in distilled water by using Fe3O4/Cl-MCMB-SO3H as the catalyst. The TRS yield still reached 61.1% after the catalyst was used six times. Importantly, through catalyst regeneration, the –SO3H density and TRS yield still reached 1.69 mmol/g and 67.3%, indicating that the catalyst exhibited excellent regenerability. CONCLUSION: Such multifunctional magnetic catalyst would be a promising catalyst in the conversion of cellulose into biofuels, which was attributed to the efficient catalytic performance, magnetism, and excellent recyclability and regenerability. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The utilization of polymeric biorenewables for the synthesis of biofuels and essential chemicals is largely obstructed by their recalcitrant structures and complex product distribution. Here, hydrosilane-mediated hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the furanic mixture 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF), directly derived from cellulosic biomass, can be enabled by heterogeneous Pd-catalyzed dechlorination to exclusively give the biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) in a high overall yield of 72%. Kinetic and isotope labeling studies supported by computational calculations explicitly elucidate the reaction pathways. The initial dechlorination of CMF into acidic species promotes the rapid in situ formation of relatively stable acetalized and etherified furanic intermediates, which not only greatly accelerate the reactivity of the entire HDO process (TOF: up to 1200 h-1), but are also able to significantly get rid of unwanted side reactions. Importantly, this catalytic system can also be applied for the upgrade of various chlorinated carboxides to produce ortho-, meta- and para-substituted arenes with satisfactory yields of 82-99% at 25-45 °C, and the used commercial Pd/C catalyst is highly recyclable.

AB  - Plasma-assisted catalytic cracking is an attractive method for producing biofuels from vegetable oil. This paper studied the effect of reactor temperature on the performance of plasma-assisted catalytic cracking of palm oil into biofuels. The cracking process was conducted in a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD)-type plasma reactor with the presence of spent RFCC catalyst. The reactor temperature was varied at 400, 450, and 500 ºC. The liquid fuel product was analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the compositions. Result showed that the presence of plasma and catalytic role can enhance the reactor performance so that the selectivity of the short-chain hydrocarbon produced increases. The selectivity of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel range fuels over the plasma-catalytic reactor were 16.43%, 52.74% and 21.25%, respectively, while the selectivity of gasoline, kerosene and diesel range fuels over a conventional fixed bed reactor was 12.07%, 39.07%, and 45.11%, respectively. The increasing reactor temperature led to enhanced catalytic role of cracking reaction, particularly directing the reaction to the shorter hydrocarbon range. The reactor temperature dependence on the liquid product components distribution over the plasma-catalytic reactor was also studied. The aromatic and oxygenated compounds increased with the reactor temperature. ©2020. CBIORE-IJRED. All rights reserved. © CBIORE-IJRED. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents 5-hydroxymethylfurfural removal from waste hand paper hydrolysate using activated carbon adsorption. In this context, the effects of adsorbent dosage, initial 5-hydroxymethylfurfural concentration, temperature, and agitation speed on 5-hydroxymethylfurfural adsorption were investigated. Moreover, isotherm and kinetic evaluations were performed using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin models. The experimental data were correlated with zero, first, pseudo-first, and Weber–Morris intraparticle diffusion models. The toxicity of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was determined using the resazurin reduction assay, and the EC50 of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in the hydrolysate was found as 192 mg/L. Most convenient 5-hydroxymethylfurfural adsorption was obtained at 5 g/L AC dosage, 40 °C and 150 rpm agitation speed. The highest 5-hydroxymethylfurfural removal efficiency was 92% at 7 g/L AC dosage. The adsorption data fitted best with the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum uptake capacity of 70.92 mg/g (R2: 0.96). The zero-order reaction kinetic model was the most suitable one among the others inspected. It was determined that intraparticle diffusion was not the rate-limiting step. This study showed that waste hand paper hydrolysate can effectively be detoxified by activated carbon adsorption. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - In this study, a comparative thermodynamic equilibrium calculation of biogas oxy-reforming and oxy-steam reforming processes to produce syngas has been conducted by Aspen Plus simulation software. The effects of temperature (600–800°C), pressure (1−20 atm), and inlet O2/CH4 (0−1.0), H2O/CH4 (0−3.0), and CO2/CH4 (0.3−1.0) mole ratios on the equilibrium compositions of products were determined. The operation of the process was optimized using Gibbs free energy minimization method and statistical approach: response surface methodology (RSM). Optimum operating conditions CH4/CO2/O2= 1:0.51:0.12 at 788°C and 1 atm for oxy-reforming and CH4/CO2/H2O/O2= 1:0.63:0.19:0.07 at 780°C and 1 atm for oxy-steam reforming were obtained to reach maximum H2 yield, CH4 and CO2 conversions by minimizing carbon selectivity to produce syngas for methanol production. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The aim of present work is to improve the efficiency and reduce the harmful exhaust emissions from diesel engines. Neat lemongrass oil was selected as a biofuel, and its physical and chemical properties based on ASTM standards were investigated. The combustion unit was coated with yttria-stabilized zirconia as a ceramic layering material. The initiative behind the thermal barrier coating was to acquire reduced heat losses by ceramic layering the combustion unit with the substance having reduced thermal conductivity, so as to aid in the transformation of accrued heat transformation into constructive work. Conventional diesel fuel was taken as a baseline fuel and investigated in the uncoated engine. Then, the coated combustion unit was installed in the engine and investigated with diesel. Subsequently, lemongrass biofuel was used as operating energy in both coated and normal conditions. Ceramic-layered conditions exhibited high engine efficiency with reduced fuel utilization. The result showed that the coated engine exhibited reduced emissions like smoke, HC and CO with the exception of NOx compared to normal engine. This variation was observed owing to trapping of energy inside the combustion unit and low level of energy transferred to the combustion chamber walls.

AB  - In rural India, unpleasant atmosphere, anthropogenic gas emission, air and soil pollution are caused due to disposal of livestock's wastes (cow dung and chicken waste) in open environment. This study provides zero emission concept for waste disposal and value addition of these wastes for renewable green energy production. In this study, biogas production was carried out with varying proportion of cow dung to chicken waste (1:0, 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 1:2, 3:1 and 1:3) for duration of 40 days. Chlorella pyrenoidosa was cultivated from digestate water and used as co-substrate in digester in varying proportions (2:1:1, 2:1:2 and 2:1:3) to study its role on biogas distribution. The effect of pH, feedstock ratio, time and C/N ratio for biogas production were evaluated. The maximum methane and hydrogen yield was 68% (30th day) and 29% (10th day) for 2:1:2 ratio respectively. The slurry possessed nitrogen (1.7%), phosphate (0.8%) and potassium (0.4%) respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recycling of waste material and production of biofuels are the thrust areas to modern technology. The basic idea behind this work is to regenerate waste silver from X-ray films and to employ them in biofuel production from jatropha oil. Stable silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were prepared using Quercus infectoria (oak gall) and raw Camellia sinensis (tea) extracts. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, UV-visible spectra, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fe-SEM technique. The temperature of the reactions, weight hourly space velocity, and time of reaction decide the yield of biofuel, and the parameters were optimized over Ag NP catalyst. Apart from yield of biofuel, the proportion of gasoline fraction (C5-C9) was also peer monitored. A maximum of 90% conversion of jatropha oil was converted into 85% biofuel with 76% selectivity toward gasoline over Ag NPs. Flash point, fire point, calorific value, cloud point, specific gravity, and viscosity of the gasoline were evaluated and correlated with ASTM D6751 standards. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The synthesis and characterization of Ni-NH2/Mesoporous Silica (MS) catalysts from Lapindo mud for the hydrocracking of waste cooking oil into biofuel has been conducted. The MS was synthesized by the hydrothermal method using CTAB as a template. The functionalization of –NH2 into MS was carried out by the grafting method. The Ni metal was loaded into NH2/MS by wet impregnation. The catalytic activity test was done for hydrocracking of waste cooking oil by using the MS, NH2/MS, and Ni-NH2/MS catalysts. The results of the liquid product of the hydrocracking were analyzed by the gravimetric method and GC-MS. The experimental result showed that the liquid products of the hydrocracking using MS, NH2/MS, and Ni-NH2/MS catalysts were 63.95, 70.32, and 66.44 wt.%. The highest selectivity of the gasoline fraction (34.98 wt.%) was produced by the NH2/MS catalyst and the highest diesel oil fraction (1.52 wt.%) was produced by MS. The NH2/MS catalyst was successfully used as a catalyst in the hydrocracking of waste cooking oil into the hydrocarbons (biofuel). © RASĀYAN. All rights reserved.

AB  - Synthesis of Co-NH2/mesoporous silica bifunctional catalyst for conversion of used cooking oil into biofuel was carried out. Synthesis of mesoporous silica (MS) was done by the hydrothermal method using silica from Sidoarjo mud and gelatin from bovine bone as a template. Weight ratio variation of silica/gelatin was 4, 6, and 8 produced MS4, MS6, and MS8 respectively characterized by FTIR. The MS with minimum gelatin content after calcination (MS8) was identified using FTIR, TEM, and SAA. The impregnation of Co into the MS8 was done by the wet impregnation method and the Co/MS8 catalyst was analyzed using XRF and acidity test with NH3 vapor adsorption. Functionalization of NH2 into the MS8 and Co/MS8 was done by the grafting method and the products were characterized using FTIR. The catalytic activity test in used cooking oil hydrocracking was done by thermal (without catalyst), physical mixture of Co/MS8 and NH2/MS8 catalyst, and Co-NH2/MS8 bifunctional catalyst. The hydrocracking liquid products were investigated by GC-MS. The MS8 had a specific surface area of 666.76 m2 g-1, a pore diameter of 4.9 nm, and a pore volume of 0.46 cm3 g-1. The Co-NH2/MS8 bifunctional catalyst produced the highest liquid product of 97.62 wt.% in the hydrocracking of used cooking oil with selectivity for gasoline and diesel fraction of 3.02 and 46.86 wt.%. © RASĀYAN.

AB  - Three different waste animal fats (bone, chicken, and tallow) have been studied to evaluate whether they could be used as bioliquids according to the European Regulation (EC) No.1069/2009. The analyses showed that they contained an unsuitable amount of free fatty acids (FFA) and impurities content (total sediment) if compared with the standards for power generation (set by UNI 6579:2009), with the exception of tallow fat (class C, UNI/TS 11163:2018). A series of physical-chemical processes already applied at industrial scale have been considered to manage the acid value and the impurities content. The FFA esterification was carried out with methanol, comparing two acid catalysts (sulfuric acid or Amberlyst – 15), followed by neutralization of the residual acidity with two different bases (ammonia solution or solid sodium carbonate monohydrate) when necessary. The final purification has been achieved by treatment with powdered activated carbon. In particular, the bone fat was studied as reference material, having the worst initial physical-chemical characteristics. The UNI/TS 11163:2018 standard would allow to classify the bioliquid from bone fat belonging to class B, while the one from chicken would require further degumming and purification processes to reduce the metals, sulfur, and phosphorus content. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fermentation of gases from biomass gasification, named syngas, is an important alternative process to obtain biofuels. Sequential experimental designs were used to increase cell growth and ethanol production during syngas fermentation by Clostridium carboxidivorans. Based on ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) 2713 medium composition, it was possible to propose a best medium composition for cell growth, herein called TYA (Tryptone-Yeast extract-Arginine) medium and another one for ethanol production herein called TPYGarg (Tryptone-Peptone-Yeast extract-Glucose-Arginine) medium. In comparison to ATCC® 2713 medium, TYA increased cell growth by 77%, reducing 47% in cost and TPYGarg increased ethanol production more than four-times, and the cost was reduced by 31%. In 72 h of syngas fermentation in TPYGarg medium, 1.75-g/L of cells, 2.28 g/L of ethanol, and 0.74 g/L of butanol were achieved, increasing productivity for syngas fermentation. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - As a new kind of solvent and catalyst, the functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) had been successfully used in the conversion of fructose to high value-added biofuels. In this work, a detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculation had been carried out to investigate the interactions of fructose-ILs system. To study the effect of different anions and cations on the interaction with fructose, 25 different kinds of functionalized imidazolium-based ILs were calculated by using M06-2X-D3/6-311 + G** level. It was found that the interaction energies of fructose-anions were higher than those of the fructose-cations. The interaction will become stronger for the fructose and ILs when the alkyl chain of imidazolium-based cations was replaced with a functional group (COOH, OH or HSO3). However, when the length of the alkyl chain increased, it will result in a decrease in interaction energy due to the steric effect. In the anions (Y–SO3), the greater electronegativity of SO3 will lead to strong interaction with fructose. Also, this work simulates the interaction of fructose and ion pairs, with the results showing that hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and π-stacking play an important role in the system. The present study provided basic aids to understand the structures and noncovalent interaction of fructose and functionalized ILs as well as the microscopic mechanism of fructose dissolution in the ILs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A ternary transition metal chalcogenide, containing MoS2, NiS, and Co3S4 (MCNS), and MCNS/reduced graphene oxide (MCNS/rGO) composite were prepared as anode catalysts by a simple hydrothermal process for Urea electro-oxidation. It's expected that rGO with high specific surface area provides superior catalytic performance for MCNS/rGO than MCNS. Also, the synergic effect of Mo, Ni, and Co in the composite accelerates the urea oxidation and enhances the performance of the catalyst. The composites were characterized by field emission electron microscopy, transition electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties of composites were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. The MCNS/rGO demonstrated superior electrocatalytic performance than the MCNS catalyst. The incorporating of rGO into MCNS creates a high electrochemical surface area for urea electro-oxidation that resulted in a higher current density (18 mA cm−2) than MCNS (3.7 mA cm−2) at the presence of 0.6 M urea and the scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The maximum current density obtained 43 mA cm−2 for MCNS/rGO at the scan rate of 70 mV s−1 in room temperature. Also, single cells based on MCNS and MCNS/rGO supplied a maximum power density of 7.7 mW cm−2 and 21.0 mW cm−2 at room temperature, respectively. Hence, MCNS/rGO can be a favorable electrocatalyst for application in the direct urea fuel cell. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, five different bifunctional catalysts (NiO/SAPO-34, NiO/ZSM-5, NiO/USY, NiO/γ-Al2O3 and NiO/SiO2) are characterized and applied for the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Spirulina to produce biofuel. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), ammonia desorption measurement (NH3-TPD) and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) analysis results show that NiO/SAPO-34 and NiO/USY catalysts have the better physical properties compared to the other three catalysts, resulting in the higher bio-oil yields of 59.85 wt% and 59.12 wt%, respectively. Then the bio-oil samples are characterized by elemental analysis, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) and Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). Results indicate that the bio-oil obtained over NiO/USY catalyst has the highest higher heating value (HHV) due to the higher C and H content as well as the lower O and N content. What's more, it contains the most hydrocarbons (20.58%) and light oil components (72.91%) with NiO/USY catalyst. Consequently, NiO/USY is considered to be the best bifunctional catalyst for the HTL of Spirulina. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and supercritical water gasification (SCWG), two effective thermochemical approaches converting biomass into biofuels, have received increasing attention due to their advantages of a fast reaction rate and the use of wet feedstocks without the need for an energy-intensive drying process. In this review, we first summarize the physical properties of the biocrude oil obtained from HTL and then examine the catalytic hydrotreatment of the biocrude oil with or without solvents. The experimental studies on the SCWG of sewage sludge, microalgae, black liquor, and food wastes are analyzed, and the corrosion and salt-deposition problems associated with the solutions are discussed. Finally, to fully comprehend the reaction mechanism of biomass components in hydrothermal media, the conversion of model compounds (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, lipid, protein, and their derivatives) is reviewed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this work five biorefinery scenarios are proposed for the production of five different target products. Two of these scenarios included biodiesel production from Scenedesmus dimorphus microalgae biomass and glycerol valorization through bioconversion into dihydroxyacetone (DHA) with the bacteria Gluconobacter oxydans. Experimental data of microalgae biomass composition were used as inputs to simulate reactive distillation column (RD) and continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for microalgae oil transesterification stage. Optimum methanol/microalgae oil molar feed ratio, catalyst mass and reflux ratio were determined from simulated conditions with the Aspen Plus® V.10.0 Software. The biorefinery with the best economic performance integrated RD and glycerol valorization processes and achieved an internal rate of return (IRR) of 19.8%. The results showed that the combined use of reactive distillation (RD) with the biological oxidation of glycerol into DHA allows economically feasible biorefinery schemes using Scenedesmus dimorphus microalgae biomass as a feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To overcome the mass transfer limit and saponification, acidic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were prepared with p-Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) and quaternary ammonium salts with different carbon chains. The DESs acted as catalysts and reaction media for biodiesel production by transesterification of the cooked and waste vegetable oil. The DESs were characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR and TG. In five DESs, TOAB/p-TsOH was found to enhance the direct contact between methanol and oil and have the highest catalytic activity due to its long carbon chain, which was chosen to further optimize. The suggested conditions given by the response surface methodology model were the reaction temperature of 70.5 °C, catalyst dosage of 24.6 wt%, and a molar ratio of 12.5, which reached the yield of 99.2%. Furthermore, the kinetic study of transesterification was studied and followed the pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction mechanism. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The quality of bio-oil can be improved by conducting biomass pyrolysis either over a core-shell hierarchical zeolite catalyst or in a microwave reactor. However, there is a lack of comparative studies on the individual effects of each factor (e.g., catalysts, reactors) on bio-oil production. In this regard, the catalytic pyrolysis of coconut shell in a fixed-bed reactor and in a microwave reactor using the conventional ZSM-5 and core-shell hierarchical ZSM-5@SBA-15 catalysts was evaluated. With an emphasize on the production of hydrocarbons and phenols, the comparative effect of the core-shell catalyst and microwave reactor was demonstrated. The core-shell catalyst had the dual effect of regulating the bio-oil yield and composition. Compared to conventional ZSM-5 (25) with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 25, the core-shell ZSM-5 (25)@SBA-15 not only increased the bio-oil yield by at least 40%, but also approximately doubled the production of hydrocarbons, irrespective of the reactor type. In contrast, the microwave reactor played a greater role in regulating the bio-oil composition. Irrespective of the catalyst used, the fixed-bed reactor tended to generate phenolic-rich bio-oil, while the microwave reactor sharply reduced the phenol selectivity by at least doubling that for aromatics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of As enriched Pteris vittata L. (PVL, hyper-accumulator biomass) was performed with the recycled aqueous phase as reaction medium, aiming to dispose the biomass with high water content and produce high-quality bio-oil. After three times of aqueous phase recycling at 275 °C, 30 min, the bio-oil yield increased to 30.32% from 21.54% and the higher heating value (HHV, 28.51 MJ/kg) of the bio-oil was higher than that of the bio-oil from HTL with pure water (26.80 MJ/kg). The main compounds detected in bio-oils were phenols, ketones, hydrocarbons, and aldehydes. Acetic acid (17.21–24.77 mg/mL) was dominant in the aqueous phases, resulting in the low pH (4.31–4.89). The heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd) mainly remained in bio-char whereas As was transferred to aqueous phase. Thus, HTL by aqueous phase recycling could be a promising way for PVL treatment to obtain high-quality bio-oil and arsenic recovery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bio-waste slow pyrolysis process is assessed by four indicators to determine its energetic, exergetic, economic and environmental performance. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature (300–800 °C) on these parameters, but also on the biochar, bio-oil and gas production, is analysed. The biochar yield decreased 10.5% and the gas yield increased 17.2% between 300 and 800 °C. The bio-oil yield increased about 2.1% between 300 and 500 °C and decreased about 8% between 500 and 800 °C. Within the temperature range 300–800 °C, the H2, CO and CH4 molar fractions increased 51.4, 6.6 and 0.3%, respectively. CO2 content decreased about 58.3%. The exergy efficiency varied between 81.16 and 85.33% in this temperature range. The exergy-based economic factor revealed that 15.38–19.16% of the total cost was associated with the exergy destruction. The environmental impact was lower at higher temperatures. The recommended temperature range is 300–400 °C to produce biochar, and temperatures of over 700 °C to produce gas. When the interest focus is on the bio-oil, it is recommended to work close to 500 °C. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report herein, Soybean oil was shaped to biodiesel using CaO as heterogeneous catalyst and acetone as cosolvent by employing transesterification reaction at room temperature. In order to prepare active CaO catalyst, waste snail shell was calcined at 800 °C. The prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, TGA, FTIR, XRF, CO2-TPD, XPS and BET. Biodiesel yield of 98% was achieved with the optimized reaction parameters such as acetone loading of 20 wt% of oil, reaction time of 2 h, catalyst loading of 3 wt% and oil to methanol molar ratio of 1/6. Catalyst can be reused up to 11th cycles. It was concluded from the results that this waste material derived heterogeneous catalyst can replace homogeneous catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study was designed to isolate microalgal species which can tolerate severe environmental stresses and can be used for wastewater treatment and biofuel generation. Three different microalgal strains (including Chlorella sorokiniana GEEL-01, Parachlorella kessleri GEEL-02, and Parachlorella kessleri GEEL-03) were isolated from a wastewater treatment plant and Waterwheel Park. The highest growth rate (1.61 OD680nm) was observed for C. sorokiniana GEEL-01 with highest removal of total nitrogen (1.5 mg L−1 day−1) and total phosphorus (1.82 mg L−1 day−1). The biocomponents of the isolated species ranged from 19.47–29.64%, 39.39–52.51%, and 15.08–22.75% for carbohydrate, protein, and lipid, respectively, based on the dry cell weight (DCW). The function groups in microalgal biocompounds were also confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared radiation (FT-IR) spectra, indicated their ability for biofuel generation. Ultimate and proximate analyses of C. sorokiniana GEEL-01 showed high carbon (54.24% DCW) and volatile content (92.69% DCW), compare to other strains. Moreover, it exhibited a significant accumulation of lipid with an increase in the fractions of saturated fatty acids (64.5%), and the major fatty acids were palmitic acid (11.17%), stearic acid (33.86%), oleic acid (9.84%), and linoleic acid (11.56%). Biodiesel derived from the major fatty acids had optimum engine efficiency properties including iodine value (77.34 g I2/100 g oil) and cetane number (54.83). Cultivation of C. sorokiniana GEEL-01 can serve as a dual function of biodiesel feedstock generation and nutrients removal. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mesoporous structure is important to promote mass transport and active site utilization of zeolites when used in reactions involving bulky molecules. However, their conventional hydrothermal synthesis is energy and labor intensive, requiring high-pressure operation, and lengthy heating a huge amount of alkaline liquid. We successfully synthesized new mesoporous zeolites, Meso-ZSM-5, via solid-state crystallization of dry aluminosilicate nanogels. Neighbor developing nanocrystals further joint at edges, creating connected, inter-lattice mesoscale pathway in the finished single crystalline zeolites. Palladium was further loaded on these zeolites to form a bi-functional catalyst (Pd/Meso-ZSM-5). When used in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol, a major bio-oil compound with disappointing conversion and severe coking issue over many HDO catalysts, Pd/Meso-ZSM-5 exhibits superior guaiacol conversion and product distribution when compared with those supported on conventional microporous ZSM-5 counterparts. This is attributed to the improved diffusion and accessibility of active sites inside Meso-ZSM-5 with its unique hierarchically porous structure. Ring saturated hydrocarbons are largely produced at 200 °C when hydrogenation dominates while alkaylated aromatics become major HDO products as deoxygenation becomes favorable at 250 °C. These encouraging results may ignite the wide use of these mesoporous zeolites in many other reactions in both traditional fossil fuel and emerging renewable energy fields. © 2020

AB  - Carbon deposits are well known to cover the γ-alumina surface when exposed to high temperatures in the presence of carbonaceous feedstocks by means of coking and/or fouling mechanisms. Herein, it is demonstrated that this phenomenon, which is extremely undesirable when γ-alumina is used as a catalyst or an adsorbent material, can be successfully exploited for the production of fluorescent carbon-based quantum nanodots (CQDs) under mild conditions of temperatures (250–300 °C) and time (30 min) by using residual biomasses as a carbon source. Specifically, four agro-industrial residues including sugar beet pulp (SBP), grape marc, tomato peels and seeds, and olive pomace have been successfully tested for the synthesis of biomass-based CQDs. Different techniques including UV–vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy (PL), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been applied for the characterization of the as-prepared SBP-based CQDs. Results highlight that the obtained carbon dots exhibit excellent solubility in both water and organic media. In addition, TEM investigations show that such nanoparticles disclose a rather uniform spherical morphology and a narrow size distribution in the range of 2–4 nm. The typical excitation dependent PL emission behavior of carbon-based quantum dots was also observed by PL analysis. Unlike other currently available bottom-up synthesis routes, a high-value by-product is obtained during the synthesis of biomass-based CQDs assisted by γ-Al2O3, i.e., the residual thermally treated biomass, which can be further valorized as a high-quality solid biofuel exhibiting a lower oxygen-to-carbon ratio and, hence, a higher calorific value than the parent biomass. The innovative finding of the present work is that a catalyst can be used to produce CQDs from the volatile matter that is driven off the biomass by heating, which opens up new possibilities of valorization for the off-gas substream coming from other biomass conversion process, like for example slow pyrolysis and carbonization.

AB  - This work involved the utilization of a byproduct from the palm oil refining process as reaction feedstock in a solventless and hydrogen-free catalytic deoxygenation (DO) over NiO–ZnO catalyst in producing diesel-like hydrocarbons as advanced biofuels. The catalyst supporter was synthesized using coprecipitation methods to form highly crystalline meso-macrostructured ZnO particles. The catalyst support was wet-impregnated with different loadings (wt %) of NiO to prepare the NiO–ZnO catalyst. X-ray diffraction patterns verified the persistence of good crystallinity and phase purity of the support, with fine NiO crystallites of size 14–22 nm. Synthesized NiO–ZnO catalysts demonstrated Type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop with mesoporous-macroporous properties. The Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites of NiO–ZnO offer a synergy effect between the active site and catalyst supporter. Both N2 adsorption isotherm and electron microscopy analysis revealed the increase of the crystallite size of the catalyst by increase the NiO loadings. The catalytic activity of the NiO–ZnO catalyst was tested in a semi-batch reactor at 350 °C for 2 h in N2 atmospheric. The oxygenated compounds of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) have been successfully removed to form linear hydrocarbons as green diesel compounds. The synergistic effect between NiO and ZnO significantly enhanced the catalytic activity for substrate DO. The hydrocarbons product yield reached 83.4%, with a diesel range (C11–C17) selectivity of 86.0%. The green diesel, which contains diesel-range hydrocarbons, is suitable as an alternative fuel product for vehicle engine usage. It is possible to be upscaled and compatible with the existed petrochemical refinery facilities. Hence, this is a promising work could be an economic potential and give value added to the palm oil byproduct sectors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel efficient and cost-effective heterogeneous catalyst for the production of biodiesel from transesterification of sunflower oil was prepared through the impregnation of K2CO3 upon the Talc material. The physicochemical features of the catalyst were studied through several characterization analyses. The effect of the K2CO3 loading was investigated by comparing the catalytic activity of various prepared catalysts. Moreover, the effect of the calcination temperature upon the catalytic activity was examined. To maximize the yield of the produced biodiesel fuel, reaction variables such as the reaction time and temperature, catalyst concentration, and methanol: oil molar ratio were optimized. Additionally, the kinetics of the reaction was understudied. Results revealed that the catalyst with 40 wt.% of K2CO3 calcined at 823 K possessed the highest catalytic activity. That is the biodiesel production yield of 98.4 %. Moreover, the kinetic parameters of the reaction rate constant of 0.01558 min−1, Eact of 62.4 kJ/mol, and Eyring-Polanyi's ΔH and ΔS of 59.7 kJ/mol and -103.7 J/(mol K), respectively were obtained for this material. These were revealed under the optimum reaction condition of the catalyst reactor loading of 4 wt.% as well as the methanol: oil molar ratio of 6:1 operated at 338 K. Furthermore, the optimized catalyst was demonstrated to successfully withstand the aforementioned optimum criteria up to five consecutive reaction cycles while experiencing a negligible loss of about 8% of its activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Designing nanostructured silicon, such as in the form of nanoparticles, wires, and porous structures, for high-performance Li-ion electrodes, has progressed significantly. These approaches have largely overcome the capacity fading of silicon electrodes from volume expansion during lithiation/de-lithiation. However, they involve high costs, complex processes, and hazardous precursors. Herein, we propose an electrochemical fabrication of silicon nanowires from waste rice husks via a molten salt process based on electrodeoxidation. The addition of NiO as an electric conductor improved the production efficiency and created pores in the nanowires after washing. The electrically produced high-purity silicon yielded high capacity, and the nanowires provided sufficient free volume to accommodate silicon electrode expansion, resulting in improved cycle life. The converted silicon nanowires from the molten salt process will help develop sustainable energy storage materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion can produce biogas as an eco-friendly energy source, driven by a microbial community-dependent process and, as such, suffer influences from many biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding the players and how they interact, the mechanisms involved, what the factors are, and how they influence the biogas process and production is an important way to better control it and make it more efficient. Metagenomic approach is a powerful tool to assess microbial diversity and further, allow correlating changes in microbial communities with multiple factors in virtually all environments. In the present study, we used metagenomic approach to assess microbial community structure changes in two biodigesters, differing in their biogas production capacity, architecture, and feed. A total of 1,440,096 reads of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region were obtained and analyzed. The main bacterial phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in both biodigesters, but the biodiversity was greater in the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor fed with bovine manure than in the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) fed with swine manure, which also correlated with an increase in biogas or methane production. Microbial community structure associated with biodigesters changed seasonally and depended on animal growth stage. Random forest algorithm analysis revealed key microbial taxa for each biodigester. Candidatus Cloacomonas, Methanospirillum, and Methanosphaera were the marker taxa for UASB and the archaea groups Methanobrevibacter and Candidatus Methanoplasma were the marker taxa for CSTR. A high abundance of Candidatus Methanoplasma and Marinimicrobia SAR406 clade suggested lower increments in methane production. Network analysis pointed to negative and positive associations and specific key groups, essential in maintaining the anaerobic digestion (AD) process, as being uncultured Parcubacteria bacteria, Candidatus Cloacomonas, and Candidatus Methanoplasma groups, whose functions in AD require investigation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hierarchical flower-shaped hollow MgO (f-MgO) spheres were synthesized through an ethylene-glycol-mediated polyol process via hydrothermal reactions. The structure of f-MgO originates from intermediate flower-shaped Mg glycolate through the Ostwald ripening process. The surface of f-MgO consists of uniform petal-like nanosheets that provide high surface area and excellent accessibility to catalytic sites. Also, the f-MgO microsphere can prevent aggregation and stacking problems of nanosheets and control a surface area for catalytic activity. The morphology and structure of f-MgO were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The density of basic catalytic sites was derived from CO2-temperature-programmed desorption measurements. The f-MgO exhibits a basic site density of 0.5134 mmol/g, which is much higher than that of commercial MgO (c-MgO, 0.0288 mmol/g). Experimental results for the fatty acid methyl ester revealed that the catalytic strength of f-MgO as a heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production is greater than that of c-MgO. The maximum biodiesel conversion efficiency of f-MgO from canola oil is 93.4%, which is greater than the value of 91.4% for c-MgO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Development of bioelectrodes with multiple virtues, such as biocompatibility, flexibility, versatility and cost-effectiveness, remains a huge area of research for multiple applications. Here, we delve upon fabricating carbon electrodes using a desktop PCB printer in a cost-and-time efficient manner (less than 2 min). Such printed carbon paste electrodes have been incorporated to develop an enzyme-based glucose biofuel cell to power various low-power biomedical devices and for biosensing. The bioelectrodes were prepared by electrodepositing gold nanorods followed by the immobilization of suitable enzymes. These bioelectrodes were tested for their electrochemical behavior and was setup as a Direct Electron Transfer (DET)-based enzymatic biofuel to be amenable for various physiological fluids, like tears, human saliva, whole blood and blood serum, due to its biocompatibility and efficiency. It delivered maximum energy of 3.18 µW/cm2 and 8.8 µW/cm2 from tears and human serum, respectively. These fabricated electrodes have huge potential to be incorporated in miniaturized devices as a renewable energy source for implantable and self-powered bioelectronics. © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - Direct electron transfer (DET) between oxidoreductases and electrodes is crucial for understanding the fundamental features of redox proteins as well as developing mediator-free bioelectronics devices. Bioelectrocatalysis with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent dehydrogenases is promising for both biosensors and biofuel cells. However, a limited number of studies have reported DET between PQQ in the enzyme and the electrode. Here, the PQQ domain (containing only the PQQ cofactor) of the fungal PQQ-dependent pyranose dehydrogenase from Coprinopsis cinerea, was studied in DET with various electrodes. A 2-mercaptoethanol self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-coated polycrystalline gold electrode was found to give excellent DET for the PQQ domain, resulting in 10-times the catalytic current density compared to bare glassy carbon. The amount of immobilized PQQ domain was determined to be 8.2 ± 0.4 pmol/cm2 by using a 27 MHz quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM), suggesting an approximate protein monolayer formation on the SAM modified gold surface. To improve current density, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were modified on top of polycrystalline gold electrodes. Importantly, high catalytic current densities of 1.6 mA/cm2 for the oxidation of L-fucose were achieved under optimized conditions. Together, these results demonstrate highly efficient DET to PQQ in the active site of the fungal PQQ-dependent dehydrogenase. Thus, our PQQ-domain/SAM/AuNPs coated polycrystalline gold electrode could serve as an exquisitely sensitive biosensor and a highly active sugar oxidizing anode for biofuel cells. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of lignin can obtain valuable products such as bio-oil, bio-chemical, syngas, and biochar. In this study, two types of lignin known as brown solid from the byproduct of cellulosic ethanol fermentation and commercial dealkaline lignin from the papermaking process were used for pyrolysis in a 3-L batch reactor at 300–450 °C. The product composition in the liquid and gas phases were analyzed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/Flame-ionization detector/thermal conductivity detector (GC-MS/FID/TCD). Increasing the N2 flow rate to 150 mL/min was sufficient to increase the production of bio-oil/bio-organics up to 15% for brown solid pyrolysis. In contrast, the biochemical production during dealkaline lignin pyrolysis was not sensitive to the change of the N2 flow rate. The amount of biochar produced in the pyrolysis (~60%) slightly changed at various pyrolysis temperature and gas flow rate, which could be due to the relatively low pyrolysis temperature that was insufficient to decompose the lignin. The GC-MS analysis also revealed that C7–C8 compounds, which represented the phenolic compounds, were the most abundant in the liquid products. Kinetic models of the pyrolysis were established based on the thermogravimetric analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Crude bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis of woody biomass was subjected to catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reaction with various metal catalysts (Ni/C, Ni/SBA-15, Ni/Al-SBA-15, NiMn/SBA-15, Pt/C) using for continuous-flow reaction system at 300 °C under H2 pressure. Gas, immiscible liquid phases (light oil and heavy oil), and char was obtained as the primary products. Heavy oil yield was in the range 27.9–42.3 wt%, while char production was 2.3–11.0 wt%, both less than the corresponding figures for batch processing. Hydrodeoxygenation enhanced the fuel properties of bio-oil, yielding higher HHV (32.8–38.0 MJ/kg) than bio-oil (15.7 MJ/kg) and heavy oil produced in a batch type reactor (24.4–34.5 MJ/kg). Additionally, Miscibility of crude bio-oil and upgraded heavy oils with gasoline and diesel were also evaluated with three emulsifiers (Span60, Brij58, or IGEPAL CO-520). Crude bio-oil was hardly emulsified, whereas upgraded heavy oil was well emulsified with Span60. Increasing Span60 concentration also enhance the miscibility of heavy oil and diesel. An emulsion of heavy oil and diesel was stable for 6 months, suggesting that the heavy oil produced might have potential use in blends with diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production from the esterification of stearic acid with ethanol catalyzed by the mesoporous ZrO2/SiO2 catalysts which successfully synthesized by surfactant-assisted sol-gel auto-combustion method. These catalysts were characterized by various physico-chemical techniques such as XRD, BET surface area measurement, HR-TEM and NH3-TPD. The mesoporous catalyst prepared with cationic surfactant (ZrSiOC) showed a maximum BET surface area and pore volume. Interestingly, the ZrSiOC catalyst exhibited the largest acidity value among all catalysts. The results showed that the mesoporous ZrO2/SiO2 catalysts prepared with cationic (ZrSiOC) and non-ionic (ZrSiOT) surfactants demonstrated higher stearic acid conversion than those with anionic (ZrSiOS) or without surfactant (ZrSiO). Significantly, the ZrSiOC and ZrSiOT catalysts exhibited the highest conversion of 69.2% and 63.1% at 120 °C after 3 h, respectively. Additionally, it was observed that the conversion increased extremely with increasing the reaction temperature giving a maximum conversion of 76.9% at 125 °C by using the most active catalyst (ZrSiOC). Interestingly, the ZrSiOC catalyst displays suitable recycling as it kept performance of 72.5% after five recycle runs without significant lack in performance. Moreover, the kinetic study confirmed that esterification follows pseudo first-order equation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electromicrobial production aims to combine electricity and microbial metabolism for solar and electrical energy storage. We have constructed molecule to reactor models of highly engineered electromicrobial production systems that use H2 oxidation and direct electron transfer (DET). We predict electrical-to-biofuel conversion efficiency could rise to 52% with engineered in vivo CO2 fixation. H2 diffusion at ambient pressure requires areas 20 to 2,000 times the solar photovoltaic (PV) area supplying the system. Agitation can reduce this below the PV area, and the power needed is negligible when storing ≥1.1 megawatts. DET systems can be built with areas ≤ 15 times the PV area and have low energy losses even with natural conductive biofilms and can be even smaller if the conductivity could be raised to match conductive artificial polymers. Schemes that use electrochemical CO2 reduction could achieve efficiencies of almost 50% with no complications of O2 sensitivity. © 2020 The Authors
We have developed a theory that lets us calculate the efficiency of microbes that absorb electricity and store CO2 as biofuels with greater efficiency than photosynthesis. We outline 10 development scenarios including re-engineering direct electron uptake microbes with high-efficiency CO2 fixation; scaling up H2-oxidizing microbe systems to store megawatts of electricity; engineering direct electron uptake microbes to make highly conductive artificial biofilms to enable high power density electricity storage; and engineering microbes that assimilate electrochemically reduced CO2 with electron uptake. © 2020 The Authors
The penetration of renewable electricity is increasing significantly making low-cost, large-scale energy storage essential. At the same time, the need for CO2 sequestration and hydrocarbon fuels are likely to grow for decades to come. Photosynthesis gives a template for solar energy and CO2 storage at enormous scale, but its inefficiency sets the stage for land competition. We have developed a theory that lets us calculate the efficiency of microbes that absorb electricity and store CO2 as biofuels with greater efficiency than photosynthesis. We outline 10 development scenarios including re-engineering direct electron uptake microbes with high-efficiency CO2 fixation; scaling up H2-oxidizing microbe systems to store megawatts of electricity; engineering direct electron uptake microbes to make highly conductive artificial biofilms to enable high power density electricity storage; and engineering microbes that assimilate electrochemically reduced CO2 with electron uptake. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The production of sustainable and biodegradable products, for energy or material use, is becoming important for local economies. Thus, biorefineries can play an important role in sustainable development at regional levels and therefore the search for feedstocks with multiple uses is vital. The goal of this research was to assess the implementation of Cynara Cardunculus L. oil as the basis of a biorefinery for biodiesel and biolubricant production, proposing the main steps for this purpose. The chemical reaction selected for biodiesel and biolubricant production was transesterification, using methanol and other more complex alcohols. The optimization of each step was carried out, assessing the yield by gas chromatography. Once the optimum conditions were selected, the main characteristics of the biofuel or biolubricant were measured, paying attention to viscosity and oxidative stability. As a result, Cynara Cardunculus L. oil could be a suitable feedstock for a biorefinery, as long as some antioxidants are added in final products, especially to increase its oxidative stability in biodiesel (whose value was 1.35 h). Concerning biolubricant production, the yields were acceptable (exceeding 92%) and the products showed variable viscosity values (from 8.6 to 18.85 cSt), implying a desirable diversification of production depending on demand. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Crude glycerol was introduced into hydrothermal liquefaction of wastewater-grown algae, Galdieria sulphuraria, to improve yield and energy recovery of bio-crude oil, and to enable solvent-free oil/aqueous phase separation by gravity. Co-hydrothermal liquefaction of 5, 12.5, and 20 wt% solids loading algae and crude glycerol at 350 °C for 30 min gave bio-crude oil yields of 58.8 ± 0.8, 65.5 ± 1.5 and 56.2 ± 1.5 wt%, compared to 14.6 ± 0.1 wt% and 58.1 ± 0.8 wt% for algae alone and crude glycerol alone, respectively. Solvent-free bio-crude oil was upgraded into a liquid biofuel at a yield of 48.1 ± 0.8 wt% and higher heating value of 43.7 ± 0.1 MJ/kg. Incorporation of the co-hydrothermal liquefaction experimental yields and solvent-free phase separation into a techno-economic model for biofuels from hydrothermal liquefaction of algae resulted in a calculated minimum fuel sell price of $0.38–1.24 per liter gasoline equivalent, suggesting substantial potential for co-hydrothermal liquefaction of low-lipid algae with crude glycerol as a competitive strategy for economic 3rd generation biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biorefineries are a new concept in chemical manufacturing in which naturally occurring, sustainable biomass resources such as forestry and agricultural waste are converted to diverse fuel and chemical product streams, akin to the processing of non-renewable fossil fuels by petrochemical refineries. Biomass derived from waste agricultural and forestry materials or non-food crops offers the most easily implemented and economical solutions for transportation fuels, and the only nonpetroleum route to organic molecules for the manufacture of bulk, fine, and speciality chemicals necessary to secure the future needs of society. The successful implementation of biorefineries can address concerns over dwindling oil reserves, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources and associated climate change, and will be underpinned by catalytic processes to facilitate the co-production of platform chemicals and biofuels. Catalysis is a central theme in sustainable chemistry, lowering energy and resource requirements while minimising waste production. In contrast to fossil-derived crude oil, which has low oxygen content, the high oxygen and water content of biomass feedstocks presents challenges for their utilisation and requires innovations in catalyst and process design for the selective conversion of these hydrophilic, bulky feedstocks into fuels or high-value chemicals. This article highlights how methods to control porosity, solid acid and base character, and surface hydrophobicity are essential components of a toolkit for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for biomass processing. © CSIRO 2020.

AB  - Biological CO2 fixation by microalgae coupled with value-added product creation appears to be a sustainable approach in microalgae-based industry. However, the major constraint of this process is the low solubility of CO2 in water which limits CO2 fixation ability by the microalgae. Therefore, the current work aimed to improve the CO2 fixation efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris through the introduction of sequential-flow bubble column photobioreactor system. The influence of various cultivation parameters towards the growth, carbon fixation efficiency, lipid accumulation, and fatty acid profile of C. vulgaris were explored. Experimental results showed that microalgae cultivated under optimized conditions attained the highest biomass productivity (0.83-0.86 »g/L/day) as compared to the control conditions. Meanwhile, the highest lipid content (50.4 % for SFB-PBR1) was recorded when the microalgae were cultivated in the spent medium. In addition, the CO2 fixation efficiency by microalgae in the sequential-flow photobioreactor system under the optimized condition was 3.78-fold higher than a single column mode (control). In short, the present work had demonstrated that cultivation conditions and photobioreactors configuration were equally important for an effective carbon capture process via microalgae cultivation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, argemone mexicana seed was used for the production and characterization of biofuel and biochar using thermochemical conversion process. Thermal pyrolysis of Argemone mexicana seed was carried out in a semi- batch reactor in the temperature range of 400-600 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, maximum liquid product yield of 52 % was obtained at 550 °C. The obtained biofuel was analysed according to its fuel properties, functional groups and compounds present in it. The calorific value of the obtained biofuel was found to be 6542 kcal/kg which is less than diesel fuel. The morphological characteristics of bio-char was determined using SEM and BET analysis which revealed their macroporous surface with a less surface area of 0.208 m2/g. The calorific value of obtained bio-char was 2765.43 kcal/kg which is in the comparable range with solid fuel. The obtained results shows that the Argemone mexicana seed can be used as a potential feedstock of renewable fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Abstract: 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), as one of the most important renewable platform-chemicals, is a valuable precursor for the synthesis of biofuels and bio-products. In this work, hydrothermal carbon (HC), with a large specific surface area and plenty of oxygen-containing functional groups, was derived from sucrose via a hydrothermal method, which could facilitate the dispersion and anchoring of Ni. The selectivities to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) were tuned by modulating Ni nanoparticle sizes and Ni/NiO ratios. The yield of BHMF can reach 88% with its selectivity up to 94% on the reduced 10%-Ni/HC catalyst with big Ni particle size; while the total yield of DMF + DMTHF is up to 94.6% at full HMF conversion on the calcined 5%-Ni/HC catalyst with small Ni particle sizes and balanced Ni/NiO ratios; for the calcined Ni/HC catalysts, the synergistic effect between Ni(0), favoring H2 activation and hydrogenation, and NiO, facilitating the hydrogenolysis of C–O bonds, could promote the selective hydrogenolysis of HMF to biofuel production (DMF and DMTHF).

AB  - In this work, the high yield self-N-O doped hydrochar had been prepared through the hydrothermal carbonization of microalgae in the aqueous bio-oil. The effects of temperature, residence time and the ratio of Chlorella and bio-oil on the solid yield were investigated. The results showed that the hydrochar had excellent thermal stability and abundant nitrogen and oxide functional groups, its solid yield reached 199.33%. After activated by KOH at high temperature, the hydrochar was transformed into a porous carbon material with high nitrogen content. The porous carbon showed high CO2 absorption of 5.57 mmol/g at 0 °C and 1 bar. It also exhibited a high specific capacitance of 216.6F/g at 0.2 A/g and a good electrochemical stability with 88% capacitance retention after consecutive 5000 cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The influence of palm oil biodiesel content on the cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of particle- and gas-phase diesel vehicle emissions was investigated. The emissions were collected on-board of a EURO IV diesel truck, fuelled with mixtures of 10% (B10), 20% (B20) and 100% (B100) of palm oil biodiesel, under real driving conditions. Organic extracts of the particulate matter (PM) and gases were characterised for 17 PAH (including EPA priority) and used for the biological assay. Increasing biodiesel content in the fuel mixture results in a decrease in the PM and PAH emission factors, both in the particulate and gas-phase. The majority of the PAH are present in the gas-phase. The mutagenic potencies, in TA98 bacteria, are higher for B20 in both phases, whereas the mutagenicity emission factor, that takes into account the lower emission of PM and PAH, is not significantly different between the fuels. Higher direct mutagenicity (TA98 + S9) is observed in all the tested fuels, indicating the action of carcinogenic compounds other than non-substituted PAH. The gas-phase extracts present higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in lung epithelial cell A549, which may be related to the higher PAH content in the gas-phase. The increase in biodiesel content have a different impact on cytotoxicity, being larger in the gas-phase and lower in the particle-phase. This indicates that pulmonary toxicity may be higher for the gaseous emissions, due to the role of different toxic compounds compared to the PM. The adverse biological effects when biodiesel content increases are not consequent with the reduction of the PAH characterised, indicating that other toxic compounds are more relevant. Further investigations to identify these compounds are required in order to update and focus the efforts regarding emission targets and controls. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - CaO is efficient in catalyzing transesterification for biodiesel production, but its industrial application is inherently restricted by active sites leaching. To address this drawback, CaO is decorated into wollastonite to prepare the stable Ca/wollastonite catalyst. Microwave-assisted transesterification is used to produce biodiesel from palm oil, which effectively accelerates the reaction rate and improves the conversion efficiency. The Ca/wollastonite-0.8 catalyst with the mass ratio of CaO to wollastonite of 0.8 performs well with the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 97.59%. Also, this catalyst is highly stable, where the FAME yield of 87.30% could be obtained for the fifth reused cycle. CaO is evenly dispersed on the wollastonite surface and the total basicity is high to 0.281 mmol g−1. Meanwhile, transesterification parameters are optimized by response surface methodology with central composite design (RSM-CCD) and the maximum FAME yield of 98.46% is achieved at reaction temperature of 64.2 °C, molar ratio of methanol to palm oil of 15.54 and mass ratio of catalyst to palm oil of 9.21 wt% for 3 h. Besides, the mass ratio of catalyst to palm oil is the primary variable. Wollastonite is demonstrated to be feasible to enhance the stability of CaO in catalyzing transesterification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The presented experimental investigation aims at providing a microscopic insight into the flame characteristics of the conventional (light/heavy diesel), a renewable fuel (waste cooking oil), and its blends with light/heavy diesel oils. A hyperspectral camera is used to provide detailed information on fuel reactivity and radiation intensities within the flame zones via the analysis of the C2 and CH radiation emissions. The experiments cover four equivalence ratios (Φ) of 0.63, 0.75, 0.96, and 1.1. A coaxial disc stabilized burner having a twin air jet atomizer is employed. The flame images are taken in the open atmosphere and the assessment of the combustion efficiency is obtained through the measurements of the cooling load inside a cylindrical combustor. The calculated values of the spatial cross-sectional average flame temperatures along the different flames are compared with the corresponding values obtained by a type S thermocouple. The processing of the hyperspectral flame images proves to be an extremely useful tool to define the location, size, and characteristics of the flame zones. The burning of HDO/WCO blend at near stoichiometric conditions appears to be a viable renewable alternative to burning standalone HDO. The burning of a standalone waste cooking oil must be avoided. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We investigate the use of rendered poultry fat, beef tallow, and soybean oil as ready sources of free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides (TG) for conversion to renewable diesel. Laboratory scale saponification and decarboxylation experiments using trilaurin, lauric acid, protein, and water as a model compound representing rendered animal fat are reported and combined with chemical process simulations, and thermodynamic and kinematics equations to build energy and material balances where Ab Initio methods are used for estimating missing data to build a life cycle inventory model. Life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for producing renewable diesel from soybean oil, poultry fat, and beef tallow fall between −8.7 and 47.2 g CO2 equivalent/MJ even considering induced land use change when soybean oil is used as feedstock. Emissions vary depending on co-products and allocation rules used, which can affect compliance with energy policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Combined soda and enzyme-catalyzed extrusion pretreatment (bioextrusion) of barley straw was evaluated for bioethanol production. The effect of the enzyme dose on the bioextrudate was for the first time analyzed. The enzyme load (5–10 FPU/g DM) had a significant impact on the solubilization of sugars during bioextrusion and also affected the saccharification yield at long incubation times. The solids concentration (17–25% w/w) in the extended incubation of bioextrudates was also studied and its effect on the carbohydrate conversion and sugar release was evaluated. An enzyme dose of 10 FPU/g dry matter and a solids content of 20% (w/w) were selected as the best conditions to submit the bioextrudate to a liquefaction plus simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (LSSCF) process using a modified S. cerevisiae strain. At the end of the process, an ethanol concentration close to 38 g/l was obtained, corresponding to a production of 15.8 g ethanol/100 g raw barley straw. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein we report the synthesis of Ru/Zr/Al-SBA-15 catalysts, their characterization by XRD, FT-IR, BET, ICP, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, HAADF-STEM, XPS, TPR, TPD, TGA/DTA and UV-DRS techniques and their catalytic activity towards the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) at ambient H2 pressure under non-corrosive conditions. As the product 2-Methyl Tetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) obtained in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid is a promising platform chemical having wide applications in the production of biofuels, fine chemicals and green solvents, this research work carries significance. The characterization studies revealed the presence of Zr species well dispersed on SBA-15 and upto 5% loading of Ru over Zr/Al-SBA-15 preserved the mesoporous structure of bare SBA-15. Among the different catalysts, 5% Ru/Zr/Al-SBA-15 (ISM) exhibited the highest catalytic activity with 97% conversion and 84% selectivity towards MTHF in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid without using any solvent. 5% Ru/Zr/Al-SBA-15 catalyst was also synthesized by other methods such as traditional impregnation method (TIM) and ultrasonication method (USM). 5% Ru/Zr/Al-SBA-15 (ISM) showed different morphologies depending on the preparative methods and their catalytic performances were found to be dependent on the method of synthesis. The recyclability of the best catalyst was tested upto five cycles and there was not much variation in terms of conversion and selectivity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A clean and highly efficient catalytic system for the synthesis of ethyl levulinate (EL) from kitchen waste was developed. A heterogeneous catalyst (Sn/ZrP–SO3H) was prepared and the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst were evaluated by pyridine FT-IR. Other physicochemical properties were also characterized using XRD, SEM, FT-IR, XPS, BET, NH3-TPD. The yield of EL obtained was 49.27%, when glucose was used as the starting material and subjected to 170 °C for 10 h in the presence of the solid acid catalyst, Sn/ZrP–SO3H. The prepared catalyst was also combined with several metal triflates; (Al(OTf)3, Fe(OTf)3, Sm(OTf)3) to form a catalytic system for the efficient preparation of EL from kitchen waste. Sn/ZrP–SO3H/Al(OTf)3 had superior activity compare to other catalyst combinations. In single factor experiments, the yield of EL reached 52.52% after heating at 170 °C for 4 h. In addition, four-factor and three-level experiments were performed using response surface methodology (RSM) to analyze the interaction between each factor. The optimal reaction conditions predicted by the model (163 °C, 7.63 h, 20 mg Al(OTf)3, 40 mg Sn/ZrP–SO3H and 79.98 mg of kitchen waste) estimated a maximal yield for EL of 51.24%. The experimental yield of EL however was 52.03% which confirms the reliability of the model. This work provides a cleaner production technology for the synthesis of the high value-added chemical EL, and a sustainable route for the utilization of kitchen waste. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel solid acidic polymeric ionic liquid catalyst was synthesized for ethyl esters production via the esterification of oleic acid with ethanol, normally transesterification of Pistacia chinensis oil with diethyl carbonate. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis was used to characterize the products and optimize the reaction conditions to provide P. chinensis oil derived ethyl esters in 93% yield. Kinetic studies performed at different temperatures revealed that the conversion of P. chinensis oil to an ethyl ester follows first order reaction kinetics. The properties of ethyl esters were determined, found to meet the ASTM D6751-02. Results revealed that the catalyst had perfect utility after several runs without much loss in activity. The mild conditions (1:5) P. chinensis oil:diethyl carbonate molar ratio, 300 wt% PIL loading, 120 °C, 400 rpm, 6 h, recyclability of the catalyst make the proposed synthesis a sustainable method for the development of ecofriendly, cost-effective biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a novel p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) based deep eutectic solvent (DES) was prepared successfully for biodiesel production by one-pot method. The DES consisting of PTSA and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) exhibited the best catalytic activity among the five prepared DESs. Central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology were conducted to investigate reaction factors. The maximum oil extraction yield 90.33 % and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) conversion yield 96.53 % were obtained under the optimal condition: microwave temperature 72 °C, microwave power 500 W, time 40 min, the ratio of liquid to seed weight 27:1 and DES amount 11 wt%. The chemical composition of FAMEs and main physical-chemical properties were investigated and the results demonstrated that the prepared biodiesel product possessed high quality. The study showed the prepared DES was a green and efficient catalyst for rapid and simultaneous extraction and transesterification seed oil for biodiesel production by one-pot method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae are attractive feedstocks for biofuel production and are especially suitable for thermochemical conversion due to the presence of thermally labile constituents—lipids, starch and protein. However, the thermal degradation of starch and proteins produces water as well as other O- and N-compounds that are mixed-in with energy-dense lipid pyrolysis products. To produce hydrocarbon-rich products from microalgae biomass, we assessed in situ and ex situ catalytic pyrolysis of a lipid-rich Chlorella sp. in the presence of the HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst over a temperature range of 450–550°C. Results show that product yields and compositions were similar under both in situ and ex situ conditions with benzene, toluene and xylene produced as the primary aromatic products. Yields of aromatics increased with increasing temperature and the highest aromatic yield (36.4% g aromatics/g ash-free microalgae) and selectivity (87% g aromatics/g bio-oil) was obtained at 550°C. Also, at this temperature, oxygenates and nitrogenous compounds were not detected among the liquid products during ex situ catalytic pyrolysis. We also assessed the feasibility of a two-step fractional pyrolysis approach integrated with vapor phase catalytic upgrading. In these experiments, the biomass was first pyrolyzed at 320°C to degrade and volatilize starch, protein and free fatty acids. Then, the residual biomass was pyrolyzed again at 450°C to recover products from triglyceride decomposition. The volatiles from each fraction were passed through an ex situ catalyst bed. Results showed that net product yields from the 2-step process were similar to the single step ex situ catalytic pyrolysis at 450°C indicating that tailored vapor phase upgrading can be applied to allow separate recovery of products from the chemically distinct biomass components—(1) lower calorific value starch and proteins and (2) energy-dense lipids. © Copyright © 2020 Shirazi, Viamajala and Varanasi.

AB  - The rapid consumption of conventional fossil fuels has caused a sharp decline in their reserves and led to climate change. Exploitation of renewable energy sources especially bio-fuels such as 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), methylfuran (MF), ?-valerolactone (GVL), etc. has both environmental and economic benefits. In the present work, diverse Co-based bimetallic catalysts were prepared and used for catalyzing hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass-derived oxygenates. Co5Zn1Ox, obtained by the incorporation of Zn species into the Co metal catalyst especially with a Co/Zn molar ratio of 5, could enhance the catalytic performances obviously compared to the sole Co catalyst. For example, the DMF, MF, and GVL yields reached up to 94, 98, and 77% during the catalysis by Co5Zn1Ox, which were much greater than 74, 0, and 23% for the Co catalyst, respectively. The enhanced performances of Co5Zn1Ox stem from the strong interaction between the Co and Zn species. Specifically, the presence of ZnO could stabilize Co2+ species, by offering electrons to Co species and creating oxygen vacancies, resulting in Co5Zn1Ox showing the highest adsorption amounts of furfural and furfuryl alcohol compared to Co1Zn1Ox and Co7Zn1Ox catalysts. Moreover, the catalyst showed good universality and reusability, and the HDO of 5-HMF to DMF proceeded in a true heterogeneous manner. The present work is believed to extend the application of bimetallic catalysts to the synthesis of bio-fuels and utilization of biomass materials. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Spent coffee grounds (SCG), an agro-industrial residue produced after brewing of coffee beans contains appreciable amounts of lipids (~16 wt%). One way of valorizing SCG is to subject it to dilute acid hydrolysis for the production of sugar-rich hydrolysate and lipid-dense post-hydrolysis residue. The post-hydrolysis spent coffee grounds (PHSCG) contains substantial amounts of lipids (~26 wt%), making it necessary to gather lipid extraction kinetics and equilibrium data for process and equipment design. The effects of solvent-to-solid ratio (4–20 mL g−1) and temperature (30–60 °C) on the kinetics and equilibrium of lipid extraction from PHSCG using hexane as solvent was investigated. To appropriately describe the lipid extraction system, various kinetic models were fitted, with multi-step models best representing the extraction process (R2 ≥ 0.99). Regardless of extraction temperature and SSR, washing step equilibrium is reached at a very short extraction time (&lt;10 min) and over 90% of the lipids can be extracted in at least 1 h. Extraction of lipids from PHSCG required less amount of solvent to extract and recover the same amount of lipids present in SCG saving up to 40% of the solvent required for lipid extraction from SCG. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is highly desirable but challenging to develop a one-pot process for the transformation of fructose into 2,5-bis(isopropoxymethyl)furan (BPMF), a promising biofuel component, because a cascade sequence involving dehydration, reduction, and etherification requires multifunctional acid catalysts. Herein, we propose a facile and firm assembly of Zr/2-methylimidazole (2-MeIM) coordination polymer over USY zeolite (USY@ZrCP) through N-Al bonds formed by the condensation of 2-MeIM and the hydroxyls on USY surface at room temperature. USY@ZrCP possesses an abundance of strong Lewis acid sites with suitable amount of Bronsted acid sites, which are mainly attributed to the highly dispersed Zr(IV) species and the hydroxyls over USY@ZrCP, respectively. Unexpectedly, USY@ZrCP could offer BPMF yield up to 82.6% from fructose in isopropanol by the integration of dehydration, Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction and etherification in a one-pot strategy. This work proposes a novel approach to prepare highly efficient and robust solid acid catalyst for the catalytic valorization of biomass-derived carbohydrates and their derivatives. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hydrotreating of vegetable oils offers a green alternative to oil-derived fuels and raw hydrocarbon materials, usually obtained from oil. In contrast to sulfided catalysts, which contaminate the product with sulfur, carbide-based catalysts are able to produce clean hydrocarbons. A NiMo carbide-based catalyst, supported on nanometric γ-alumina was prepared, characterized by X-ray crystallography, Nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The oxidation temperatures and acidity were also determined. Tests were performed in a batch-type reactor for the hydrotreatment of soybean oil at 360, 380, and 400°C and 4.5 MPa. Liquid samples were analyzed by gas chromatography with a mass spectra detector. The reaction rate was calculated showing that reactant concentration did not influence deoxygenation rates, nor did the catalyst revealed a significant change in the activity. The product composition was extensively characterized, proving that reaction temperature greatly influences the concentration of aromatic, unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons, as well as chain size distributions. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The yield and quality of lipids extracted from microalgal biomass are critical factors in the production of microalgae-based biodiesel. The green microalga Chlorella homosphaera, isolated from Beira Lake, Colombo, Sri Lanka was employed in the present study to identify the effect of chlorophyll removal and cell disruption methods on lipid extraction yield, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile and quality parameters of biodiesel; including cetane number (CN), iodine value (IV), degree of unsaturation (DU) and high heating value (HHV). In the first section of this study, chlorophyll was removed from dry microalgae biomass prior to lipid extraction. Through the analysis of FAME profiles, it was observed that chlorophyll removal yielded biodiesel of enhanced quality, albeit with a lipid loss of 44.2% relative to the control. In the second section of the study, mechanical cell disruption strategies including grinding, autoclaving, water bath heating and microwaving were employed to identify the most effective method to improve lipid recovery from chlorophyll-removed microalgae biomass. Autoclaving (121 °C, 20 min sterilization time, total time 2 h) was the most effective cell disruption technique of the methods tested, in terms of lipid extraction yield (39.80%) and also biodiesel quality. Moreover, it was observed that employing cell disruption subsequent to chlorophyll removal has a significant impact on the FAME profile of microalgae-based biodiesel, and consequently served to increase HHV and CN although IV and DU did not vary significantly. © 2020 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Cytochrome P450 OleT is a fatty acid decarboxylase that uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to catalyze the production of terminal alkenes, which are industrially important chemicals with biofuel and synthetic applications. Despite its requirement for large turnover levels, high concentrations of H2O2 may cause heme group degradation, diminishing enzymatic activity and limiting broad application for synthesis. Here, we report an artificial enzyme cascade composed of glucose oxidase (GOx) and OleTSA from Staphylococcus aureus for efficient terminal alkene production. By adjusting the ratio of GOx to OleTSA, the GOx-based tandem catalysis shows significantly improved product yield compared to the H2O2 injection method. Moreover, the co-assembly of the GOx/OleTSA enzymes with a polymer, forming polymer-dual enzymes nanoparticles, displays improved activity compared to the free enzyme. This dual strategy provides a simple and efficient system to transform a naturally abundant feedstock to industrially important chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, HZSM-5, Al-SBA-15 and Al-SBA-15/HZSM-5 were adopted as supporting materials for the nickel-based catalysts used in hydrodeoxygenation process. Incipient wetness impregnation method was employed to load nickel species onto these materials. The physicochemical characterization was carried out using advanced instruments. The effect of composition of nickel-based catalysts on hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction was studied. Support materials of nickel-based catalyst have a significantly impact on HDO activity. The highest selectivity (67.9%) of propyl-cyclohexane was obtained over nickel based Al-SBA-15/HZSM-5 catalyst, and nearly all the eugenol was completely hydrodeoxygenated after reaction. The impact of light fractions existed in bio-oil on phenols upgrading process was investigated. The conversion of eugenol mixed with light fractions reached nearly 100% for all the reactions. Eugenol mixed with light fractions as reactant could reduce ring break reaction during hydrodeoxygenation process. The selectivity of alkanes remained nearly unchanged after adding ethylene glycol into the reactant. However, the selectivity of propyl-cyclohexane was significantly decreased by mixing furfural or acetic acid with eugenol as reactant. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of present study is to investigate the effect of different solvent on lipids extraction efficiency and biodiesel production under optimized process parameters from tannery sludge. Results have revealed that standard chloroform-methanol method has a higher lipid yield of 22.8% (w/v), corresponding to 98.5% (w/v) of lipid extraction efficiency at optimal conditions. The optimized conditions for in-situ transesterification procedure were: catalyst concentration of 3% (v/v), sludge solid to methanol ratio of 1: 25 (w/v), reaction temperature of 60 °C, and time of 12 h, achieving 89.7% yield of biodiesel. Further, the FAME profile of biodiesel analyzed by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR, and GC–MS showed the purity of higher than 97.12%. The physicochemical properties of 5% blended biodiesel were found to be within the ASTM standards. This work concluded the production of biodiesel from sludge could be techno-economically viable due to extremely high lipids yield and low-cost of this feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oil refinery sludges from tank bottoms, oil-water-solid separators and dissolved air-filtration range around 0.2 w% of crude oil processed and are classified as hazardous wastes. Worldwide data manifest large disparities in composition (10–20% hydrocarbons, 5–20% solids -including heavy metals- and water) and heating values. Treatment by landfarming/bioremediation, hazardous waste incineration, anaerobic digestion or disposal in hazardous waste landfills bears high costs and environmental impacts. Substitution of fossil fuels (petcoke) by refinery sludges in cement plants is investigated. Main impacts are quantified: energy efficiency and clinker production level, plant operation and capacity constraints, halogen presence in plant circuits, inclusion of alkalis and heavy metals in cement and atmospheric emissions. It is found that clinker losses may exceed one tonne clinker/tonne sludge. Environmental concerns, mainly increased NOx and Hg emissions, may restrict substitution. Guidelines are obtained for identifying efficient blends with renewable biogenic fuels (urban or agro-industrial biowaste). Blends of sludge from local refineries with renewable fuels are assessed for a local cement plant using about 1.65 × 105 tonnes fossil fuels/year (70% petcoke, 30% coal) to produce 1.5 × 106 tonnes clinker/year. Superior customer-tailored blends are identified that avert clinker losses, maintain operability and tolerable inclusions, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve atmospheric pollutant emissions. © 2020

AB  - BACKGROUND: Microalgae are considered a third–generation raw material for biofuel production. This work compared the conversion of the extracted oil from the freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus rubescens via transesterification for the production of biodiesel. Considering the cost of biodiesel production, heterogeneous catalysts present a significant advantage because of their stability and reusability. Biochar and modified biochar with H2SO4 were used as catalysts. RESULTS: Biochar (BC) was pyrolyzed at 850 °C, under limited oxygen conditions, and was activated by sulphuric acid (H–BC). The catalyst: oil mass ratios tested were from 0 to 0.7:1 for BC, and from 0 to 1:1 for H–BC. The biochar sample exhibited a strong buffer capacity in the pH range between 7 and 5.5, while the acid treated biochar was strongly acidic and could neutralize a significant amount of bases. The produced methyl esters are almost the same in all cases examined. BC samples gave better transesterification results, as far as it concerns the conversion, compared to H–BC. CONCLUSION: The enhanced activity of the BC with mass used may be correlated with the basic minerals presented on the biochar surface. Raw biochar gave better conversion results (47%) during transesterification compared to the modified biochar with H2SO4 (24%) with better catalyst to molar ratio, 0.7:1 and 0.1:1, respectively. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Bacterial production of gaseous hydrocarbons such as ethylene and methane affects soil environments and atmospheric climate. We demonstrate that biogenic methane and ethylene from terrestrial and freshwater bacteria are directly produced by a previously unknown methionine biosynthesis pathway. This pathway, present in numerous species, uses a nitrogenase-like reductase that is distinct from known nitrogenases and nitrogenase-like reductases and specifically functions in C–S bond breakage to reduce ubiquitous and appreciable volatile organic sulfur compounds such as dimethyl sulfide and (2-methylthio)ethanol. Liberated methanethiol serves as the immediate precursor to methionine, while ethylene or methane is released into the environment. Anaerobic ethylene production by this pathway apparently explains the long-standing observation of ethylene accumulation in oxygen-depleted soils. Methane production reveals an additional bacterial pathway distinct from archaeal methanogenesis. Copyright © 2020 The Authors,

AB  - A new cascade type cathodic catalyst containing hemin and glucose oxidase (GOx) is suggested for enhancing the performances of enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs). In the cathodic catalyst, the upper GOx layer generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), and then actual cathodic current is determined by H2O2 reduction reaction (HRR) catalyzed by hemin, using the pre-produced H2O2. The reaction potential of hemin is positively shifted by the formation of coordinate bond between its core ions and amine groups, meaning that that of HRR deciding reduction onset potential of the catalyst is positively shifted. As materials providing the ligand containing amine groups, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and imidazole propionic acid (IPA) are considered. According to evaluations, the reaction potential for HRR is favorably moved as the amounts of available ligand and coordinate bond increase. When IPA is applied, the reduction onset potential for HRR is shifted from 0.4 to 0.51 V and reduction reaction rate also increases from 55 to 86 μAcm−2. Based on that, the EBC using catalyst containing IPA shows superior performances, such as maximum power density of 66 μWcm−2 and open circuit voltage of 0.65 V. © 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - A series of novel mixed metal oxide catalysts with the incorporation of copper as a dopant supported on zinc-alumina (Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3) for biodiesel production have been synthesized and characterized. ZnO is a solid base catalyst, but its weak surface basic properties have limited the usage of ZnO in the transesterification reaction of refined used cooking oil to biodiesel. To further improve the catalytic activity, the copper dopant was loaded by the wetness impregnation method. Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst of 10:90 wt% dopant-to-based (ZnO) ratio with calcination at 800 °C exhibited the highest biodiesel yield (89.5%) at optimum reaction conditions (65 °C, 10 wt% catalyst loading, 1:20 oil-to-methanol mol ratio and 2 h reaction time). The N2 adsorption-desorption and CO2-temperature programmed desorption analyses indicated that the material possessed a high surface area (149 m2/g) and high basicity (3.7424 mmol/g). The mechanistic study confirmed the catalytic reaction followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) model, which involves the initial adsorption of reactants molecules on active sites of the catalyst surface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, the design of nanocomposite (NC) formulations that consist of metal enzyme cofactors, highly conductive carbon materials, DIET activators, to boost AD biogas production from anaerobically incubated cattle manure are investigated and discussed. Three different NC formulations were designed and synthesized: zinc ferrite (ZnFe), ZnFe with 10% carbon nanotubes (ZFCNTs), and zinc ferrite with 10% C76 fullerene (ZFC76). The structure and morphology of the nano-additives were investigated via x-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). NCs were supplemented to lab-scale biodigesters containing organic slurry. Biogas production was monitored daily and compared to blank biodigesters for 50 days. The maximum methane enhancement was obtained for ZnFe, which promoted methane production to 185.3%. ZFCNTs and ZFC76 showed a positive impact on the hydraulic retention time and enhanced methane production to 162% and 145.9%, respectively compared to the blank reactors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Stringent emission norms impose challenges to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in reducing diesel engine emissions. Implementing renewable fuels as alternative energy sources in diesel engines leads to increased emission levels particularly NOx. In this work, performance, combustion, and emission parameters from a diesel engine powered with grapeseed oil biodiesel (GSBD) was investigated. Nano additive emulsions of cerium oxide (CeO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) at 100 ppm each were added to grapeseed oil biodiesel. To enhance the NOx reduction task further, an advanced technology called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system was used. With easy availability of aqueous urea, careful injection, and distribution of the reductant solution, a paradigm change was brought about in NOx reduction technology. The experiments were carried out with and without SCR for better understanding and investigation. The percentage reduction of NOx emission by adding cerium oxide and zinc oxide emulsion blends were 4.19% and 13.13%, respectively. The overall reduction in NOx emission were 74.16% and 80.06% with SCR for cerium oxide and zinc oxide emulsion blends. The research conclusions make grapeseed oil biodiesel conceivable as an effective alternate fuel for diesel engines without any engine modifications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The upgrading of biomass derivatives to biofuels and chemicals through transfer hydrogenation (TH) is attractive relative to direct hydrogenation, especially when the hydrogen donors can be sourced renewably. Here we report the first process that uses glycerol, a renewable waste material from biodiesel processing, as a hydrogen donor in the catalytic TH of a biomass-derived platform chemical, levulinic acid, to selectively afford γ-hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV) and lactic acid (LA). GHV can be further converted to γ-valerolactone (GVL), a widely used platform chemical. Levulinic acid can be used directly, without esterification, which is typically needed for transfer hydrogenation. The process is efficiently facilitated by robust iridium N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with sulfonate functional groups at low catalyst loading (1–10 ppm), affording quantitative conversion of levulinic acid in the presence of KOH to GHV, with &gt;100,000 TON in 2 h at 150 °C, using 1 ppm catalyst. The most prolific catalyst, [(NHC-SO3-)2(CO)2Ir]Na, can also facilitate transfer hydrogenation from other hydrogen donors, such as 2-propanol, potassium formate, and most notably, ethanol, which can also be derived from renewables. Ethanol is a highly efficient hydrogen donor for levulinic acid using this catalyst, affording &gt;7,000 turnovers in 2 h using 10 ppm catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a crucial process for the synthesis of biofuels from renewable biomass. Here, several bimetallic Ni-M/Nb2O5 catalysts (M = Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized and evaluated in the HDO of biofuel precursors (aldol adduct of furfural with acetone) to liquid alkane and it was found that Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 has the best performance (86.5% yield of octane and 5.1% yield of heptane). Various characterization techniques show that Ni-Cu alloy is formed over the Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 catalyst, which may have the main active metal sites. Moreover, the Ni-Cu alloy has more sites for the adsorption-activation of H2, leading to the high activity. During the HDO process, the ring-opening of the intermediate butyl-tetrahydrofuran (BTHF) and the conversion of octanol are two rate-determining steps. The kinetic study confirms that the ring-opening of BTHF over Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 is more favorable than that over Ni/Nb2O5. More importantly, the Ni-Cu alloy significantly restrained the undesirable decarbonylation due to the weak adsorption of carbonyl, which was key for the efficient production of Cn alkanes. This work provides an in-depth understanding of the role of Ni-Cu alloys and new insights into the design of non-noble metal catalysts for the HDO of biofuel precursors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - As to metallosilicate zeolites, ions with larger size such as Ta5+ in the gels greatly retarded their crystallization during the hydrothermal synthesis, affording long-winded synthesis periods, up-limited framework-substituted metal contents, or even frustrated outcome. An efficient hydrothermal synthesis strategy for metallosilicate, in this case of Ta framework-substituted *BEA zeolite, via structural reconstruction was proposed to stride the gap. The Ta content in our developed Ta-Beta-Re-50 zeolite achieved up to 5.48 % (Si/Ta = 52), breaking through the limitation of Ta contents for conventional method (Si/Ta &gt; 100). Additionally, this Ta-Beta-Re zeolite possessed nanosized crystals (20–40 nm) and short crystallization time (8 h), significantly improving space-time yields of practical zeolite production. Through spectroscopic study, it was confirmed that the existence of zeolite structural units intensively facilitated the formation of nucleation and crystal growth. This innovative Ta-Beta zeolite demonstrated high catalytic performances for oxidation desulfurization, far outperforming traditional fluoride-mediated Ta-Beta-F, which was ascribed to its excellent diffusion properties and incredible high isolated Ta contents. Additionally, the catalytic performance of Ta-Beta-Re could be regenerated after simple calcination and the deactivation may be caused by pore blocking of organics. This work provides a new method for rationally design and construction of metallosilicate materials with high activity for catalytic oxidation applications, which can bridge the conceptual and technical gap between periodic trends and zeolite material synthesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A series of nickel–alumina catalysts promoted by copper containing 1, 2, and 5 wt. % Cu and 59, 58, and 55 wt. % Ni, respectively, (symbols: 59Ni1CuAl, 58Ni2CuAl, 55Ni5CuAl) and a non-promoted catalyst containing 60 wt. % Ni (symbol: 60NiAl) were prepared following a one-step co-precipitation method. They were characterized using various techniques (N2 sorption isotherms, XRD, SEM-EDX, XPS, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD) and evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil using a semi-batch reactor (310 ◦C, 40 bar of hydrogen, 96 mL/min hydrogen flow rate, and 100 mL/1 g reactant to catalyst ratio). The severe control of the co-precipitation procedure and the direct reduction (without previous calcination) of precursor samples resulted in mesoporous nano-structured catalysts (most of the pores in the range 3–5 nm) exhibiting a high surface area (192–285 m2 g-1). The promoting action of copper is demonstrated for the first time for catalysts with a very small Cu/Ni weight ratio (0.02–0.09). The effect is more pronounced in the catalyst with the medium copper content (58Ni2CuAl) where a 17.2% increase of green diesel content in the liquid products has been achieved with respect to the non-promoted catalyst. The copper promoting action was attributed to the increase in the nickel dispersion as well as to the formation of a Ni-Cu alloy being very rich in nickel. A portion of the Ni-Cu alloy nanoparticles is covered by Ni0 and Cu0 nanoparticles in the 59Ni1CuAl and 55Ni5CuAl catalysts, respectively. The maximum promoting action observed in the 58Ni2CuAl catalyst was attributed to the finding that, in this catalyst, there is no considerable masking of the Ni-Cu alloy by Ni0 or Cu0. The relatively low performance of the 55Ni5CuAl catalyst with respect to the other promoted catalysts was attributed, in addition to the partial coverage of Ni-Cu alloy by Cu0, to the remarkably low weak/moderate acidity and relatively high strong acidity exhibited by this catalyst. The former favors selective deoxygenation whereas the latter favors coke formation. Copper addition does not affect the selective-deoxygenation reactions network, which proceeds predominantly via the dehydration-decarbonylation route over all the catalysts studied. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This research has developed a soap-derived biokerosene (SBK) production process to produce hydrocarbons for use as an aviation alternative fuel. The SBK production process was developed in keeping with the conditions of the available technologies and investment while leveraging the advantage of an abundant national feedstock resource that is found in Indonesia in particular, and tropical emerging countries in general. The production of SBK comprises two main processes: saponification and thermal decarboxylation to convert coconut oil into hydrocarbons. The composition of SBK was analyzed and compared to that of Jet A1. Additionally, the critical properties of SBK and several of its blends with Jet A1 were measured and collated with the established jet fuel standard. The results show that SBK can be blended directly with Jet A1 at up to 10 vol.% to meet selected properties: distillation temperature, flash point, density, net heating value, viscosity, freezing point, smoke point, and oxidation stability. From this study, it can be concluded that SBK is feasible for use as a drop-in aviation fuel when blended with conventional jet fuel. Thus, the SBK production is highly promising for use in tropical countries to produce aviation biofuels, given the appropriate technologies and feedstock resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The goal of this research is to develop a partial delignification process for corn stover that simultaneously improves accessibility of enzymes to cellulose and recovers hydroxycinnamic acids (HCA) as a value-added product from the lignin. We recover HCAs from corn stover with a mild base extraction employing sodium hydroxide, ethanol, and water. The total HCA yield was 33.5 wt% on a lignin basis and approximately 6 wt% on a corn stover basis. This partial delignification pretreatment allowed 85 wt% of total available glucose to be recovered by enzymatic hydrolysis using an enzyme loading that is only 10% of the level recommended for recovering sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. Technoeconomic analysis indicates that recovery of HCAs could reduce the selling price of ethanol by $0.26 L-1. That part of the lignin not removed as HCA becomes a co-product of enzymatic hydrolysis suitable for thermochemical processing into additional biofuels and/or chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Large-scale commercialization of drop-in biofuel technologies requires a deeper understanding of the molecular structure of biocrude oils and their compatibility with fossil crudes in terms of molecular interactions that govern miscibility. For the first time, the compatibility of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) derived biocrude obtained from pinewood with straight-run gas oil (SRGO) was comprehensively investigated by theoretical prediction using Hansen double sphere plots and experimental confirmation from miscibility studies to achieve a biofeed compatible for coprocessing at refineries. The Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) for biocrude, biocrude components (residue and light and heavy distillate fractions), and SRGO were determined by plotting a three-dimensional Hansen solubility sphere plot based on the experimental solubility data obtained on their solubility studies in 38 different solvents. The compatibility of HTL biocrude oil with SRGO was verified from the solubility distance (Ra) and relative energy difference (RED) values obtained from the center of their Hansen spheres and difference in HSPs, respectively, in a Hansen double sphere solubility plot. The experimental data obtained on miscibility studies confirmed that pyridine, cyclohexanone, and a pyridine-cyclohexanone solvent mixture (1:1) occupy a well-defined Hansen space and show fitting to HSPs of the biocrude-SRGO blend, improve the overall compatibility of the blending mixture, and display a maximum miscibility of 72%. To correlate the compatibility with the molecular structure, the compatibility of light, heavy, and residual fractions obtained by fractional distillation of HTL biocrude (pinewood) was also evaluated with SRGO using the Hansen double sphere plot, and a close agreement with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results as well as the experimental data on miscibility studies was verified. Furthermore, the comprehensive estimation of the detailed composition and chemical nature of biocrude and light, heavy, and residual fractions by the means of elemental (CHN/O), GC-MS, and GC × GC analysis was also presented. Additionally, the correlation between compatibility and interactions within chemical functionalities of blend components was established by analyzing the contribution of aromatic, aliphatic, and oxygen containing functional groups to the miscibility using quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy. The present study reports a mixing strategy to assess the compatibility of biocrudes, heavy distillate fractions, asphaltenes, residues, and polymers with existing petroleum infrastructure for the cost-effective biorefinery process to balance economic and environmental considerations.

AB  - The present paper investigates the feasibility of using acetone (ACE) in triple blends with fossil diesel (D) and straight vegetable oils (SVOs) as alternative fuel for diesel engines. In this respect, ACE is selected as an oxygenated additivedue to its favorable propertiesto be mixed with vegetable oils and fossil diesel. In fact, the very low kinematic viscosity allows reduces the high viscosity of SVOs. ACE’s oxygen content, low autoignition temperature, and very low cloud point and pour point values highlight its possibilities as an additive in D/ACE/SVO triple blends. Moreover, ACE can be produced through a renewable biotechnological process, an acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation from cellulosic biomass. The SVOs tested were castor oil (CO), which is not suitable for human consumption, and sunflower oil (SO), used as a standard reference for waste cooking oil. The viscosity measurement of the ACE/SVO double blend was considered crucial to choose the optimum proportion, which better fulfilled the specifications established by European standard EN 590. Moreover, some of the most significant physicochemical properties of D/ACE/SVO triple blends, such as kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point, and calorific value, were determined to assess their suitability as fuels. The blends were evaluated in a conventional diesel generator through the study of the following parameters: engine power, smoke emissions, and fuel consumption. Despite the low calorific value of ACE limits its ratio in the mixtures due to engine knocking problems, the experimental results reveal an excellent performance for the blends containing up to 16-18% of ACE and 22-24% of SVO. These blends produce similar engine power as to fossil diesel, but with slightly higher fuel consumption. Considerable reductions in emissions of air pollutants, as well as excellent cold flow properties are also obtained with these triple blends. In summary, the use of these biofuels could achieve a substitution of fossil diesel up to 40%, independently on the SVO employed. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This study makes use of tannery waste to produce biodiesel using a nano-sulfated zirconia catalyst (ferric-manganese-doped sulfated zirconia). It was through a modified wetness impregnation method that the catalyst was prepared which was then characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The catalytic property of the synthesized catalyst was determined by using it to produce biodiesel from tannery waste sheep fat. A study was carried out to find the effect of the different parameters affecting the process. Optimized conditions of 15:1 methanol to fat molar ratio and catalytic loading of 8 wt% at 65 °C with a stirring rate of 400 rpm for a reaction duration of 300 min gave a maximum yield of 98.7 wt%. The performance of the catalyst during recycling was analyzed by conducting reusability study. The reused catalyst gives a maximum yield above 90 wt% up to five cycles with a catalyst recovery of 88 wt%. ASTM D6751 standard was used to compare the analyzed fuel properties of the biodiesel. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present experimental study aims to examine the impacts of various fueling modes of operation on the particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and n-alkanes (C16–C30), and volatility and oxidation reactivity of particulate matter (PM) emitted from a diesel engine fueled with a ternary fuel (80% diesel, 5% biodiesel and 15% ethanol (D80B5E15, volume %)) under four engine operating conditions. Four fueling modes, including diesel, blended, fumigation and combined fumigation + blended (F + B) modes were tested using pure diesel fuel for diesel mode and a constant fuel content of D80B5E15 for the blended, fumigation and F + B modes to create the same condition for comparing their impacts on the parameters investigated. The average results illustrate that both blended and fumigation modes can reduce the PAHs (−78.4% and −31.3%), benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (−81.7% and −38.9%), n-alkanes (−46.5% and −21.5%) and non-volatile substance fraction (−25.1% and −11.1%), but increase the high-volatile substance fraction (12.8% and 6.9%) and oxidation reactivity rate (34.0% and 4.9%), respectively compared to those of the diesel mode. While the effect of the blended mode on the parameters investigated is stronger than the fumigation mode. And the F + B mode has the effects in between the results of the blended and fumigation modes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The incompatibility of the aldol condensation reaction of furfural (FF) and upstream FF conversion limits the direct production of cyclic biofuel intermediates (C10, C15) from lignocellulosic biomass. Herein, an efficient catalytic system comprised of choline chloride-formic acid-SnCl4·5H2O (ChCl-Fa-SnCl4) has been developed, which gives high intermediate yields of 92.03, 88.24, and 56.78%, respectively, from the one-pot conversion of FF xylose and corncob with cyclopentanone (CPO). These data are higher than the reported intermediate recovery of 61.55% observed using FF/CPO and a solid acid catalyst (Nafion resin) under solvent-free conditions and 44% using xylose/acetone and CrCl3/VCl3/[BMIM]Cl. Moreover, Sn(IV) and H+ ions in ChCl-Fa-SnCl4 contribute toward catalyzing the aldol condensation reaction, and far-infrared spectroscopy indicated that deep eutectic solvents may strengthen the coordination of Sn(IV) to the carbonyl group. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present work mainly focuses on the development of heterogeneous catalysts from fishbone, loaded with sodium hydroxide for transesterification of biodiesel. The catalyst was developed using a two-step process involving the calcination of fishbone at 900 °C, followed by a hydrothermal process with a sodium hydroxide-loaded (NaOH) solution. The synthesized heterogeneous catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and BET surface area analysis. The transesterification of waste cooking palm oil (WCO) with BC-NaOH shows a maximum yield of up to 98% for 2.5 wt.% catalyst loading, 1:9 oil:methanol molar ratio at a temperature of 65 °C for a reaction time of 1.5 h. The enhanced catalytic activity is due to the high base active site density of hydroxyl groups from hydroxyapatite, β- tricalcium phosphate, and sodium hydroxide. A gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) was performed to determine the conversion of oil to biodiesel. The reusability of the catalyst was confirmed from the consistency in the biodiesel yield obtained in up to 7 cycles. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As articulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), limiting atmospheric concentration of CO2 is a major goal of the world. Reduction of CO2 to CO in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) using biomass gasification is a potential method of limiting atmospheric CO2 concentrations while producing energy, biofuels, or both. Gasification of biomass using CO2 requires high temperatures. Catalysts have the potential to limit the reaction temperature. Non-edible corn stover is one of the plentiful biomass and is used in this study. Corn stover char samples with a particle size less than 150 μm are mixed with iron nitrate through a wet impregnation technique. Experiments are conducted at three different temperatures (1110 K, 1160 K, and 1210 K) and four different pressures (1.3 atm, 4 atm, 7 atm, and 10 atm). In-line sampling is employed to measure CO mole concentrations in the exhaust gases at a 1 Hz rate. Measurements of the reactor wall temperature are used for gas temperature correction. CO mole production increases with increasing pressure and temperature. A significant finding of this study is that pressure increases above 4 atm do not show any benefits in CO mole production or char conversion. The use of catalyst allows gasification temperature reduction by 100 K, which may be beneficial for longer reactor life. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Constantly decreasing fossil resources and exceeding energy demands are the most alarming concerns nowadays. The only way out is to develop efficient, safe, and economical biomass processing protocols that can lead toward biofuels and fine chemicals. This research is one of such consequences involving the deconstruction and conversion of wheat straw carbohydrate constituents into reducing sugars via one-pot reaction promoted by Lewis acidic pyridinium-based ionic liquids (PyILs) mixed with different metal salts (MCl). Various parameters such as the type of metal salt, loading amount of metal salt, time, temperature, particle size of biomass, and water content which affect the deconstruction of wheat straw have been evaluated and optimized. Among the studied ionic liquid (IL) and metal salt systems, the best results were obtained with [BMPy]+ CoCl−3. The dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay was used to determine the percentage of total reducing sugars (TRS) generated during treatment of wheat straw. The deconstructed wheat straw was characterized with various analytical tools, that is, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses. The IL–metal salt system was recycled for subsequent treatment of wheat straw. Statistical parameters were calculated from analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the 0.05 level of confidence. © Copyright © 2020 Naz, Uroos, Asim, Muhammad and Shah.

AB  - The catalytic deoxygenation of biomass to produce renewable carbon energy addresses major concerns of limited energy sources. In particular, the second-generation biodiesel by selective deoxygenation possesses a higher cetane number, lower cloud point, and higher oxidation stability compared to the fatty acid ester-based biodiesel, and therefore, can be fed directly to the current diesel engines. In present work, we address the significant concerns of cost-effectiveness, high hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) selectivity, modest hydrogen environments, and solvent-free condition using high surface area silica-alumina-supported cobalt oxide nanoparticles as a catalyst to produce fuel-grade hydrocarbons from fatty acid-based feeds that are palm oil and jatropha oil. The catalytic performance is tested for methyl stearate to achieve the best conversion efficiency with remarkable deoxygenation selectivity. The HDO selectivity was as high as 87% at 250 °C and 30 bar H2 pressure, whereas moderate HDO selectivity with relatively higher cracking was observed at 300 °C and 2 bar H2 pressure. Remarkably, the HDO selectivity was comparable in the absence of solvent. The catalyst is recyclable with low metal leaching during the deoxygenation. The use of non-noble metal catalysts under solvent-free conditions offers facile production of fuel-grade hydrocarbons. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Efficient degradation of lignocellulosic biomass has become a major bottleneck in industrial processes which attempt to use biomass as a carbon source for the production of biofuels and materials. To make the most effective use of the source material, both the hemicellulosic as well as cellulosic parts of the biomass should be targeted, and as such both hemicellulases and cellulases are important enzymes in biorefinery processes. Using thermostable versions of these enzymes can also prove beneficial in biomass degradation, as they can be expected to act faster than mesophilic enzymes and the process can also be improved by lower viscosities at higher temperatures, as well as prevent the introduction of microbial contamination. Results: This study presents the investigation of the thermostable, dual-function xylanase-glucuronoyl esterase enzyme CkXyn10C-GE15A from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii. Biochemical characterization of the enzyme was performed, including assays for establishing the melting points for the different protein domains, activity assays for the two catalytic domains, as well as binding assays for the multiple carbohydrate-binding domains present in CkXyn10C-GE15A. Although the enzyme domains are naturally linked together, when added separately to biomass, the expected boosting of the xylanase action was not seen. This lack of intramolecular synergy might suggest, together with previous data, that increased xylose release is not the main beneficial trait given by glucuronoyl esterases. Conclusions: Due to its thermostability, CkXyn10C-GE15A is a promising candidate for industrial processes, with both catalytic domains exhibiting melting temperatures over 70 °C. Of particular interest is the glucuronoyl esterase domain, as it represents the first studied thermostable enzyme displaying this activity. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Conversion of manure into energy products via hydrothermal liquefaction was studied. Hydrothermal reactions, conducted at different temperatures (200-300 °C), were compared on the basis of conversion yields, carbon and energy recoveries and product quality. The results demonstrate how reaction temperatures affect the relative production of biocrude oil and hydrochar. Comprehensive analyses of both biocrude oil and hydrochar suggest that decarboxylation was the dominant mechanism involved in the reaction and was enhanced with temperature. With a relatively high carbon (67-74%) and low oxygen (13-18%) content, biocrude oil seems to provide a better platform to deliver recovered energy, with higher heating values of 30-35 MJ kg-1. An overall energy balance, supported by a sensitivity analysis, demonstrated how the higher temperature enhanced the overall energy return. Twelve scenarios were used to estimate the daily net energy gained in feedlots of different sizes. All scenarios provided a positive energy balance with returned energy found to be 2 to 3 times higher than invested energy. The estimation presented herein highlights the feasibility of hydrothermal technology to return energy by multiple products and, hence, to provide a sustainable waste management practice in confined feedlots. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry..

AB  - The production of biodiesel from Scenedesmus algal oil is one of the best alternative forms of liquid fuel production from biomass to petrol diesel. Biodiesel plays a significant role in the carbon sequestration process during cultivation. Scenedesmus algal species was isolated and cultured in a bold basal medium by using nonheat releasing white florescence (2500 lx) for a 12:12-h dark and light cycle. Algae oil was extracted from dried microalgae biomass through a microwave digester–assisted solvent extraction method. Consequently, about 20.8% algal oil per gram was obtained. A waste-based calcium oxide (CaO) nano-catalyst prepared from goat bone was used in the transesterification process. The catalyst was calcinated at 900 °C and characterized using FTIR, SEM, EDX, and XRD techniques. The results revealed a mean particle size of 43.96 nm with an irregular shape, porous structure, and possession of many active sites. The optimized transesterification process offers an optimum biodiesel yield of 92% at the experimental conditions, i.e., at a reaction temperature of 60 °C, 2% (Wt.) catalyst loading and 11:1 methanol to algal oil molar ratio, 1500 rpm stirring speed, and 3 h reaction duration. The physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel were tested according to ASTM D6751 standards and are in good agreement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The molecular basis of cell–cell adhesion in woody tissues is not known. Xylem cells in wood particles of hybrid poplar (Populus tremula × P. alba cv. INRA 717-1B4) were separated by oxidation of lignin with acidic sodium chlorite when combined with extraction of xylan and rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) using either dilute alkali or a combination of xylanase and RG-lyase. Acidic chlorite followed by dilute alkali treatment enables cell–cell separation by removing material from the compound middle lamellae between the primary walls. Although lignin is known to contribute to adhesion between wood cells, we found that removing lignin is a necessary but not sufficient condition to effect complete cell–cell separation in poplar lines with various ratios of syringyl:guaiacyl lignin. Transgenic poplar lines expressing an Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding an RG-lyase (AtRGIL6) showed enhanced cell–cell separation, increased accessibility of cellulose and xylan to hydrolytic enzyme activities, and increased fragmentation of intact wood particles into small cell clusters and single cells under mechanical stress. Our results indicate a novel function for RG-I, and also for xylan, as determinants of cell–cell adhesion in poplar wood cell walls. Genetic control of RG-I content provides a new strategy to increase catalyst accessibility and saccharification yields from woody biomass for biofuels and industrial chemicals. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of the present work was to obtain methyl biodiesel from soybean oil (BMS) using immobilized Porcine pancreas lipase (PPL) on the support of p-nitrobenzyl cellulose xanthate (NBXCel). The influence of the parameters immobilized enzyme quantity, reaction time and buffered reaction medium were studied. As the reaction time increased, the conversion rate increased because using 5.16% mPPL/mNBXCel with 24 h reaction, the conversion rate achieved was 50.35%, and after 48 h the conversion increased to 71.19% conversion using the same amount. The pH 7.0 buffered reaction medium also contributed to decrease the required amount of immobilized lipase to achieve satisfactory conversion, because in the experiment using 4.27% mPPL/mNBXCel over 36 h of reaction, there was an increase in the OSjC conversion rate. for BMS ranging from 50.54% in bufferless reaction medium to 89.94% in buffered reaction medium. After the 40 experiments performed, the conditions of six experiments allowed a conversion higher than 96.5%, as required by the regulators, and under these conditions the reuse of the support was performed by evaluating the conversion obtained in 10 reuse cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Dicarboxylic acids offer several applications in detergent builder and biopolymer fields. One of these acids, 4-O-methyl d-glucaric acid, could potentially be produced from glucuronoxylans, which are a comparatively underused fraction of wood and agricultural biorefineries. Results: Accordingly, an enzymatic pathway was developed that combines AxyAgu115A, a GH115 α-glucuronidase from Amphibacillus xylanus, and GOOX, an AA7 gluco-oligosaccharide oxidase from Sarocladium strictum, to produce this bio-based chemical from glucuronoxylan. AxyAgu115A was able to release almost all 4-O-methyl d-glucuronic acid from glucuronoxylan while a GOOX variant, GOOX-Y300A, could convert 4-O-methyl d-glucuronic acid to the corresponding glucaric acid at a yield of 62%. Both enzymes worked effectively at alkaline conditions that increase xylan solubility. Given the sensitivity of AxyAgu115A to hydrogen peroxide and optimal performance of GOOX-Y300A at substrate concentrations above 20 mM, the two-step enzyme pathway was demonstrated as a sequential, one-pot reaction. Additionally, the resulting xylan was easily recovered from the one-pot reaction, and it was enzymatically hydrolysable. Conclusions: The pathway in this study requires only two enzymes while avoiding a supplementation of costly cofactors. This cell-free approach provides a new strategy to make use of the underutilized hemicellulose stream from wood and agricultural biorefineries. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - We previously optimized a conventional twostep process (TSP) for biodiesel production using waste coffee grounds (WCGs). In the present study, a novel process, one-step direct process (OSDP) comprised of lipid extraction and simultaneous transesterification in a reactor, was evaluated for biodiesel production for WCGs, and compared with TSP. Owing to a relatively low free-fatty acid content (2.3%), an alkaline catalyst, NaOH, was readily used in this process. We found that a mixture of methanol and n-hexane was the best combination for the OSDP. Optimization of OSDP was conducted by statistical technique, followed by one-factor-at-a-time and sensitivity analysis techniques. Using these techniques, 10.8% (gbiodiesel/ g-WCGs) biodiesel yield was achieved at 3.0 wt% of catalyst relative to WCGs, 3.0 mL methanol/g-WCGs, 4.5mL n-hexane/g-WCGs, 45°C, and 9 h of reaction time. Compared to the TSP, the OSDP saved methanol and n-hexane requirement by 69.7% and 67.2%, respectively, while the actual biodiesel yields based on the lipid amount in WCGs were similar in both processes. This study showed that the novel OSDP could be a promising alternative to TSP for economic biodiesel production from WCGs. © 2020, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer.

AB  - Environmental regulations motivate the industries to replace conventional fuels and chemicals by those produced from biomass. In this regard, hydrodeoxygenation of lignin compounds is of a great deal of attention. Synthesis gas could be utilized instead of pure hydrogen for the cleavage of oxygen-containing chemical bonds through hydrodeoxygenation. Following this, the utilization of synthesis gas is investigated in the present contribution. A wide range of commercial alumina-supported catalysts is investigated. The experimental results of cyclohexanone hydrodeoxygenation in the presence of pure hydrogen and synthesis gas at 573 K and 20 bar of total pressure are presented and discussed. The whole investigated catalysts show good activity toward the hydrodeoxygenation of cyclohexanone. Methylatedbenzene derivatives are produced from cyclohexanone hydrodeoxygenation for the first time. The catalysts composed of platinum showed the best performance. By utilizing a chlorinated platinum catalyst, 89.6% cyclohexanone conversion, 100% total hydrocarbon selectivity, and 44.6% total hydrocarbon yield are obtained. In the case of syngas-assisted hydrodeoxygenation, 80.1% cyclohexanone conversion, 100% total hydrocarbon selectivity, and 29.6% total hydrocarbon yield are obtained by utilizing the same catalyst. The presence of methylated aromatics proves the accomplishment of methanation or direct aromatization reactions in the presence of carbon oxides and hydrogen. © 2020 Curtin University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolysis oil produced from forestry residues is used as a low-grade fuel in applications such as heating oil. However, the high water and acid content can lead to fuel instability, phase separation, poor lubrication, and corrosion. In this work, pervaporation has been studied as a process to simultaneously upgrade a pyrolysis oil produced from Canadian softwood bark to meet a boiler fuel standard and extract value-added chemicals. Commercial polyacrylonitrile-supported polyvinyl alcohol membranes from DeltaMem AG were used at temperatures of 60 and 80 °C to separate water and volatile organic components, including methanol, acetic acid, and acetol. A design of experiment study was used to define the range of operating conditions. A temperature of 80 °C and a low feed flow rate of 0.1 mL min−1 resulted in the highest quality oil. The upgraded pyrolysis oil (pervaporation retentate) showed an increased heating value from incomplete combustion to 16.07 MJ kg−1 and the water content was lowered from 70.2 wt% in the feedstock to 21.4 wt%, demonstrating the potential for this process on a larger scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, a novel technique is applied to recover the pyrolysis products (bio-oil, char, and non-condensable gas) from algal biomass (E. compressa) by utilizing solar energy. To observe the parametric effect on product distribution, the temperature was varied from 250 to 600 °C, heating rate of 20–100 °C/min, particles feed size of &lt;0.5–2.5 mm and sweeping gas flow rate of 3–15 liter per minute (lpm). The maximum solar bio-oil yield of 38.12 wt% was obtained at 400 °C, 9 lpm, &lt;0.5 mm and 20 °C/min. The non-condensable gas evolution rate increase with a rise in temperature except for CO2. The bio-oils were characterized and their economic feasibility was evaluated by proximate, ultimate and GC-MS analysis whereas char product was characterized by proximate and FTIR. The gaseous products were analyzed by micro-gas chromatography (GC). The products yield and their characteristics highly dependent on temperature variation. The products possess high energy contents which are a potential alternative fuel. The energy upgrading factor, and solar to chemical conversion efficiency was also calculated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of biodiesel from fatty acid distillates (FAD) is a technically viable route but the assessment of engine performance and environmental impact are non-well researched issues. The scope of this contribution is to develop a characterization of the FAD obtained as a waste product from the vegetable oil refining industry and to evaluate the biodiesel performance and exhaust emissions on a diesel engine. A physicochemical characterization is also developed. The gas chromatography results show the fatty acids profile, indicating 50.56% of linoleic acid. Acidity level indicated that the FAD must be converted to biodiesel before its use on a diesel engine. The conversion of FAD to biodiesel reaches 92% yield. Combustion of biodiesel from FAD shows 80% increase in the specific fuel consumption and 5.6% in NOx, shorter ignition delay and hydrocarbons and CO reductions in 22% and 46%, respectively. The results demonstrate the viability to produce biofuels from FAD, which also leads to a reduction of environmental pollutants. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - During the last three decades, hydroprocessed fuels, biodiesel, and hybrid fuels derived from vegetable oils and animal fats were emerging as the prominent biofuels for compression ignition engine. A comparative analysis of production, chemical structure, fuel properties, and cost estimation of waste cooking oil-based biodiesel, hybrid fuel, and hydroprocessed fuels was carried out and reported in this article. Biodiesel was produced by transesterification process; hybrid fuel was prepared by three-phase microemulsion process, while hydroprocessed fuels were produced via hydro-processing followed by true boiling point distillation as per ASTM D2892 and ASTM D5236 specifications. The principal fuel properties of the biodiesel, hybrid fuel, and hydroprocessed fuels were measured as per ASTM/EN standards and compared with those of petro-diesel. The production cost per liter (L) of each of the biofuel was computed at the lab scale level. Moreover, the initial capital cost estimation for 400 L/batch/day pilot plant has been estimated on the basis of land, infrastructure, instruments, laboratory glassware, feedstock, chemicals, and workers. It is anticipated that more than 0.28 million USD are needed for the complete setup of pilot plant, which can get an approximate revenue of 0.1 million USD per annum, besides the environmental benefits. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Edible oils remain the principal feedstocks for biofuel production. Given the potential impact of this use on the food supply chain, extensive research has supported the adoption of inedible oils for biodiesel generation, an approach that may help diversify the supply of oleochemical materials. This article reports an investigation of Scheelea phalerata, Terminalia catappa, and Aleurites moluccanus, three inedible oilseeds found in Midwest Brazil. Oils from these species were employed to synthesize biodiesel (methyl route) and produce binary blends with soybean biodiesel (S. phalerata: soybean, T. catappa: soybean, and A. moluccanus: soybean, each at 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, and 50:50). Investigation of the thermal and oxidative properties of esters from individual plant species and blended with soybean esters showed that the alternative esters are suitable for use as biodiesels. The chemical composition profile of transesterification products revealed a predominance of saturated compounds (62.5%) in S. phalerata oil, while a more balanced distribution between saturated (40.5%) and unsaturated (57.4%) esters was found for T. catappa, while a high unsaturated content (90.0%) was detected for A. moluccanus. Scheelea phalerata esters had a favorable effect on the blends, reducing thermal stability, decreasing crystallization points, and increasing induction periods. Higher ratios of T. catappa esters in the blends promoted an increase in thermal stability and crystallization points, while decreasing induction periods. Use of A. moluccanus esters in the blends led to increased thermal stability and decreased crystallization temperatures and induction periods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The integrated production of biodiesel and biogas has been explored by using N. gaditana, I. galbana and A. platensis as substrate. Three fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) production approaches were assessed, namely an indirect process with previously extracted lipids (IPPEL), an indirect process with extracted lipids as free fatty acids (IPELFFA) and a direct process (DP) without a previous lipid extraction stage. Besides de FAEE production, these approaches are considered as pre-treatments of the microbial biomasses evaluated in this study with the objective of increasing the methane yield during the anaerobic digestion. Biogas yields of the residues generated under the three FAEE production methodologies were compared to the biogas yield of the raw feedstock. In all cases, the biodiesel and biogas yields were higher after the FAEE production process from the previously extracted lipids as free fatty acids (IPELFFA). Therefore, this constitutes an interesting and promising route in the joint production of biodiesel and biogas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Amano lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (L-AK) was covalently immobilized on various carbon nanomaterials (functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide) and tested for biodiesel production. Using the most active lipase preparation (covalently immobilized L-AK on SwCNTNH2 derivatized with glycerol diglycidyl ether) under optimal conditions, quasi-complete conversion (>99%) of sunflower oil was obtained after only 4 h reaction time. Moreover, the biocatalyst maintained more than 99% of its initial activity in the batch system after multiple recycling experiments. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Increasing CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions are decreasing the living conditions all around the world and considerable damage is inflicted on our planet. Creating solutions for clean energy, air, water and food is becoming inevitable and urgent. This paper focuses on upgrading biogas to high quality biofuel to meet German gas grid requirements. The Sabatier process has proven that carbon dioxide present in biogas can be converted to methane (&gt;96% -Vol) by adding hydrogen in a stoichiometric ratio. High quality methane yield 98.9%, with CO2 conversion 99.6% is achieved with a Nickel catalyst and with process conditions of temperature (473.15 K), pressure (1000 kpa), H2/CO2 ratio (6), CH4/CO2 ratio (1.52), a flow rate of 1.11 × 10−6 m3 s−1 for the reactor dimensions of a diameter of 0.1 m, a catalyst bed height of 0.14 m, a catalyst amount of 0.01 kg and a reactor volume of 1.099 × 10−3 m3. These experimental laboratory parameters are beneficial as a reference for upscaling Methanation reactors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A number of industrial crops have been promoted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to meet a range of policy objectives including economic growth, rural development, agricultural modernization and energy security. The food security impacts of industrial crop production have received extensive policyattention and have been widely discussed in the academic literature. There is, however, an overall lack of a clear understanding of these impacts due to thelarge diversity of industrial crops, and their varied modes of production, expansion areas, and impact mechanisms. This systematic review synthesizes theavailable knowledge on the interface of industrial crops and food security in SSA. In particular we identify key patterns with how different industrial cropsand impact mechanisms are represented and studied in the current literature, and how they intersect to affect food security. The current literature isfragmented, as most studies focus on single or small subsets of crops and impact mechanisms. Most studies capture mechanisms related to food access andavailability, rather than to food utilization and stability. A clustering analysis identified the main literature clusters that combine mechanisms related to foodavailability, access to food, and environmental impact. The overall analysis presented in this systematic review allowed us to identify priority policy andpractice domains that need to be targeted in order to improve the food security outcomes of industrial crop production in SSA. © 2019, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Rapid population and economic growth causes the demand for energy is increasing every year. A lot of focus has been put on renewable energy as the fossil fuel reserve is expected to last only a few decades. Biomass is recognised as a potential source of renewable energy but however, it usually requires further processing before it can be used. In the present study, biochar was prepared via pyrolysis using palm fibre as the biomass feedstock. This paper provides experimental data for the production of biochar at a temperature range of 300 to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The obtained biochar was characterised using bomb calorimeter, Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Physisorption BET and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The biochar gasification behaviour was studied in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 °C. From the pyrolysis experiments, it was found that a good char yield can be obtained at lower pyrolysis temperatures. For the gasification experiment, a temperature of 800 °C and above is required for gasification to take place. Energy consumption can be reduced significantly for future research when employ this operating condition. Properties of solid fuel like char reactivity and carbon conversion under well defined gasifying agent and temperature is necessary for designing any gasifier model. It can be concluded that palm fibre can be upgraded into solid biofuel and has potential to be used as a feedstock for renewable energy production. © 2020

AB  - Many countries have their biofuel policy programs in place as part of their overall strategy to achieve sustainable development. Among biofuels, bioethanol as a promising alternative to gasoline is of substantial interest. However, there is limited availability of a sufficient quantity of bioethanol to meet demands due to bottlenecks in the present technologies to convert non-edible feedstocks, including lignocelluloses. This review article presents and critically discusses the recent advances in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, with a focus on the use of green solvents, including ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents, followed by enzymatic saccharification using auxiliary proteins for the efficient saccharification of pretreated biomass. Different techniques used in strain improvement strategies to develop hyper-producing deregulated lignocellulolytic strains are also compared and discussed. The advanced techniques employed for fermentation of mixed sugars contained in lignocellulosic hydrolysates for maximizing bioethanol production are summarized with an emphasis on pathway and transporters engineering for xylose assimilation. Further, the integration of different steps is suggested and discussed for efficient biomass utilization and improved ethanol yields and productivity © 2020 BRTeam. All rights reserved.

AB  - The utilization of waste biomass such as crop residues in the production of biofuel is gaining attention from all around the world. The wheat is one of the most grown crops in the world and its main by-product straw produced 529 million tons per annum. The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of wheat straw as biomass material to produce bio-oil in a fluidized bed fast reactor. The developed system has a throughput capacity of 5 kg/h and the effect of varying temperature, biomass particle size, and sweep gas flow rate on the yield of pyrolysis products mainly on bio-oil is also studied. The result showed that the highest bio-oil yield 42 wt% was obtained at a temperature of 500°C, the feed particle size of 1 mm, and the gas flow rate of 4 m3/h. The properties of produced bio-oil were determined such as heating value, viscosity, and pH of 19.59 MJ/kg, 18.01 cP, and 3.1, respectively. The GCMS and FTIR analysis were used to identify the chemical compounds available on bio-oil and the phenol, alcohols, alkanes, alkenes, esters, furnol, hydrocarbon, and aromatic compounds were reported in the bio-oil. The economic assessment showed that the production cost of bio-oil was 0.50 US$/liter and the calculated payback period of the system was 1.57 years. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In order to partially replace the use of fossil fuels in the aeronautical sector, it is proposed to produce FAMEtype biofuels from palm kernel oil. Short chain methyl esters can be used so that the FAME biodiesel have no significant effects on the cold properties of the Jet Fuels when these are mixtures. In this sense, a study of the production of biodiesel FAME from palm kernel by transesterification oil at bench scale was carried out using a batch reactor with the optimal value of the process conditions that were obtained in a previous work but at laboratory level. In that research, the input variables were the methanol-oil ratio, the temperature and the amount of catalyst (% KOH). In this work, the response variable was on the production yield of methyl esters, which were analysed by GC. Physicochemical characterization of the generated biodiesel and an economic analysis of the bank-scale process was carried out to envision a future implementation in the Colombian Air force. Using additives, the improvement of the cold flow properties (such as freezing point and cloud point) of mixtures of FAME of Palm Kernel Oil with Jet Fuel A1 can be contemplated. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The biomass-to-liquid (BtL) process is a promising technology to obtain clean, liquid, second-generation biofuels and chemicals. The BtL process, which comprises several steps, is based upon the gasification of biomass and the catalytic transformation of the syngas that is obtained via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reaction, producing a hydrocarbon pool known as syncrude. The FTS process is a well-established technology, and there are currently very large FTS plants operating worldwide that produce liquid fuels and hydrocarbons from natural gas (NG) (gas-to-liquids, GtL process) and coal (coal-to-liquids, CtL process). Due to the limited availability of local biomass, the size of the BtL plants should be downscaled compared to that of a GtL or CtL plant. Since the feasibility of the XtL (X refers to any energy source that can be converted to liquid, including coal, NG, biomass, municipal solid waste, etc.) processes is strongly influenced by the economies of scale, the viability of small-scale BtL plants can be compromised. An interesting approach to overcome this issue is to increase the productivity of the FTS process by developing reactors and catalysts with higher productivities to generate the desired product fraction. Recently, by integrating membrane reactors with the FTS process the gas feeding and separation unit have been demonstrated in a single reactor. In this review, the most significant achievements in the field of catalytic membrane reactors for the FTS process will be discussed. Different types of membranes and configurations of membrane reactors, including H2O separation and H2-feed distribution, among others, will be analyzed. ©2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - Biodiesel is a clean and renewable fuel, which is considered as the best alternative to diesel fuel, but the feedstock contributes more than 70% of the cost. The most important constituent essential for biodiesel development is to explore cheap feedstock with high oil content. In this work, we found novel non-edible plant seeds of Koelreuteria paniculata (KP) with high oil contents of 28-30 wt.% and low free fatty acid contents (0.91%), which can serve as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. KP seed oil can convert into biodiesel/fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by base-catalyzed transesterification with the highest biodiesel production of 95.2% after an optimization process. We obtained the optimal transesterification conditions, i.e., oil/methanol ratio (6:1), catalyst concentration (0.32), reaction temperature (65 °C), stirring rate (700 rpm), and reaction time (80 min). The physico-chemical properties and composition of the FAME were investigated and compared with mineral diesel. The synthesized esters were confirmed and characterized by the application of NMR (1H and 13C), FTIR, and GC-MS. The biofuel produced from KP seed oil satisfies the conditions verbalized by ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards. Accordingly, KP source oil can be presented as a novel raw material for biofuel fabrication. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Managing of wastes rich in lignocellulose creates the opportunity to produce biofuels that are in full compliance with the principles of sustainable development. Biomass, as a suitable base for the production of biofuels, does not have to be standardized, and its only important feature is the appropriate content of lignocellulose, which assures great freedom in the selection of input. Biobutanol, obtained from this type of biomass, can be used as fuel for internal combustion engines, including diesel engines. In the era of strict environmental protection regulations, especially concerning atmospheric air, any new fuel, apart from good energetic properties, should also show beneficial ecological effects. This study investigates the carbon dioxide emissions from biobutanol powered diesel engine by means of use of the simulation model. The parameters of a real passenger car powered by a diesel engine were used for simulation carried out accordingly to the WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure) approval procedure as the current test for newly manufactured cars. The results obtained for biobutanol were compared with simulated exhaust emissions obtained for conventional diesel and with FAME (fatty acid methyl esters)—the most popular biofuel. Biobutanol, in spite of its higher consumption, showed lower direct carbon dioxide emissions than both: the conventional diesel and FAME. In addition, a LCA (life cycle assessment) was carried out for the fuels and vehicles in question using the SimaPro package. Therefore, the implementation of butyl alcohol as a fuel provides favorable environmental effects. This result gives arguments towards biofuel production management indicating that implementation of biobutanol production technology mitigates carbon dioxide emission, as well as promotes lignocellulosic resources rather than edible parts of the plants. © 2020 by the authors

AB  - Thermal conductivity of two types of nanobiodiesels (NBs) was investigated theoretically and experimentally. The first type of NBs (C4-Au) was composed of C4 biodiesel (purchased from Biofuels of Mexico) filled with Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs) and the second type (SB-Ag) was composed of soybean biodiesel (SB) filled with Ag nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). It has been demonstrated in the literature that the addition of Au-NPs or Ag-NPs to biodiesel can lead to a significant increase in thermal properties. The photothermal techniques were used to determine the thermal diffusivity (D), thermal effusivity (e), and thermal conductivity (k) of biodiesel filled with Au-NPs or Ag-NPs for different concentrations. For about two decades, researchers have made the effort to predict the enhancement of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids based on experiments and several theoretical models have been proposed. One of these analytical models, which have allowed researchers to calculate the thermal conductivity of the nanofluids, is the Hamilton–Crosser Model. This model is based on the classical theory of compounds and mixtures containing particles in the order of millimeters or micrometers and fails dramatically in predicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. In that sense, the Hamilton–Crosser model (H–C) cannot represent adequately the enhancement in k as a function of NP’s concentration. Then, the artificial neural network (ANN) modeling method was used to predict the thermal conductivity of the two NBs studied in this work. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - High-quality bio-fuel (low oxygen content and acid value, high calorific value) was produced by catalytic pyrolysis of clay oil over calcined clay. Both feedstock (clay oil) and catalyst (calcined clay) were obtained from spent bleaching clay (SBC) deriving out of edible oil plants. The calcined clay was characterized with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), N2 adsorption/desorption analyses, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and carbon dioxide (NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD). Catalytic pyrolysis experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of several parameters on the product distribution, including pyrolysis temperature, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) and residence time. The optimal conditions for produce high quality bio-fuel were 550 °C with WHSV of 2.5 h−1 and residence time of 1.65 s. The low heating value of bio-oil was increased by 13%–46.36 kJ/g, as long as the acid value was decreased by 97% to 1.16 mg/g KOH. The calcined clay catalyst showed slight deactivation after 4 cycles. Therefore, fast pyrolysis process is a rapid and efficient method of valorising spent bleaching clay from waste oils for high quality bio-fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that can be obtained by the transesterification of vegetable oils. Spectrophotometric methods can be used for the quantification of mixtures of oils, associated with chemometric tools, enabling the analysis of overlapping signals. The aim of this work was to apply the multivariate calibration with PLS (partial least squares) and artificial neural network (ANN), to estimate the concentration of esters in the transesterification of soybean oil using molecular absorption spectrophotometry as analytical technique. The absorbance measurements were performed in a spectrophotometer UV/VIS. Synthetic solutions were prepared with standards of the five major compounds of soybean biodiesel and the real samples were obtained by the reaction of transesterification of soybean oil with two types of catalysts: NaOH and enzymatic method using Lipozyme® IM (Novozymes). According to the results, all components of the reaction medium absorb in the wavelength range of 190-280 nm. The reactions of the basic catalysis reached conversions close to 100%, whereas the enzymatic reactions reached lower conversion values. For both methods, the calibration and validation groups were composed, respectively, by the synthetic and the real samples. Results showed that the concentrations of esters estimated by the ANN model in the real samples are more accurate (R2 of 0.93), showing the great ability of the ANN in estimating the data. © 2020, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - Oil extraction from kernels requires an appreciable amount of energy that could be decreased when the purpose of this oil is to produce biodiesel by intensifying the oil extraction and transesterification steps. The qualities of biodiesels obtained from Calophyllum inophyllum oilseeds resulting from variation in the seeds drying process under optimized conditions in an in situ acid catalyzed transesterification of the oil using n-hexane and methanol was evaluated in the present study. Oils of freshly pulverised seeds that were dried under different conditions were used for biodiesel productions through extractive reaction method. The drying process/condition is observed to have influenced the quantity and quality of the biodiesel obtained with parameters such as the free fatty acids (FFA) content, cloud and pour points of the oil considerably affected. Biodiesel from oven-dried kernels at 75 °C and 105 °C without removal of their husks met both ASTM and EN specifications. The study concluded that the optimized conditions adopted yielded biodiesel of very high quality from Calophyllum inophyllum seeds that could serve as a better non-edible oil substitute for biodiesel fuels production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Combustion (pyrolysis with oxygen) and pyrolysis without oxygen are two potential methods to convert wood into biofuels or biochemicals. To evaluate which is preponderant to convert wood into biofuels or biochemicals and provide guidance for optimization of product yield, the pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics of typical hardwood (black walnut) are comparatively investigated in nitrogen and air employing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Two model-free methods including Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) method are applied to obtain the kinetic parameters, and a model-fitting method called Coats–Redfern (CR) method is employed to estimate the reaction mechanism. The black walnut pyrolysis in nitrogen may be divided into two stages with the threshold of conversion rate α = 0.4, but that in air may be separated into three stages with the thresholds of α = 0.25 and 0.7. The reaction mechanism for pyrolysis in nitrogen may be assumed random nucleation and its subsequent growth, but that in air may be assumed random nucleation and its subsequent growth followed by chemical reaction. The average activation energy and natural logarithm of pre-exponential factor for the whole pyrolysis process in nitrogen and air are 211.59 and 187.73 kJ/mol and 32.33 and 28.36 min−1, respectively. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this work, the pine cones pyrolysis (a mixture of both scales and axis) was investigated under different temperature (500–800°C) at a bench scale fixed bed reactor operating in batch mode. It was found that operating temperature had a slight or more marked influence on the product phase distribution as a consequence of the enhancement of biomass decomposition and also the greater prominence of cracking reactions especially at highest temperatures, yielding a greater gas production. It was found that increasing temperature led to decreasing biochar yields (from 29.4% to 20.4%) and increasing gas yields (from 34.4 to 44.4%), whereas the bio-oil yield passed through a maximum 37.6% at 600°C. The biochars were characterized in terms of proximate and elemental analysis, thermal degradation profiles, high heating value and surface chemistry and morphology. In addition, the composition of gases was determined by gas chromatography. Apart from the changes induced by increasing temperature on the biochar properties such as greater pore volumes at 700°C (used in activated carbon manufacture), it was found that gas production was enhanced, and H2 and CH4 yields were the highest at 800°C. Finally, at 600°C biochar showed the highest heating value of 30.95 MJ kg−1, allowing its use briquette biofuels. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Lignin component in lignocellulosic biomass always adversely affects the efficiency of its enzymatic saccharification and subsequent bioethanol production. To mitigate the lignin inhibition, this work thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of deacetylation and steam pretreatment for improved fermentable sugars and bioethanol production from hardwood as well as quantified the relative contribution of lignin toward physical blockage effect and unproductive adsorption effect on cellulose hydrolysis. It was found that deacetylation reduced the formation of acid catalyst, thus significantly mitigating lignin inhibition on cellulose hydrolysis. The addition of Na2S in deacetylation was more liable in improving biomass porosity, and the addition of Na2SO3 was more favorable for removing surface lignin; both of these factors contributed to the decreased physical blockage effect of lignin. Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated that deacetylation distinctly suppressed the undesirable lignin repolymerization and the formation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, which could alleviate the unproductive adsorption effect of lignin. When lignin was isolated from the deacetylation-steam-pretreated substrates and added to the enzymatic hydrolysis of Avicel, a distinctly lower lignin inhibition was observed compared to the samples without deacetylation. Besides, the lignin inhibition showed a strong correlation with the extent of lignin repolymerization, proving the lignin inhibition mitigating effect of deacetylation through modification of the lignin structure. ©

AB  - The reduction of energy sources, environmental and destructive pollution caused by the combustion of fossil fuels and urban sewage wastes, has created a situation that researchers are thinking about a solution to two problems simultaneously. There are several processes for converting sewage sludge to energy. Pyrolysis is considered one of the processes of interest. The products obtained and the characteristics of each product depend on the pyrolysis operating factors, such as temperature, residence time, heating rate, specifications of the reactor, and the catalyst. The amount of oxygen and water in bio-oils is high and its viscosity is high, therefore are unstable in terms of oxidation. Therefore, it is necessary to improve it. Most liquid bio-oil products are obtained when the bio-char production is minimized. This is done at high temperatures and heating rate temperatures around 1000 °C/S with rapid cooling. Fluidized bed reactors are the most economically suitable reactors for rapid pyrolysis of sewage sludge with high bio-oil production efficiency. The cost of raw materials is 80% of the total cost of bio-oil production, so, the use of sewage sludge as feed for the pyrolysis process to produce bio-oil reduces its cost and makes its production economically competitive with fossil diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, we report a membraneless glucose and air photoelectrochemical biofuel cell (PBFC) with a visible light assisted photobioanode. Flavin adenine dinucleotide dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FADGDH) was immobilized on the combined photobioanode for the visible light assisted glucose oxidation (GCE|MWCNT|g-C3N4|Ru-complex|FADGDH) with a quinone mediated electron transfer. Bilirubine oxidase (BOx) immobilized on MWCNT coated GCE (GCE|BOx) was used as the cathode with direct electron transfer (DET). An improvement of biocatalytic oxidation current was observed by 6.2% due in part to the light-driven electron-transfer. The large oxidation currents are probably owing to the good contacting of the immobilized enzymes with the electrode material and the utilization of light assisted process. Under the visible light, the photobioanode shows an anodic photocurrent of 1.95 μA cm2 at attractively low potentials viz. −0.4 vs Ag/AgCl. The lower-lying conduction band of g-C3N4 as compared to Ru-complexes decreases the rate of hole and electron recombination and enhances the charge transportation. The bioanode shows maximum current density for glucose oxidation up to 6.78 μA cm−2 at 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl at pH:7. The performance of three promising Ru-complexes differing in chemical and redox properties were compared as electron mediators for FADGDH. Upon illumination, the PBFC delivered a maximum power density of 28.5 ± 0.10 μW cm−2 at a cell voltage of +0.4 V with an open circuit voltage of 0.64 V. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the effect of hydrogen addition to a compression ignition (CI) engine fueled with the diesel fuel-waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) blend (B25) on the engine performance, and exhaust emissions was examined experimentally. In the tests, a four-cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, 1.461-L, turbocharged CI engine was used. The engine tests were performed at the fixed engine speed of 1750 rpm and at the diverse engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm. The hydrogen was added to the intake air at the flow rates of 10, 20, 30 and 40 lpm. According to the results obtained, hydrogen had a positive effect on break specific fuel consumption (BSFC) for all test conditions. The increase occurred at the exhaust gas temperatures (EGTs) and cylinder pressures (CPs) with hydrogen addition. The NOx and total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions decreased with the hydrogen addition until 30 lpm at 40 and 60 Nm engine loads. On the other hand, they increased at 80 Nm engine load for all hydrogen additions. While CO2 and O2 emissions decreased with the hydrogen addition, the smoke emissions increased. It was found that the value of 30 lpm was the optimum condition of the hydrogen addition rates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the efficacy of waste peels of mango (Mangifera indica) as a basic catalyst in room temperature transesterification reaction is investigated for biodiesel production from soybean oil. Biowaste based catalyst, Mangifera indica peel ash, was prepared by conventional open air burning of the mango peel. The morphology and chemical components of the catalyst are investigated using several techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Hammett indicator method. The highest biodiesel yield of 98% was attained under the optimized reaction conditions; methanol to oil ration of 6:1, catalyst loading of 6 wt %, and time of 4 h under room temperature. Crucially, the catalyst retained its activity up to 4th cycle of reused. The excellent catalytic activity of the ash catalyst could be attributed to the presence of highly basic metal oxides such as K2O, MgO and CaO, its high surface area and porous nature. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The design and development of new routes for the production of sustainable bulk-chemicals requires focus on feedstock, conversion technology and downstream product recovery. This brief article discusses some of the constraints with using fermentation and suggests the removal of some constraints by using microbial biocatalysis or enzyme biocatalysis, which give a number of benefits in the context of the requirements for bulk-chemical production. Some potential process concepts are described, for products in the suitable low-price range. These examples (biodiesel, furfurals and amines) are used to illustrate the power of biocatalysis. Suggestions for future research efforts beyond molecular biology, involving process-based concepts, are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The electrochemical reduction of aryldiazonium salts is a versatile and direct route to obtain robust covalently modified electrodes. We report here a comparative study of Azure A modified carbon nanotube electrodes prepared by diazonium electrografting and by physical adsorption for bioelectrocatalytic glucose oxidation with fungal FAD-glucose dehydrogenase from Aspergillus sp. The electrografted and adsorbed electrodes exhibited different reversible electroactivity consistent with polymer-type and monomer-type phenothiazine surface assemblies, respectively. The electrografted Azure A electrodes exhibited superior mediated bioelectrocatalysis compared to the adsorbed Azure A electrodes. A more than 10-fold higher catalytic current up to 2 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl together with a similarly low onset potential of −0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl was observed at the electrografted electrodes. Faster estimated electron transfer kinetics and a +200 mV potential shift for the polymer-type redox couple vs. the adsorbed monomer-type couple underlines the favourable driving force for mediated electron transfer with the buried FAD active site for the diazonium-derived bioelectrode. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Due to its substantial lipid content, leather tanning waste (LTW) is regarded as a potential feedstock for the waste-derived biodiesel. To promote the valorization of LTW, one-pot synthesis of biodiesel via supercritical ethanol method was investigated. The influence of the three independent reaction variables, namely reaction time t (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 min), temperature T (300, 350, 400 °C) and ethanol to LTW molar ratio reo (35, 40, 45), on the yield of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) YF was studied. The multilevel factorial design combined with the response surface methodology and three-way analysis of variance was employed to design and optimize the experiment in regards to the three independent variables. Based on the optimization results, the highest FAEE yield was predicted at 99.68% when t = 47.4 min, T = 374.6 °C, and reo = 40.02. The actual FAEE yield was experimentally obtained at 98.91 ± 0.31% using the optimized reaction conditions. A deviation of 0.77% in the experimental verification shows a satisfactory agreement between the actual and predicted YF. All reaction variables were also found to give a significant effect on the yield of FAEE. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae offer numerous potential applications, however the industrial scale-up of algal technology still remains a challenge due to high production cost. Optimization of growth conditions and integration with waste streams can improve the economic viability of microalgal production systems. This study investigated on the optimal growth conditions of microalgae Nostoc ellipsosporum cultivated in municipal wastewater with the objective of achieving maximum biomass production, nutrient removal efficiency and bio-oil yield. The effect of light intensity, photoperiod, wavelength, aeration and growth media composition were studied. Different formulations of municipal wastewater blended with Fog's nutrient were used as growth medium. Optimization of growth conditions and acclimatization to wastewater enhanced the biomass yield of Nostoc ellipsosporum from 1.42 to 2.9 g L−1, achieving 87.59% of nitrogen removal and 88.31% of phosphate removal from wastewater. Furthermore, hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass produced bio-oil yield of 24.62% at 300 °C. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The recently industrialized process of converting coal to ethanol (CTE) is a potential competitor of the conventional biomass to ethanol (BTE) conversion route. In this study, a life cycle analysis was employed to assess the energy consumption, carbon emissions and economic costs associated with CTE compared with those associated with BTE. The operation data for the world's first industrialized CTE project were incorporated into the analysis. It is estimated that energy consumption and carbon emissions are mostly from the ethanol production process. The capital investment input is largely in the form of equipment costs, and the production cost is mainly spent on purchasing feedstock and energy. Compared with BTE, CTE offers a feasible alternative for energy engineering applications, benefiting from a robust energy conservation effect and excellent economic competitiveness even with feedstock price fluctuations. However, such a promising route faces the challenge of high carbon emissions, which needs to be solved promptly. An effective way to address this issue is to improve the conversion efficiency according to sensitivity analysis. The results of this study demonstrate the energy engineering application value of CTE technology, provide important indicators for its improvement and help policymakers and the market to select the appropriate ethanol production route according to local resource conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Different α-Fe2O3 loading (4–12 wt%) doped nanowires AlOOH/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are synthesized using a deposition hydrothermal technique and thoroughly characterized using XRD, SAED-TEM, FTIR, UV–Vis, N2 sorptiometry and XPS measurements. The 12 wt% α-Fe2O3/AlOOH(γ-Al2O3) catalyst presented the highest fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) Yield that comprised of 100% for virgin oil and 94.3% for the waste one, all performed under mild optimized conditions (60 °C, methanol to oil molar ratio = 6:1, 3 wt% catalyst, reaction rate 600 rpm and within 3 h reaction time). It also shows high recyclability without significant loss in activity because of the superior large surface area (323.3 m2/g), high number of acid sites (0.45 mmol g−1), deep pore volume (0.322 ml/g) and to the exposed active site planes (110) and (214) of α-Fe2O3. The kinetic constant (k = 0.016–0.02 min−1) and the activation energy (Ea = 57.4 kJ mol−1) of the reaction together with ΔH ‡ (59.4 kJ mol−1), ΔG ‡ (+95.9 kJ mol−1) and ΔS ‡ (- 0.108 kJ mol−1) values elaborate that the reaction is endothermic, non-spontaneous and obey an associative path. The fuel properties derived from cottonseed oil exhibited high quality biodiesel comparable to the international (ASTM) standards. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main aim of this work was to develop sustainable catalyst from geothermal waste by hydrothermal process for enhanced biohydrogen production. The effects of Si/Al ratio and pH neutralization on the catalyst were also investigated to provide further insight into the hydrogen production capability. Results have shown with increasing Si/Al ratio, a lower amount of catalyst was synthesized and smaller particle size was obtained. pH neutralization treatment resulted in higher conversion compared to non-neutralized ones. Meanwhile, the highest conversion of biohydrogen from ethanol through steam reforming process (95.19%) was obtained from catalyst with pH neutralization treatment and Si/Al ratio of 10. The catalyst developed in this study was concluded to be suitable for framework/supporting catalyst due to relatively low selectivity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Esterification of glycerol with acetic acid has been studied with different solid acid catalysts, prepared by impregnating phospotungustic, silicotungstic, and phosphomolybdic acids on polymeric material polyvinylpyrrolidone. These results were compared with commercially available montmorillonite KSFO catalyst showed that PVP-DTP gave higher selectivity to di- and triacetins. This study was mainly focused on increasing the selectivity toward triacetin which is an excellent alternative to fossil fuel based fuel additives. The detail characterization was done for the PVP-DTP catalyst which gave complete conversion of glycerol and maximum selectivity of 34% toward triacetin. Complete conversion of glycerol was achieved at 110 °C within 6 h of reaction time. The characterization of the catalyst was performed by SEM/EDX, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetic techniques, and FT-IR analysis.TPD-NH3 characterization showed that DTP supported on PVP increases the catalyst acidity of PVP. The highest acidity of PVP-DTP is also confirmed using NH3-TPD analysis. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuels from microalgae are being considered as an alternate renewable energy to fossil fuels, which could extinct by the year 2050 due to its exhaustive usage. Microalgae are tiny cell factories that accumulate large amount of lipids under nutrients starvation, which are sustainable sources for biofuels production. In this study, hydrolysate of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) was used as a carbon source to improve the production of microalgal biomass, which was further subjected to nitrogen starvation for the enhanced lipid accumulation. The lipid content of LCB supplement 3% and 2% grown cultures of Dictyococcus sp. VSKA18 and Coelastrella sp. M-60 were 44% and 52%, respectively. Further, recovery of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was achieved using two different catalysts such as acid (homogeneous) and iron nanoparticles (heterogeneous) synthesized using Sargassum polycystum. Moreover, the saturated fatty acid (SFA) of Dictyococcus sp. VSKA18 and Coelastrella sp. M-60 supplemented with 3% of LCB hydrolysates along with N starvation had yielded 90% and 28% respectively. Fuel quality parameters were also analyzed and compared with ASTM and European standards. Thus, the synthesized bio-iron nanoparticles mediated FAME conversion would be a suitable choice for improving biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fodder radish seed cake (FRSC), a by-product of biodiesel production process using fodder radish seed oil, by the composition, presents itself as a possible new raw material for pyrolysis to obtain biochar with attractive agronomic properties and bio-oil that may has use in the chemical industry and in bioenergy. In this work, FRSC chemical properties were evaluated to discuss the possibility of using this biomass as a feedstock for pyrolysis. The study presents that FRSC has characteristics that make it attractive as a feedstock for thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) in order to obtain products to be used as feedstock in the obtainment of chemicals, with agronomic uses and in bioenergy. This may also close the loop in biodiesel production, enhancing the potential of this biofuel compared to other biomasses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Scenedesmus obliquus, a green microalga of the class Chlorophyceae, has been used to produce biofuels. However, limited research has been reported on platform chemicals that use microalgae as biomass to replace fossil sources. This paper reports on the investigation of levulinic acid (LA) production from lipid-extracted S. obliquus with an acid-catalyzed thermochemical conversion using a statistical experimental approach. For the reaction factors, the highest effect on LA yield resulted from catalyst concentration. The optimized LA yield of 45.63 wt% (70.7 mol%) was achieved with 5 wt% lipid-extracted microalgae and reaction factors of 0.85 M HCl as a catalyst at 180 °C for 10 min. Also, the LA yield as a function of the combined severity factor followed a sigmoid curve. High LA yield resulted from combined severity factors greater than 3.4. These results indicate that the production of platform chemicals may be possible using microalgae feedstocks and thermochemical conversion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasilienis) is a plantation crop grown in various regions of India. It is a non-edible oil source and has excellent potential for being a biodiesel feedstock. The major problem with crude rubber seed oil is its high free fatty acid (FFA) content (37.46%). The present study has used the Box-Behnken response surface method to minimize the FFA content of the oil. FFA content of 1.31% was obtained with alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6.652:1 and 0.5 wt% of H2SO4 catalyst at a reaction temperature of 63.75 °C in 50 min. The results of engine testing indicated a decrease in fuel consumption by 50.23% for RB10 and 47.74% for RB20 when compared with neat diesel. The thermal efficiency was reduced by 12.16% for RB10 and 14.74% for RB20. The emission analysis revealed that HC emissions were increased by 22.3% for RB10 and by 41.72% for RB20. There was a decrease in NOx emissions by 21.5% for RB10 and by 21.7% for RB20 while the CO2 emissions were reduced by 46.3% for RB10 and 49.54% for RB20 at full loading. The CO emissions were increased by 25% and 37.5% for RB10 and, respectively, when compared with diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Presently, sugarcane bagasse (SB) and oat hulls (OH) have a distinctive potential as a renewable source of biomass, due to its global availability, which is advantageous for producing liquid and gaseous fuels by thermochemical processes. Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR) is a pyrolysis based technology for generating energy vectors (char, bio-oil and syngas) from biomass wastes. This work aims to study the conversion of SB and OH into fuels, using TCR in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot-scale reactor at different pyrolysis temperatures. The pyrolysis temperatures were studied at 400, 450 and 500 °C, while the subsequent reforming temperature remained constant at 500 °C. The bio-oil contained the highest calorific value of 33.4 and 33.5 MJ/kg for SB and OH, respectively at 500 °C pyrolysis temperature, which represented a notable increase compared to the raw material calorific value of SB and OH (16.4 and 16.0 MJ/kg, respectively), this was the result of deoxygenation reactions occurring. Furthermore, the increment of the pyrolysis temperature improved the water content, total acid number (TAN), viscosity and density of the bio-oil. The syngas and the biochar properties did not change significantly with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature. In order to use TCR bio-oil as an engine fuel, it is necessary to carry out some upgrading treatments; or blend it with fossil fuels if it is to be used as a transportation fuel. Overall, TCR is a promising future route for the valorisation of lignocellulosic residues to produce energy vectors. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - In this study, the alkaline catalyst (NaOH)-aided sulfolane organosolv pretreatment was first developed to reduce the recalcitrance of willow (Salix matsudana cv. Zhuliu) for effective saccharification and lignin valorization in subsequent processes. The pretreatment notably removed lignin, minimized cellulose loss, and increased the accessibility of cellulose. The sulfolane/water (50/50, w/w) pretreatment with 4% NaOH at 140 °C for 1.5 h increased the glucose saccharification yield by 14.2-fold of the yield from the untreated willow. The recovered lignin had high purity (∼97.0%), well-preserved molecular weight (4300-5010 g/mol), and low polydispersity (∼2.0). NMR analysis of the recovered lignin also indicated that it retained the representative linkage structures (e.g., β-O-4, β-β linkages). Based on these observations, the recovered lignin showed great potential as an intermediate in the production of functional biomaterials and/or green biofuels.

AB  - Sulfur-free Ni–W/Al2O3 catalysts synthesized through incipient wetness impregnation technique were investigated in deoxygenation of methyl palmitate and ethyl caprate blend at 300 °C and P = 1 MPa (PH2 = 0.25 MPa) in a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. Modification of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts by W (0.4–4.4 wt%) was found to give rise to higher both conversions of the feedstock and deoxygenation degree. In addition, this also resulted in a change in the selectivity of deoxygenation towards alkanes formed via direct hydrodeoxygenation route, compared to alkanes formed through decarboxylation/decarbonylation. Selectivity by alkanes with carbon chain length equal to those of an initial fatty acid formed via hydrodeoxygenation was found to increase with W content increasing. The synthesized catalysts were investigated by XRD, XPS, TEM, BET and H2-TPR techniques. According to XPS study of the reduced samples, tungsten was in 6+ oxidation state on the sample surface and W6+ content increased in the near-surface layer of samples with tungsten content increasing in catalysts. © 2020

AB  - Red mud samples were used to catalyse in-situ co-pyrolysis of pinewood and low-density polyethylene for the production of high-quality bio-oil. The sodium cation in the crude red-mud was exchanged with barium and calcium cations and further tested to explore their role in oil upgrading. The relationship between red-mud catalytic activity and its constituents was explored using synthetic sodalite. The red-mud catalysts exhibited a considerable aromatisation capacity compared to the thermal co-pyrolysis, as the selectivity towards monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 12.7 to 19.6%, respectively. Long-chain molecules cracking was more significant in synthetic sodalite associated with their acidic active sites. The addition of barium and calcium cations to the red-mud largely improved oxygen elimination as a result of the enhanced catalyst basicity. In contrast, the aromatisation ability of red-mud significantly impeded by the large cation size (Ba2+ and Ca2+) due to the limited diffusion of pyrolysis vapours to the active sites. Ba-exchanged red-mud catalysts reduced the content of carboxylic acids in the bio-oil to 1.8 % while maintained a high yield of the organic fraction (34 %). Ca-exchanged red-mud catalysts produced the lowest fraction of oxygenated compounds (35.1 %); however, the organic phase yield was as low as 23.6 %. The modified red-mud catalysts reduced the fraction of oxygenated compounds from 69.9–35.1% during the biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biogenic residues are a promising feedstock to produce liquid biofuels via chemical looping gasification (CLG), but they form ashes with a high inorganic matter content, thus causing agglomeration and deposition in CLG-fluidized beds made of oxygen carriers (OC). The aim of this work is to develop pretreatments for residual biomasses to prevent this issue. Raw forest pine (as a reference material) and wheat straw residues were considered. The latter were pretreated by torrefaction at 250, 260, or 270 °C and through the washing of torrefied biomasses. Torrefaction encouraged a de-chlorinating effect, while washing allowed the removal of 30-40% of S, 60-70% of K, and 40-50% of P. The analysis of pressure fluctuation signals (standard deviations and dominant frequencies) was utilized to verify the improvement of the performance of treated biomass in fluidized beds: three OCs were, respectively, coupled with ashes from all biomasses, then fluidized from 700 to 1000 °C at two and three times the minimum fluidization velocity. The diagnostic method used to analyze pressure fluctuations was shown to be effective for detecting the incipient fading of bubbling fluidization. This phenomenon was related to the agglomeration or the severe fragmentation of OC particles mixed with ashes, thanks to scanning electron microscopy and particle-size measurements. These characterizations and pressure fluctuations analyses confirmed the general improvement of wheat straw performances after pretreatments. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion of biomass into useful products is a promising route to harness biofuels. This process is clean, renewable and can reduce the use of fossil fuel. In this study, SuperPro Designer (SPD) software and response surface methodology (RSM) is used to simulate and optimize rice husk pyrolysis process. The SPD simulator was built to handle kinetics and stoichiometric reaction of lignocellulosic composition of rice husk into final products. The SPD simulation and RSM optimization were performed at a temperature ranging from 350 to 800 °C and residence time of 0.25−60 s. The simulated results were in agreement with product yield published in the literature at an average relative error of 6.8 %. The combined effect of temperature and residence time were analysed by using RSM and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A cubic model for bio-oil and quartic model for char and gas yield were proposed. The desirability function in Design-Expert showed that the optimum bio-oil yield (36.72 %) could be attained at a temperature 588 °C and a residence time 0.25 s while the optimum gas yield (73.25 %) could be achieved at a temperature 798.8 °C and a residence time 15.47 s. These findings therefore revealed that the energy content of the rice husk could be harnessed by pyrolysis/gasification to obtain substantial fuel products. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Three advanced biofuels, namely HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil), a glycerol-derived biofuel (Mo·bio) and biodiesel from oil industry wastes, were tested in a Euro 6 diesel vehicle equipped with a Lean NOx Trap under the worldwide harmonized light-duty vehicles test cycle (WLTC) at warm (24 °C) and cold (−7 °C) ambient temperature. HVO was tested pure, biodiesel was used both pure and blended at 20% (v/v) with a reference diesel fuel and Mo·bio was also blended with the diesel fuel at the same ratio. In order to analyse the sensitivity of the gaseous emissions and the aftertreatment efficiency to the type of fuel, emissions were measured upstream and downstream of the aftertreatment system and fuel-associated effects were isolated from those of the engine operating conditions (EGR rate, injection strategy and equivalence ratio). The energy consumption was not very different between fuels, although HVO led to a higher engine efficiency while biodiesel behaved oppositely at the low speed phase. Regarding NOx emissions, no differences were found between fuels while cold temperature led to higher NOx because of the lower EGR rate and the use of only high pressure EGR. Biodiesel and Mo·bio improved CO and THC engine-out emissions at warm temperature, but these compounds were deteriorated at low ambient conditions because of the poorer viscosity and volatility of these fuels. The DOC efficiency was higher for CO than for THC excepting the low speed phase, for which deposition of high molecular weight hydrocarbons could mask the results. The LNT efficiency was lower at cold conditions because of the high NOx engine-out emissions. Differences between fuels were only observed in the case of the DOC and during the engine warm-up period. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic co-pyrolysis of water hyacinth and scrap tire experiments were performed to evaluate the feasibility of improving the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons production. The production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 5.31% (sole pyrolysis of water hyacinth) to 13.11% (co-pyrolysis with scrap tire). With use of zeolites, the highest production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can reach up to 69.18%. Comprehensive comparison on catalytic effects of HZSM-5 and multilamellar MFI nanosheets were provided. With the material to multilamellar MFI nanosheets ratios changes from 2:1 to 1:4, the production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increases significantly from 37.15–69.18%. The average production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced by using multilamellar MFI nanosheets were 12.07% higher than that using HZSM-5, indicating the better performance of multilamellar MFI nanosheets in producing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This work provided a reference for the reuse of water hyacinth and scrap tire over multilamellar MFI nanosheets in energy field. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial lipids were produced by both rice straw hydrolysates and recycled pretreated glycerol. First, lipid fermentation of glucose via Cryptococcus curvatus was optimized by response surface methodology. Variables were selected by Plackett–Burman design, and optimized by central composite design, achieving 4.9 g/L total lipid and 0.16 g/g lipid yield, and increased further as glucose increased from 30 to 50 g/L. Secondly, after pretreatment, 72% lignin of rice straw was removed with glucose yield increased by 2.4 times to 74% at 20% substrate and 3 FPU/g. Subsequently, its hydrolysates produced high total lipid (8.8 g/L) and lipid yield (0.17 g/g). Finally, recycled glycerol reached the maximum total lipid of 7.2 g/L and high lipid yield of 0.16 g/g. Based on the calculation, 2.9 g total lipid would be produced from 1 g rice straw and the recycled glycerol, with a similar composition to soybean oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Isoprenoids are an abundant and diverse class of natural products with various applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and biofuel industries. A methanotroph-based biorefinery is an attractive scenario for the production of a variety of value-added compounds from methane, because methane is a promising alternative feedstock for industrial biomanufacturing. In this study, we metabolically engineered Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z for de novo synthesis of a sesquiterpenoid from methane, using α-humulene as a model compound, via optimization of the native methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Expression of codon-optimized α-humulene synthase from Zingiber zerumbet in M. alcaliphilum 20Z resulted in an initial yield of 0.04 mg/g dry cell weight. Overexpressing key enzymes (IspA, IspG, and Dxs) for debottlenecking of the MEP pathway increased α-humulene production 5.2-fold compared with the initial strain. Subsequently, redirecting the carbon flux through the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway resulted in an additional 3-fold increase in α-humulene production. Additionally, a genome-scale model using flux scanning based on enforced objective flux method was used to identify potential overexpression targets to increase flux towards isoprenoid production. Several target reactions from cofactor synthesis pathways were probed and evaluated for their effects on α-humulene synthesis, resulting in α-humulene yield up to 0.75 mg/g DCW with 18.8-fold enhancement from initial yield. This study first demonstrates production of a sesquiterpenoid from methane using methanotrophs as the biocatalyst and proposes potential strategies to enhance production of sesquiterpenoid and related isoprenoid products in engineered methanotrophic bacteria. © 2020 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - Different titanium (Ti) sources modified HZSM-5 coupled with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) were applied to upgrade biomass-derived vapors to prepare bio-fuels. Four objectives were included: (I) effects of different Ti species on active radicals were investigated, (II) effects of Ti sources on bio-fuel yield and properties were analyzed, (III) the availabilities of bio-fuels were evaluated from different composition angles, and (IV) the catalyst stabilities were characterized on different scales. The results showed that the interaction between low-valent titanium species and DBD could increase radicals. The rutile modification (TiRH5) had no positive effect on bio-fuel production, while the anatase modification (TiAH5) could induce photo-catalysis by coupling with DBD to increase both the yield (17.26%) and high heating value (HHV) (35.56 MJ/kg). The low-valent Ti modification (Ti3H5) further increased the yield to 17.77% and HHV to 36.47 MJ/kg, benefiting from the MAHs increase and the integration of more hydrogen-radicals under multiple interactions, while the conventional titanium dioxide (TiO2) modification (Ti4H5) lacked the catalytic effects. The bio-fuel from TiAH5 catalysis had potential for producing gasoline additives or substitutes, while the bio-fuel from Ti3H5 catalysis tended to become diesel additives or substitutes. The induced photo-catalysis and multiple interactions improved the stabilities of TiAH5 and Ti3H5, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite the increasing interest in upgrading biomass-derived molecules to value-added products, the electrochemical conversion of biomass platform chemicals to highly valuable biofuels, such as jet fuel, has not yet received wide attention. Herein, we report a catalyst-free electrochemical route for the production of a jet fuel precursor, hydrofuroin, from the electrohydrodimerization of furfural, which can be readily derived from lignocellulose and already has an industrial production of 300 000 tons per year. Detailed electrochemical studies using carbon and copper electrodes at various pH values enabled us to probe the reduction mechanism of furfural and obtain the kinetic details, such as the diffusion constant and electron transfer rate. Preparative electrolysis in a batch electrolyzer achieved a high yield of hydrofuroin (94%) with an excellent faradaic efficiency of 93%. Finally, a flow electrolyzer was employed to demonstrate the great promise of large-scale production of hydrofuroin from the electrohydrodimerization of furfural.

AB  - In this study, the effects of different biochar catalysts on the quality of bio-oil derived from the co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) and rice husk (RH) are explored. Catalysts include SS biochar (SWC), RH biochar (RHC), mixed SS and RH biochar (SRC), and RH ash (RHA). The quality of bio-oil was evaluated based on the results of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS; including the contents of hydrocarbons and N-species), oxygen content, higher heating value, and pH. The GC–MS analysis results illustrated that N-species content in the bio-oil reduced with the addition of the biochar catalyst, while the hydrocarbons content increased from 15.51% for co-pyrolysis to 38.74–61.84% for different biochar catalysts at a catalytic temperature of 650 °C. RHC exhibited the best catalytic effect in terms of decreasing the content of N-species by 58.79% and increasing the content of hydrocarbons by nearly four times compared to co-pyrolysis. The higher heating value of bio-oil raised from 25.75 to 34.67 MJ/kg, while oxygen content decreased from 31.1 to 8.81 wt%, and the pH increased from 4.06 to 5.48. Moreover, the catalytic mechanism of catalytic co-pyrolysis over RHC, including the hydrocarbon generation pathway and nitrogen removal, is also discussed here. High specific surface area of RHC provides sufficient active sites (e.g. O-containing and N-containing functional groups) for the catalytic reaction of pyrolytic intermediates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has been widely considered as an alternative fuel for aircraft and power generation turbine engines, but experimentation in literature is mostly limited to microturbines and technological challenges remain open regarding its sustainability. The present study publishes the experimental methodology and the obtained results of testing a full-scale turbojet engine J69-T-25A using blends of JetA1 and palm oil biodiesel with volume contents from 0% to 50%. An increased biodiesel FAME substitution and extended data analysis yields new findings. Biodiesel substitution up to 50% v/v drops the thrust force by 26,6% and raises the fuel consumption by 10,8%, causing a detriment in the efficiency near 76,3%. Albeit poor atomization is noticed, the rise in the excess air of combustion diminishes the CO and HC emissions. An optimum trade-off value of 15,8% of biodiesel volume content is found to avoid a significant reduction of efficiency and acceleration time, driving to a slight reduction in the GHG-emissions and a raise of 25% in the fuel costs. The employment of a biodiesel content above 30% harms the ignition at the start-up procedure of the engine and fosters cloudiness development at the exhaust gases during the shutdown. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transformation of renewable biomass into value-added chemicals and biofuels has evolved to be a vital field of research in recent years. Accurate estimation of reducing sugars post pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass has been very inconsistent. For a few decades, 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay has been widely employed for the estimation of reducing sugars derived from pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. This assay tests for the presence of free carbonyl group (C=O), the so-called reducing sugars. This involves the oxidation of the aldehyde functional group present to the corresponding acid while DNS is simultaneously reduced to 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid under alkaline conditions. However, the presence of other active carbonyl groups can potentially also react with DNS leading to incorrect yields of reducing sugars. Therefore, a detailed study has been carried out to evaluate the influence of active carbonyl compounds like furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) in the overall estimation of reducing sugars (glucose, xylose and arabinose) by DNS assay. In addition to this, reducing sugars estimation in the presence of furans were also investigated, it reveals that reducing sugars estimation was found to be 68% higher than actual sugars. Therefore, current findings strongly indicate that the employment of DNS assay for quantifying the reducing sugars in the presence of furans is not appropriate. © 2020

AB  - Energy cane bagasse (ECB) is the major residue after the cane is milled to extract juice for sugar, biochemical, and/or biofuel production. The sustainable conversion of ECB into high value-added products can help reduce agricultural waste, and enhance utilization of bioresources. In the present work, we demonstrate that ECB can be converted into cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) that can serve as high value-added additives in bentonite water-based fluids (BT-WDFs). Particularly, cellulose fibers (CFs) were rapidly isolated from ECB by microwave-assisted NaOH / NaClO2 treatments. CFs treated with the higher NaOH concentration and microwave irradiation lost more lignin (96.2 % delignification) and their crystal structure was more completely transformed from cellulose I to II, resulting in smaller diameters (8.5 μm). CNFs suspensions from subsequent wet-grinding and microfluidization of the CFs exhibited typical shear-thinning behaviors and solid-like viscoelastic properties due to the entangled network structure of the CNFs. Formulated fluids with 0.5 wt% of the manufactured CNFs showed good rheological and filtration properties, demonstrating their potential applications in the oil service industry. © 2020

AB  - The present study targeted towards the feasibility of various agricultural residues for bio-hythane production by anaerobic digestion (AD) process without pre-treatment. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) analysis was carried out for mixed fruit waste (MFW), mixed vegetable waste (MVW), sugarcane bagasse (SB), rice husk (RH), and wheat straw (WS). The analysis of gas was carried out in gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD). The BMP test results in the study for SB, MFW, and MVW reveal that the average percentage value of bio-hythane production was 53.64%, 43.54%, and 40.92% and that of RH and WS was 16.74% and 29.75%, respectively. The result also shows that agricultural biomass, such as WS and RH produces less % of bio-hythane due to the presence of lignocellulosic components. The main contribution of this study is to highlight the bio-hythane potential with reference to the bio-methane and bio-hydrogen productions from the agricultural residues. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was synthesized from a reaction of waste cooking oil (WCO) and methanol in the presence of catalyst which was derived from chicken bone and coconut residue in a packed bed reactor. Calcium oxide (CaO) was extracted from calcined chicken bone and nano-crystal cellulose (NCC) was isolated from coconut residue by acid hydrolyzed and were supported with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The catalyst was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to study its elemental composition and surface morphology. The parameters used for the reaction were optimized by Design of Experiment (DOE) using Central Composite Design (CCD) to maximize the biodiesel yield. The maximum yield of 98.40% was obtained at optimum temperature, methanol to oil and catalyst loading of 65 °C, 6:1 and 0.5 wt%, respectively. Investigation on the kinetic of the reaction specified that the reaction followed pseudo first order reaction with k-value ranged from 0.0092 min−1 to 0.0151 cm−1 and Thiele modulus was less than 2. The activation energy Ea for the transesterification reaction was 45.72 kJ/mol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Variants of the highly active [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from D. vulgaris Hildenborough that exhibit enhanced O2 tolerance were used as H2-oxidation catalysts in H2/O2 biofuel cells. Two [NiFeSe] variants were electrically wired by means of low-potential viologen-modified redox polymers and evaluated with respect to H2-oxidation and stability against O2 in the immobilized state. The two variants showed maximum current densities of (450±84) μA cm−2 for G491A and (476±172) μA cm−2 for variant G941S on glassy carbon electrodes and a higher O2 tolerance than the wild type. In addition, the polymer protected the enzyme from O2 damage and high-potential inactivation, establishing a triple protection for the bioanode. The use of gas-diffusion bioanodes provided current densities for H2-oxidation of up to 6.3 mA cm−2. Combination of the gas-diffusion bioanode with a bilirubin oxidase-based gas-diffusion O2-reducing biocathode in a membrane-free biofuel cell under anode-limiting conditions showed unprecedented benchmark power densities of 4.4 mW cm−2 at 0.7 V and an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V even at moderate catalyst loadings, outperforming the previously reported system obtained with the [NiFeSe] wild type and the [NiFe] hydrogenase from D. vulgaris Miyazaki F. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Formic acid is obtained in equimolar amount with levulinic acid during the hydrolysis of cellulose and thus can be used as a sustainable hydrogen source in the direct levulinic acid hydrogenation towards gamma-valerolactone (biofuel additive). Ag[sbnd]Pd catalysts prepared by various methods and containing different Ag:Pd ratio were investigated in this context. By combining activity tests, characterization of the main physicochemical properties of the catalysts and DFT study of formic acid decomposition, the key factors responsible for the activity of Ag[sbnd]Pd catalysts in both the formic acid decomposition and the subsequent hydrogenation of levulinic acid were specified. Pd is shown to be active, but prone to poisoning by CO, while the CO poisoning remains limited on diluted Ag[sbnd]Pd alloy with strong intermetallic interaction, where its adsorption is very weak thanks to the isolation of Pd atoms. Therefore, the catalyst containing 4%Ag-1%Pd/AlOOH showed the highest selectivity in formic acid decomposition as well as the highest activity in levulinic acid hydrogenation (34% conversion in 5 h at 190 °C). © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In gas/solid conditions, different chemicals, such as diethylether, ethylene, butadiene, higher hydrocarbons, acetaldehyde, acetone and hydrogen, can be produced from ethanol with heterogeneous catalytic processes. The focus of this paper is the interplay of different reaction paths, which depend on thermodynamic factors as well as on kinetic factors, thus mainly from catalyst functionalities and reaction temperatures. Strategies for selectivity improvements in heterogeneously catalyzed processes converting (bio)ethanol into renewable chemicals and biofuels are also considered. © 2020 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioethanol production from syngas using acetogenic bacteria has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, low ethanol yield is the biggest challenge that prevents the commercialization of syngas fermentation into biofuels using microbial catalysts. The present study demonstrated that ethanol metabolism plays an important role in recycling NADH/NADμ during autotrophic growth. Deletion of bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE) genes leads to significant growth deficiencies in gas fermentation. Using specific fermentation technology in which the gas pressure and pH were constantly controlled at 0.1 MPa and 6.0, respectively, we revealed that ethanol was formed during the exponential phase, closely accompanied by biomass production. Then, ethanol was oxidized to acetate via the aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase pathway in Clostridium ljungdahlii. A metabolic experiment using 13Clabeled ethanol and acetate, redox balance analysis, and comparative transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that ethanol production and reuse shared the metabolic pathway but occurred at different growth phases. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Production of biodiesel from lipids of Serratia sp. ISTD04 by lipase of Pseudomonas sp. ISTPL3 immobilised on biocomposite materials to increase the enzyme stability and reusability was studied. Lipase extracted, partially purifiedand immobilized onto activated biochar, impregnated with calcite obtained from biomineralization-based conversion of CO2 from ISTD04, and bioactive ceramics materials, Na2Ca2Si3O9 prepared by chemical process. The composition, structure and texture of biocomposite materials determined by SEM and EDS methods. The composition of synthesized biodiesel was determined by GC–MS. The results imply that the immobilized lipase on activated biochar impregnated with calcite gave the maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME:97.41%) followed by immobilized lipase on biochar (FAME:94.91), immobilized lipase on glass-ceramic (FAME:91.50%) and NaOH (FAME:85.63%). The reusability of lipase immobilized on activated biochar impregnated with calcite retained 75.11%and 50% catalytic activity after 5 and 10 cycles of transesterification reaction, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conventional synthesis of monolith-supported zeolite catalysts is based on a hydrothermal strategy. Here, we report a solvent-free crystallization process to coat ZSM-5 zeolite crystals on a monolithic SiC foam with a honeycomb structure (ZSM-5/SiC). Characterizations of the ZSM-5/SiC by scanning electron microscopy, N2 sorption, and X-ray diffraction indicate that the zeolite sheath has been ideally coated on the surface of the SiC foam with high purity and crystallinity. Fixing Pd nanoparticles within the ZSM-5 zeolite crystals delivers a bifunctional Pd@ZSM-5/SiC catalyst, which exhibits high activity and selectivity toward diesel range paraffins in the hydrodeoxygenation of methyl oleate, a model molecule for biofuel. In comparison to the powder Pd@ZSM-5, the Pd@ZSM-5/SiC monolith catalyst shows more efficiency, which is attributed to the fast mass transfer and high heat conductivity on the honeycomb SiC structure. The durability test indicates that the Pd@ZSM-5/SiC catalyst is stable under the reaction and high-temperature regeneration conditions. © 2020 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource existing, and presently it is considered as a promising feedstock for the synthesis of green chemicals and biofuels for reducing transportation emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. In this research, a TCR (thermo-catalytic reforming) reactor is used to transform lignocellulosic biomass into high quality bio-oils, biochar and syngas. Sugarcane bagasse (SB) and oat hulls (OHS) were processed in the TCR (2 kg/h) at 450 °C in the intermediate pyrolysis reactor (kept constant) and varying reforming temperature between 500 and 700 °C. This paper studies the conversion potential of SB and OHS into sustainable bioproducts at different reforming temperatures. TCR oils contained the highest calorific value of 34.9 MJ/kg from SB and 35.0 MJ/kg from OHS at 700 °C which makes the bio-oil suitable to be applied as fuel for engines when compared to bio-oils produced from other pyrolysis technologies. SB and OHS pyrolysis gas at 700 °C contained higher H2 yield 30.9 vol% and 31.6 vol%, respectively. The highest gas caloric values of SB and OHS were 18.4 MJ/kg and 18.8 MJ/kg at the same reforming temperatures, respectively. Overall, the TCR results of SB and OHS are promising for waste conversion into sustainable fuels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic conversion of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfuraldehyde (HMF, a biomass-derived platform chemical) into ethyl levulinate (EL) is an attractive approach for producing renewable transport fuels for mitigating global warming. We report here the application of hierarchical zeolites (DZSM-5 and MZSM-5 synthesized by desilication and mesoporous templating approaches, respectively) as solid acid catalysts for this transformation. Hierarchical structure of these zeolites was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen-physisorption and electron microscopy, and acidity was determined by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia. HMF conversion of 94.2% with EL selectivity of 90.8% was achieved over the MZSM-5 catalyst. Acidity, pore size and surface properties affected the catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel derived from biomass is a renewable source of fuel, and global application of biodiesel in the transport sector has rapidly expanded over the last decade. However, effort has been made to overcome its main shortcoming, i.e., efficiency and exhaust emission characteristics (NOx emissions) in unmodified diesel engines. Biodiesel combustion generally results in lower unburned hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) in exhaust emissions compared to fossil diesel. In this study, various biodiesel blends (Chlorella vulgaris, Jatropha curcus, and Calophyllum inophyllum) were investigated for fuel characteristics, and engine performance with exhaust emission compared to diesel. Chlorella vulgaris, Jatropha curcus, and Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel were synthesized by the acid–base transesterification approach in a microwave reactor and blended with conventional diesel fuel by volume. The fuel blends were denoted as MB10 (90% diesel + 10% microalgae biodiesel), MB20 (80% diesel + 20% microalgae biodiesel), JB10 (90% diesel + 10% jatropha biodiesel), JB20 (80% diesel + 20% jatropha biodiesel), PB10 (90% diesel + 10% polanga biodiesel) and PB20 (80% diesel + 20% polanga biodiesel). Experiments were performed using these fuel blends with a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine at different loads. It was shown in the results that, at rated load, thermal efficiency of the engine decreased from 34.6% with diesel to 34.1%, 33.7%, 34.1%, 34.0%, 33.9%, and 33.5% with MB10, MB20, JB10, JB20, PB10, and PB20 fuels, respectively. Unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and smoke emissions improved with third-generation fuels (MB10, MB20) in comparison to base diesel fuel and second-generation fuels (JB10, JB20, PB10 and PB20). Oxides of nitrogen emissions were slightly increased with both the third-and second-generation fuels as compared to the base diesel. The combustion behavior of microalgae biodiesel was also very close to diesel fuels. In the context of comparable engine performance, emissions, and combustion characteristics, along with biofuel production yield (per year per acre), microalgae biodiesel could have a great potential as a next-generation sustainable fuel in compression engine (CI) engines compared to jatropha and polanga biodiesel fuels. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This study is the first to integrate gamma-valerolactone/water (GVL/water) pretreatment with anaerobic digestion (AD) for biogas production and lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) synthesis. The hydrothermal treatment was conducted at 135 to 180 °C with GVL at 0 to 90%. After pretreatment, the compositions of hybrid pennisetum were changed with the removal of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose to different extent. Subsequent anaerobic digestion achieved a maximal specific methane yield of 228.00 ± 4.37 mL/g VS, compared with that at 165.11 ± 1.99 mL/g VS for the control. The highest actual methane yield (150 mL/g RM) was achieved by pretreatment with GVL/water (50/50) at 150 °C for 90 min. LNPs at 200 to 2000 nm were synthesized from the liquid waste with a yield at ~4 mg/mL. The mass balance of this integrated method was discussed. In general, the maximal valorisation of hybrid pennisetum was achieved based on a catalyst-free of GVL/water pretreatment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipid-rich microalgae are a potential source for the bio-oil production. We isolated a novel oleaginous Thraustochytrid microalga from seawater, Schizochytrium sp. ABC101, and tested the effect of different growth conditions on its production of lipids. Batch fermentation experiments indicated that depletion of nitrogen led to lipid accumulation, and lipid accumulation led to increased cell size and decreased cell wall thickness. Based on these results, we tested three types of fed-batch fermentations (carbon and no nitrogen feeding, carbon and limited nitrogen feeding, carbon and sufficient nitrogen feeding) to examine the effect of adjusting the nitrogen supply on lipid accumulation. The limited nitrogen feeding provided the most efficient lipid production, with maxima after 60 h (dry cell weight [DCW]: 64.7 g/L, lipids: 25.4 g/L, docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]: 11.0 g/L). Use of corn steep liquor (CSL) as the sole nitrogen source also led to excellent performance, with maxima at 84 h (DCW: 86.0 g/L, lipids: 37.2 g/L, DHA: 16.7 g/L). In addition, use of CSL rather than yeast extract reduced the lipid production cost by 50%. Our results suggest that regulation of the nitrogen source improves the efficiency of microalgal lipid production and use of a low-cost nitrogen source reduces production costs. © 2020

AB  - Based on a circular bioeconomy strategy, eucalypt wood fines rejected from a Kraft pulp line were used as starting material in a pilot-scaled fast-pyrolysis process. The bio-oil and its coproducts were characterized regarding their physical, chemical, and thermal aspects. We put in perspective their properties to bring forward considerations for applications on biofuels, materials, and precursors. The yields of the pilot-scaled fast-pyrolysis process reached interesting values even if compared with optimized laboratory conditions. The results indicated the highest heating values (22–27 MJ/kg) for bio-oil, char, and crust material. The higher water content of aqueous extract had a negative effect for its application as fuel. The lignin/carbohydrate ratio for the bio-oil (2.82) and aqueous extract (0.53) identified a higher concentration of lignin-derived compounds in the first, mainly syringyl units. Bio-oil and aqueous extract presented chemical compounds with many functionalities, such as syringaldehyde and levoglucosan, expanding their potential application for higher value-added products besides energy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The study aimed to utilize the industrial spent seaweed biomass (SSB) for effective ethanol production using yeast as a fermenting microorganism. Pretreatment of SSB was optimized using different acids. The highest percentage of spent biomass was obtained from G. corticata (12.53 ± 2.66% DW). The proximate, ultimate and biochemical constituents of spent biomass were calculated. The total sugar (440 ± 40 mg/g DW), reducing sugar (129.85 ± 10.23 mg/g DW) and protein (11.08 ± 0.11 mg/g DW) content of SSB were analysed. Pretreatment was optimized using three different acids. The effect of different pH (4.5, 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0) and temperature (30 and 35 °C) on ethanol production using baker's and MTCC yeast was studied. At 35 °C, the maximum (4.85% w/w) ethanol production was achieved in a fermentation process maintained at pH 4.5 and 5.0 at 24 h and 72 h, respectively. Substrate fermented with MTCC yeast recorded the maximum production of ethanol (4.98% w/w) at pH 4.5 within 48 h. The fermentation process was scaled up to 300 mL for ethanol production, and achieved 3.75% w/w ethanol (72 h, pH 5.5). To conclude, in future SSB would be a potential renewable novel substrate for bioethanol production when compared to other lignocellulosic substrates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil has several undesired fuel properties such as high viscosity, high acidity, high molecular weight, instability, and phase separation upon aging. Further, the high oxygen content (typically 45–50 wt%) and the water content (typically 15–30 wt%) of pyrolysis oil result in a lower energy density than conventional fuel oils. Whole bio-oil from the fast pyrolysis of birch bark is phase separated at room temperature, probably because of the high extractive content of the bark. It prevents the application of bio-oil derived from birch bark as a fuel. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to investigate the application of fractional condensation of pyrolysis vapors as a promising method to obtain bio-oils that are more resistant to aging. Bio-oil vapors were separated into three cuts: a hard solid in the first condenser, a viscous oily cut (“second condenser cut”) in the second condenser/electrostatic precipitator, and a water-rich acidic liquid in the third condenser. It was found that fractional condensation is an effective method to separate water, acids and other low molecular weight reactive components from bio-oil and is a promising downstream approach to control the quality of bio-oils, making it more suitable for further upgrading and/or direct application. Performing fractional condensation and mixing the second condenser oil fraction with 25% isopropanol yields a very stable liquid fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is an indispensable and important reaction in the fuel production process. Generally, the catalysts for HDO contain metal or acidic active sites, and the co-existence of them can significantly promote the HDO performance. While the subtle interaction between metal and acidic active sites is still not very clear. Herein, a series of Ru-based catalysts with different supports were prepared by photochemical method to obtain both of the high Ru dispersion and the moderate acidity. Among the catalysts with various supports, Ru/TiO2–Al2O3 showed the most efficient performance in the HDO process of phenolic compounds. Guaiacol was converted into cyclohexane with above 90% selectivity at 240 °C. Other typical phenolic compounds, including phenol, anisole, p-cresol, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, benzofuran, eugenol and dibenzyl ether, were all transformed into the corresponding cycloalkanes with yield close to 100%. The synergistic effect between highly dispersed Ru and moderate acid site played the key role for the enhanced production of hydrocarbon fuels. Moreover, this catalytic system was also effective on the raw bio-oil upgradation for producing high yield of hydrocarbons and alkylphenols, which has the potential to be used as biofuels. © 2019 Energy Institute

AB  - Biodiesel was prepared at laboratory scale via transesterification reaction from waste cooking oil using Sr-Ti mixed metal oxide as a heterogeneous base catalyst. The solid base catalyst was synthesized by polymer precursor method. The most efficient active phase of catalyst was explored by varying the Sr/Ti atomic ratio in mixed metals oxides. The synthesized catalyst underwent for TGA, Powder XRD, SEM, EDX, FT-IR, XPS, and BET surface area analysis to assess its physicochemical characteristics. Additionally, basicity which has been observed as the most process governing factor was also evaluated through Hammett indicator-benzoic acid titration method. The Sr-Ti mixed metals oxide with 4:1 was observed with highest catalytic activity for methanolysis reaction. Its potency was facilitated by fairly acquired BET surface area (43.6 m2/g) and basic strength (2.89 mmol/g). The appreciable values of both the parameters imparted the high catalytic activity in Sr-Ti mixed metals oxide with atomic ratio 4:1. Onward, transesterification reaction was optimized for the maximum FAME conversion through RSM using CCD. The confirmatory tests showed the consistency with the conclusions drawn from RSM study regarding optimized values of concerned process variables. Transesterification reaction turned out 98% FAME conversion exerting catalyst dose (1.0 wt%), methanol to oil molar ratio (11:1), and reaction time (80 min) at reaction temperature (65 °C) and agitation speed (600 rpm) featured by RSM study. The closeness in optimized value of anticipated and confirmatory results perceived the efficiency of CCD and approving its potency as successful tool to estimate the highest FAME conversion. Next, a pseudo-first-order kinetic model of transesterification reaction was established. In addition to this, the thermodynamic functions were also computed through Eyring plot dictating the non-spontaneity and endergonic nature of transesterification reaction. The Environment-factor (E-factor) and Turn Over Frequency (TOF) were enumerated and they approved the prepared Sr-Ti mixed metals oxide as an efficient and sustainable catalyst for biodiesel production through transesterification. Finally, all the important fuel properties of prepared biodiesel from waste cooking oil was discerned within the range laid by ASTM D-6751 standards for biodiesel which coined the compatibility of prepared methyl ester with CI engines as a substitute of diesel fuel. © 2020

AB  - The objective of the present study is the assessment of the environmental impact of a bivalent (bi-fuel) vehicle, running either on gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG). To that aim, a Euro 6 passenger car was tested under various real-world driving conditions. In order to cover the full range of conventional powertrains currently in the market, the tests were also repeated on a Euro 6 diesel passenger car. Both cars were driven in two routes, the first complying with the regulation limits and the second going beyond them. Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particle number (PN) emissions were recorded using a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS). Apart from the aggregated emission levels, in g/km, the exact emission location along the route was also assessed. Natural gas proved beneficial for CO and PN emissions, the level of which always remained below the respective legislation limits. On the other hand, under the dynamic driving conditions with gasoline, the relevant limits were exceeded. Cold start, occurring at the beginning of the urban part, and motorway driving were identified as major contributors to total emissions, especially in gasoline mode. However, the application of natural gas was associated with a penalty in NOx emissions, which were significantly increased as compared to gasoline. Local peaks within the urban part were identified in CNG mode. In any case, the diesel vehicle was by far the highest NOx emitter. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) of spent coffee ground (SCG) and cellulose over HZSM-5 and HY was characterized thermogravimetrically, and a catalytic pyrolysis of two samples was conducted using a tandem micro reactor that directly connected with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To access the more fundamental investigations on CCP, the effects of the zeolite pore structure, reaction temperature, in-situ/ex-situ reaction mode, catalyst to feedstock ratio, and the SCG and cellulose mixing ratio were experimentally evaluated. The temperature showing the highest thermal degradation rate of cellulose with SCG slightly delayed due to the interactions during the thermolysis of two samples. HZSM-5 in reference to HY produced more aromatic hydrocarbons from CCP. With respect to the reaction temperature, the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons increased with the pyrolytic temperature. Moreover, the in-situ/ex-situ reaction mode, catalyst/feedstock, and cellulose/SCG ratio were optimized to improve the aromatic hydrocarbon yield. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles are promising materials for enzyme immobilization, since they provide a high specific surface area for enzyme loading and can also be modified with metal ions (HA-Me2+) to enable interaction with proteins. The adsorption of proteins on HA-Me2+ has been explored for purification purposes, while the use of this material as a support for the immobilization of enzymes remains to be further investigated. Xylanase is an enzyme of considerable industrial interest, being used in the biofuel, pharmaceutical, pulp, and food &amp; beverage sectors, among others. The immobilization of xylanase can enable recovery of the enzyme after biocatalysis, so that it can be reused several times, hence reducing the costs of industrial processes. Here, a systematic study was performed of the immobilization of xylanase on HA nanoparticles modified with metal ions (Cu2+ and Ni2+). A simple, fast, and efficient immobilization protocol was established using statistical experimental design as a tool, generating derivatives by interactions involving complexation of metals of the support with electron donor groups of the enzyme. The affinity towards xylanase was higher for the HA-Cu2+ support, compared to HA and HA-Ni2+. The pH and temperature profiles for the immobilized enzyme activity remained the same as for the soluble enzyme, indicating that the xylanase did not undergo major changes in its conformational state after immobilization. The HA-Cu2+ support was the most effective in reuse assays, retaining up to 80% activity in the second cycle. The results showed that xylanase could be immobilized on HA nanoparticles modified with Cu2+ and Ni2+ metal ions, using a simple and effective method, indicating the promising potential of the system for applications in different industrial processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the current methods of converting pyrolysis oil and its aqueous phase into more useful biofuels with higher heating value is by the steam reforming technique. In this study, a thermodynamic model for the steam reforming of the aqueous phase of biomass bio-oil was developed. The optimal values of the process parameters for the steam reforming of the aqueous phase of biomass bio-oil are reforming temperature of 773 °C, reforming pressure of 1 atm and steam-to-oil ratio of 20 kg/kg. The synthesis gas obtained at optimal conditions has a hydrogen gas content of 76%, carbon dioxide content of 22%, carbon monoxide content of 2% and only trace quantities of methane. For a theoretical feed of 100 kg/h bio-oil, a water flow rate of 2000 kg/h will be required. Simulation showed that overall gas yield under such feed rate at optimal conditions will generate 131.3 kg/h synthesis gas (with 76% H2 content) and 1968.7 kg/h of condensate water. The interaction of the factors with regard to all chemical species was also extensively investigated. © 2019, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Lignin valorization to chemicals is an important component of creating economically viable biofuels production from lignocellulosic biomass. Any such strategy should aim at producing chemicals used at scales that can appropriately match lignin availability. Herein, a combined pyrolysis and low-pressure hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process configuration is proposed to achieve total oxygen removal and obtain hydrocarbon (aromatic and alkene) products. This approach is tested for its robustness for lignin feedstocks obtained from a variety of sources and extracted using different procedures. The experimental results demonstrate that regardless of the lignin source, the HDO process using a MoO3 catalyst was able to funnel the complex mixture of pyrolysis vapors to mono-aromatics (17-29 C%), as well as alkenes and alkanes. The formation of char from lignin pyrolysis retains more than 50% of the feed carbon in the pyrolyzer, allowing only a portion of carbon to volatilize and be converted to products. A partial depolymerization technique is employed on one of the lignin samples prior to pyrolysis as an example of how the amount of char can be drastically reduced leading to an increased yield of aromatics (53-55 C%). Techno-economic analysis based on the experimental results suggest significant economic benefit of this strategy compared to using lignin as simply a boiler feed. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Substitution of fossil energy sources for bio-based ones will require development of efficient processes that can convert inedible and preferably low-value fractions that currently are not used into high-value products. It is desirable that such processes are developed so that both current logistics and infrastructure can be used. Bark, which is the outer layer of woody biomass, is currently burnt in a low-value process or left in the forests to decay and is therefore considered waste. In this work, birch (Betula pendula) bark was converted to hydrocarbons suitable for use in both road and aviation fuels in two efficient steps. Development of an efficient, recyclable, salt- A nd metal-free solvent-based system to solubilize birch bark under benign reaction conditions was a key outcome. The obtained gum was composed of organosolv lignin and suberin oligomers and was fully characterized. This gum had unique properties and could be directly processed in a conventional hydroprocessing unit set-up to afford hydrocarbons in the road and aviation fuel ranges. Life cycle assessment was applied to evaluate different scenarios for implementing this technology. When using bark generated as a forestry by-product and current infrastructure in a pulp mill, the process had a favorable low carbon dioxide footprint for biofuel generation.

AB  - Aims: The present work aims to explore a new oleaginous Fusarium isolate potential to accumulate lipids in its biomass from inexpensive substrates. In addition, impacts of carbon and nitrogen sources and their ratios on lipid production by the interested fungal isolate were also studied. Methods and Results: Lipid was assayed by sulfo-phospho-vanillin colorimetric method. Among 11 Fusarium isolates obtained on potato dextrose agar from rhizosphereic soils, Fusarium RAS18 was selected as the highest producer that accumulates above 20% lipid. It was identified based on phenotypic characterization and the internal transcribed spacer sequence as Fusarium solani, that was recorded in the GenBank database under the accession number MK167372.1. The optimized lipid yield (34·5%) is obtained using glycerol (35 g l−1) and peptone (1·5 g l−1) as carbon and nitrogen sources respectively. The produced fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) is composed of linoleic acid (56·81%), palmitic acid (17·81%), oleic acid (11·81%) and stearic acid (11·12). The unsaturated fatty acids accounted for 69% and this is nearly similar to the plant oils commonly used in biodiesel production. Conclusions: These findings suggest the applicability of F. solani RAS18 as a promising strain to accumulate lipids from glycerol as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Significance and Impact of the Study: Fusarium solani RAS18 is a new oleaginous fungal isolate that is able to produce lipid (34·5%, g g−1) from glycerol. Glycerol is a cheap substrate and is formed as a byproduct from transesterification process and others industries. Thus, recyclation of glycerol for lipid production by micro-organisms is an important point of economic view. Direct transesterification of the produced fatty acids indicated its similarity to the plant oil composition used in biodiesel production. So, F. solani RAS18 might be a potential lipid source as a feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - The utilization of novel materials within the scope of biofuel synthesis has been represented as a significant step in the development of remarkable catalysts. The use of lipases in biodiesel production is often found as a cost-limiting step, as the operational expenditures in recovering such catalysts may lead to unfeasible market expectations. Herein, magnetic-polymer composites were evaluated as supports to immobilize commercial lipase, following the application in ethyl ester syntheses. A matrix of polysiloxane-polyvinyl alcohol (SiO2-PVA) was selected as the polymeric structure, following Fe3O4 and γFe2O3 coating and incorporation assays to the support backbone. Characterization of the produced catalyst support materials was performed via analysis of X-ray powder diffraction, pore size, Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Burkholderia cepacia was then immobilized on the matrices, following transesterification of coconut oil with ethanol. The biodiesel samples generated were all within commercial standards, achieving conversion ester contents higher than 96.5%. The purified product samples (biodiesel) were essentially odorless and translucent appearance. Other properties such as density (873–876 kg m−3) and viscosity (3.76–3.93 mm2 s−1) meet the specifications required by the ASTM to be used as a biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper describes the application of chromium(III) terephthalate (Cr-Tp) and cobalt(II) terephthalate (Co-Tp) metal organic frameworks, as heterogeneous acid catalysts to avoid the yield reduction caused by saponification during the process of biodiesel production using Calophyllum inophyllum oil. The catalysts were mainly characterized using spectroscopic (FTIR), microscopic (SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and X-ray diffractive techniques. The surface acidity and the thermal stability of the catalysts were determined using Hammett indicator and thermo-gravimetric methods, respectively. The catalysts were employed for the pre-esterification of free fatty acid content of the oil before subjecting the oil for the transesterification of its triglyceraldehyde content. The pre-esterification was performed through a couple of successive catalytic cycles under milder conditions [25°, 1 atm, and 2/1 MeOH/oil (w/w) ratio] than the conditions reported so far. The study revealed that the successful pre-esterification required these catalysts in very small amount (&lt; 2.5% by oil weight) and occurred within very short time (2 h for the 1st cycle and 2–4 h for the 2nd cycle), reducing the acid value of C. inophyllum oil significantly (88%) from 56.91 to ~ 6.5 mg KOH g−1. The catalytic activity of these catalysts remained unchanged even after the 10th cycle of catalyst reuse. More importantly, the yield of biodiesel obtained from C. inophyllum oil in this way was significantly high (~ 93%) and free from saponification. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel and flavor compound production using enzymatic transesterification by microbial lipases provides mild reaction conditions and low energy cost compared to the chemical process. SGNH-type lipases are very effective catalysts for enzymatic transesterification due to their high reaction rate, great stability, relatively small size for convenient genetic manipulations, and ease of immobilization. Hence, it is highly important to identify novel SGNH-type lipases with high catalytic efficiencies and good stabilities. Results: A promiscuous cold-adapted SGNH-type lipase (HaSGNH1) from Halocynthiibacter arcticus was catalytically characterized and functionally explored. HaSGNH1 displayed broad substrate specificity that included tert-butyl acetate, glucose pentaacetate, and p-nitrophenyl esters with excellent stability and high efficiency. Important amino acids (N83, M86, R87, F131, and I173F) around the substrate-binding pocket were shown to be responsible for catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and reaction kinetics. Moreover, immobilized HaSGNH1 was used to produce high yields of butyl and oleic esters. Conclusions: This work provides a molecular understanding of substrate specificities, catalytic regulation, immobilization, and industrial applications of a promiscuous cold-adapted SGNH-type lipase (HaSGNH1) from H. arcticus. This is the first analysis on biodiesel and flavor synthesis using a cold-adapted halophilic SGNH-type lipase from a Halocynthiibacter species. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This study developed a new catalyst-free process for producing ethyl levulinate, a biofuel additive. Noncatalytic levulinic acid esterification with ethanol using microwave irradiation (MW) was compared with that using traditional heating (TH) under different reaction conditions. The results demonstrated that the esterification process using MW was more effective than that using TH. A reaction conversion of 90.38% was obtained for the esterification using MW at 473 K and reaction time of 3 hours. Moreover, this study established a model for depicting the kinetics of levulinic acid esterification using MW and TH. A good fit to the data (R2 of &gt;.9999) was achieved, indicating the validity of the developed model. The rate constants and pre-exponential factor obtained for the esterification using MW were greater than those obtained using TH. Consequently, the microwave-assisted noncatalytic synthesis is a green and promising method for preparing ethyl levulinate. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - 5-HMF is a platform chemical that can be used in many applications such as biofuels, monomers, industrial feed stocks, etc. In this work 5-HMF was synthesized from glucose in a biphasic system using a batch reactor. Aluminium oxide and ion exchange resin were used as catalysts in this system. The organic solvent and aqueous solvent were methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP). The effect of operating conditions for synthesis of 5-HMF on the yield and selectivity of 5-HMF was studied including aqueous-to-organic phase ratio, NMP-to-water ratio, catalyst dosage, ratio of catalyst, and reaction time. The optimal conditions were at the reaction temperature of 120 °C and reaction time of 480 min, aqueous-to-organic phase ratio of 7 : 3, NMP-to-water ratio of 4 : 1, 0.3 g of catalyst, and the catalyst ratio of 1 : 2. The conversion of glucose, yield of 5-HMF, and selectivity of 5-HMF were 94.036%, 84.92%, and 90.48%, respectively. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this work, the experimental conditions for the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil, over commercial calcium oxide (CaO) as heterogeneous catalysts, have been optimized employing a multi-factorial design based on the response surface methodology (RSM). Hence, the effects of temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio and have been considered. The partial transesterification of sunflower oil produces one mol of monoglyceride (MG) and two moles of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME). This blend constitutes a new type of biofuel called Ecodiesel which can be applicable to diesel engines. This Ecodiesel integrates the glycerol as MG removing by-products and increasing the lubricity of the biofuel. Thus, the reaction conditions, obtained by Response surface methodology (RSM), that promote the highest values of selectivity to Ecodiesel are 65 °C of reaction temperature, 0.7 g of CaO and methanol/oil molar ratio of 5.3. On the other hand, in order to get a biofuel with lower viscosity, 65 °C and 0.7 g of CaO were also employed, although a lower methanol/oil molar ratio of 2 was employed. Operating under these selected experimental conditions, a high conversion value (70 %), a selectivity value to Ecodiesel of 35 % and a viscosity value around 15 cSt can be achieved. The biofuel thus obtained can be used in blends with diesel because in order to accomplish the viscosity limits stablished in the EN 14214. Consequently, this methodology could represent an advance in the technical and economic feasibility in the process of replacing fossil fuels by renewable fuels. © 2020

AB  - Air pollution is a major issue affecting the health of millions of citizens, notably in cities where pollutants are concentrated. Low-temperature combustion is a promising route to reduce nitrogen oxides and smoke emissions from compression ignition engines. Reduction in emissions during low-temperature combustion is known, yet emissions using oxygenated biofuels are poorly known. Therefore, I tested the potential reduction in emissions using oxygenated biofuels during low-temperature combustion, in the reactivity-controlled compression ignition mode. Ethanol, a low-reactivity fuel, was inducted in the intake manifold at 10% and 20% levels on energy basis, whereas waste cooking oil biodiesel, a high-reactivity fuel, was injected directly inside the cylinder. Results show a reduction in emission of nitrogen oxides up to 60%, and of smoke up to 29%. Nonetheless, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions increased up to 2% at full load for biodiesel with 20% ethanol induction, compared to neat diesel and biodiesel. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Microalgae are promising feedstock for the production of biofuel due to their high productivity and low interference with food production for their cultivation and usage. Owing to their aquatic production environment, however, energy-intensive dewatering and drying processes may be required before their conversion to biofuel. In order to avoid these processes, their liquefaction through hydrothermal means has attracted attention, with extensive research works. The present research proposes and examines alcohothermal liquefaction of wet microalgae, in an attempt to modify and improve microalgae liquefaction characteristics. Thus supercritical methanol was employed as a reaction media for liquefaction of wet Chlorella vulgaris, and the effects of water presence as well as the effects of heterogeneous oxide catalysts were examined. This methanothermal liquefaction gave high bio-oil yield of 54.5 C% (feed microalgae basis) compared to 30.5 C% by hydrothermal for non-catalytic reaction at 385 °C. With Zr(WO4)2 catalyst methanothermal bio-oil yield increased further to 65.6 C%. The presence of water in the methanol medium somewhat decreased the bio-oil yield, while some of the catalysts mitigated the decrease: at 50 wt% water content in methanol, MnO2, ZnO2 and ZrO2 gave bio-oil yield of 55.5 C%, 59.5 C% and 57.6 C%, respectively. Possible mechanism of catalytic methanothermal liquefaction of wet microalgae is discussed. © 2019

AB  - Rice husk is a rich source of waste silica which has potential for application in the preparation of porous materials for use as catalyst supports or sorbents. Here we report on the synthesis of rice husk silica (RHS) and mesoporous templated rice husk silica (MT-RHS) using sodium silicate, obtained from rice husk ash, and castor oil as a pore directing agent. The resulting silicas were functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) or 3-diethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane (DEPA), and their catalytic activity evaluated in the transesterification of model C4–C12 triglycerides (TAG) to their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters, of relevance to biodiesel synthesis. Castor oil templating enhances the surface area of rice husk silica, and introduces uniform 4 nm mesopores, albeit as a disordered pore network. Post-synthetic grafting of silica by APTS or DEPA resulted in base site loadings of 0.5 and 0.8 mmolg−1 respectively on RHS and MT-RHS. Turnover frequencies of amine-functionalized MT-RHS were 45–65% greater than those of their amine-functionalized RHS counterparts for tributyrin transesterification. Switching from a primary (APTS) to tertiary (DEPA) amine increased activity three-fold, delivering 80% tributyrin conversion to methyl butyrate in 6 h. DEPA-MT-RHS was effective for the transesterification of C8 and C12 triglycerides, with methyl caproate and methyl laurate selectivities of 93% and 71% respectively in 24 h. © 2019

AB  - Project decisions are currently decided primarily on initial costs and neglect environmental and social aspects. In this study, a new optimization algorithm has been developed based on the three-legged stool of sustainability, namely technical, environmental, and socioeconomic aspects. The new algorithm, entitled the sustainability-based optimization algorithm, will minimize the average of normalized values of life-cycle costs, environmental impacts, and social objections subject to the constraint that all options will be acceptable. The optimal combinations of input variable values are found by optimization. The algorithm is demonstrated on algal biofuel production and is adapted from the model described in the greenhouse gases, regulated emissions, and energy use in transportation model. The indicators that are practical and widely applicable in algal production were based on previous studies. The results show the minimum objective function occurs at the combination of input variables that minimizes each component of sustainability, namely CO2-reduction, environmental, and economic aspects. The minimum objective considering only the social aspects occurs at the water-recycling reduction scenario. Considering the optimal solution with the focus only on one of the environmental, social, or economic terms could potentially lead to a solution that is not robust. The advantage of this algorithm is that by considering all active and effective indicators together the most sustainably robust result is found. The new algorithm is potentially applicable for various types of projects involved in resilient infrastructure such as bridges, roads, electrical grids, water distribution systems, sewer systems, water and wastewater treatment plants, and renewable energy. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The microalgae culture medium should contain essential nutrients for their optimal growth. However, landfill leachate contains these nutrients; merely, the use of leachate in the cultivation of microalgae is not conceivable because of its high toxicity. This survey proposes to demonstrate the growth performance in terms of biomass production, chlorophyll contents and cell morphology of two microalgae, namely Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp., in different concentrations of leachate (10%, 30%, 50%, 80% and 100% (v/v) crude leachate). Changes in chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4 +–N) and salinity content were also monitored. Results showed that when the two algae were mixed, the culture medium containing 10% (v/v) of leachate caused an optimal and selective growth of Chlorella and a total mortality for Scenedesmus cells. Also, this culture medium containing 10% (v/v) of leachate promoted the cell growth of Chlorella sp., of around 2 times in terms of cell density and 10 times in terms of chlorophyll content as compared to the result obtained for the standard culture medium “Bold’s Basal Medium (BBM).” Abatement rates of COD, NH4 +–N and salinity of 60%, 100% and 10% were, respectively, achieved by pure cultures of Chlorella sp. Therefore, the strain of Chlorella sp. appeared resistant in this unfriendly environment as compared to the strain of Scenedesmus sp. As a perspective, the tested landfill leachate could be convenient for culturing Chlorella sp. for leachate purification and biofuel production. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Non-edible vegetable oils are characterized by high contents of free fatty acids (FFAs) that prevent from using the conventional basic catalysts for the production of biodiesel. In this work, solid acid catalysts are used for the simultaneous esterification and transesterification with methanol of the FFAs and triglycerides contained in sunflower oil acidified with oleic acid. Molybdenum oxide (MoO3), which has been seldom considered as a catalyst for the production of biodiesel, was used in bulk and alumina-supported forms. Results showed that bulk MoO3 is very active for both transesterification and esterification reactions, but it suffered from severe molybdenum leaching in the reaction medium. When supported on Al2O3, the MoO3 performance improved in terms of active phase utilization and stability though molybdenum leaching remained significant. The improvement of catalytic performance was ascribed to the establishment of MoO3Al2O3 interactions that favored the anchorage of molybdenum to the support and the formation of new strong acidic centers, although this effect was offset by a decrease of specific surface area. It is concluded that the development of stable catalysts based on MoO3 offers an attractive route for the valorization of oils with high FFAs content. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Increasing demand of fossil fuel and its depleting stock across the globe have necessitated a search for potential alternative sources of renewable energy. Recently focus has shifted to production of diesel from bio-oils derived from plant biomass as a potential source. However, it has been an endeavour to shift the exploration to non-edible oils produced by non-crop plants. Hiptage benghalensis is one such unexplored plant which stores ricinoleic acid in its seeds. In this report, analyses of various biochemical and biophysical parameters of H. benghalensis seed oil have been undertaken in order to explore the potential of this oil for biodiesel production. The plant was sourced from three different geographic regions of India. The total lipid and ricinoleic acid contents of seeds obtained from three locations varied from 54 to 69% and 69–87 %, respectively. Properties of various parameters of the H. benghalensis seed oil (HbSO), besides being non-edible prove its potential as a biodiesel feedstock. In order to test this potential, the seed oil was converted into biodiesel through the process of transesterification with an efficiency of ∼93 %. Analysis of various fuel properties like acid value, calorific value, viscosity, density, ash content, flash, pour and cloud point of the biodiesel in accordance with ASTM-D6751 standard and a comparison with the properties of other reported biodiesels showed its reasonable quality. Thus, this non-edible oil from H. benghalensis seeds has a potential to be utilized as an alternate green energy source for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Palm biomass wastes are currently considered as promising solid biofuels. However, their high potassium content leads to formation of slag in combustion chambers and causes frequent power-plant shutdowns for maintenance. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a low-cost practical biological pretreatment for these wastes. Oleaginous fungi Aspergillus tubingensis TSIP9, which originates from palm wastes, was used to pretreat biomass wastes and simultaneously produce oils through non-sterile solid state fermentation (SoSF). The operating conditions were optimized through response surface methodology. The fungi could grow and produce oils with good biodiesel fuel properties. After SoSF, potassium content in biomass wastes was reduced by 90% and cellulose content increased to >57%, making it suitable as clean solid biofuel. Repeated-SoSF with 90% substrate replacement was highly effective in continuously pretreating biomass wastes and producing fungal oils. This study demonstrates the cost-effective and environmentally friendly process for production of clean renewable energy through zero-waste strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The highly selective conversion of furanic molecules to biofuels was achieved on the hierarchical catalysts, which were prepared through modifying the commercially microporous zeolites with sequential alkali and acid post-synthesis treatments. The characterization results indicated that the post-synthesis treatment could successfully introduce the mesopores into the microporous ZSM-5 sample as well as adjust its acidity. The yield of three furanic ethers i.e. 2,5-bis(ethoxymethyl)furan, 5-ethoxymethyl-furfural, and ethyl furfuryl ether on the AT(0.50)-OT catalyst were 94.7%, 90.6%, and 58.2%, respectively. The excellent performance could be attributed to the synergic effect of mass transfer efficiency and surface acidity. This work provides a simple route to prepare high-performance catalysts for the production of biofuels from biochemical. © 2019

AB  - A mathematical model describing the reduction of Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water in a metal dispersed conducting polymer film is discussed. The model is based on a system of reaction-diffusion equations containing a non-linear term related to Michaelis- Menten kinetics of the enzymatic reaction. The approximate analytical expressions corresponding to the concentration of substrate and product for steady and non-steady state conditions have been obtained using a new approach to homotopy perturbation method (HPM). Approximate analytical expressions of the electrochemical oxidation current are also presented for steady and non-steady state conditions. The numerical simulation (Matlab program) response for concentration profiles was carried out and compared with the analytical results of this work and are found to be in good agreement. The influence of initial substrate concentration, the thickness of the film as well as the diffusion layer and kinetic parameters on the current response were investigated. A graphical procedure for estimating the kinetic parameters from the expression of the current response is also proposed. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica. All rights reserved.

AB  - Energy security and environmental problems are important factors behind the increasing biomass consumption around the world including the lower-income countries such as Pakistan. To utilize local biomass reserves more efficiently in the context of future energy demand, the possession of knowledge about recent energy system in different sectors of the country has become interestingly important. A few initiatives and technologies are currently under process in order to move towards renewable resources from non-renewable resources and minimizing dependency on fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In recent past, some ideas have been developed for sustainable biofuel production which will make sure a rapid shift from an unsustainable attitude towards a potentially sustainable approach. Hence, in this review, detailed data about the potential of biomass for the production of renewable energy in Pakistan have been presented, keeping in view the recent energy mix and future perspectives. The feasibility of local/indigenous biomass reserves and important conversion methods to transform such biomass reserves to bioenergy has also been discussed. Here, we also highlighted the drivers for consumption of local/indigenous biomass reserves in future energy system along with the challenges related to energy systems among various stakeholders. Finally, the suggestions/recommendations on the government policies and future directions for successful implementation of the energy production from local/indigenous biomass resources have been given which could be sufficient to meet increasing energy demands of Pakistan. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.

AB  - A heterogeneous photocatalyst has been developed using sono-chemical assisted sol-gel method by maintaining aweight ratio of 1:2:3 for hydrogen exfoliation graphene, titanium oxide andcopper sulphateand exhaustively characterized. Rigorous experimentations have been done using newly developed heterogeneous photocatalyst for efficient capturing and maximum conversion of carbon di oxide to methanol by mutual effects of governing conditions, like as catalyst dose, pH, CO2 flow rate and temperature. Optimization study has been carried out employing a statistical approach of response surface methodology which reveals the maximum methanol productivity and yield. Approximately, 134 g/Lh of productivity and 40 mg/gcatof yield were found after 3 h of illumination under UV in an annular type Pyrex reactor at an optimum catalyst dosage of 10 g/L, CO2 flow rate of 3 L/m, pH of 3, and process temperature of 50 °C. By the judicial integration of flat-sheet cross flow microfiltration membrane module for catalyst separation and recycle, a steady state permeate flux 145 L/m2h was achieved at an applied pressure of 3 bar and cross-flow feed rate of 700 L/h. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Biphasic tandem catalytic process (biTCP) is a generalized “one-pot” synthesis approach to produce hydrophobic biofuels or biobased chemicals from relatively hydrophilic biomass feedstocks. In this work, we report our findings on employing the biTCP to convert carbohydrates (such as fructose) to value-added furan derivative chemicals, 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) or 5-methylfurfural (MF). Through the studies of kinetics and probe reactions, the reaction mechanism was explored, in which the key intermediates, such as 5-methylfurfural (MF) and DMF, were identified during the conversion of fructose to DMTHF. The catalytic effects of the different catalysts, H2SO4 and Pd/AC, partitioned in water and organic phases, respectively, were elucidated. The effect of various organic solvents and process conditions were systematically studied to maximize the production yield of DMTHF. At the optimum conditions, a ∼ 70% yield of DMTHF was achieved from fructose with the hydrophobic Pd/AC and the hydrophilic Brønsted acid catalysts in the water-diethyl ether biphasic solution at 130 °C in 12 h. In addition, the effect of the co-solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which modulated the distribution of furan products, was also investigated. Finally, the deactivation mechanism of the Pd/AC catalyst was discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We have developed a new electrode material for biofuel cells (BFCs) in which a mediator was covalently immobilized on MgO-templated porous carbon (MgOC). Grafted MgOC (GMgOC) was prepared by modifying poly (glycidyl methacrylate) on the MgOC surface by electron beam graft polymerization. Furthermore, aminoferrocene (AmFc) and flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) were immobilized by covalent bonding between the amino group and pendant glycidyl group. The current density estimated by cyclic voltammetry was approximately 21.2 mA cm−2 at 0.49 V in a 1 mol L−1 phosphate buffer containing 100 mmol L−1 glucose. The current value was stable because of the suppression of AmFc elution after 10 h of continuous measurement. A glucose/O2 BFC was fabricated by combining an anode modified with FAD-GDH/poly(GMA)-modified AmFc and a BOD/2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)-modified water-repellent cathode and applying 1 mol L−1 PBS containing 300 mmol L−1 glucose (pH 7.0). The BFC showed a high power density of 3.6 mW cm−2. We fabricated a wearable BFC based on hydrogels with ortho hydroquinone groups that can maintain adhesiveness on human skin. The power density of the wearable cell was 0.42 mW cm−2 at 0.38 V in the air, which is sufficient output to power a small electronic device. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Selective aromatic ring hydrogenation is an important process for the valorization of lignin and designing the high active and selective catalyst is still a challenge. At present, it is reported that such catalysts generally have some shortcomings including strict reaction conditions, complicated catalyst preparation and low reaction efficiency. Herein, Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst with the macropore structure prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method could effectively promote the aromatic rings hydrogenation of various lignin-derived compounds under extremely mild condition (30 °C). The resulting aliphatic compounds with the high yield provided abundant raw materials for the production of fine chemicals and biofuels. In this case, further experiments revealed that it was H2 rather than solvents provided the only hydrogen source. A relatively low bond energy of Ru0 in Ru/Nb2O5 promoted the formation of active hydrogen from H2. Due to the acid loss of Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst, the hydrodeoxygenation reaction did not occur. Moreover, the catalyst was investigated under different influence parameters in order to obtain the optimal reaction conditions (30 °C, 3 MPa H2). The application of Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst may provide a promising approach to the value-added utilization of lignin-derived fragments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The raw Jojoba oil is utilized to produce biodiesel via a transesterification process, which is optimized using smoke point, yield, and viscosity of produced biodiesel, as well as the final product, is characterized utilizing GC-MS and FTIR. Then, the combustion and emission characteristics of Jojoba oil biodiesel-Jet-A1 blends are performed utilizing a lean premixed pre-vaporized combustion (LPP) approach. The JME with two blending ratios of 10% and 20% by volume and jet fuel of 90% and 80% by volume, as well as the pure jet fuel, are burned in an LPP combustor at two different equivalence ratios of 0.87 and 0.95 to investigate the suitability of using the JME-jet A1 fuel blends as an alternative energy resource. The LPP combustor is designed precisely regarding a comprehensive survey of the main parameters affecting on it, and its combustion results show that it has an acceptable and stable flame. The results indicate that the NOx emission decreases with enlarging the volume fraction of JME, while the CO and UHC formation increase. The flame temperature distributions are similar for the different tested fuels. It can be deduced that Jojoba biodiesel can be used up to 20% by volume as an alternative fuel with jet fuel in a commercial application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electronic waste (e-waste) with an annual growth rate of 3–5% is one of the fastest-growing waste streams. The unregulated accumulation and improper recycling can cause grave hazards to human beings and the environment. On the contrary, e-waste can be considered as a secondary source of metals and energy due to its high metal content and polymeric material. Thus, the present study demonstrates technology for the metallic fraction recovery and the production of valuable gases from e-waste. The process involves pyrolysis at a temperature range of 200 °C–600 °C in a fixed bed setup for 10–60 min. Under optimized operating conditions, 35 wt% combustible gases and 60 wt% solid product were obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C in 20 min. The gaseous product consisted of CH4, H2, CO and CO2, having the heating value 28 MJ/kg whereas, the solid product is a mixture of metals and other solid residue material. Treatment of the solid product using an ultrasonication process resulted in around 90 wt% recovery of metallic fraction, thereby leaving behind solid residue. Moreover, the transfer of precious metals (Au, Ag, Pd and Pt) was nearly 100% to the metallic fraction. This process combines mild temperature pyrolysis and ultrasonication process to provide a solution for efficient management of e-waste, metallic fraction recovery and valuable gases production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper compares the cost and life cycle environmental performance of renewable diesel produced from upgraded catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) and fast pyrolysis (FP) bio-oils produced from forest residues. Integrating zeolite catalyst into the pyrolysis reactor in CFP requires upgrading in one catalytic hydrocracking step, whereas FP requires upgrading by multiple catalytic hydrotreating and hydrocracking steps, raising capital costs. The FP system considers hydrogen production from co-produced biochar, further raising capital costs but eliminating the large external hydrogen need. Despite lower capital costs, due to higher operating costs from catalyst replacement and purchased hydrogen, the estimated minimum selling price of CFP fuel ($2/L) is greater than FP fuel ($1.68/L). Utilities, hydrogen and catalyst contributions to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exergy and annual cost are sizeable for CFP. However, GHG emissions for CFP (−72 to 32 g CO2e/MJ) are low and negative when considering credits for biochar due to a high biochar to fuel product ratio (2:1). In contrast, FP with catalytic upgrading maintains a high biofuel yield and low GHG emissions (8–13 g CO2e/MJ) that meet energy policy objectives with more favorable economics compared to CFP. Neither fuel is cost competitive with petroleum-diesel even with renewable fuel credits. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgrading the inferior properties of Calophyllum inophyllum oil via catalytic cracking into biofuel required a porous heterogeneous acid catalysts. Hierarchical ZSM-5 (Hi-ZSM-5(K)) produced from desilication of kaolin-derived ZSM-5 was employed as catalyst and the activity was compared with hierarchical ZSM-5 obtained from templating method (Hi-ZSM-5(T)). Catalytic cracking of Calophyllum inophyllum oil was carried out in one-pot reaction at 475 °C for 120 min under the flow of H2 and the products analysed using GC-MS were consisted of the mixtures of alkane, alkene, oxygenated carbon and aromatics compound. The advantages of desilication method for the formation of highly selective hierarchical ZSM-5 was observed when the catalyst exhibited enhanced acidity with mesopores diameter of 2–5 nm to give 93% conversion and high selectivity towards light C7–C9 hydrocarbons. However, Hi-ZSM-5(T) showed low acidity to give only 43% conversion, and selectivity towards C11–C12 hydrocarbons due to the mesopores diameter of 3–12 nm. The activity of hierarchical ZSM-5 was also compared with microporous ZSM-5 that produced biofuel with approximately equal distribution of C5–C18 hydrocarbons. The role of hierarchical structures was further discussed on the composition of aromatics compound, oxygenates content and alkene/alkane ratios of the biofuel. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Dimethyl ether (DME) is an advanced second-generation biofuel produced via methanol dehydration over acid catalysts such as γ-Al2O3, at temperatures above 240 °C and pressures above 10 bar. Heteropolyacids such as tungstosilicic acid (HSiW) are Brønsted acid catalysts with higher DME production rates than γ-Al2O3, especially at low temperatures (140–180 °C). In this work, we show that the performance of supported HSiW for the production of DME is strongly affected by the nature of the support. TiO2 and SiO2 supported HSiW display the highest DME production rates of ca. 50 mmolDME/h/gHSiW. Characterization of acid sites via 1H-NMR, NH3-isotherms and NH3-adsrobed DRIFT reveal that HSiW/X have Brønsted acid sites, HSiW/TiO2 showing more and stronger sites, being the most active catalyst. Methanol production increases with T until 200 °C where a rapid decay in methanol conversion is observed. This effect is not irreversible, and methanol conversion increases to ca. 90% by increasing reaction pressure to 10 bar, with DME being the only product detected at all reaction conditions studied in this work. The loss of catalytic activity with the increasing temperature and its increasing with reaction pressure accounts to the degree of contribution of the pseudo-liquid catalysis under the reaction conditions studied. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Industrial waste, such as crude glycerol, was used for vitamin K2 by B. subtilis Z-15. Crude glycerol could be used instead of pure glycerin for vitamin K2 production. The combination of soybean peptone and yeast extract was more conducive to the synthesis of vitamin K2. The optimal composition of medium was obtained by response surface methodology. The results indicated that the optimal medium was as follows: 6.3% crude glycerol, 3.0% soybean peptone concentration and 5.1 g/L yeast extract. Under the optimal culture medium, vitamin K2 production was increased to 45.11 ± 0.62 mg/L. The fermentor test further proved that the use of crude glycerol affected neither the synthesis of vitamin K2 nor the growth of B. subtilis. These investigations could lay a foundation for reducing the pollution of crude glycerol, exploring a late model for vitamin K2 cleaner production. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is considered a promising carbon-neutral fuel, with a high hydrogen content, that can diversify the global energy system. Blending ammonia with a highly reactive fuel is one possible strategy to enhance its combustion characteristics. Here, an investigation of blends of NH3 and dimethoxymethane (DMM), a biofuel with high fuel-born oxygen content and no carbon-carbon bonds, is reported. Unstretched laminar burning velocity (SL) and Markstein length of different NH3/DMM blends were experimentally determined using spherically propagating premixed flames. The DMM mole fraction was varied from 0.2 to 0.6 while measuring SL at 298 K, 0.1 MPa, and equivalence ratios (φ) over the range of 0.8-1.3. The addition of DMM was found to immensely enhance the combustion characteristics of ammonia. DMM 20% (by mole fraction) in the NH3/DMM blend increased SL by more than a factor of 3 over neat ammonia; such enhancement was found to be comparable to 60% CH4 in NH3 (φ = 0.9-1.1) blends. Increasing φ was found to significantly decrease the burned gas Markstein length for lean cases, whereas a negligible effect was observed for rich mixtures. A composite chemical kinetic model of DMM/NH3, aimed at interpreting the high-temperature combustion chemistry, was able to reliably predict SL for neat NH3 and DMM flames. Also, the predictive capability of the kinetic model to describe SL for DMM/NH3 blends is reasonably good. Sensitivity analysis and reaction path analysis indicated that the NH3/DMM blends could be understood as dual oxidation processes of the individual fuels that are competing for the same radical pool. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Considering the depletion of fossil fuel, alternative energy resources have been continuously investigated. Microalgae-derived biofuel can be a solution to replace traditional fuel; however, biofuel contains much nitrogen-containing compounds (NCCs) such as carbazole (CBZ) and benzonitrile (PhCN). In this work, effective denitrogenation of biofuel was investigated by using MOFs, especially having multi-functional groups and high porosity. MIL-101-NH2 was modified with oxalyl chloride (OC) to have a MOF called M101-OC. The M101-OC showed remarkable performance in adsorptive denitrogenation from biofuel. Or, M101-OC had 3.8- and 19.6-times adsorption capacity for CBZ and PhCN that of activated carbon, respectively; and showed the highest adsorption capacity, compared with any known adsorbent. The noticeable performances of M101-OC could be explained with hydrogen bonding due to ample hydrogen donor and hydrogen acceptor sites on the M101-OC. Finally, the investigated MOF was also easily recycled via simple ethanol washing. Therefore, M101-OC might be a promising adsorbent for the purification of microalgae-derived biofuel having much NCCs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The direct synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME) from biomass-derived syngas is a topic of great interest in the field of biofuels. The process takes place in one reactor combining two catalytic functions, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) for the synthesis of methanol and an acid catalyst (typically γ-Al2O3) for methanol dehydration to DME. However, the catalytic performance of those catalysts is negatively affected by the high CO2/CO ratio in the bio-syngas, resulting in low methanol and DME production rates. In this work, we show that promoters such as zirconium and gallium oxides increase the CO fraction in the syngas. However, the production of H2O is also increased, leading to the deactivation of both CZA and γ-Al2O3. The addition of a water sorbent (zeolite 3A) in the reaction medium alleviates the detrimental effect of H2O in the direct synthesis of DME from CO2-rich syngas. Thus, DME production over the CZA/γ-Al2O3 catalytic bed increases from ca. 8.7% to 70% when a zeolite 3A is placed in the reaction medium. In fact, carbon conversions higher than conventional equilibrium conversions are achieved. This work demonstrates that the sorption enhanced synthesis of DME is a suitable strategy to increase DME production from biomass-derived syngas. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate co-torrefaction followed by co-combustion of intermediate waste epoxy resins and fir in the form of mini-pellet to evaluate the potential of industrial wastes as biofuels for alternatives of coals. Co-torrefaction and co-combustion of the materials were analyzed through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The results suggested that most of the torrefaction had a slight influence on the wastes due to their thermal resistance properties. Conversely, fir was markedly affected by torrefaction, and the corresponding volatiles were the chemicals stripped or reacted from its components (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin). By introducing an index, both antagonistic and synergistic effects were discovered in the two-stage reaction because new compounds formed during the co-torrefaction and co-combustion processes, as a consequence of catalytic and blocking effects. Overall, co-torrefaction could make the quality of the biofuel from intermediate waste epoxy resins more homogeneous and is a promising route to transform waste epoxy resins into alternative fuels for industrial applications. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, as an alternative fuel for petroleum-derived fuel, has gained significant attention from society. In this research work, biodiesel is produced via simultaneous esterification and transesterification of chicken fat and skin oil (CFSO) over Ce supported sulfated activated carbon derived from coconut shell (ACcs-S). Details of a study on the effect of Ce concentrations in the range of 5–15 wt% were also investigated. The results showed that 5 wt% Ce was an optimum concentration for the esterification and transesterification of CFSO with approximately 93% free fatty acid (FFA) conversion. High FFA conversion by 5Ce/ACcs-S is attributed to it having a sufficient amount of acid-base and noticeable pore structures. The effect of four variables (i.e., methanol to chicken fat oil, catalyst loading, reaction time, and temperature) on the FFA conversion was studied via the one-variable–at-a-time method. Optimum FFA conversion (93%) was achieved at a temperature of 90 °C, 12:1 MeOH to oil ratio, 3 wt % catalyst loading, and 1 h reaction time. 5Ce/ACcs-S shows high chemical stability by maintaining the FFA conversion at up to 90% within five consecutive reaction cycles. © 2020

AB  - The current study used acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials to obtain fermentable sugar for bioethanol production. However, toxic compounds that inhibit fermentation are also produced during the process, which reduces the bioethanol productivity. In this study, atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) was adopted to degrade the toxic compounds within sulfuric acid-hydrolyzed sugarcane bagasse. After ACP treatment, significant decreases in toxic compounds (31% of the formic acid, 45% of the acetic acid, 80% of the hydroxymethylfurfural, and 100% of the furfural) were observed. The toxicity of the hydrolysate was low enough for bioethanol production using Kluyveromyces marxianus. After adopting optimal ACP conditions (200 W power for 25 min), the bioethanol productivity improved from 0.25 to 0.65 g/L/h, which means that ACP could effectively degrade toxic compounds within the hydrolysate, thereby enhancing bioethanol production. Various nitrogen substitute was coordinated with detoxified hydrolysate, and chicken meal group presented the highest bioethanol productivity (0.45 g/L/h). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of drop-in biofuels 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) from biomass-derived hydrocarbons usually incorporates precious metals as a catalyst. Herein, we developed a bimetallic (Ni-Cu) supported on hydrotalcite (HT) catalyst and applied for catalytic hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and other valuable fuel additives at a relatively low temperature (85–130 °C) and pressure (6–20 bar). The effect of other process parameters like reaction time, solvent and catalyst loading on DMF yield was also investigated. Ni-Cu/HT was found to be exceptionally active and selective catalyst for hydro-deoxygenation of HMF to DMF and other high-energy furanics. Ni-Cu/HT was applied under mild reaction condition for hydrogenation of BHMF to DMF and 100% BHMF conversion and 83% DMF yield was obtained at 85 °C and 6 bar hydrogen pressure and 100 mg catalyst loading. 78% over-hydrogenated product (DMTHF) yield was observed at higher catalyst loading (200 mg) at 130 °C. The excellent activity of Ni-Cu/HT catalyst for hydrogenation and deoxygenation is attributed to synergistic-cooperation of Ni and Cu and metal stability owing to hydrotalcite support. Moreover, the acid-base properties of HT also contributed to superior activity of Ni-Cu/HT catalyst by facilitating HMF, BHMF and formic acid adsorption and activation and by promoting hydrogenolysis of C-O ester bond. A detailed characterization of as-synthesized Ni-Cu/HT by TPR, BET, XPS, TEM, HRTEM, FESEM, EDX, powder XRD and FTIR techniques was carried out to examine its structural and morphological features. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae has received overwhelming attention worldwide as a sustainable source for energy generation. However, the production of biofuel from microalgae biomass consists of several steps, of which lipid extraction is the most important one. Because of the nature of feedstock, extraction needs special attention. Three different methods were studied to extract algal oil from two different algae variant, Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp. The highest percentage oil yield was obtained by ultrasonication (9.4% for Chlorella sp., 6.6% for Spirulina sp.) followed by the Soxhlet and solvent extraction processes. Ultrasonication and Soxhlet extraction processes were further optimized to maximize oil extraction as solvent extraction was not effective in extracting lipid. For ultrasonication, an amplitude of 90% recorded the highest percentage yield of oil for Spirulina sp. and a 70% amplitude recorded the highest percentage yield of oil for Chlorella sp. On the other hand, for Soxhlet extraction, a combination of chloroform, hexane, and methanol at a 1:1:1 ratio resulted in the highest yield of algal oil. Afterward, the crude algae oil from the ultrasonication process was transesterified for 5 h using an immobilized lipase (Novozyme 435) at 40 °C to convert triglycerides into fatty acid methyl ester and glycerol. Thus, ultrasonic-assisted lipid extraction was successful in producing biodiesel from both the species. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Four types of green alkali modified clinoptilolite (K, Na, Ca, and Mg) were prepared using green tea extracts as novel types of eco-friendly heterogeneous basic catalysts in the transesterification of commercial waste cooking oil into biodiesel. The modified products displayed significant enhancement in the total basicity, surface area, ion exchange capacity, and the morphological properties. The modified samples of K/clinoptilolite (K/Clino), Na/clinoptilolite (Na/Clino), Ca/clinoptilolite (Ca/Clino), and Mg/clinoptilolite (Mg/Clino) showed promising catalytic activities achieving biodiesel yields of 93.6%, 95.2%, 96.4%, and 98.7%, respectively. The best yields were recognized using 4 wt, % as catalysts loading, 16:1 as methanol-to waste oil molar ratio, and at 70 °C as temperature. The best transesterification intervals were identified at 120 min, 120 min, 180 min, and 150 min for K/Clino, Na/Clino, Ca/Clino, and Mg/Clino, respectively. The modified products also demonstrated high reusability properties and the resulted biodiesel in their transesterification systems are of technical properties within the accepted limits of EN 14214 and ASTM D-6751 standards. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study explores the potential of the Croton macrostachyus seed, a non-edible feedstock found in abundance in the southeastern parts of Ethiopia, for the production of biodiesel. Soxhlet extractor was used to extract, 53.34% of the oil from the Croton macrostachyus seed. This oil was further purified and the resulting product was known as the purified Croton macrostachyus seed (P-CMS) oil. After obtaining the P-CMS oil, biodiesel was produced by the transesterification process. Focus was made on the optimization of biodiesel production by varying the identified process parameters, through the Box- Behnken Design using response surface methodology (RSM) (Design-Expert ® Version 11 software). The crude biodiesel was purified, characterized and complied with the ASTM D6751, United States and the EN 14214, European Union standards. The optimum conversion efficiency of the P-CMS oil to fatty acid methyl ether (FAME) was 96% at the optimal conditions (6:1, methanol to oil ratio; 1%, catalyst loading; 50 °C, reaction temperature). A plan for the environmental impact assessment and life cycle assessment were provided to evaluate the sustainability of this new feedstock and the biodiesel produced from it. Results of these studies indicated the prospective of Croton macrostachyus seed as a new biodiesel feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to study fast pyrolysis of three microalgae species in a continuous bench-scale conical spouted bed reactor at 500 °C. Bio-gas, bio-oil and bio-char yields have been determined and characterized by using GC, GC/MS, elemental analyzer and SEM. Bio-oil was the main product obtained through pyrolysis of microalgae. The non-condensable gaseous stream is made up of mainly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, apart from other light hydrocarbons detected in lower concentration, as are methane, ethane, ethylene, propane and propylene. The compounds identified in the bio-oil have been categorized into hydrocarbons, nitrogen containing compounds, ketones, alcohols, acids, lactones, phenols and aldehydes. The nitrogen and carbon contents of the microalgae bio-chars are higher than those for bio-chars derived from other biomasses. Pyrolysis improved the morphology and porous structure of microalgae. Finally, the mechanism involving microalgae pyrolysis has been approached and the main reaction pathways have been proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of macroalgae Ulva prolifera (UP) over various solids, basic, or acidic oxide and metal salt catalysts at different reaction temperature (260, 280 and 300 °C), reaction holding time (15, 30 and 45 min.) and solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) were investigated. The maximum bio-oil yield (35.1 wt.%) was obtained with metal MgO catalyst with water solvent compared to the acidic (Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2), salt (MgCl2, FeCl3, and CuCl2) and other basic (CaO and CaCO3) catalyst. When alcoholic solvent (ethanol and methanol) used, the bio-oil yield increased extensively, and highest bio-oil yield (50.6 wt.%) was observed with MgO catalyst in ethanol solvent. GC–MS, FT-IR, NMR, TGA, and CHNS were used for bio-oil characterization. The higher selectively ester compound 62.2 % was obtained with MgO under ethanol solvent. The higher carbon (60.8–66.2 %) and higher heating value (HHV) (30.2–34.2 MJ/kg) was observed in the case of catalytic liquefaction bio-oil compared to the non-catalytic reaction bio-oil. The results suggest that catalytic liquefaction has potential for quality bio-oil production. Also, the reusability of the optimum catalyst (MgO) was examined in this study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrogen fuel offers a cleaner fuel alternative to fossil fuel due to more efficient burning as well as reduces the environmental and health issues brought by fossil fuel usage. In engine application, regardless of either pure hydrogen or in combination with air or/and other biofuel, all the moving parts are exposed to friction and wear, and lubricant is used to minimize friction and wear for optimum operation. Thus, in this study, the use of microalgae oil as an alternative biolubricant is evaluated from the physicochemical and tribological aspects. It is found that modified microalgae oil (MMO) has demonstrated great anti-friction and anti-wear potential, particularly the 10% modified microalgae oil blend (MMO-10). The coefficient of friction is reduced (up to 10.1%) and significant reductions of wear loss and surface roughness are obtained in comparison to pure poly-alpha-olefin. Lubricant's heat dissipation is also enhanced with MMO addition, demonstrating great prospect for MMO for hydrogen-powered engine utilization. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is one of the nutrients embedded in biowastes and its speciation in solid-liquid-gas pyrolysis products is closely related to environmental issues such as the greenhouse effect, acid rain, and eutrophication. This study investigated the distribution and evolution of N species during pyrolysis of various biowaste matrixes, and the roles of exogenous mineral calcium (CaCl2) in regulating N transformation were explored. The results showed that these biowastes show a similar tendency for the conversion of protein-N (70-90% in biowaste) into char-N (25-35%), oil-N (15-30%), and gas-N (30-60%). Exogenous Ca did not alter total char-N yield, while it promoted the conversion of protein/pyridine-N into pyrrole/quaternary-N, which could mitigate N loss as a cause of eutrophication; Ca catalyzed the cracking of N-containing macromolecules in bio-oil, especially amine, and therefore, drove N migrating from the liquid phase to gas phase. This would benefit the recycle of bio-oil as a fuel. In gas, the significant decrease of harmful HCN accompanied by a remarkable increase of NH3 and N2 were observed. Detection by thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry-gas chromatography mass spectrometry confirmed that mineral Ca intensified N-related reactions, including dehydration, decarboxylation, dehydrogenation, and deamination of protein-N. This study could guide pyrolytic production and subsequent application of biochar/biofuel, as well as exhaust gas collection regarding N recovery and pollution control. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The goal of the study was to establish the optimal condition for the transesterification process for Hevea brasiliensis oil (HBO) conversion into H. brasiliensis oil methyl esters (HBOME) using a novel base heterogeneous catalyst synthesized from a biowaste (kola nut pod husk). Thus, the influence of concentration of catalyst, MeOH:HBO molar ratio, reaction time and reaction temperature on the HBOME yield was identified using Taguchi orthogonal array design approach. Also, the overall reaction rate constant (k) and reaction order (n) for the process was determined as a way to develop a kinetic model. The results showed that HBOME yield of 96.97 wt% could be achieved using catalyst amount of 3.5 wt%, MeOH:HBO molar ratio of 6:1, reaction time of 75 min and reaction temperature of 65 °C. Performance evaluation of the process input variables suggests reaction time had the highest influence on the HBOME yield. The values of n and k were determined to be 1 and 0.0034 min−1, respectively via kinetic modeling of the transesterification process. The cetane number, kinematic viscosity and acid value of the HBOME produced were 59.54 ± 0.15, 4.98 ± 0.12 mm2/s and 0.22 ± 0.00 mg KOH/g oil, respectively, which compared well with the standard specifications for biodiesel. Thus, HBO and kola nut pod husk could serve as cheap bioresources for biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The efficiency of ultrasonic-assisted organosolv in pretreating oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) was investigated in this study. The effect of temperature, time, sonication power, ethanol concentration and presence of different types of catalysts were examined. The ultrasonic-assisted organosolv pretreatment was found to be significantly affected by temperature, time and sonication power. These parameters were further subjected to process optimization study using Leverburgh Marquee artificial neural networks (ANNs). An empirical model with good predictive accuracies (R-squared value of 0.9084) was generated. From the morphology study, pretreated EFB showed significant structural disruption through the breakage of hemicellulose and lignin bonds, leading to the enhancement of enzymatic saccharification. A maximum reducing sugars of 356 mg/g biomass (7.12 g/L) was obtained at optimized conditions of 48.2 °C, 30 min and 55% (192.5 W) sonication power. The relatively high yield of reducing sugars associated with lower lignin content compared to raw EFB also suggested the effectiveness of ultrasonic-assisted organosolv in pretreating EFB. Therefore, this synergistic approach could pave the way for a more efficient and cost-effective pretreatment process for the production of various bioproducts and biofuels in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the current scenario of climate change, the search for alternative energy sources is very important to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Undesired biomass (weed) from agricultural fields can be used to produce biofuels through nano catalysts enhanced gasification and process. Lignocellulosic part of weedy plants represents a potential alternative feedstock for economic production of bioethanol. Large numbers of weedy plant species are growing all over the world. However, high energy requirements and poor-quality biofuel products are the major constraints for utilization of this technology. Nanomaterials could be used as a catalyst to enhance the energy use efficiency and product quality. So, present study was conducted to produce bio-gas, bio-diesel and bio-char from mixed weed biomass of weeds like Carthamous oxyacantha, Asphodelus tenuifolius and Chenopodium album through gasification process using nano-materials as catalysts. Nickel and cobalt nano-particles were used as nano-catalysts to expedite the bio-chemical reactions for the generation of these products at lower temperatures i.e. (400 C°) in a muffle furnace. Further, these products were characterized using GC-MS analysis. It was observed that biodiesel contained 65.47% esters, which indicates its better quality than the normally produced biodiesel having 15–20% esters contents. Similarly, GC-MS analysis of biogas produced from mixed weed biomass showed 3.76% Methane, 8.32% Propane, 50.16% Ethene, 3.12% Propyne and 34.64% Methanol. The present results clearly exhibited the improved product quality and better energy use efficiency in gasification of weed biomass for bioenergy production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The developing approaches in the recovery of resources from biowastes for the production of renewable value-added products and fuels, using microbial cultures as bio-catalyst have now became promising aspect. In the path of anaerobic digestion, the microorganisms are assisting transformation of a complex organic feedstock/waste to biomass and biogas. This potentiality consequently leads to the production of intermediate precursors of renewable value-added products. Particularly, a set of anaerobic pathways in the fermentation process, yields small-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) via chain elongation pathways from waste valorization and CO2 fixation. This review focuses on the production of SCFA and MCFA from CO2, synthetic substrates and waste materials. Moreover, the review introduces the metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for SCFAs/MCFAs production. Furtherly, it concludes that future critical research might target progress of this promising approach as a valorization of complex organic wastes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The physiological properties, including biochemical composition and cell wall thickness, of microalgal species have a remarkable effect on the pretreatment of biomass and its further conversion to biofuels. In the present study, multiple biofuels (bioethanol, higher alcohols (C3–C5), and biodiesel) were produced using energy-efficient microwave pretreatment, successive carbohydrate/protein fermentation, and lipid transesterification from three microalgal strains (Pseudochlorella sp., Chlamydomonas mexicana, and Chlamydomonas pitschmannii). The microwave pretreatment method required the lowest specific energy (5 MJ/kg) compared to ultrasound pretreatment. The proposed integrated approach achieved high conversion efficiency (46%) and maximum biomass utilization (93%) of C. mexicana with improved yields of bioethanol (0.46 g-ethanol/g-carbohydrates), higher alcohols (0.44 g-higher alcohols/g-proteins), and biodiesel (0.74 g-biodiesel/g-lipids). This study suggests that the application of an appropriate pretreatment method for microalgal strains having different physiological properties is essential for improving the extraction efficiency and conversion of biomass to biofuels with less waste production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - [FeFe] hydrogenases are enzymes capable of producing and oxidizing H2 at staggering submillisecond time scales. A major limitation in applying these enzymes for industrial hydrogen production is their irreversible inactivation by oxygen. Recently, an [FeFe] hydrogenase from Clostridium beijerinckii (CbHydA1) was reported to regain its catalytic activity after exposure to oxygen. In this report, we have determined that artificially matured CbHydA1 is indeed oxygen tolerant in the absence of reducing agents and sulfides by means of reaching an O2-protected state (Hinact). We were also able to generate the Hinact state anaerobically via both chemical and electrochemical oxidation. We use a combination of spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and density functional theory (DFT) to uncover intrinsic properties of the active center of CbHydA1, leading to its unprecedented oxygen tolerance. We have observed that reversible, low-potential oxidation of the active center leads to the protection against O2-induced degradation. The transition between the active oxidized state (Hox) and the Hinact state appears to proceed without any detectable intermediates. We found that the Hinact state is stable for more than 40 h in air, highlighting the remarkable resilience of CbHydA1 to oxygen. Using a combination of DFT and FTIR, we also provide a hypothesis for the chemical identity of the Hinact state. These results demonstrate that CbHydA1 has remarkable stability in the presence of oxygen, which will drive future efforts to engineer more robust catalysts for biofuel production.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine the quantitative performance of the electrochemical redox reaction of glucose by glucosidase and oxygen with laccase in a phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.0. The characterization of electrode performance was performed by using electrochemical analysis such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The use of such electrochemical analysis (CV and EIS) enables a better understanding of the redox process, the charge transfer resistance, and, hence, the potential mass transfer among the electrode materials in phosphorus buffer solution. The experimental results show that the maximum power densities of the bioanode and the biocathode electrodes were 800 µA/cm2 and 600 µA/cm2, respectively. Both the bioanode and biocathode show high internal resistance. The occurrence of peak-separation shows an excellent mass-transfer mechanism and better chemical reactivity in the electrode. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Palm oil is one of the most rapidly expanding equatorial crops, which is suitable for feedstock of biodiesel production. In this work, production of methyl esters from palm oil transesterification in a microwave heated continuous flow system was investigated. Choline hydroxide (ChOH) was employed as a green ionic liquid catalyst. The oil to methanol molar ratio, flow rate, power of the microwave, and catalyst loading were varied and optimized by response surface methodology combined with the Box-Behnken design of experiments for maximum biodiesel yield. The ionic liquid proved to be effective in tranesterification of palm oil. The quadratic regression model can be used to forecast the resulting methyl esters content. The optimum condition was identified at molar ratio between oil to methanol of 1:13.2, flow rate of 20 ml/min, microwave power of 800 W and catalyst loading of 6% (w/w), giving the methyl esters content almost 90% in EN 14103 standard test. In addition, most properties of the biodiesel considered were observed to meet the fuel specifications from the ASTM D6751 and Thai standards (community use). Reusability of the ionic liquid for several times was demonstrated before it was contaminated and decomposed, leading to a marked drop in catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Resource nexus research gained ground in the last decade prompted by crises of food and water supply throughout the world. In parallel, bioenergy emerged as an important renewable source worldwide, though it entails a large spectrum of externalities and feedback effects, involving key resources, such as water, land, and biodiversity. Making sense of the complex interactions and measuring all these impacts translates into significant challenges for developing and implementing policies based on a nexus perspective, especially amid divergent interests and normative views. This paper brings an empirical contribution by exploring how reflexive governance concepts can help to understand nexus implementation challenges, and possibly overcome them, based on biofuels policies in Brazil and Germany as case studies. It shows that nexus issues play out differently in each country and discusses how the idea of reflexivity could help to address them, supported by deliberation to reflect upon risks usually assigned to large-scale biomass use and, ultimately, about the underlying assumptions of cause-effect relationships. The cases comparison suggests that cognitive and normative aspects that influenced broader deliberation on biofuels will remain relevant for the deployment of biomass as part of negative emissions strategies in the future. Therefore, it reinforces the need to consider such aspects in nexus research and to expand the debate about the role of bioenergy beyond transformations in the energy sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chemoselective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lipids to diesel-like hydrocarbons is important for biomass to biofuel conversion. Here we design a new Ni-based catalyst (Ni/MoO2@Mo2CTx) with extraordinary catalytic performance in the HDO of palmitic acid. To relieve the loss of C atom for Ni-based catalyst, partial oxidation of Mo2CTx MXene was used as a novel support. As a result, the catalytic activity and selectivity ratio of hexadecane/pentadecane (C16/C15) were enhanced over Ni/MoO2@Mo2CTx catalyst, and the major product of palmitic acid HDO is C16, demonstrating a high C atom economy. This facilitated catalytic performance may be ascribed to the synergic effect of metal Ni, Mo2CTx MXene as well as MoO2 active sites. The palmitic acid (–COOH) can convert into hexadecanal (–CHO) and hexadecanol (–CH2OH) over Ni/MoO2@Mo2CTx catalyst in the initial stage. The metal Ni further contributes to the hydrogenation of the hexadecanal to C15 with the cleavage of C–C bonds by decarbonylation (DCO) route. MoO2 nanoparticles obtained from Mo2CTx oxidation accelerate the scission of C–O bonds of the hexadecanol to improve the selectivity of C16 by hydrogenation-dehydration route. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To promote the growth of the biodiesel industry, many countries have started allocating initial inducements to start-up companies to set up the infrastructure for its production facilities. Thus, comprehensive economic assessments are vital to keeping businesses on the right track in the long run. In this present study, net energy ratio (NER) and macroeconomic assessment are investigated using actual data obtained from biodiesel production from waste cooking oil (WCO) by using a semi-industrial plant. The fuel quality produced has complied with the European Biodiesel Standard (EN 14214) and the net energy ratio (NER) calculated was positive, which, in other words, epitomized a competent-designed production practice. Concerning mass balance, 74.3% of biodiesel, 24.0% of by-product glycerol and 8.9% soap were measured. By applying these as baseline values for scale-up production of 3.68 kt per annum, projected values of total production costs, selling price of B10 fuel, net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) were USD 1.78 million, USD 0.47/kg, USD 1.43 million and 60%, respectively. In summary, these projected values are suggestively lucrative, offering strong business growth for 10 years and capable of withstanding the variations of plant capacity and raw material price. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, Loblolly pine biomass residue was converted to bio-oil in a two-step process, consisting of 1) fast pyrolysis in the presence of zeolite ZSM-5 as a catalyst to produce pyrolysis oil, 2) hydrogenation of pyrolysis oil using formic acid as the hydrogen source in presence of Ru/activated carbon catalyst. Pyrolysis oils were analyzed by 13C, 31P and HSQC-NMR and the results revealed that the zeolite-induced catalytic fast pyrolysis process led to effective demethoxylation, producing more catechol and p-hydroxy-phenyl hydroxyl groups in the bio-oils, resulting in a decrease in the methoxyl group content by about 85 % and rich aromatic structures in the pyrolysis oils. The properties of pyrolysis oil with and without zeolite were in the bio-oil range. Hydrogenated pyrolysis oil showed that 79 % of the aromatic protons are eliminated and 87 % of protons are aliphatic in nature, with no oxygen attached to the α-carbon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production with 6/2 pulsed ultrasonic single and dual frequencies were conducted under M/O molar ratio (9:1), CaO catalyst (size 200 mesh at 8%wt), time (37 min), intensity (0.91 W/cm2). Powers of waves were 140 W for single waves, and 70W + 70W for dual case. Biodiesel yield for dual frequency case was 96.16% while those of single 28 kHz and 40 kHz cases were 94.42% and 93.60% respectively. The power ratios were varied for the dual cases at 0/140, 20/120, 40/100, 60/80, 70/70, 80/60, 100/40, 120/20 and 140/0 W. The highest yield of 97.13% was obtained at 120/20 W. It was found that lower frequency waves played more important role than higher frequency. Thus, 28 kHz was used as the resonance frequency to determine the resonance size of the catalyst (equal to 49.50 μm). Lastly, biodiesel productions were conducted with 6/2 pulsed dual frequency waves (28 + 40 kHz, 120/20 W) and varying catalyst size as 150, 74, 38, 25 and 18 μm. The 38 μm size gave highest yield of 98.85% due to it was closer to the resonance size compared to the others. Thus using pulsed dual waves with optimal catalyst size can enhance the production yield from 93.60% to 98.85%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new anodic catalyst consisting of carbon nanotube, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, chitosan, genipin, and glucose oxidase (GOx) (CNT/4-NBA/[Chit/GOx/GP]) is suggested to promote the glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) and the performance of enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC). In this catalyst, through the cross-linked structure of chitosan and genipin and the proper distribution of amine groups within chitosan, many GOx molecules are maximally captured, their leaching out is suppressed, and the GOR is improved upon. In addition, 4-nitrobenzoic acid plays the role of mediator well. The effect induced by the cross-linked structure is evaluated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, pH measurements, and electrochemical characterizations. According to the characterizations, the new CNT/4-NBA/[Chit/GOx/GP] catalyst contains a large amount of GOx (17.8 mg/mL) and produces a high anodic current (331 μA/cm2 at 0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl) with a low onset potential (0.05 V vs Ag/AgCl) because its catalytic activity follows the desirable reaction pathway that minimizes creation of a protonated amine group that interferes with GOR. When the performance of EBC using this catalyst as an anodic electrode is measured, the EBC shows a high open-circuit voltage of 0.54 V and a maximum power density of 38 μW/cm2 © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Understanding the inhibition of cellulase activity in the presence of ionic liquids (IL) is extremely important towards engineering IL tolerant enzymes for biomass saccharification and subsequent biofuel production. Here we report the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a highly active and thermostable GH1 β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) B8CYA8 from Halothermothrix orenii in the presence of the IL, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM][Cl]). In the presence of IL, we observed a lack of destabilization of the overall protein structure but instead a localized increase in fluctuations of active site pocket residues corresponding to the loop region, gatekeeper region, aglycone binding site, and glycone binding site. The role of specific residues was confirmed by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Chemical Shift Perturbation (CSP) analyses. Since the enzymatic saccharification requires the proper arrangement of catalytic side chains, residue fluctuation within the active site tunnel affects the reaction rate. Indeed, while B8CYA8 exhibits very high IL tolerance, high concentrations of IL inhibit the enzyme, our analyses show that in high concentrations of IL, the IL accumulates at the active site pocket entrance and near the active site catalytic residues to restrict substrate accessibility to the catalytic site and decreases enzyme activity. Unlike the reaction product glucose, the IL does not change the overall tunnel diameter to constrict substrate access. To understand how IL viscosity may affect enzyme behavior, we determined the self-diffusion constant and show that the presence of IL has a significant effect on substrate access to the catalytic site due to the low diffusivity of the substrate in IL. These results highlight the role played by the residues in active site pocket and the IL properties and may guide in the design of better protein and IL pairs for efficient catalysis. © 2020

AB  - Although algal biofuels have been promoted as a carbon-neutral alternative to fossil fuels, several economic and technological barriers challenge the much-anticipated success of algae as a commercial bio-feedstock. In particular, utilizing only a lipid portion of harvested algal biomass limits possible monetary returns from algal biomass within which non-lipid compounds generally comprise a major proportion. Previous studies thus demonstrated the production of ethanol from defatted algal biomass to improve overall economic outlook of the nascent algae industry; however, it is also possible to utilize residual algal biomass as a fermentation substrate for bacterial strains producing high value alternative products. Therefore, the goal of this study was to compare the yield of biosurfactant from B. subtilis C9 in conventional culture medium and the acid hydrolysate of defatted Chlorella biomass (DCB). Although increasing the concentration of acid catalyst from 0 N to 1.0 N was expected to proportionally enhance the effectiveness of dilute acid hydrolysis, the results indicated that DCB hydrolysates treated under different acid conditions at 121 °C for 15 min exhibited the highest yield of fermentable monosaccharides when treated with 0.25 N HCl. Subsequently, the fermentation of B. subtilis C9 was performed in both Luria-Bertani (LB) and DCB hydrolysate medium after adjusting salinity and monosaccharide concentration to identical levels; a significantly greater yield of biosurfactant was observed in the culture grown with DCB hydrolysate medium, while the presence of magnesium and manganese co-factors in DCB hydrolysate contributed to a greater biosurfactant yield. Collectively, these results suggest that the valorization of defatted algal biomass could be also accomplished by incorporating biosurfactant fermentation into algal biorefinery processes and call for further process optimization efforts that consider factors associated with the operation of industrial algal biorefineries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study is to investigate the suitability of Lemon Peel Oil (LPO) as a partial substitution to a conventional gasoline engine. LPO is a novel, renewable, and sustainable alternative biofuel derived from lemon rinds. LPO is a promising fuel for SI engine operation as its properties such as lower heating value, air/fuel ratio, and octane rating are comparable to gasoline. This study aims to evaluate the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of two different gasoline-LPO blends in Port Fuel Injection (PFI) engine. For this purpose, two different blends of LPO, 20% and 40% has been prepared with gasoline by volumetric concentration. A comparative analysis of combustion, performance, and emission characteristics are evaluated in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, PFI engine. The obtained results are compared with the baseline fuel gasoline under various engine loads. For statistical understanding, ANOVA with two factors interaction is performed. The experimental results showed that the LPO20 and LPO40 have similar brake thermal efficiency as compared to gasoline. Kinetic modeling and sensitivity studies for LPO and gasoline laminar flames showed that the improved combustion of LPO could be related to its higher laminar flame speeds compared to gasoline at lean and stoichiometric conditions. There is a reduction in HC and CO emission is observed with the addition of LPO in gasoline for each engine loading condition. However, higher NOx emission is noted with an increase in LPO concentration in the blend. Overall, the experimental investigation showed that LPO is a promising alternative renewable source for PFI engines. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the rapid development of spacecraft such as rocket, it is increasingly important to develop high-energy and sustainable fuels. Biofuels synthesized from biomass derivatives provide great convenience for sustainable development. In this work, we reported a route for synthesis of high-energy cyclopropane bio-kerosene by cyclopropanation of myrcene with zinc carbenoid. The reaction conditions including reaction time, reaction temperature, solvent and molar ratio were optimized. Finally, a tricyclic cyclopropane bio-kerosene was synthesized with 69.8% yield under optimum conditions (i.e. zinc carbenoid synthesis temperature of −15 °C, cyclopropanation temperature of 25 °C and solvent of dichloromethane). Importantly, this bio-kerosene possesses a high specific impulse of 328.25 s, much better than the commercial rocket kerosene RP-1, as well as a high net-heat-value of 43.4 MJ/kg and good low-temperature properties. © 2020

AB  - The present work details the effects of injection of higher order alcohols, namely hexanol (Hex) and octanol (Oct) as secondary fuels in a CI engine. The last decade has seen an exponential increase in the carbon emission chief of which have been contributed by fossil fuels. Vegetable oils provide a viable alternative to the current scenario as they can be synthesized easily from nature and can be readily adapted for use in CI engines. Neem oil (NO) is non-edible and widely available and hence taken as a base fuel for this research. The poor properties of neem oil were improved by the addition of novel low viscous biofuel, namely wintergreen oil (WGO). During the course of this research work, a blend containing a mixture of 50% of neat neem oil and 50% of wintergreen oil (NO50-WGO50) was optimized based on trial tests and taken as pilot fuel while Hex and Oct were injected along with intake air as secondary fuels. The alcohols were injected into the engine successively in the 10%, 20%, and 30% (by mass) ratios. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder CI engine fabricating 5.2-kW power at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at varying load conditions. It is observed that inferior performance of NO led to more smoke, HC, and CO in comparison to diesel at all the loads and these are improved with NO50-WGO50 blend. Nevertheless, a minor increase in NOx emission was perceived with the blend. Addition of higher order alcohol promoted reduction of both NOx and smoke emission without affecting performance. Among the various combinations, NO50-WGO50 + Hex30 and Oct30 reduced NOx emission by 12% and 9.5% and smoke emission by 13% and 19% respectively. These results are on par with the diesel performance and emission characteristics. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of Enteromorpha prolifera (EP) (seaweeds) with waste plastics (high density polyethylene (HDPE)) for maximum yield of enhanced biofuels has been investigated. Main and interaction effects of three effective co-pyrolysis parameters (pyrolysis temperature, feedstock blending ratio and heating rate) on bio-oil, char and gas yields were also modeled and simulated, respectively. Optimization studies using central composite rotatable experimental design were performed in Design Expert® Version 8.0.6 software to predict the optimal conditions of co-pyrolysis parameters for maximum yield of enhanced biofuels. Analysis of variance was carried out to determine whether the fit of multiple regressions was significant for second order models. Compositions of bio-oils and chars from the pyrolysis of EP, HDPE and their mixtures at different blending ratios were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis technique. Other important properties of oils and chars such as heating values, water contents, and specific gravity were also determined. Results of products’ analysis revealed that synergistic effect exists between EP and HDPE during co-pyrolysis which led to enhanced seaweed biofuels. Statistical analysis’ results unveiled that feedstock blending ratio, pyrolysis temperature and heating rate significantly influenced bio-oil and char yield rates. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Dodecamolydbophosphoric acid (HPMo) immobilized on USY zeolite was used as a catalyst for the acetalization of glycerol with pentanal at 70 °C. Catalysts were prepared with different amounts of heteropolyacid, and the most active sample was the HPMo2@Y catalyst (1.1 wt.%). The products of glycerol acetalization with pentanal were (2-butyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methanol, a five-member ring compound, and 2-butyl-1,3-dioxan-5-ol, a six-member ring compound. Good values of selectivity for the five-member ring compound (80–85%) were obtained with all materials. The reaction conditions were optimized using HPMo2@Y as a catalyst. The optimal conditions were determined to be 70 °C reaction temperature with 0.3 g catalyst and a 1:2.5 M ratio of glycerol to pentanal. The catalytic stability of HPMo2@Y was studied. The acetalization of glycerol with pentanal was performed using the same sample. High catalytic activity for HPMo2@Y was observed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The selective hydroconversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to biofuels is currently highly sought-for. While the literature has demonstrated that this reaction is possible on promoted Ni catalysts, we show here that a monometallic, non-promoted Ni/SBA-15 catalyst, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, can convert HMF to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and to 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) at 180 °C, in a consecutive way. Through a control over reaction time, high yields to DMF (71 %, at conversion of 93 %) or DMTHF (97 %, at conversion of 100 %) can be achieved. Kinetic modelling suggests a preferential route to DMF via 5-methylfurfural (MFFR) as intermediate, though the route via 2,5-bis(hydroxylmethyl)furan (BHMF) is also present. The favored route in the experimental conditions involves the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxyl group of HMF as first step, followed by the hydrogenation of the aldehyde function, to methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFOL). It is suggested a higher reaction rate of hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis of the side group is linked to the presence of a methyl group in the molecule. No hydrogenation of the furan ring is detected on the intermediates. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This work studied the performance of Rh, Pd and Ni supported on Nb2O5 catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation of phenol in the vapor phase. In general, an increase in reduction temperature favored benzene selectivity. For Ni/Nb2O5, this selectivity increased around 50%. The change in reduction temperature also affected the reaction rates. After reduction at 500 °C, there was a decline in these rates for all samples (a 75-fold decrease for Pd/Nb2O5). This behavior was related to structural modifications caused by strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). For Pd sample, the increase in benzene selectivity (around 30%) was related to a partial encapsulation of the metal by NbOx, which led to an electron enrichment of the Pd particles, as indicated by XPS analysis. This alteration caused an enhancement in the adsorption of phenol through its oxygen. For Rh/Nb2O5, the reduction temperature did not change the benzene selectivity. According to TPR-XANES results, Rh is fully reduced for both reduction conditions studied. On other hand, Ni sample was not fully reduced after H2 treatment at 300 °C, as observed in TPR-XANES at Ni K-edge. It was hypothesized that higher reduction temperatures favored the Ni-NbOx interface, which probably improved the oxophilicity of this sample and, consequently, the benzene selectivity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of oak wood was carried out in tubular micro reactors at different temperatures (280–330 °C), reaction times (10–30 min), and catalyst loads (10–50 wt%) using metallic Ni catalysts. For the first time, to enhance the catalytic activity of Ni particles, a coating technique producing a nanostructured surface was used, maintaining anyway the micrometric dimension of the catalyst, necessary for an easier recovery. The optimum conditions for non-catalytic liquefaction tests were determined to be 330 °C and 10 min with the bio-crude yield of 32.88%. The addition of metallic Ni catalysts (Commercial Ni powder and nanostructured surface-modified Ni particle) increased the oil yield and inhibited the char formation through hydrogenation action. Nano modified Ni catalyst resulted in a better catalytic activity in terms of bio-crude yield (36.63%), thanks to the higher surface area due to the presence of flower-like superficial nanostructures. Also, bio-crude quality resulted improved with the use of the two catalysts, with a decrease of C/H ratio and a corresponding increase of the high heating value (HHV). The magnetic recovery of the catalysts and their reusability was also investigated with good results. © 2018

AB  - Non-noble bimetallic Co8Ni2/NC nanoalloy catalyst is prepared through impregnation of cobalt and nickel precursors on nitrogen doped carbon derived from sustainable chitin. Compared to monometallic Co or Ni catalyst and other reported materials, Co8Ni2/NC catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity, high selectivity and good stability towards vanillin hydrodeoxygenation to obtain 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP), a promising way of upgrade biofuel. Characterizations indicate that the active f.c.c. phase of metal alloy can be generated under the induction of nickel component. Kinetic experiment suggests that the activation energy vanillin alcohol over bimetal catalysts are lower than pure nickel or cobalt catalyst, confirming that the synergetic effect between cobalt and nickel also improve its higher catalytic activity. © 2019

AB  - This study systematically investigated the bioenergy potential of Phragmites communis, a large perennial grass found in wetlands. The biofuel physicochemical characteristics of Phragmites were determined and a pyrolysis kinetic study and thermal behaviour analysis were performed. Thermal degradation was investigated by exposing dried and powdered biomass to different heating rates (10, 20, 30, and 40 ℃/min) using TG-FTIR-GC/MS. The pyrolysis process of Phragmites communis occurred in three stages, with maximum mass loss (59.32%) during the main stage of devolatilization in the range of 150–500 ℃. The iso-conversional models of Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method was applied to explain the reaction chemistry, with good statistical confidence (R2 ≥ 0.9). The kinetic reaction mechanism of the three sub-stages predicted by the master-plots is f(α) = 3α2/3; f(α) = 3α3/4; and f(α) = 2 (1 − α)2, respectively. The coupled TG-FTIR-GC/MS analyses allowed identification of the volatile species as the major pyrolytic products, including acids, ketones, furan, phenols, benzene, furan, and alkane. Based on the thermodynamic parameters of Phragmites communis, this material is a promising feedstock for bioenergy production, and this study provides theoretical and practical guidance for effective energy and resource utilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sugarcane molasses (SM) a low-cost substrate was used for single-cell oil production by Mucor circinelloides. Cultivations were carried out with diluted molasses at a concentration of 40 g sugars L−1 with and without nutrients supplementation. The best performance in regard to the lipid productivity (0.66 g L−1 day−1), biomass (11.2 g L−1) and lipid content (29 wt.%) was attained in a medium containing SM supplemented with minor nutrients. The profile of fatty acid composition revealed suitable properties for biodiesel synthesis, although high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were also found, which may suggest the possibility of using the oleaginous biomass from Mucor circinelloides URM 4182 as feedstock to yield both products. Concentrated solutions of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of the acylglycerol structures, while biodiesel was prepared by direct transesterification of the oleaginous biomass using acid heterogeneous catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: Biodiesel is an alternative sustainable energy source and can be utilized in the compression ignition engine without any changes in the engine design. This research work focuses on the preparation of Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester through two steps of transesterification process and its implementation in common rail direct injection diesel engines under various fuel injection strategies. At the initial stage of the current research work, two biodiesel blends of 10 vol% and 20 vol% with remaining quantity as diesel have been used as fuel in a diesel engine at a fuel injection pressure of 600 bar at 5%, 10% and 15% pilot injection variations. In the second stage, the study has been extended for the same strategies of injecting the fuel at the rates of 10% and 20% exhaust gas recirculation. All the experimental results are compared with diesel fuel at an injection pressure of 600 bar with 10% pilot injection. The experimental results revealed that an increase in the blend ratio of biodiesel enhances the combustion, performance characteristics and proliferation of pilot injection from 5 to 15% facilitates spontaneous and complete combustion. It is observed that 15% pilot injection quantity of 20 vol% Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester blend has shown the best performance among the test samples with other injection strategies. The results also showed that the implementation of exhaust gas recirculation at 10% and 20% rates during diesel engine operation is evident in lower performance characteristics with a significant impact on oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide emissions.

AB  - This study reports the first investigation of the systematic introduction of defects in functionalized UiO-66 structures and its effect on their catalytic activities. Indeed, fifteen UiO-66-based MOFs were synthesized and used as catalysts in the esterification reaction of butyric acid in presence of butanol to produce the novel green biofuel additive, butyl butyrate. The samples included three different structures, UiO-66, UiO-66(COOH)2, and UiO-66(NH2), and five different modulation synthesis conditions for each structure yielding a total of fifteen samples. The increase in the modulator acidity or concentration significantly increased the number of missing linkers per cluster, surface area, and pore volume of the three structures. This leads to the increase in the conversion to butyl butyrate to levels higher than those previously achieved with similar systems. The improved conversion in each structure was attributed to the missing-linker defective sites which act as catalytic centers for the activation of butyric acid. However, using organic linkers with uncoordinated Brønsted acid sites boosted the catalytic activity of UiO-66(COOH)2 to levels higher than both counterparts even for lower number of defects, surface area, and pore size. The catalytic reaction was thus proved to be occurring utilizing both the defective sites and the carboxylic functional groups as catalytic centers and a reaction mechanism is proposed based on this assumption. Finally, the choice of the organic linker for the engineering of the MOFs' structure in catalytic applications offers abundant possibilities especially if coupled with the systematic increase in defective sites to overcome challenging diffusion limitations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The operation of wearable epidermal biofuel cells is prone to rapid irreversible deactivation effects under dynamic sweat pH changes from neutral to acidic. We demonstrate that the encapsulation of lactate-oxidase (LOx) within a hydrophobic protective carbon-paste anode imparts unusually high stability during dynamically changing pH fluctuations and allows the BFC to continue harvesting the lactate bioenergy even after long exposures to acidic conditions. The unique power-recovery ability of the carbon-paste BFC after its failure in harsh pH is attributed to the protective action of the non-polar paste environment. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Production and use of bio-based products offer advantages over conventional petrochemicals, yet the relatively high cost of production has restricted their mainstream adoption. Optimization of wastewater treatment processes could reduce capital expenditures, lowering the barrier to market entry for lignocellulosic biorefineries. This paper characterizes wastewater associated with lignocellulosic ethanol production and evaluates potential wastewater treatment operations. Results: It is found that organic material is intrinsic to bioconversion wastewater, representing up to 260 kg of biological oxygen demand per tonne of feedstock processed. Inorganics in the wastewater largely originate from additions during pretreatment and pH adjustments, which increase the inorganic loading by 44 kg per tonne of feedstock processed. Adjusting the ethanol production process to decrease addition of inorganic material could reduce the demands and therefore cost of waste treatment. Various waste treatment technologies - including those that take advantage of ecosystem services provided by feedstock production - were compared in terms of capital and operating costs, as well as technical feasibility. Conclusions: It is concluded that wastewater treatment technologies should be better integrated with conversion process design and feedstock production. Efforts to recycle resources throughout the biofuel supply chain through application of ecosystem services provided by adjacent feedstock plantations and recovery of resources from the waste stream to reduce overall capital and operating costs of bioconversion facilities. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Costs of producing “advanced” biofuels (those with the lowest GHG and land use impacts) have not decreased in recent years as envisioned by analysts. Despite aggressive policy incentives, no transition to a lower cost mature industry has occurred. Information about the cost dynamics and slow industry emergence is of major interest to policymakers and others seeking to understand the likely success – and cost – of incentive programs. This paper reviews literature on production cost at the plantgate – without considering taxes or delivery costs – for selected biofuel technology pathways using a levelized cost of fuel approach, applying common financing assumptions for capital amortization and converting all values to year 2016 dollars, and examines results in the current low carbon fuel policy context. The average production cost estimate for cellulosic ethanol was $4 per gallon-gasoline equivalent (gge). For drop-in fuels, the pyrolysis-biocrude-hydro treatment pathway had the lowest average production cost estimate at about $3.25/gge. Biomass to liquid (BTL) production cost estimates averaged $3.80/gge, while hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) – the sole fuel studied gaining commercial traction – averaged about $3.70/gge. Estimate ranges did not allow any definitive rank ordering of the fuels by production cost. Production cost estimates are higher in later than in earlier publications for non-HEFA fuels due primarily to higher costs for feedstock and capital expenditure components. This may reflect learning from early but largely unsuccessful commercialization efforts that yielded more realistic (and higher cost) information and detail on feedstock provision and conversion processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aldol condensation between furfural (FA) and MIBK is used to synthesize branched bio-jet-fuel precursors. It remains difficult to design hybrid solid bases to efficiently promote this reaction, because only strong basic sites can activate MIBK. Different basic species were immobilized into zirconia/carbon hybrid supports by thermal decomposition of GO/UiO materials loaded with corresponding alkane (earth) nitrides. Only Cs immobilized zirconia/carbon (CsZC) could efficiently promote this reaction, while counterparts with Li, Mg and Ca species showed little activity over condensation between MIBK and FA. Optimized CsZC showed excellent FA conversion and selectivity towards desired products (88.6% in yields of FMIBK in 6 h at 130 °C). Two indirect proofs were provided to check the influence of basic strength on the catalytic performance, and only Cs samples had enough strong basic sites to accelerate the reaction. After modified with octyl groups, hydrophobic CsZC were reused for 4th cycle while retaining most of its original activity. Functionalization with organosilanes increased the hydrophobicity of the surface, which had dramatical promotion on activity, selectivity, and stability. It was the first time to run recycling experiments for this reaction, to afford the demands for chemical sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Organosulfonic acid functionalized montemorillonite-MMT (K10 and cloisite Na+) were prepared by different methodologies: (a) one-pot organosilylation or sulfonation, and (b) two-step organosilylation followed by sulfonation or oxidation. The physicochemical characterization ensured the success of the selected methodologies to promote HSO3-functionalization including high S contents (2.84 mmol S/g) and acidities up to 6.03 mmol H+/g (K10_PhSO3H). All the organosulfonic acid functionalized MMT were tested as acid catalyst in the esterification of free fatty acids in a hybrid feedstock model. Conversions of 100% were obtained after 60 min for K10_PhTESO3H, K10_SO3H, Cloi_PhTESO3H and Cloi_H2SO4, in accordance with the acid character of these catalysts, prepared by one-pot and two-step methodologies involving a sulfonation step. The MMT catalysts obtained by direct sulfonation exhibited the highest TOF whereas those obtained by two-step organosilylation-sulfonation showed the highest stability and reusability. The increase of FFA carbon chain length led to higher conversions, showing the prevalence of inductive effect and absence of steric effects on the esterification mechanism using these organosulfonic acid functionalized catalysts. Moreover, K10-PhSO3H was applied as solid acid catalyst in a simultaneous (trans) esterification of different feedstock types for biodiesel production giving up to 100% of FAMEs under moderate conditions. © 2019

AB  - MgAl hydrotalcite was successfully prepared through the sol-gel method and modified by in situ addition of base metals (Me = K, Ba, Sr and La). The Me–MgAl hydrotalcites were calcined and the obtained oxides were evaluated as catalysts for ethylic transesterification in order to investigate their potential application for biodiesel production. The Me–MgAl characterization revealed that the materials present different crystalline structures and the metal addition caused surface area reduction and increased the apparent crystallite size. On the other hand, the addition of the base metals to hydrotalcite deeply affected the base properties of the oxides, increasing their catalytic activity. Particularly, the Ba–MgAl presents the highest amount of strong base sites which resulted in a high conversion (≈90%) in the model transesterification reaction between methyl acetate and ethanol. Furthermore, an ester conversion of about 80% was reached in soybean oil transesterification. Moreover, the Ba–MgAl can be reused for 3 batch cycles with low deactivation. These results suggest that Ba–MgAl can be considered a promising heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to obtain ethyl esters (EEs) from macauba pulp crude oil, using heterogeneous-acid catalyst, varying the temperature of (trans)esterification, ethanol-to-oil molar ratio (MR) and catalyst content. Catalyst Amberlyst 15 characterization showed high concentrations of active sites of 3400 μmol g−1 and a surface area of 31.3 m2 g−1, which associated with the resin macroporous structure. A Central composite rotational design (CCRD) 2³ design and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to analyze the studied variables effects on the EEs production: temperature (80–180 °C), ethanol-to-oil MR (4–14) and catalyst Amberlyst 15 content (1–20 wt%). EEs formed were quantified by gas chromatography, and the RSM showed that the reaction presented EEs yields greater than 85% with a high index selectivity (817.4). The desirability procedure showed, that for both Free fatty acids (FFAs) conversion and EEs yield, the optimum conditions were the same, being 130 °C, ethanol-to-oil MR 9 and 16 wt% of catalyst. The biodiesel obtained was characterized and all the analyzed parameters agreed with the national biofuel-monitoring agency. The process conditions and the characterization of produced EEs showed that macauba crude pulp oil has good potential for biodiesel production using heterogeneous acid-catalyst. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Efficient bioethanol production from hemicellulose feedstocks by Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires xylose utilization. Whereas S. cerevisiae does not metabolize xylose, engineered strains that express xylose isomerase can metabolize xylose by converting it to xylulose. For this, the type II xylose isomerase from Piromyces (PirXI) is used but the in vivo activity is rather low and very high levels of the enzyme are needed for xylose metabolism. In this study, we explore the use of protein engineering and in vivo selection to improve the performance of PirXI. Recently solved crystal structures were used to focus mutagenesis efforts. Results: We constructed focused mutant libraries of Piromyces xylose isomerase by substitution of second shell residues around the substrate- and metal-binding sites. Following library transfer to S. cerevisiae and selection for enhanced xylose-supported growth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, two novel xylose isomerase mutants were obtained, which were purified and subjected to biochemical and structural analysis. Apart from a small difference in response to metal availability, neither the new mutants nor mutants described earlier showed significant changes in catalytic performance under various in vitro assay conditions. Yet, in vivo performance was clearly improved. The enzymes appeared to function suboptimally in vivo due to enzyme loading with calcium, which gives poor xylose conversion kinetics. The results show that better in vivo enzyme performance is poorly reflected in kinetic parameters for xylose isomerization determined in vitro with a single type of added metal. Conclusion: This study shows that in vivo selection can identify xylose isomerase mutants with only minor changes in catalytic properties measured under standard conditions. Metal loading of xylose isomerase expressed in yeast is suboptimal and strongly influences kinetic properties. Metal uptake, distribution and binding to xylose isomerase are highly relevant for rapid xylose conversion and may be an important target for optimizing yeast xylose metabolism. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - While furfural has great potential as a platform chemical through diverse conversion pathways, 2-methylfuran is one of the key components as a fuel additive and a precursor of derived biofuels. However, catalyst design to control reactivity of active species to furfural has been challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that a mesoporous Cu−Al2O3 catalyst prepared by solvent-deficient precipitation shows the enhancement of furfural hydrodeoxygenation performance. Not only is the unique pore structure provided, but also the synergistic effects of improved Cu accessibility, co-existence of Cu0/Cu+ states, and strong metal-support interaction contribute to the superior activity and stability. Additionally, essential parameters for the synthesis and the test reaction are studied to improve the selectivity to 2-methylfuran. The employed catalyst preparation method opens a new channel for tailoring the bifunctionality of supported Cu catalysts. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In recent years, interest has increased in the use of agro-industrial wastes for use as raw materials in the production of second-generation biofuels and other products of industrial interest. A pretreatment is necessary, followed by an enzymatic hydrolysis to obtain high yields of fermentable sugars. In the present study, the best conditions were established both for peroxide-alkaline pretreatment and for enzymatic hydrolysis of the Mexican barley straw (Hordeum vulgare L.) variety Doña Josefa in order to maximize lignin removal and improve enzyme conversion. Response surface methodology based on a Box–Behnken experimental design was used to optimize pretreatment conditions (concentration of hydrogen peroxide [H2O2], reaction time, and liquid–solid ratio (LSR)), and enzymatic hydrolysis (cellulase and xylanase concentrations and reaction time). Samples obtained from residual bagasse at each process stage were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared spectrometry (FTIR) to evaluate the changes in the structure of the material after treatments. In pretreatment optimization, it was possible to obtain 60% delignification at a 6% peroxide concentration and a 12:1 LSR in 24 h. In saccharification, a maximum 82% conversion of cellulose to glucose using 6% cellulase (Cellic® CTec III), and 4% xylanase (Cellic® HTec III) in 20 h of hydrolysis, was used in obtaining a maximum sugar concentration of 70 g/L. Peroxide-alkaline pretreatment together with state-of-the-art enzyme saccharification makes barley straw an excellent alternative for fermentable sugar production that can be used for various biotech industries. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Considering the rapid decline in the amount of fossil fuels and the large quantities of emissions they release into the atmosphere, which are responsible for global warming, researchers are looking for alternative sources of energy. Biodiesel is an alternative source that is suitable for use as an alternative to diesel and can result in a reduction in the level of pollutants released. It has been observed that trans-esterified cooking oil can be combusted in an internal combustion engine like different biofuels with no major adjustments. Recent studies have proved that with the addition of nanoadditives, the performance and emissions have a very good impact on the environment. In the present experimental study, trans-esterified vegetable oil was used as biodiesel, along with the addition of nanoadditives (alumina) to diesel, and the outcomes were compared with baseline diesel operation. The nanoadditive was blended in the fuel mixture alongside an appropriate surfactant. Various blends were made and used for this investigation. Performance, emission and combustion parameters were studied using a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine at various loads, keeping a constant compression ratio of 18. Due to the availability of oxygen in the biodiesel and the better blending capacities of the nanoparticles, it was observed that there was a reduction in the opacity, CO and HC emissions; however, there was a small increment in NOx. It was also observed that the specific fuel consumption decreased with the increase in in-cylinder pressures. The outcomes showed that the addition of alumina in the diesel-biodiesel mixture has a positive overall effect on the environment. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Clean energy and renewable fine chemicals including biofuels, hydrogen, and bicarbonates are critical for a sustainable and green future. In this study, the integrated production of naturally separated high density liquid biofuels (mainly C7 and C14 olefins), hydrogen gas, and fine chemicals is achieved in an electrochemical cell under ambient conditions. Biofuels are obtained by anodic decarboxylation of the carboxylates, hydrogen is obtained by cathodic reduction of water, and fine chemicals are obtained by the reaction between the alkaline aqueous solution and the anodic carbon dioxide products. An environmentally friendly and low-cost aqueous substitution method is employed to prepare self-supporting Pt nanospheres on 3D porous titanium sponge (Pt@TS) composite electrodes for such an integrated electrolysis. A Pt@TS anode with abundant Pt(100) facets exhibits enhanced activity and stability for electrocatalytic biofuel production as compared with commercial Pt anodes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of crude glycerol from biodiesel production is a feasible way for methane production. However, crude glycerol (CG) contains impurities, such as long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) that can inhibit methanogenic microorganisms. Ultrasound promotes the hydrolysis of LCFA and deagglomerates the microorganisms in biological flocs. Furthermore, Aspergillus niger and Escherichia coli produce lipases capable of degrading LCFA. This study aims at improving the methane yield from anaerobic digestion by coupling with ultrasound or E. coli/A. niger biodegradation. The effect of the different treatments was first assessed in a perfectly mixed batch reactor (PMBR), using diluted CG at concentrations of 0.2%, 1.7%, and 3.2% (v/v). Later, the best conditions were replicated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor to simulate full-scale practical applications. Experiments in the PMBR showed that ultrasound or A. niger biodegradation steps improved methane yield up to 11% for 0.2% CG and 99% for 1.7% CG, respectively. CG biodegradation by E. coli inhibited the subsequent anaerobic digestion for all concentrations tested. Using a UASB digester, ultrasonic treatment of CG led to an average increase of 29% in methane production. The application of ultrasound led to a lower accumulation of propionic acid in the digested material and increased biogas production. On the other hand, an average 77% increase in methane production was achieved using a preliminary CG biodegradation step by A. niger, when operated at a loading rate of 2.9 kg COD m-3 day-1. Under these conditions, an energy gain of 0.48 kWh day-1, with the production of the 0.434 m3 CH4 kg-1 CODremoval and 0.573 m3 CH4 kg-1 VS, and a biogas quality of 73% in methane were obtained. The digested material was analyzed for the detection and quantification of added-value by-products in order to obtain a broad assessment of the CG valorization through anaerobic digestion. In some experiments, propionic and oxalic acid were detected. However, the accumulation of propionic caused the inhibition of the acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study reports the fabrication of a new cathode electrode assembly using polyaniline (PANI) and graphene on a stainless steel mesh (SSM) as an alternative for the conventional expensive cathode of microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). With respect to the previous efforts to propose an efficient and cost-effective alternative for platinum (Pt) catalysts and cathode electrodes, the present study investigates the assessment of different catalysts to elucidate the potential of the modified SSM cathode electrode for larger-scale MECs. In the case of feeding dairy wastewater to the MEC, the maximum hydrogen production rate and COD removal were obtained by SSM/PANI/graphene cathode and had the values 0.805 m3 H2 m−3 anolyte day−1 and 82%, respectively, at the applied potential of 1 V. These values were only 20% and 7% lower than those of the MEC with Pt on the carbon cloth cathode, respectively. The coulombic efficiencies of SSM/Pt and SSM/PANI/graphene were seen to be 64.48% and 56.67%, respectively. It was also concluded that the fabrication cost of the modified cathode was 50% lower than the conventional cathodes with Pt on the carbon cloth. Finally, the evaluation of the modified cathode performance was achieved based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the influence of stirring and mixing on the production of soybean biodiesel. It was verified the influence of the baffle, different stirring speeds and two types of impellers (turbine and blade). The experiments were conducted by full experimental design 23 with the following fixed parameters: temperature (70 °C), oil/ethanol molar ratio (1/10), catalyst amount (1.5%), and reaction time (30 min). The independent variables were impeller type (turbine or blade), baffle (presence or absence), and stirring speed (150 or 350 rpm). Chromatographic analyses helped to determine the yield of biodiesel production at different operating times. The optimized parameters turbine impeller, absence of baffle, and stirring speed of 350 rpm provided high biodiesel yields within the first minutes of reaction. The analysis of the effect over time allows to verify in which period the variables had more influence on the biodiesel production and in which time there is no increase of the yield. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The present study was aimed to demonstrate a semi-commercial biomethanation plant based on anaerobic gas lift reactor (AGR) for the mono and co-digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and landfill leachate (LL) for 47 weeks. The reactors were commissioned at a volatile organic loading rate (VOLR) starting from 0.4 to 6.2 kg VS/(m3·day) to investigate the impact of VOLR on the organic matter removal rates, substrate utilization rate using Stover-Kincannon reaction kinetics, biogas yield and microbial diversity. 16s-metagenomic sequencing of the species present in the inoculum that was acclimatized with OFMSW, LL separately and in combination was also performed to identify the dominant microbial species in the mixed microbial consortia. Results revealed that the VS reduction in AGR 1, AGR 2 and AGR 3 at full load was 46%, 42% and 47% respectively with a corresponding biogas generation of 73.8 m3/day, 42 m3/day and 60.8 m3/day. The biodegradability in AGR 1 was between 73% and 81% whereas in AGR 2 and AGR 3, it was between 57% and 78% and 64% and 86% respectively. The operational strategy of digestate recirculation facilitated in the reduced usage of buffering chemicals which impacted on overall financials of the plant. The techno-economic analysis suggests that these kinds of biomethanation plants are remunerative. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hazards to health and the environment associated with the transportation sector include smog, particulate matter, and greenhouse gas emissions. Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels has the potential to provide significant amounts of infrastructure-compatible liquid transportation fuels that reduce those hazardous materials. However, the development of these technologies is inefficient, due to: (i) the lack of a priori fuel property consideration, (ii) poor shared vocabulary between process chemists and fuel engineers, and (iii) modern and future engines operating outside the range of traditional autoignition metrics such as octane or cetane numbers. In this perspective, we describe an approach where we follow a “fuel-property first” design methodology with a sequence of (i) identifying the desirable fuel properties for modern engines, (ii) defining molecules capable of delivering those properties, and (iii) designing catalysts and processes that can produce those molecules from a candidate feedstock in a specific conversion process. Computational techniques need to be leveraged to minimize expenses and experimental efforts on low-promise options. This concept is illustrated with current research information available for biomass conversion to fuels via catalytic fast pyrolysis and hydrotreating; outstanding challenges and research tools necessary for a successful outcome are presented. © 2020

AB  - To minimize waste production and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, agricultural waste such as rice straw has been actively used in biochemical production. In Taiwan, cellulosic waste has been used in anaerobic digestion for bioethanol production. This process produces a large amount of biomass-associated sludge that may become a serious environmental issue. Therefore, in this study, the anaerobic digestion sludge was recycled for the production of activated carbon via pyrolysis and activation by KOH. Surface characterization showed increased surface area and development of microporous structure upon activation. The FTIR image showed that high temperature activation eliminated most functional groups in the activated carbon, except for C[dbnd]O and C–O groups. The results showed that the activated carbon could be used for pollutant adsorbents such as molecular dyes (methylene blue: 217 mg g−1) and metal ions (copper: 169 mg g−1) from aqueous solution. In addition, the as-synthesized activated carbon can be used for CO2 capture and capacitor. Instead of focusing on one single application, we proposed that centralized production of activated carbon could be used in various applications, while further modification could be adopted depending on the need of its specific application. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Oxidative fast pyrolysis of sawdust was performed in a pilot scale fluidized bed system (3 kg/h) under stabilized experimental conditions (0.20 equivalence ratio and 550 °C). Experiments were performed in non-catalytic and catalytic (ZSM-5) mode. During non-catalytic fast pyrolysis, bio-oil (∼38 wt%), bio-char (∼12 wt%) and pyro-gas (∼50 wt%) were obtained; in contrast, for catalytic fast pyrolysis bio-oil, bio-char and pyro-gas yields were ∼44 wt%, ∼4 wt% and ∼52 wt% respectively. The obtained bio-oil was characterized through CHNSO, NMR (1H and 13C NMR), FT-IR and GC–MS techniques. GC–MS analysis of the bio-oil shows it is a mixture of ∼21 chemical compounds. Furthermore, NMR (1H and 13C NMR) and FT-IR results indicates presence of hydrocarbon, alcohol, phenol and aldehyde in the bio-oil. The TGA of bio-char shows that it is stable up to 950 °C. The activation energies (Ea) of sawdust and bio-char are found to be 112.3 kJ/mol and 46.92 kJ/mol respectively. FT-IR analysis of bio-char clearly revealed removal of functionalized organic compounds during devolatilization of sawdust. In addition, GC analysis of pyro-gas suggests that it is a mixture of N2 (35.55 vol%), CO (34.49 vol%), CO2 (16.80 vol%), H2 (4.54 vol%), O2 (4.25 vol%), and CH4 (4.41 vol%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The oxidative Weimberg pathway for the five-step pentose degradation to α-ketoglutarate is a key route for sustainable bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to added-value products and biofuels. The oxidative pathway from Caulobacter crescentus has been employed in in-vivo metabolic engineering with intact cells and in in-vitro enzyme cascades. The performance of such engineering approaches is often hampered by systems complexity, caused by non-linear kinetics and allosteric regulatory mechanisms. Here we report an iterative approach to construct and validate a quantitative model for the Weimberg pathway. Two sensitive points in pathway performance have been identified as follows: (1) product inhibition of the dehydrogenases (particularly in the absence of an efficient NAD+ recycling mechanism) and (2) balancing the activities of the dehydratases. The resulting model is utilized to design enzyme cascades for optimized conversion and to analyse pathway performance in C. cresensus cell-free extracts. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The sustainability of biodiesel adoption in diesel engines are dependent on its environmental friendliness relative to lower pollutant emissions. Biodiesel was produced from extracted Parinari polyandra oil via alkali catalyzed methanolysis. Performance and emission analysis of a diesel engine was conducted on a diesel engine, operated under different operating conditions, using varied Parinari polyandra biodiesel blends. Exhaust emissions, like total hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides were measured. The biodiesel properties were found to be similar to fossil diesel. B10 was found to be the optimal blend in improving the engine performance in terms of speed, power and thermal efficiency. B30 demonstrated stable performance characteristics without any modification of the diesel engine. The exhaust emissions from biodiesel blends combustion were found to be lower than that of diesel, except nitrogen oxides. High percentage reduction of greenhouse gases, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, was recorded at 81.7% and 65.7%, respectively. The utilization of Parinari polyandra biodiesel for engine application was found to be a viable means of heightening adoption of sustainable biofuels and minimizing pollutant emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Algae biomass has recently attracted the attention of the green energy industry as a raw material for biofuels production. Their high-water content has led to the choice of hydrothermal liquefaction as a suitable way to convert them into bio-oil. From algae species to bio-oil as fuel, many steps are required, including the selection of algae species and process parameters (including catalysts), the liquefaction process, product separation, recovery of crude bio-oil, and subsequent upgrading (if the goal is to use the bio-oil as transportation fuel). This review gives some biochemical, elemental, and inorganic compositions of algae. The reaction mechanism of hydrothermal liquefaction is briefly described, with an emphasis on the influence of process parameters on the yield and quality of the crude bio-oil. The use of organic solvents as reaction media or for recovery of crude bio-oil from product mixtures is discussed. The research work on the catalytic hydrothermal upgrading of algae liquefied crude bio-oil in recent years is reviewed, and some conclusions are put forward. According to recent reports, there is a section devoted to the techno-economic analysis of the hydrothermal liquefaction process. Finally, the challenges that future research and new development strategies may face are proposed. ©

AB  - Pyrolysis of Spirulina Platensis (SP) microalgae was carried out under different reaction environment such as nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at different reaction temperatures of 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 °C. Catalytic upgradations were examined over solid acid (ZSM-5) and solid base (MgO) catalyst, and with ZSM-5-MgO catalysts mixtures. Results showed, pyrolysis of non-catalytic biomass yielded maximum bio-oil of 43.6% under N2. However catalytic upgradation in CO2 environment produced lower bio-oil due to the coke formation. Maximum bio-oil (46.2 wt%) was obtained with basic metal MgO catalyst in N2 environment compared to other catalyst and environments. Mixture of MgO-ZSM-5 catalyst improved the bio-oil yield (37.8–48.6 wt%) compared to individual catalytic reaction under N2 and CO2. Higher high heating value (HHV) was observed in catalytic bio-oil 36.8 MJ/Kg. Bio-oil (catalytic) analysis revealed that 64–70% of compounds are in hydrocarbon range. Bio-oil was rich in hydrocarbons of C7-C18 range with less oxygenated compounds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing demand for biofuel production and global competition for the use of natural resources are key factors in finding new and environmentally safe routes for methanol production. In the present study, life cycle assessment was used to analyse the potential environmental impact and environmental cost of a novel methanol production process from wood compared to a conventional processes. Both the novel and the conventional process were divided into three stages: pre-treatment, gasification, and syngas cleaning and methanol synthesis. The environmental impacts were assessed and compared using Simapro 9 (ecoinvent 3.5 database) and the ReCiPe 2016 (World-H) midpoint method. The results, expressed per tonne methanol, showed that the impact categories of global warming potential (GWP) and marine ecotoxicity potential were lower in the novel process in comparison to the conventional process (48.2 kg CO2 eq. vs. 63.1 kg CO2 eq., and 4.55 kg 1,4-DCB vs. 6.35 kg 1,4-DCB respectively). However, the novel process had a higher environmental impact in the pre-treatment stage. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the GWP of the novel process increased from 48.2 kg CO2 eq. to 216 kg CO2 eq. due to the replacement of Na2CO3 by K2CO3. The human toxicity impact categories showed significant impact on environmental cost. These findings will help relevant industries to reduce their environmental impact and improve the production efficiency of methanol from wood. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mild prehydrogenation of phenolics in bio-oil is known to effectively alleviate the severe coking that occurs on the surface of the cracking catalysts. This study investigated the hydrogenation of phenolic monomers (i.e., phenol, catechol, and guaiacol) over Pt–Ni/SiO2 at different Ni/Pt ratios. The results show that the hydrogenation of aromatic rings preferentially occurred over the Pt–Ni/SiO2 catalyst, with a slight hydrogenolysis of the Caryl–OR bond. The prepared Pt–Ni/SiO2 catalysts not only offered a good dispersion of the Pt and Ni species on SiO2, but also promoted spontaneous dissociation of H2 and facile diffusion of the resulting H atoms on Pt–Ni/SiO2, thereby contributing to its remarkable catalytic performance. The optimized 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 catalyst not only achieved a high phenolic conversion of 66%−99% and a high liquid product yield of 80%, but also significantly inhibited the side reaction of the products leading to gas formation. Furthermore, a stable phenolic conversion of ~80% within 24 h indicates the superior stability of 3Pt6Ni/SiO2. Subsequently, catalytic cracking of the hydrotreated bio-oil was investigated. The results indicate that mild hydrogenation benefits the formation and aromatization of light olefin intermediates, leading to increased formation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The oil phase yield of the bio-oil fraction was 38.6%, comprising entirely hydrocarbons, of which 82.2% were monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hence, this study provides a promising approach for converting the phenolics in bio-oil into highly hydrogenated products, which are ready for the subsequent catalytic cracking. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Single cell oils or microbial lipids produced by oleaginous microorganisms are being utilized for various applications such as nutrition, fuels and valuable chemicals. However, after the extraction of value added products from microbial cells, the residue is generally burned or discarded. In the present study, synthesis of a novel bio-based solid acid catalyst from waste yeast residue has been carried out through sulfonation for biodiesel production. The obtained yeast residue based solid acid (YSA) catalyst showed higher fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 96.2 wt % for waste cooking oil at 60 °C and 94.8 wt % for yeast oil at 70 °C with 4 wt % catalyst concentration and 10:1 methanol to oil molar ratio. The FAME profile indicated the presence of elevated monounsaturated fatty acid content with improved oxidative stability and cold flow properties. The catalyst revealed high catalytic activity, high thermal stability and can be regenerated with its activity maintained up to four cycles. Furthermore, the biodiesel properties were abided with the international fuel standards. © 2020

AB  - Olive tree pruning (OTP) represents an attractive biomass feedstock in the Mediterranean countries and worldwide. In this work, OTP has been studied as raw material for the production of advanced biofuels (i.e. bioethanol) within a biorefinery perspective. After pretreatment by water extraction and phosphoric-acid-catalyzed steam explosion, the whole pretreated slurry was completely inhibitory to the tested Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Detoxification of the liquid fraction overcame such inhibition allowing complete fermentation of both glucose and xylose by the recombinant xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae F12. When reaching sugar depletion, the fermentation broth was fed with the hydrolysate resulting from enzymatic saccharification of the solid fraction at high solid loadings. This process configuration increased ethanol concentrations up to 45 g/L, reaching 80% of the theoretical conversion yields. Overall, about 180 g of ethanol per kg of extracted OTP biomass could be obtained with this process, which increases previous conversion yields by 12.5%. This strategy also enables the use of the extracted fraction for antioxidant production and offers the potential utilization of the xylose-rich fraction to obtain alternative fermentation-based bioproducts (simultaneously obtaining 125–150 g of ethanol per kg of extracted OTP biomass), thus allowing adaptation of the process to the market needs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The valorization of lignin is critical for the economic viability of the bioeconomy. Microbial metabolism is advantageous for handling the myriad of aromatic compounds resulting from lignin chemical or enzymatic depolymerization. Coupling aromatic metabolism to fatty acid biosynthesis makes possible the production of biofuels, oleochemicals, and other fine/bulk chemicals derived from lignin. Our previous work identified Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus as a yeast that could accumulate nearly 70% of its dry cell weight as lipids using aromatics as a sole carbon source. Expanding on this, other oleaginous yeast species were investigated for the metabolism of lignin-relevant monoaromatics. Thirty-six oleaginous yeast species from the Phaff yeast collection were screened for growth on several aromatic compounds representing S-, G-, and H- type lignin. The analysis reported in this study suggests that aromatic metabolism is largely segregated to the Cutaenotrichosporon, Trichosporon, and Rhodotorula clades. Each species tested within each clade has different properties with respect to the aromatics metabolized and the concentrations of aromatics tolerated. The combined analysis suggests that Cutaneotrichosporon yeast are the best suited to broad spectrum aromatic metabolism and support its development as a model system for aromatic metabolism in yeast. © 2020, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - One of the challenging tasks for the researchers is to identify alternative renewable energy feedstocks which can be used as a substitute for fossil fuel to meet the increasing demand for energy, reduce the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and eliminate the increasing concerns of environmental impact. The 2nd generation poppy (Papaver somniferum) seed oil (PSO) can be considered as one of the feedstocks which would be low cost and does not compete with food crops for biodiesel production. In this study, biodiesel production was conducted in 2 stage processes which consist of acid and base–catalysed esterification and transesterification to reduce the free fatty acid (FFA) content of poppy seed oil (PSO) and to increase the yield of poppy seed oil methyl ester (PSOME), respectively. To determine the maximum yield of methyl ester, different parameters that influence the production of methyl ester, namely the molar ratio of methanol to oil (5.0:1–7.0:1), catalyst loading (0.5–1.5 wt.%), reaction temperature (40–80 °C) and time (60–120 min) were investigated under the transesterification reaction. The results found that methanol to oil molar ratio of 6.0:1, catalyst loading of 1.0 (wt.%), reaction temperature of 60 °C and reaction time of 90 min were observed to be the optimum process parameters for maximising the yield of PSOME at a constant speed of 720 rpm. In these conditions, the maximum methyl ester yield was found to be about 93 %. The gas chromatography (GC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition of the PSOME. Furthermore, the physico-chemical properties of the PSOME were evaluated and characterised using ASTM and EN standards for biodiesel. It was found that PSO can be used as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production as most of the physico-chemical properties are within the ASTM and EN standards. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report herein a catalytic deoxygenation strategy that allows the direct removal of oxygen atoms from triglycerides by lowering the activation energy through the use of metal-based catalysts. Activation energies were investigated by TG analysis, employing fatty acid salts as model compounds. Introducing different metal atoms into carboxyl groups has a substantial effect on the dynamic pyrolytic behavior, and decomposition activation energies varied in the range 80–260 kJ/mol. The catalytic cracking of soybean oil using SnO as a representative catalyst has been investigated in a 5 L reactor, whereby the catalyst lowered the decomposition temperature by approximately 40 °C and gave a conversion rate of approximately 66 wt%. A catalytic conversion mechanism has been proposed based on the results of TG-FTIR, GC, and GC-MS analyses. The pyrolysis products from the deoxygenation process had a high alkene content, endowing them with great potential for conversion into cyclic hydrocarbons used in real aviation fuels. Such conversion through aromatization and hydrogenation over ZSM-5 and Raney Ni catalyst has been investigated. Overall, a new refining process, including conversion of triglycerides to alkanes and terminal alkenes catalyzed by metal compounds, furnishing viable aviation and diesel fuels, is reported. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In China, plantations of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge are grown on more than 170,000 ha. X. sorbifolium is a promising bioenergy crop as its seed oil is a suitable feedstock for biodiesel. In this work, X. sorbifolium seeds were collected from 26 populations distributed over a wide geographic area across northern China. Differences were found among accessions in seeds oil contents, fatty acids profiles and quality indexes of the biodiesel. Seed oil content was found to vary from 56.54% to 76.27%. Most of the accessions showed 60–70 % oil content, and a few accessions showed more than 70 % oil content. As revealed by gas chromatography, the contents of the three major fatty acids were found to significantly vary in the seed oils is linoleic acid (C18:2) (39.83–46.05 %), followed by oleic acid (C18:1) (26.02–33.04 %) and erucic acid (C22:1) (7.71–8.99 %). In respect to unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAS) in each of estimated classes of accessions was predominant and most abundant in broad range of minimum–maximum values from 44.42% to 51.00%. The X. sorbifolium accessions were distinctly grouped into 3 clusters on the basis of the Ward's hierarchical clustering method. After analyzing these indicators, it showed clearly that Naiman (P9) provenance is the best performer in produce biodiesel can be selected as a source of planting material, followed by Anqiu (P18). And the relationship between these parameters and the environment was determined, the results indicate that latitude, MAT (mean annual temperature) and longitude are the three key environmental factors affecting the fatty acid profile of X. sorbifolium. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research was focused on the valorisation of glycerol, exploring the feasibility of an efficient route for oxygenated additives production based on its etherification with bio-butanol. A home-made BEA zeolite sample with a tuneable acidity has been proposed as the catalytic system, being tested in a stirred reactor under different etherification conditions. Although a reaction temperature as high as 200 °C resulted to be beneficial in terms of glycerol conversion (~90%), only by operating at milder conditions the product selectivity to glycerol-ethers can be better controlled, in order to obtain a bio-fuel complying with the requirements for mixing with fossil diesel or biodiesel, without any need of purification from large amount of by-products. A comprehensive identification of all the compounds formed during the reaction was performed by a GC–MS analysis, on the basis of the complex network of consecutive and parallel reaction paths leading not only to the desired ethers, but also to many side products not detected in similar acid-catalyzed reactions in liquid phase and not available in the most used mass-spectra libraries. © 2020

AB  - Background: Thioesters of coenzyme A participate in 5% of all enzymatic reactions. In microbial cell factories, they function as building blocks for products of recognized commercial value, including natural products such as polyketides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, biofuels, and biopolymers. A core spectrum of approximately 5-10 short chain thioesters is present in many microbes, as inferred from their genomic repertoire. The relevance of these metabolites explains the high interest to trace and quantify them in microbial cells. Results: Here, we describe a common workflow for extraction and absolute quantification of short chain CoA thioesters in different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotic yeast, i.e. Corynebacterium glutamicum, Streptomyces albus, Pseudomonas putida, and Yarrowia lipolytica. The approach assessed intracellular CoA thioesters down to the picomolar level and exhibited high precision and reproducibility for all microbes, as shown by principal component analysis. Furthermore, it provided interesting insights into microbial CoA metabolism. A succinyl-CoA synthase defective mutant of C. glutamicum exhibited an unaffected level of succinyl-CoA that indicated a complete compensation by the l-lysine pathway to bypass the disrupted TCA cycle. Methylmalonyl-CoA, an important building block of high-value polyketides, was identified as dominant CoA thioester in the actinomycete S. albus. The microbe revealed a more than 10,000-fold difference in the abundance of intracellular CoA thioesters. A recombinant strain of S. albus, which produced different derivatives of the antituberculosis polyketide pamamycin, revealed a significant depletion of CoA thioesters of the ethylmalonyl CoA pathway, influencing product level and spectrum. Conclusions: The high relevance of short chain CoA thioesters to synthetize industrial products and the interesting insights gained from the examples shown in this work, suggest analyzing these metabolites in microbial cell factories more routinely than done so far. Due to its broad application range, the developed approach appears useful to be applied this purpose. Hereby, the possibility to use one single protocol promises to facilitate automatized efforts, which rely on standardized workflows. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of combined catalyst (ZSM-5 and CaO) for high quality bio-oil production from the catalytic pyrolysis of pinewood sawdust that was performed in Py-GC/MS and fixed bed reactor at 500 °C. In Py-GC/MS, the maximum yield of aromatic hydrocarbon was 36 wt% at biomass to combined catalyst ratio of 1:4 where the mass ratio of ZSM-5 to CaO in the combined catalyst was 4:1. An increasing trend of phenolic compounds was observed with an increasing amount of CaO, whereas the highest yield of phenolic compounds (31 wt%) was recorded at biomass to combined catalyst ratio of 1:4 (ZSM-5: CaO - 4:1). Large molecule compounds could be found to crack into small molecules over CaO and then undergo further reactions over zeolites. The water content, higher heating value, and acidity of bio-oil from the fixed bed reactor were 21%, 24.27 MJkg−1, and 4.1, respectively, which indicates that the quality of obtained bio-oil meets the liquid biofuel standard ASTM D7544-12 for grade G biofuel. This research will provide a significant reference to produce a high-quality bio-oil from the catalytic pyrolysis of woody biomass over the combined catalyst at different mass ratios of biomass to catalyst. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - A new cathodic catalyst is developed for improving the performance of membraneless enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) by enhancing overall oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this catalyst, both hemin and glucose oxidase (GOx) are considered as enzymatic catalysts to facilitate H2O2 reduction reaction (HRR) and partial oxygen reduction reaction (PORR), respectively. Hemin is attached to amine group functionalized carbon nanotube (Amine-CNT) to form amide bond, and GOx is conjugated with two poly(dimethyl-diallylammonium chloride) (PDDA) layers to form sandwich-like structure. As a result, [Amine-CNT/Hemin]/PDDA/GOx/PDDA catalyst is completed. This catalyst plays a role in reducing the amount of GOx leached out and preserving the mass transfer of fuels, and finally, increasing the catalytic activity for cathodic reactions. According to electrochemical estimation, its onset potential reaches 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl and current density significantly increases to 323 μA cm−2. When the performance of membraneless EBC adopting this catalyst is measured, maximum power density is 24.1 ± 0.61 μW cm−2 and its activity preserves 82.1% after four weeks. This excellent result is because PORR and HRR are promoted by the rigid connection of GOx and hemin, which is mainly induced by the sandwich effect of GOx by PDDA layers. © 2020 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

Experiments are performed individually on both the biomasses and then the co-feed in the ratio of 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25 taken for co-pyrolysis study. Further to be noted that pyrolysis experiments of each case and their product analyses in addition to feed characterization have been done thrice. These results are presented individually for each run in addition to their average and standard deviation values. The biomass feedstock, bio-oil, and biochar are thoroughly characterized by extensive advanced characterization techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) appropriately, as applicable for each case. The highest heating value of obtained pyrolytic bio-oil is from a co-feed ratio of 50:50 with an average HHV of 20.3 MJ/kg and having only 14.3 wt % of moisture content on average of three repetition experiments. The density of bio-oil obtained in all cases is approximately close to 1 g/cc, whereas their average viscosity varies between 2.07 and 3.61 mPa s. Thus, this study delivers that the rarely researched biomass considered for this study has almost similar potential to produce biofuels as that of extensively researched other biomass and their co-feed (1:1) pyrolysis is optimum for production of improved quality of pyrolytic bio-oil in terms of HHV, pH, density and moisture content. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rhodium-meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (RhTPP) and rhodium-meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (RhTCPP) complexes were synthesized and surface grafted on amine-functional mesoporous molecular sieves. The formation of ligands (TPP and TCPP) and their rhodium complexes (RhTPP and RhTCPP) was evident with the help of 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectral and elemental (CHN) analysis. The absence of the pyrrole proton of the porphyrin units on RhTPP and RhTCPP confirmed the successful formation of metallo-macro-molecules. Further, RhTPP and RhTCPP were fixed on the surface of SBA-15 through amino-silane as the linker. The rhodium containing homogeneous (RhTPP and RhTCPP) and heterogeneous catalysts (RhTPP-SBA-AM and RhTCPP-SBA-AM) were used for biomass-derived levulinic acid hydrogenation. Further, the synthesized catalysts were utilized for the hydrogenation of various organic molecules having arene, carbonyl, and alkene functionality under moderate reaction conditions. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts showed more than 95% levulinic acid conversion even after four cycles. The homogeneous RhTPP and RhTCPP yielded γ-valerolactone (GVL) as a major product, whereas heterogeneous catalysts showed only comparable γ-valerolactone (GVL) selectivity, with improved reusability and recylability in the presence of relatively lower amounts of rhodium complexes. Among RhTPP and RhTCPP, RhTPP showed better selectivity for γ-valerolactone (GVL) compared to RhTCPP. Further, as the number of catalytic runs increased, there was a gradual increase in diol selectivity, which was predominant in the case of RhTCPP, possibly due to the presence of the hydrophilic carboxylate ion which facilitates the interaction of water by-products with γ-valerolactone and favours diol formation. The hydrophobic environment of the RhTPP catalyst facilitated the formation of γ-valerolactone as the major product even in the fifth run.

AB  - Coconut pulp residue is the waste generated after the extraction of milk and oil. This material became an interest as feedstock for the production of biofuels and other bioproducts in a biorefinery context. The present study aimed to improve the release of sugar from coconut pulp residue through the optimization of sequential hydrothermal and acid pretreatment. An experimental design was constructed with the central composite design (CCD) response surface method using factors of the hydrothermal residence time of 20, 40, 60 min and post-acid treatment concentration of 1%, 2% and 3% (v/v) in constant temperature and time of 121 °C and 20 min. Total sugar yields of 32.47, 27.51 and 26.72 g/L were observed after hydrothermal pretreatment time of 20, 40 and 60 min, respectively. Furthermore, when the pretreated solid residues were subjected to acid pretreatment, the results revealed an increment of 90% on reducing sugars after reaction with 1%, 2% and 3% H2SO4. Statistically, the optimum condition for the two-stage hydrolysis of coconut pulp residue was 60 min hydrothermal pretreatment followed by 3% H2SO4 acid hydrolysis with maximal reducing sugar release of 120.71 g/L. In addition, the degree of polymerization achieved was 1.2, indicating no further hydrolysis required. The current study demonstrates that two-stage pretreatment improves saccharification and provide sufficient sugars for the fermentation process. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - In the current study, waste biomass (quail beaks) has been considered for synthesizing highly active hydroxyapatite (HAp) catalyst and used for biodiesel production. The produced HAp is characterized by several analytical techniques such as Thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Hammett indicator-benzene benzoic acid titration method and BET surface area. TGA/DSC analysis confirmed the complete removal of organic matter from the raw quail beaks. The XRD results revealed that the crystallinity of HAp phase was enhanced by thermal calcination with crystallite size of 37.33 nm at 900 °C. FTIR results showed the peaks of phosphate (PO4−3) and hydroxyl groups (OH−1) belonging to HAp molecules. EDX analysis revealed the presence of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) compositions were 28.5 and 11.4 wt %, respectively. Total basicity and BET surface area of the synthesized catalyst were found to be 12.9 mmol/g and 4.54 m2/g, respectively. Furthermore, the treated HAp at temperature of 900 °C was used for biodiesel production from canola oil, rapeseed oil and waste cooking oil. Thus, HAp was opted to be highly active for biodiesel production with promising reusability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The high tendency of bio-oil towards polymerization is one of the key challenges in hydrotreatment of bio-oil for production of bio-fuels. However, such properties of bio-oil could be used to produce carbon materials, but the mechanism for the polymerization has not been clarified. Bio-oil contains sugars, derivatives of sugars (i.e. furans et al.), phenolic monomers and oligomers. Among of them, the furans and phenolics are the typical compounds in bio-oil. In this study, the potential cross-polymerization between the furans (furan, furfural and furfuryl alcohol (FA)) and the phenolics (vanillin and guaiacol) in bio-oil was explored in water with/without H2SO4. The furans could polymerize via ring-opening to produce reactive reaction intermediates. Furfural and FA contained branched functionalities in furan ring, which was more reactive towards polymerization, especially for furfuryl alcohol. In general, the furans were more reactive towards polymerization than vanillin and guaiacol. Nevertheless, the cross-polymerization between the furans and phenolics occurred and significantly enhanced its tendency towards polymerization. The reaction intermediates formed via opening of the furan ring were the key initiator for the cross-polymerizations. Additionally, the presence of H2SO4 could enhance consumption of the C[dbnd]O during the polymerization and the thermal stability of the resulting polymer. © 2020

AB  - Because of the abundance and renewability of lignocellulosic biomass, lignocellulose-derived biofuels and chemicals are promising alternatives to fossil resources. In this study, we developed a strategy for pretreating lignocellulose (corn stover) using a sodium hydroxide–urea solution (SUs) and evaluated changes in the efficiency and structure. The results showed that treatment with 6% NaOH/12% urea at 80 °C for 20 min gave a glucose yield of 0.54 g/g corn stover. Recycling of the NaOH/urea was also explored, and the average glucose yield over four pretreatment cycles was 0.44 g/g corn stover. The structural characteristics of corn stover were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Compared with untreated corn stover, NaOH/urea-pretreated corn stover had more micropores, mesopores, and macropores, higher crystallinity, and a higher cellulose content. This pretreatment process is economical and efficient and has good application prospects for lignocellulose biorefinery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing renewable jet fuels from solid waste contributes greatly on circular economy with respect to the energy, environment and economics. The feedstock sources are resolved, the solid wastes are re-used, the pollution from aircrafts are reduced and the air energy is renewed. In this study, the rice husk biomass, which has been a headache agriculture waste in Taiwan, was turned into products similar to traditional jet fuel through fluidized bed fast pyrolysis, hydro-processing and hydro-cracking/isomerization, in which significant increases in normal alkanes, iso-alkanes and cycloalkanes were found. The final product from hydro-cracking/isomerization contained appropriate amount of normal, iso-, and cyclo-alkanes, which made it suitable to be the replacement for jet fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of municipal sludge (MS) was performed at 350 °C for 30 min (subcritical water) and at 400 °C for 0 min (supercritical water) at fixed kinetic severity (LogR0 = 8.9) in static and stirred batch reactors to study the effect of the flow regime on the energy recovery (ER) of the process and on the quality of the products. With adopted experimental procedures it was possible to reduce to less than 10% the yield of lost organic compounds, termed volatiles (VT), and to collect and quantify a liquid hydrocarbon fraction (HC) separated from the biocrude (BC). The highest value of the HC yield, 25% w/w, was obtained in supercritical conditions. The C content of the solid residues (SR) and the H/C ratios of the BC increased when the stirred reactor was used. Quite interestingly in this research we have found, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that the cumulative ER of the product phases was significantly higher than 100% thus indicating that HTL of MS can be energetically driven by renewable thermal energy, such as solar heat, offering a storage option for it. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Different thermal stability of three major components is a challenge to efficiently liquefy lignocellulosic biomass into bio-oil because the degradation products from holocellulose can react with lignin, resulting in repolymerization reactions. In this work, a biorefinery approach of co-generation of bioethanol and bio-oil from rice straw that integrated separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) processes was proposed. SHF of dilute sulfuric acid pretreated rice straw gave a bioethanol concentration of 8.3 g/L with approximately 68% of theoretical yield. The maximum bio-oil yield 31.36 wt% via HTL of solid fermentation residues using bioethanol wastewater as the solvent was obtained under optimum conditions. Mass balance showed that 9.7 wt% bioethanol and 15.0 wt% bio-oil were produced corresponding to 56% energy recovery. Separate conversion of cellulose and lignin could be one promising way to enhance the overall energy recovery from lignocellulose to liquid biofuels. © 2020

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) has been derived from oil present in algae through transesterification using catalysts of acids, base, supercritical fluids, etc. These catalysts are corrosive and have been posing challenges of contaminating the environment necessitating environmentally friendly and biodegradable catalysts such as enzyme (lipase) based biocatalysts. In this study, fungal strains (endophytic/free spores) were isolated from an estuarine ecosystem and screened for extracellular lipase activities. A novel fungal strain Cladosporium tenuissimum, identified through molecular technique exhibited higher lipolytic activity among the isolates. The crude lipase extracted from fungus was subjected to ammonium sulphate precipitation and purification using Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatographic system. The molecular weight of purified lipase was found to be ∼46 KDa and a specific activity of 37.2 U/mg. Lipase activities attained stability and reached maximum at 60 °C temperature and pH of 6. The purified enzyme was used as a biological catalyst for enzymatic transesterification of oil obtained from an indigenously isolated salt tolerant diatom Nitzschia punctata. Spectroscopic analysis on fatty acids and Fatty Acid Methyl Esters derived from diatom exhibited similarities in specific functional groups between algal oil and biodiesel. Comparisons on biodiesel yield estimation and FAME compositions of enzyme catalyzed, acid catalyzed biodiesel assessed through gas chromatographic techniques revealed a higher efficiency (87.2 ± 0.47%) of biocatalysts compared to conventional acid catalyst (83.02 ± 0.35%) exhibiting potential scope for large scale application of environment friendly biocatalysts to enhance the conversion performances of the transesterification process. © 2020

AB  - High methanol/oil ratio together with reaction temperature with increase reaction time are some of the major drawbacks affecting the use of inorganic heterogeneous catalysts for simultaneous esterification and transesterification of oils. In this study, a novel bio-based bifunctional catalyst (BBFC) was prepared from sulfonated calcined corncobs and calcined poultry droppings by wet impregnation method. Characterization of the BBFC was done using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Its catalytic activity in simultaneous esterification and transesterification of neem seed oil (NSO) having high free fatty acid content of 4.426% was investigated, with process parameters optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Result revealed that the BBFC is highly bifunctional, possessing both acidic and basic oxides. Biodiesel yield of 92.89 wt% with an acid value of 0.23 mg KOH/g was obtained at optimum conditions of methanol/oil ratio, reaction temperature and time of 14.76:1, 61.90 °C and 72.65 min respectively using a catalyst loading of 2.58 wt%. The economic viability of the catalyst was also investigated and results shows that using recovered catalyst from the process gave a biodiesel yield of over 89 wt% after two successive cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The safflower plant as an attractive feedstock for development of a biorefinery through the multi-biofuel production was evaluated. The safflower plant, composed of straw (79.6 wt %) and oilseed (20.4 wt%), was used for bioethanol, biogas, and biodiesel production. The oil was extracted from the seeds and subjected to methanolic transesterification process to produce biodiesel. The remained seed cake was converted to biogas by anaerobic digestion process. The ethanol production from safflower straw was not satisfactory; thus, the straw was hydrothermally pretreated at 120–180 °C for 1–5 h to maximize the bioethanol production. The increase in the pretreatment time and temperature considerably improved the ethanol yield, and the highest yield of 60.3% was obtained performing the pretreatment at 180 °C for 5 h. The biodiesel and methane production yields from oilseeds and seed cake were 90.3% and 185.8 mL/g volatile solids, respectively. Overall, each kg of safflower plant yielded 97.2 g ethanol, 22.4 L methane, and 46.6 g biodiesel that are totally equivalent to 0.168 L gasoline per kg of safflower plant in this biorefinery concept. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study is to test alternative additives for trace element (TE) supplementation and process stabilization during anaerobic digestion (AD) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and sewage sludge. Process instabilities due to acidification are a typical problem in waste fermentation. Provision with minerals and TE is crucial for microorganisms in AD to work effectively, allowing higher organic loading rates within the digester without risking acid accumulation. In batch-fermentation tests, different mixture configurations of OFMSW, digested sewage sludge and biomass ashes were evaluated. Based on an extensive characterization of the TE contained in wood ashes, suitable combinations of digested sewage sludge and OFMSW as a baseline substrate together with ash additives were derived. While high dosages of ash reduced biogas production, 1:1 mix of ash and OFMSW facilitated higher CH4 yields (6%). The supplementation of ashes increased the pH-value within AD and CO2 precipitation through metal oxides in situ elevated the CH4 concentration in biogas up to 98%. Therefore, ashes may increase the efficiency of AD and serve as a basis for a new gas purification method, minimizing technical effort. Additional investigations are needed to examine long-term effects as well as financial and legal aspects such as possible ways of digestate usage. As a further area of research, the transferability of batch-test results into practical applications is identified. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential to increase biofuel output from a fast pyrolysis-based biorefinery through hydrogen enhancement is assessed for thermal fast pyrolysis (TFP) and catalytic pyrolysis (CAT) processes featuring bio-oil upgrade into gasoline, diesel and heavy hydrocarbon fractions. Results show that utilizing pyrolysis process off-gases to produce synthetic natural gas with an external hydrogen source could provide up to 48.2% (TFP) and 61.2% (CAT) reductions in biomass resource utilization. These savings are enabled by significantly improved carbon efficiency of the hydrogen enhanced designs, with efficiencies increasing from 40.5% to 66.3% for TFP and from 28.9% to 58.6% for CAT. Although the CAT process has a lower biofuel yield than the TFP process, it has a higher potential for hydrogen enhancement and achieves a higher biofuel output than TFP when fully enhanced with external hydrogen. The trade-off to the improved biofuel yield (higher carbon efficiency) is the substantial need for electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, as for every megajoule (MJ) of biomass feedstock, 0.65–0.66 MJ of electricity is needed for the electrolyser. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The search for sustainable energy sources has become a worldwide issue, making the development of efficient biofuel production processes a priority. Immobilization of second-generation (2G) xylose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains is a promising approach to achieve economic viability of 2G bioethanol production from undetoxified hydrolysates through operation at high cell load and mitigation of inhibitor toxicity. In addition, the use of a fixed-bed reactor can contribute to establish an efficient process because of its distinct advantages, such as high conversion rate per weight of biocatalyst and reuse of biocatalyst. Results: This work assessed the influence of alginate entrapment on the tolerance of recombinant S. cerevisiae to acetic acid. Encapsulated GSE16-T18SI.1 (T18) yeast showed an outstanding performance in repeated batch fermentations with cell recycling in YPX medium supplemented with 8 g/L acetic acid (pH 5.2), achieving 10 cycles without significant loss of productivity. In the fixed-bed bioreactor, a high xylose fermentation rate with ethanol yield and productivity values of 0.38 gethanol/gsugars and 5.7 g/L/h, respectively were achieved in fermentations using undetoxified sugarcane bagasse hemicellulose hydrolysate, with and without medium recirculation. Conclusions: The performance of recombinant strains developed for 2G ethanol production can be boosted strongly by cell immobilization in alginate gels. Yeast encapsulation allows conducting fermentations in repeated batch mode in fixed-bed bioreactors with high xylose assimilation rate and high ethanol productivity using undetoxified hemicellulose hydrolysate. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) have an important role in the enzymatic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass by decoupling plant cell wall polysaccharides and lignin. Moreover, FAEs release anti-oxidative hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) from biomass. As a plethora of FAE candidates were found in fungal genomes, FAE classification related to substrate specificity is an indispensability for selection of most suitable candidates. Hence, linking distinct substrate specificities to a FAE classification, such as the recently classified FAE subfamilies (SF), is a promising approach to improve the application of these enzymes for a variety of industrial applications. In total, 14 FAEs that are classified members of SF1, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13 were tested in this research. All FAEs were investigated for their activity toward a variety of substrates: synthetic model substrates, plant cell wall-derived substrates, including lignin, and natural substrates. Released HCAs were determined using reverse phase-ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV detection and mass spectrometry. Based on this study, FAEs of SF5 and SF7 showed the highest release of FA, pCA, and diFAs over the range of substrates, while FAEs of SF6 were comparable but less pronounced for diFAs release. These results suggest that SF5 and SF7 FAEs are promising enzymes for biorefinery applications, like the production of biofuels, where a complete degradation of the plant cell wall is desired. In contrast, SF6 FAEs might be of interest for industrial applications that require a high release of only FA and pCA, which are needed as precursors for the production of biochemicals. In contrast, FAEs of SF1, 9 and 13 showed an overall low release of HCAs from plant cell wall-derived and natural substrates. The obtained results substantiate the previous SF classification as a useful tool to predict the substrate specificity of FAEs, which eases the selection of FAE candidates for industrial applications. © Copyright © 2020 Underlin, Frommhagen, Dilokpimol, van Erven, de Vries and Kabel.

AB  - Biodiesel was directly one-step produced from waste oils without pretreatment catalyzed by a solid base alkalized from spent bleaching clay (SBC) ash. Optimized conditions were obtained with 99.1% biodiesel yield from soybean oil with an orthogonal design. The base catalyst was stable within 8 cycles (&gt;95% biodiesel yield) and resistant to saponification (AV = 9.7 mg KOH/g, 96.5% biodiesel yield). The base was characterized with XRD, EDX-mapping, FT-IR, XRF and TPD, and it had similar strong basicity to Na2SiO3 (0.21 vs. 0.22 mmol/g for Na2SiO3) with active sites of Na2O and CH3ONa evolved from Na2SiO3 and NaAlSiO4 by reactions of NaOH with oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) in SBC ash. Furthermore, the base was magnetized with magnetism of 6.86 emu/g by carbonizing residual oil in SBC as carbon support and reductant (of Fe2O3 to magnetic Fe3O4 particles). It catalyzed soybean oil to produce biodiesel with 99.2% yield and blended oil (AV = 5.9) to biodiesel with 91.9% yield without any saponification. The catalyst was magnetically separated and reused for 3 cycles with 87% yield. The non-magnetic base could also efficiently catalyze actual SBC oil for the production of biodiesel with 95% yield at AV of 10. This work realized the full use of inorganics in SBC, and its oil for direct biodiesel production at a low temperature (i.e., 65 vs. 120 °C with sulfuric acid process) without wastes produced and results can easily find practical applications for waste oils. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dangerous environmental consequences and market unpredictability of fossil fuels have necessitated the need for sustainable large-scale production of biofuel in Nigeria. Unrefined palm oil (UPO) is a significant product of commercially available oil palm plants in the country. This study experimentally investigates the production of biodiesel from refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein extracted from UPO obtained from batch reactors. The transesterification process of the RBD palm olein with methanol and in the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst produced biodiesel with a 62.5% yield, thus confirming its feasibility for mass production. The derived biodiesel has properties equivalent to ASTM D792 standard for biodiesel fuels. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The biodiesel industry generates crude glycerol (CG) at the rate of 10% of the amount of biodiesel produced. With the production of this biofuel increasing, a large amount of CG is produced each year. This results in low price for it and its final disposal becomes a significant problem. Herein, steam reforming represents a viable route to valorize this biodiesel by-product into hydrogen. The performance of Ni–La–Zr catalysts (15 wt%) for steam reforming of a CG without any purification treatment has been investigated at atmospheric pressure and at 500 °C and 650 °C. These materials were prepared using a coprecipitation method with oxalic acid. At 650 °C, the catalyst calcined at 850 °C presents higher catalytic activity and stability and displays better resistance to deactivation by carbon formation than the catalyst calcined at 700 °C. This behavior can be attributed to several causes: higher surface nickel content, higher catalyst reducibility and the presence of oxygen vacancies formed as a consequence of the partial substitution of nickel atoms into the pyrochlore structure during the formation of the biphasic system, which is related to mechanisms that act in the removal of carbon deposits on the catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bifunctional CumNin/CoOx catalysts were fabricated by co-precipitation method and applied in in-situ hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass derived oleic acid to n-heptadecane with isopropanol as hydrogen source. Upon incorporating Cu or Ni into CoOx, the catalytic performance could be easily boosted. By varying Cu/Ni ratio, reduction temperature as well as catalyst loading, the optimized Cu1Ni1/CoOx exhibited &gt;99% conversion and 91.3% n-heptadecane yield at 240 °C in 8 h. Characterizations showed that synergistic effect between Cu, Ni and CoOx was existed, thus strengthening H2 production ability towards isopropanol and favoring the generation of n-heptadecane. Kinetic studies revealed HDO of oleic acid to alkane mainly proceeded via decarbonylation of stearaldehyde rather than direct decarboxylation of stearic acid, and the rate determining step relied on octadecanol dehydrogenation. This catalyst could be magnetically separated for 5 times recycling and was versatile for in situ HDO of various fatty acids, thus achieving a low-cost, energy-saving biomass-to-biofuel conversion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main problems in biodiesel purification using membrane are low selectivity and fouling issue. Therefore, this research was developed on the modification polyethersulfone nanohybrid membranes which have excellent selectivity performance and anti-fouling behavior. The PES-nano ZnO nanohybrid membrane was fabricated by preparing dope solution composed of PES, nano ZnO and N-methyl Pyrrolidone as a solvent. UV irradiation, PVP addition, and thermal treatments were conducted to modify fabricated nanohybrid membranes. The modified membrane exhibited significant enhancement of hydrophilicity by lowering the water contact angle value from 66.17° to 52.33°. The initial flux of modified membrane increased up to 200% of the unmodified membrane's initial flux. Both of modified and unmodified membranes have rejection more than 91% that can lowering the glycerol content from 3.98 to 0.34 wt-%. The modified membrane presented less foulant deposition on the membrane surface. This membrane also performed excellent stability in term of permeate flux and rejection efficiency. It is verified that the concept of modified PES-nano ZnO membrane can achieve a higher membrane performance for biodiesel purification such as increased of flux, lowering the glycerol content, better anti-fouling behavior and excellent stability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work establishes a ranking of the potential oleaginous feedstocks for HEFA biojet production in southeast Brazil, and consolidates their advantages and limitations, in order to assist in prioritizing strategic actions, such as research, R&D investment, and incentives for the most promising regional oilseeds. The oilseeds and the criteria considered were determined from a bibliographical review, using two multi-criteria tools in the evaluation: the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The economic criterion and the oil cost sub-criterion were considered the determining factors for the choice of oilseeds, which obtained the following ranking: soybean, jatropha, sunflower, castor bean, macauba palm, cotton, and peanut. Soybean ranked first mainly because of the lower cost of its oil and high agricultural maturity. Hence, soybean should be used first in HEFA biojet production. However, considering that soybean oil is the main feedstock for biodiesel production in the country, it is also important to evaluate other potential crops. Thus, stimulating research aimed at reaching the technological domain of new local oleaginous plants is essential to increase the scale of production, reduce oil costs, and make HEFA production more competitive and sustainable. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A glucose oxidase (GOx) based biocatalyst combined with a methyl red (MR) mediator is developed to improve the electron transfer capability of the GOx-based biocatalyst. As a support to the biocatalyst, chitosan coated carbon nanotube (CNT/chitosan) are used, while the MR mediator and GOx are well immobilized onto the CNT/chitosan due to the strong organic material capturing ability of chitosan (CNT/chitosan/MR/GOx). The stable immobilization of MR and GOx is confirmed by spectroscopic method and electrochemical characterization is performed to prove the viability as the biocatalyst promoting the anodic reactions in an enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC). Based on the evaluations, CNT/[Chitosan-MR]/Chitosan/GOx shows the relatively excellent onset potential (−0.04 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and peak current density (169 μA cm−2). This is because the catalyst follows up well the onset potential of MR determining the onset potential of the catalyst and the considerable amounts of GOx are immobilized by chitosan's strong capturing capabilities. When the biocatalyst is used, the EBC shows excellent electrical performances with an open circuit voltage of 0.64 V and power density of 93 μW cm−2. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Fischer-Tropsch process is less complex and more environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-based fuels. With growing interest in biomass-to-fuel conversion like the production of bioethanol, there is a steady supply of unfermentable biomass from bioethanol industries, which can be gasified and converted to Fischer-Tropsch syncrude. In this work, the economic and ecological feasibility of integrating a Fischer-Tropsch process using syngas obtained from the gasification of dry distillers’ grain is explored. Data from a lab-scale experiment using pelletized promoted iron supported on Carbon Nano Tubes (Fe/CNT) is used to simulate a plant for the production of 1000 kg of syncrude/h. The techno-economic feasibility of setting up a Fischer-Tropsch process is explored based on chemical engineering plant cost index of 628.2. An internal rate of return of 107.9% was obtained with a net annual profit of 5.2 MUSD/year which is higher than those reported for other Fischer-Tropsch plants due to the readily availability of the feedstock without any associated transportation costs. The potential environmental impact of the Fischer-Tropsch fuels was evaluated by the WAste Reduction (WAR) algorithm and suggested that the integration of the Fischer-Tropsch process into the bio-ethanol production plant is environmentally benign. © 2020

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis of biomass to green fuels was performed using supported, sulfided CoMo catalysts. With MgAl2O4 as support material the CoMo loading was varied between 4.1 and 12.0 wt% at constant Co/Mo atomic ratio of 0.3. Increasing the metal loading decreased the amount of oxygen in the condensed organic phase from 9.0 to 4.7 wt% on dry basis (db) and the condensable organic yield decreased from 25.2 to 22.7 wt% on dry ash free (daf) basis, corresponding to a decrease in the carbon recovery from 39 to 37%. Using zeolite H-ZSM-5 mixed with alumina as support with a CoMo loading of 4.1 wt%, the condensed organics contained only 5.2 to 6.1 wt% db oxygen. The condensable organic yield was between 23.9 and 24.4 wt% db, and the carbon recovery was 39–40%. Thus using an acidic support can remove the oxygen without decreasing the carbon recovery. The latter was ascribed to alkylation of the aromatics when the zeolite support was used. Elemental maps of the spent catalysts were obtained using STEM-EDS, showing that the CoMo phase was mainly located as monolayer MoS2 slab structures (&gt;93%) on the support and indicated a high dispersion of cobalt, consistent with incorporation of Co into the MoS2 structure in the CoMoS phase. Potassium was observed on all the spent catalysts, indicating transfer of alkali metal from the biomass to the catalyst. Potassium may decrease the acidity of the catalyst over time, thus reducing the positive effect of using a more acidic support. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigated the biocrude production from the blending of Spirulina platensis and lemon-peel via hydrothermal liquefaction process. The interaction of parameters such as temperature (280–350 °C), time (10–60 min), and different blending ratio on liquefaction was visualized using the response surface methodology. During the experiment, the highest biocrude yield of 26 wt% was achieved at 336 °C and 35 min with the Spirulina platensis/lemon-peel mass ratio of 4:1. Results showed that the biocrude yield was increased with microalgae content in the blending, whereas the effect of temperature and time was dependent on the other parameters. The blending led to a reduction in the yield, energy recovery, and also the nitrogen content of the biocrude compared with the model estimation. GC-MS, FT-IR, NMR, and TGA were applied to characterize the biocrude. Results demonstrated an increase of nitrogen heterocycles and a decline of unsaturated compounds due to liquefaction of the blending. The blending resulted in a shift of compounds in biocrude from low to middle distillation region. The ultimate analysis indicated a strong deoxygenation degree of biomass during hydrothermal liquefaction process, while the blending displayed an inconspicuous improvement in the deoxygenation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A number of different M/TiO2 photocatalysts, where M (the co-catalyst) = Pt, Pd, Au and Ag, are used to drive the steam reforming of methanol (MeOH) in a gas phase continuous flow reactor operated at 100 °C. The rate of H2 production is: Pt &gt; Pd &gt; Au &gt; Ag &gt;&gt; no metal. The photonic efficiency of Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst is ca. 120% which suggests some of the hydrogen derives from a current-doubling reaction mechanism. The Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst drives the steam reforming of MeOH, which generates H2 and CO2, with an apparent selectivity of 100% over a wide UV irradiance range (i.e. 1–9.5 mW cm−2 at 365 nm). In contrast, in the dark, the decomposition of MeOH, which generates H2 and CO, dominates with a selectivity of ca. 67%. In contrast to Pt, the Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst is non-selective to either MeOH reforming or its decomposition, so that CO2 and CO are generated with equal rates. The Au and Ag photocatalysts are less active than either the Pt or Pd co-catalysts and exhibit a variation in selectivity with UV irradiance which is intermediate between that of Pt and Pd. The possible use of photocatalysis as a means to generate H2 from alcohol-based biofuels is briefly discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In present work, Jatropha, Karanja (non-edible) and Cottonseed (edible) oils were mixed in the selected proportions and then converted to biomix methyl ester through transesterification process. Experiments were performed on a single cylinder non-road diesel engine with biomix methyl ester and results were compared with neat diesel, Jatropha, Karanja and Cottonseed biodiesel's. The major limitation observed in the biodiesel research is the fuel composition variability raised due to feedstock quality and production process parameters. Hence to have a sustainable biodiesel production based on available feedstocks of the region with balanced proportion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, use of biomix fuel is proposed on non-road diesel engine in this study. Non-road diesel engines are widely used in agriculture, power generation and construction equipment's which is also consuming lot of diesel and emitting more emissions. Use of renewable biomix fuel on non-road diesel engines will cut carbon foot print on the environment and it is better than biodiesel derived from a single feedstock based on the composition, fuel properties, performance and emissions. The results also indicated that biomix fuel has higher brake thermal efficiency, lower oxides of nitrogen and carbon-di-oxide emissions compared to biodiesel derived from single feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The evolution from petroleum-based products to the bio-based era by using renewable resources is one of the main research challenges in the coming years. Lignocellulosic biomass, consisting of inedible plant material, has emerged as a potential alternative for the production of biofuels, biochemicals, and nanocellulose-based advanced materials. The lignocellulosic biomass, which consists mainly of carbohydrate-based polysaccharides (hemicellulose and cellulose), is a green intermediate for the synthesis of bio-based products. In recent years, the re-engineering of biomass into a variety of commodity chemicals and liquid fuels by using Lewis acid catalysts has attracted much attention. Much research has been focused on developing new chemical strategies for the valorization of different biomass components. Homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts seem to be one of the most promising catalysts due to their astonishing features such as being less corrosive to equipment and being friendlier to the environment, as well as having the ability to disrupt the bonding system effectively and having high selectivity. Thus, these catalysts have emerged as important tools for the highly selective transformation of biomass components into valuable chemicals and fuels. This review provides an insightful overview of the most important recent developments in homogeneous Lewis acid catalysis toward the production and upgrading of biomass. The chemical valorization of the main components of lignocellulosic biomass (hemicellulose and cellulose), the reaction conditions, and process mechanisms are reviewed. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Alternative fuels are the need of time because of finite fossil fuels. Biodiesel produced by enzyme-catalyzed transesterification is an environment-friendly and greener alternative fuel. However, the main shortcoming of biodiesel production is high cost of production. Successful recovery for high cost of production is the use of waste cooking oils. In this study, lipase from porcine pancreas was immobilized on genipin cross-linked chitosan for catalyzing the transesterification of waste cooking oil to produce biodiesel in presence and absence of solvents. Solvents in a reaction mixture keep the essential water layer around lipase intact, which protects lipase from methanol inactivation. Our result showed no significant effect of solvent on transesterification reaction, suggesting the resistant nature of lipase against methanol. This bypasses the need to recover the solvent, making the process more economical. The structural morphology of genipin cross-linked chitosan beads was studied by SEM. The conversion of waste cooking oils into Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was analyzed by Gas Chromatography. Under the optimized conditions of 9:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, water content 6% (w/w) enzyme, at 40ºC, 10-hr reaction time, 7.5 wt% catalyst loading at 150 rpm, the ester yield was found to be 92.33%, with good reusability in solvent-free system. The obtained biodiesel was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy. The biodiesel synthesis in solvent-free system described in the study is a prospective economical method for the synthesis of the biodiesel with more than 90% yield and good reusability. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this work is to analyze the effect of using diethyl ether (DEE) as an oxygenated additive of straight vegetable oils (SVOs) in triple blends with fossil diesel, to be used in current compression ignition (C.I.) engines, in order to implement the current process of replacing fossil fuels with others of a renewable nature. The use of DEE is considered taking into account the favorable properties for blending with SVO and fossil diesel, such as its very low kinematic viscosity, high oxygen content, low autoignition temperature, broad flammability limits (it works as a cold start aid for engines), and very low values of cloud and pour point. Therefore, DEE can be used as a solvent of vegetable oils to reduce the viscosity of the blends and to improve cold flow properties. Besides, DEE is considered renewable, since it can be easily obtained from bioethanol, which is produced from biomass through a dehydration process. The vegetable oils evaluated in the mixtures with DEE were castor oil, which is inedible, and sunflower oil, used as a standard reference for waste cooking oil. In order to meet European petrodiesel standard EN 590, a study of the more relevant rheological properties of biofuels obtained from the DEE/vegetable oil double blends has been performed. The incorporation of fossil diesel to these double blends gives rise to diesel/DEE/vegetable oil triple blends, which exhibited suitable rheological properties to be able to operate in conventional diesel engines. These blends have been tested in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The efficiency, consumption and smoke emissions in the engine have been measured. The results reveal that a substitution of fossil diesel up to 40% by volume can be achieved, independently of the SVO employed. Moreover, a significant reduction in the emission levels of pollutants and better cold flow properties has been also obtained with all blends tested. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acids methyl esters derived from the triglyceride of vegetable oil. Vegetable oils consist of different types of fatty acids which influence the biodiesel fuel properties, combustion, and emissions, especially oxides of nitrogen emission. Nitric oxides emissions are one of the major threats posed by biodiesel fuel due to the presence of unsaturated fatty acids (C=C double bonds). An attempt has been made to control these nitric oxides emission through reformulated biodiesel fuel approach. In this study, reformulated biodiesel fuel was prepared by blending individual biodiesels, based on their fatty acid composition percentage (v/v %). Two samples, RBF-I and RBF-II, were prepared and tested in a single-cylinder compression ignition engine. Reformulated biodiesel fuel results in increased saturated fatty acids, long-chain saturation factor, and cetane number and a decrease in the degree of unsaturation, viscosity, density, higher heating value, and iodine value compared to individual biodiesel. RBF fuel sample showed higher cylinder pressure and the advanced start of combustion compared to diesel fuel. RBF samples shows a 20% lower nitric oxides emission and 30% higher smoke emissions than diesel fuel. Carbon monoxide emission of RBF increased as compared to diesel fuel, whereas carbon dioxide emissions were lowered by 35% approximately. Hydrocarbon emissions were found to be lower for RBF-I, but it was higher for RBF-II throughout the engine test load conditions. It is inferred that reformulated biodiesel is a potential fuel formulation technique in solving challenges associated with biodiesel as fuel in diesel engines. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Due to the toxicity and low biodegradability, mineral lubricants have been sharing space with green lubricants. Moringa oleifera can grow naturally in dry regions with subtropical climates and the oil, rich in unsaturated compounds (79.87 %), may be a potential feedstock for fuel and lubricant base stocks. Moringa oil was hydrolyzed and then esterified with polyols, trimethylolpropane (MTMPE) and pentaerythritol (MPEE), in the temperature range of 130–140 °C. P-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TSA) was used as the catalyst. The products obtained were characterized using 1H and 13C NMR, IR, and mass spectral techniques. The main physicochemical properties, the thermal behavior and toxicity against Artemia salina of products were evaluated. In addition, blends with the naphthenic lubricant, NH10, were prepared with 20 %, 35 %, and 50 % of the moringa esters. The synthesized samples have high viscosity indices (VI = 170) and they were found to be non-toxic against A. salina (LC50&gt;1000 ppm). MTMPE presented higher thermal stability and showed a melting point of -38.5 °C, which reveals its potential for applications in very low temperatures. Blends showed high viscosity indices and reduced toxicity compared to pure NH10. The study revealed that moringa esters are interesting to be applied as environmental friendly lubricants or additives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purification of second-generation biofuels is becoming an urgent issue due to the toxicity of the combustion products of residual phenol in these biofuels. The use of solid sorbents such as zeolites appears as a promising solution for ensuring the selective sorption of phenol towards aromatics (the main components of biofuel). In the present work, we have adopted a bottom-up approach for removing phenol from a synthetic biofuel feed containing isooctane, phenol (1 wt.%), n-nonane (1 wt.%) and toluene (40 wt.%), using faujasite-type Y zeolites with Si/Al ratio = 2.5. The astonishing performance of HY zeolite to treat the synthetic biofuel has been highlighted by assessing the interaction modes of the molecules involved over the structural sites via the combination of theoretical molecular modeling and experimental adsorption experiments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, we used pyrolysis to treat teabag waste (TBW). Changes in the pyrolysis temperature affected the composition and yield of the products. For example, more non-condensable gases and less char were produced with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature. Pyrolysis conducted under a nitrogen environment yielded caprolactam at temperatures between 400 and 700◦ C. An increase in the pyrolysis temperature from 400 to 500◦ C increased the caprolactam yield from 3.1 to 6.2 wt.%. At 700◦ C, the yield decreased to 4.6 wt.%. The highest caprolactam yield (i.e., 6.2 wt.% at 500◦ C) was equivalent to 59.2 wt.% on the basis of the weight of the non-biomass part of the TBW. The pyrolytic products other than caprolactam (e.g., combustible gases, pyrolytic liquid, and char) can function as fuels to supply energy during pyrolysis in order to increase and maintain the temperature. The higher heating values (HHVs) of the combustible gases and pyrolytic liquid produced at 500◦ C were 7.7 and 8.3 MJ kg−1, respectively. The HHV of the char produced at 500◦ C was 23 MJ kg−1, which is comparable to the HHV of coal. This work will help to develop effective pyrolysis processes to valorize everyday waste by recovering value-added chemicals such as polymer monomers and by producing alternative fuels. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Novel Brønsted acid functionalized phthalocyanine on perylene diimide framework knotted with ionic liquid (BAFPcPDIL) was synthesized and confirmed by instrumentation techniques. DRS-spectrum and Hammett value has been determined to confirm band-gap and proton levels of photo-catalyst respectively. The photo-catalytic performance was evaluated by production of octyl levulinate (OL) using levulinic acid (LA) with n-octyl alcohol (OA) under visible light irradiations. Response surface methodology (RSM) with Box–Behnken design (BBD) with 29 experiments was applied to explore consequences of four crucial process variables: catalyst loading (A), molar ratio of reactants (B) and power of visible light (C), duration in hour (D) on OL yield. From the model, the optimum conditions for the utmost conversion were found as: 10 mg catalyst with (1:1) alcohol to LA molar ratio under 12 W lamp, in 12 h for completing esterification reaction with 95.58% yield of OL. With optimum conditions, various alkyl esters such as methyl levulinate 92.14%, ethyl levulinate 93.12%, n-propyl levulinate 91.45%, iso-propyl levulinate 92.38%, n-butyl levulinate 85.13%, n-pentyl levulinate 86.35%, n-hexyl levulinate 89.57%, tert-butyl levulinate 91.58%, were successfully synthesized with excellent yields. The plausible photocatalytic mechanism of the esterification reaction was also described. The study was extended on blending of OL with diesel sample in 10–30%, found comparable result of density, kinematic viscosity, calorific values, cetane number, flash, fire and pour point of the blended samples with blank diesel sample and appreciable changes in exhaust gases of 25% blended diesel sample. Additionally, BAFPcPDIL displayed good recyclability without loss of photo reactivity after four runs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To realize direct power generation from biofuels in natural organisms, we demonstrate a needle-type biofuel cell (BFC) using enzyme/mediator/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite fibers with the structure Osmium-based polymer/CNT/glucose oxidase/Os-based polymer/CNT. The composite fibers performed a high current density (10 mA/cm2) in 5 mM artificial blood glucose. Owing to their hydrophilicity, they also provided sufficient ionic conductivity between the needle-type anode and the gas-diffusion cathode. When the tip of the anodic needle was inserted into natural specimens of grape, kiwifruit, and apple, the assembled BFC generated powers of 55, 44, and 33 μW from glucose, respectively. In addition, the power generated from the blood glucose in mouse heart was 16.3 μW at 0.29 V. The lifetime of the BFC was improved by coating an anti-fouling polymer 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) on the anodic electrode, and sealing the cathodic hydrogel chamber with medical tape to minimize the water evaporation without compromising the oxygen permeability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has proven to be a promising technology for processing wet biomass into valuable biofuel intermediates. We investigated the influence of HTL process parameters on the individual and co-liquefaction of Salicornia bigelovii Torr. (SL) and Cyanidioschyzon merolae (CM) biomass and their respective product properties and characteristics. SL and CM biomasses were subjected to HTL conditions of process temperatures (250–350 °C), 10 wt% solid loading, 30 min reaction time, and co-liquefaction ratios (80–20, 50–50, 20–80, CM-SL, respectively). The individual maximum HTL biocrude yields for CM (34.63 wt%) and SL (7.63 wt%) were obtained at 300 °C. In both cases, biocrude oils had a higher carbon and hydrogen content relative to those of the original biomass. The HHV (higher heating value) values for the biocrude samples ranged from 24.2 to 33.12 MJ/kg, which were significantly higher than those of the original biomasses. A positive synergistic effect was observed during the co-liquefaction of two biomasses, where the experimental yield of biocrude oil was higher than the theoretical value. During the co-liquefaction experiments, a maximum biocrude yield of 32.95 wt% was obtained at 300 °C and 80–20 CM-SL biomass mix ratio. Co-liquefaction led to an increase in the energy content of the co-liquefied biocrude oil and a higher energy recovery rate. The properties of HTL products and biomasses were determined with TGA, CHN elemental analyzer, GC/MS, bomb calorimeter, HACH Spectrophotometer, and ICP OES. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper we present a techno-economic analysis of a novel route for biomethane – urea co-production from biogas. The idea emerges as an alternative path for improving the profitability of biogas upgrading plants. The profitability of four different biogas plant sizes (100, 250, 500, and 1000 m3/h) in four European countries (Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and Germany) is studied under the current policy schemes for biomethane production of each country. Our study evidences that with the present policy schemes for biomethane production, only medium and large scale plants (500 and 1000 m3/h) in Italy would be profitable. The reason is the current strong support for biomethane production in Italy through feed-in tariffs subsidies. In this sense, we analysed the potential benefits of governmental incentives through bio-methane subsidies (feed-in tariffs and investment percentage). Feed-in tariffs proved to be a worthwhile solution for large plants. Indeed, profitability is reached under subsidies of 30–48 €/MWh. Overall, plants located in southern EU countries are more likely to reach profitability with lower subsidies. The potential of costs reduction (i.e. ammonia price) was also analysed, showing that cutting-down production costs is essential to reduce the amount of subsidies received. In summary, our study shows the challenge that European policies face in the path towards a bio-based economy using biogas upgrading as reference case. © 2020

AB  - After anaerobic-oxic (A/O) treatment, there are often high chromaticity levels in piggery bio-treatment effluents, which still contain a high concentration of refractory organics. This paper describes the use of piggery biogas residue biochar (BioC) to support MnO2 to prepare a catalyst (MnO2/BioC) and examines the effects of catalyst addition, pH and ozone dosage on chromaticity and organic matter degradation in the ozonation process. Three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) and GC–MS were used to analyse changes in the organic component of the effluent before and after ozonation. The results indicate that the decolorization percentages reached 91.29% and that the UV254 and CODcr removal percentages reached 81.64% and 61.07%, respectively, when the MnO2/BioC catalyst addition amount was 1.0 g·L−1, the pH was 9.0, and the ozone dosage was 0.45 g·L−1. The 3D-EEM analysis results showed that the macromolecular organics mainly consisted of humic acids before treatment, and the removal of humic acid organic matter after treatment had an obvious effect. The GC–MS analysis results showed that the refractory organics were mainly phenols, esters, alcohols and hydrocarbons, and most of the refractory organics were oxidatively degraded after treatment. These results show that ozone catalytic oxidation treatment of piggery bio-treatment effluent can reduce chromaticity and refractory organics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to produce hydrochar from high-ash low-lipid Chlorella vulgaris biomass via hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process. The effects of hydrothermal temperature and retention time with respect to the physicochemical properties of hydrochar were studied in the range of 180–250 °C and 0.5–4 h, respectively. It was found that the hydrothermal temperature had resulted in a significant reduction of hydrochar yield as compared to the retention time. The raw microalgal biomass was successfully converted into an energy densified hydrochar via an optimized HTC reaction, with higher heating value (HHV) of 24.51 kJ/g, which was approximately two-times higher than that of raw biomass. In addition, the overall carbon recovery rate and energy yield were in the range of 53.2–86.4% and 46.9–76.6%, respectively. The high quality of the produced hydrochar was further supported by the plot of van Krevelen diagram and combustion behaviour analysis. Besides, the aqueous phase collected from HTC process could be further used as nutrients source to cultivate C. vulgaris, in which up to 70% of the biomass yield could be attained as compared to the control cultivation condition. The reusability of the aqueous phase collected from HTC process as an alternative nutrients source to cultivate microalgal indicated the feasibility and positive integration of HTC process in microalgal biofuel processing chain. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Many countries produced biodiesel from crude vegetable oil. However, current vegetable oil feedstock to produce biodiesel slow the growth of biodiesel blend implementation due to the high cost of feedstock production. As a result, waste cooking oil (WCO) is claimed to be economic and readily available without cultivation and highly potential feedstock for high yield biodiesel. In this study, Fe-exchanged montmorillonite K10 (Fe-MMT K10) was employed as a catalyst in converting WCO to biodiesel. In comparison, Fe-MMT K10 was able to produce 95.26% biodiesel, which is higher than biodiesel produced using unmodified MMT K10 as catalyst and reaction without catalyst (38.39% and 29.50%, respectively). The full process of biodiesel production was carried out by response surface methodology (RSM) in conjunction with the central composite design (CCD) for statistically optimization and modelling. From the ANOVA, it was found that the production of biodiesel achieved an optimum level of 92.74% biodiesel at 134.07 °C, under a specific optimized condition of 6.32 h reaction time, 4.68 wt% of catalyst and 11.77:1 methanol to oil ratio. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, as an efficient renewable power source, paper microfluidic enzymatic biofuel cells have received significant attention. Due to their inherent characteristics and outstanding performance, a microfluidic paper-based analytical device for enzymatic biofuel cells (μPAD-EBFCs) has emerged as the best alternative to conventional power supplies for various miniaturized devices. This work presents a novel, user-friendly, and cost-efficient enzyme and mediator-immobilized electrochemistry-based shelf-stack-configured μPAD-EBFC. This Y-shaped colaminar fluid-flow EBFC has been realized using multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-composed Bucky paper (BP) as a bioelectrode, where GOx (anodic enzyme) and laccase (cathodic enzyme) were immobilized with optimized chemistry. The potentiometric oxidation and reduction performances of fabricated bioelectrodes were characterized using different electrochemical techniques. Subsequently, four such Y-shaped μPAD-EBFCs were realized in a shelf-stack configuration using a mini-three-dimensional (3D) printed platform, where the μPAD-EBFCs were connected in various series-parallel arrangements. With such shelf-stack configurations, 4 series-connected μPAD-EBFCs delivered the maximum stable open circuit potential of 1.65 V, with a peak power density of 46.4 μW/cm2 (58 μA/cm2) at 0.8 V. The generated output power is sufficient to power the small portable device, which can be easily and suitably tuned depending on the application. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - High environmental pollutants and depleted fossil fuels forced researchers to investigating renewable and low emission fuels. In this study, renewable bioethanol and bio-acetone are mixed together and examined as a new fuel for SI engine for the first time. Three different blend rates are applied (3, 7, and 10 vol% of dual bio-acetone and bioethanol in gasoline) and compared with each other and the pure gasoline. Results of engine performance and pollutant emissions of different blends confirmed that the utmost blend rate (10 vol% of bioethanol and bio-acetone in gasoline) introduced the greatest volumetric efficiency, brake power, and output torque and the lowest CO and UHC emissions, compared to other fuel blends and pure gasoline. Besides, all fuel blends showed higher performance and lower emissions than the pure gasoline. The ternary blended fuels (bioethanol-bio-acetone-gasoline, ACE) are also compared with dual ones (bioethanol-gasoline blends, E, and bio-acetone-gasoline blends, AC), for the first time in the literature. Results showed that the lowest emissions (CO, CO2, and UHC) are introduced by ACE blends, while the best performance (volumetric efficiency and engine power) is partly introduced by E blends. The ACE shared also the best performance (output torque) from the SI engine. The AC blends, however, introduced a moderate performance and emissions among all biofuel blends (ACE and E). The E blends, on the other hand, introduced the highest green unsuitability emissions, even higher than the pure gasoline. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agave bagasse is one of the most abundant lignocellulosic residues readily available for valorization. The agave bagasse was pretreated by applying high-pressure CO2–H2O mixture at temperatures ranging from 150 to 190 °C for a residence time varying from 10 to 50 min. Subsequently, solid phase obtained from pretreatment was subject to enzymatic hydrolysis at high solid loadings. Under optimal conditions, the process integrating pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis yielded 75.8 mol% of the polysaccharides present in the biomass converted into oligo- or monosaccharides, providing 110.5 g/L of reducing sugars. The monosaccharides present in the obtained hydrolysate were successfully fermented into ethanol, demonstrating the feasibility of performing its biological conversion to commercial biofuels or biochemicals. Thereby, the present study has demonstrated the proof of concept of use of more sustainable high-pressure CO2–H2O pretreatment in the context of lignocellulosic residual biomass valorization based on the biochemical sugar platform. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research aims to investigate the role of silica as a support for CaO catalyst in 4 different aspects: determination of optimum parameters, tolerance of water and FFA content, leaching and kinetics evaluation, and reusability of catalyst. Silica was extracted from rice husk by ion exchange method and subsequently impregnated with CaO. The experimental results showed that the supported catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity in transesterification of waste cooking oil with high yield of biodiesel, comparable to that of CaO catalyst. This is due to the fact that catalyst with higher surface area produces higher biodiesel yield. The presence of water did not have significant effect on the performance of supported catalysts, as silica can act as catalyst to esterify the FFA. Furthermore, silica support offered the greatest extent of leaching minimization of CaO and it has been proved that the calcium leached species was insignificant in transesterification reaction. Reusability study suggests that the synthesized catalysts can be recycled up for 8 successive runs. In conclusion, employing calcium rich wastes derived CaO impregnated with silica as catalyst showed good potential in catalytic applications with high economic benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic cracking of vegetable oil mainly processed over zeolites, and among all the zeolites particularly HZMS-5 has been investigated on wide range for renewable and clean gasoline production from various plant oils. Despite the fact that HZSM-5 offers a higher conversion degree and boost aromatics yield, the isomerate yield reduces due to high cracking activity and shape selectivity of HZSM-5. Hence, to overcome these problems, in this study the transition metals, such as nickel and copper doped over HZSM-5 were tested for its efficiencies to improve the isoparaffin compounds. The catalysts were screened with linoleic acid in a catalytic cracking reaction conducted at 450 ᵒC for 90 min in an atmospheric condition in batch reactor. Then, the gasoline composition of the organic liquid product (OLP) was analysed in terms of paraffin, isoparaffin, olefin, naphthenes and aromatics (PIONA). The results showed that Cu/ZSM-5 produced the highest liquid yield of 79.1%, at the same time reduced the production of gas and coke to 18.8% and 0.7%. Furthermore, the desired isoparaffin composition in biogasoline increased from 1.6% to 6.8% and at the same time reduced the oxygenated and aromatic compounds to 15.4% and 59.7%, respectively. The linoleic acid as model compound of rubber seed oil, in the catalytic cracking reaction provides a clearer understanding of the process. Besides, the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in catalytic cracking reaction provides insitu hydrogen production to saturate the branched olefin into the desired isoparaffin and the aromatics into naphthenes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Microwave assisted hydrothermal treatment (MHTC) was compared with torrefaction in terms of carbonization efficiency and physicochemical characteristics of char products. The utilization of produced char was optimized for composite solid biofuel production. The results show that MHTC significantly improved the binding capability of the microwave hydrochar (MHC) particles during co-densification with unprocessed biomass and coal. One possible contributor to the improved binding is the pseudo lignin formed during the MHTC, which led to a better interlocking of the feedstock particles and promoted the solid bridge formation. Composite pellet prepared with 80 wt% of torrefaction char (TC-120), 10 wt% of microwave hydrochar (MHC-30), and 10 wt% of Coal-04 showed a higher heating value of 24.54 MJ/kg and energy density of 26.43 GJ/m3, which is significantly higher than that of the raw cotton stalk pellet (16.77 MJ/kg and 18.76 GJ/m3, respectively), showing great promise as a solid biofuel. The moisture resistance and oxidation reactivity are also significantly improved. The results demonstrate that MHCs provides dual functionalities in acting as binder and fuel promoter in the production of composite biofuel. This study can provide new insight into the unique functions of MHC during fuel application, which demonstrates the great potential of applying MHTC in energy recovery from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Many types of flexible, wearable, and disposable electronic devices have been developed as chemical and physical sensors, and many solar cells contain plastics. However, because of environmental pollution caused by microplastics, plastic use is being reduced worldwide. We have developed an enzyme-catalyzed biofuel cell utilizing cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as an electrode component. The electrode was made conductive by mixing multi-walled carbon nanotubes with the CNF. This prepared biofuel cell was wearable, flexible, hygroscopic, biodegradable, eco-friendly, and readily disposable like paper. The CNF-based enzyme-catalyzed biofuel cell contained a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent glucose dehydrogenase bioanode and laccase biocathode. The maximum voltage and maximum current density of the biofuel cell were 434 mV and 176 μA cm−2, respectively, at room temperature (15-18 °C). The maximum power output was 27 μW cm−2, which was converted to 483 (±13) μW cm−3 © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - Chemical looping gasification (CLG) is a novel gasification technique, allowing for the production of a nitrogen-free high calorific synthesis gas from solid hydrocarbon feedstocks, without requiring a costly air separation unit. Initial advances to better understand the CLG technology were made during first studies in lab and bench scale units and through basic process simulations. Yet, tailored process control strategies are required for larger CLG units, which are not equipped with auxiliary heating. Here, it becomes a demanding task to achieve autothermal CLG operation, for which stable reactor temperatures are obtained. This study presents two avenues to attain autothermal CLG behavior, established through equilibrium based process simulations. As a first approach, the dilution of active oxygen carrier materials with inert heat carriers to limit oxygen transport to the fuel reactor has been investigated. Secondly, the suitability of restricting the air flow to the air reactor in order to control the oxygen availability in the fuel reactor was examined. Process simulations show that both process control approaches facilitate controlled and de-coupled heat and oxygen transport between the two reactors of the chemical looping gasifier, thus allowing for efficient autothermal CLG operation. With the aim of inferring general guidelines on how CLG units have to be operated in order to achieve decent synthesis gas yields, different advantages and disadvantages associated to the two suggested process control strategies are discussed in detail and optimization avenues are presented. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Combined steam/dry reforming of bio-oil with blast furnace slag as heat carrier for the syngas production with the H2/CO ratio of 3:1 for further methanation, was investigated. The increase of H2O addition can increase the total yield of H2 and CO, but also increase the critical temperature at which 3:1-H2/CO syngas was obtained, while the increase of CO2 addition can decrease the critical temperature, but the syngas yield was also decreased. When the steam/carbon (S/C) ratio was 3.0 and the CO2/carbon (CO2/C) ratio was 0.5, the critical temperature decreased to 804 °C, with the potential H2 yield of over 90%. Although the addition of slag and how much slag to be added had almost no any thermodynamic effect on the combined reforming of bio-oil under the condition where higher potential H2 yield can be obtained, the slag as heat carrier could supply all heat for the combined reforming process. When the added slag mass was 3.99 times bio-oil mass, the combined reforming at the S/C ratio of 3.0 and the CO2/C ratio of 0.5 can occur spontaneously for the production of 3:1-H2/CO syngas. The present study could offer important guidance toward utilization of this novel process for further methanation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conventional biofuels, as biodiesel and bioethanol, are oxygenated compounds that have different physical-chemical properties when compared to fossil fuels. Otherwise, drop-in biofuels are bio-hydrocarbons that have the same chemical composition of fossil fuels. These oxygen-free fuels can be used without changes in structure that already exists to fossils fuels, as engines, turbines and tanks. This work presents the synthesis of bio-hydrocarbons via deoxygenation over Co/C catalyst using Macauba acid oil as feedstock. It is an inedible oil, with high acidity (about 38%) from a perennial palm tree with high oil productivity. Macauba endocarp activated carbon supported cobalt catalyst was synthesized and tested in order to develop a low cost and sustainable conversion route. Degree of deoxygenation of 98.4 %wt was achieved using Macauba pulp oil as feedstock, 10 wt% of catalyst, at temperature of 350 °C, pressure of 30 bar H2 for 4 h. The synthesized bio-hydrocarbons presented carbon chains equivalent to the fractions of gasoline, aviation kerosene and, mostly, diesel. These drop-in biofuels and the innovative catalyst appear as an important alternative for transport sector and for improving the sustainability of Macauba biorefinery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study claimed for describing the synthesis and characterization of activated carbon doped transition metal (Mn, Fe) as effective and economic catalysts during catalytic cracking of waste cooking oil. The presented activated carbon was obtained from Peach crusts as economic, environmental and renewable resource. The prepared activated carbon and its transition metal doped forms were characterized using FTIR, XRD, thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis and N2-adsorption-desorption measurements. The physical and fuel properties of the obtained biofuels were approved compared to ASTM specifications. The performance of the different biofuel grades in engine tests was improved by blending regular diesel with 10% biofuel (BF10). The brake specific fuel consumption was decreased using BF10 blend. The brake thermal efficiency was also increased for BF10 from 16.21% to 27.25%. The brake specific fuel consumption was increased for BF10 blend compared to regular diesel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Design of oxygen and hydrogen separation membranes is the point of current interest in producing syngas from biofuels. Nanocomposites with a high mixed ionic-electronic conductivity are known to be promising materials for these applications. This work aims at studying performance of oxygen and hydrogen separation membranes based on nanocomposites PrNi0.5Co0.5O3-δ + Ce0.9Y0.1O2-δ and Nd5.5WO11.25-δ + NiCu alloy, respectively. A high and stable performance promising for the practical application was demonstrated for these membranes. For oxygen separation membrane CH4 conversion is up to 50% with H2 content in the outlet feed being up to 25% at 900 °C. For reactor with hydrogen separation membrane complete EtOH conversion was achieved at T ∼ 700 °C even at the highest flow rate, and a high hydrogen permeation (≥1 ml H2 cm−2 min−1) was revealed. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts are vital to the conversion of solid wastes into biofuels or chemicals. In this study, a bifunctional activated carbon catalyst modified with Fe (Fe/AC) was obtained and applied to the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir (DF) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using a facile fixed bed reactor. The effects of Fe loading amount, catalyst to feedstock ratio, and pyrolysis temperature on the product yields and distributions were studied. Results showed that the highest yield of bio-oil (53.67%) was achieved using 10Fe/AC at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C with a catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1. The main chemical compositions of the obtained catalytic bio-oil were aromatics, alkanes, and phenols. Increasing the temperature (450–600 °C) and catalyst to feedstock ratio (0.5–2) enhanced the selectivity of aromatics at the expense of phenols and alkanes. Compared to the AC catalyst, Fe/AC exhibited excellent performance on aromatics production (especially mono-aromatics) due to the newly created acid sites. The catalytic synergistic effect over 10Fe/AC significantly promoted the formation of aromatics through hydrogen transfer reactions which facilitated the dehydroxylation and demethoxylation of phenols. The present work provides a promising approach of converting biomass and plastic wastes directly into jet fuel range hydrocarbons by using green inexpensive carbon-based catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermal pyrolysis of Arthrospira platensis biomass was investigated at 450 °C before and after lipid or protein extractions with the aim to valorize the extraction residue. Compositions of biomass before pyrolysis and reaction products were analyzed by FT-IR, GC-MS, TG and SEM analyses. Thermal pyrolysis of biomass without any preliminary treatment led to the production of quite promising reaction products in terms of energetic potential, and the best results were obtained with biomass after protein recovery. In fact, contents of nitrogenous and oxygenated compounds significantly decreased in both liquid and gaseous reaction products. The solid residue after pyrolysis, which was mainly composed of carbon, may be usefully exploited to produce carbon-based biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Oil either from macaúba (Acrocomia aculeate) and palm (Elaeis guineensis) fruit kernel was transesterified with methanol through the classical reaction with homogeneous alkaline catalyst. The produced fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were further fractionated via atmospheric distillation as a step to obtain enriched fractions in short-molecular chain esters, ranging from C8 to C14, in a perspective to be blended with the conventional mineral jet fuel (Jet A-1). In this report, such blends of light biodiesels with Jet A-1 kerosene are described for their density, distillation fractions according to the temperature, structure changes under thermal treatments, by thermogravimetry and differential calorimetry analyses, freezing point, flash point, and calorific value. The blends corresponding to 5, 10 and 20 vol% in enriched short-chain esters with kerosene revealed values well within the recommended limits by the ASTM D1655. Light biodiesels, which are rich in lauric acid (C12:0) methyl esters are suitable to be blended with the Jet A-1 kerosene up to at least 5 vol%. Those blends could produce virtually very similar fuels, regarding the main technical standard properties, to the conventional fossil kerosene for jet engines, particularly concerning the moisture content, the density, its behavior in distillation and the flash point. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biorefinery for the purpose of producing biofuels, chemicals, and materials has received much attention. Furfural alcohol (FOL) and levulinate ester (LE) are important biomass-derived platform chemicals, and they are produced from sugar-based furfural (FAL). Unfortunately, the two products are often obtained separately in different reaction systems, which is undesirable; furthermore, it is of significant practical interest to control their selectivity so that the desired product can be accumulated in high yields. Herein, we present an efficient method for the highly selective conversion of FAL to FOL or isopropyl levulinate (IPL) in a one pot system using isopropanol as the hydrogen source and ZrO2@SBA-15 as a bifunctional catalyst with both Lewis acid and Brønsted acid sites. Under optimized reaction conditions, high yields of FOL and IPL in up to 90.4% and 87.2%, respectively, were obtained. Based on the experimental results, a kinetic model describing the catalytic conversion of FAL into FOL and IPL process has been established, which has a good correlation (R2 &gt; 0.92) between the measured and predicted data. The developed kinetics can provide an effective tool to monitor the process and tailor the process conditions to obtain the desired product. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A maximization of a direct electron transfer (DET) between redox enzymes and electrodes can be obtained through the oriented immobilization of enzymes onto an electroactive surface. Here, a strategy for obtaining carbon nanotube (CNTs) based electrodes covalently modified with perfectly control-oriented fungal laccases is presented. Modelizations of the laccase-CNT interaction and of electron conduction pathways serve as a guide in choosing grafting positions. Homogeneous populations of alkyne-modified laccases are obtained through the reductive amination of a unique surface-accessible lysine residue selectively engineered near either one or the other of the two copper centers in enzyme variants. Immobilization of the site-specific alkynated enzymes is achieved by copper-catalyzed click reaction on azido-modified CNTs. A highly efficient reduction of O2 at low overpotential and catalytic current densities over −3 mA cm−2 are obtained by minimizing the distance from the electrode surface to the trinuclear cluster. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In this work, nano-inspired nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO) and polythiophene (Pth) modified bioanode was prepared for biofuel cell applications. The chemically prepared nickel oxide nanoparticles and its composite with polythiophene were characterized for elemental composition and microscopic characterization while using scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical characterizations of polythiophene@NiO composite, biocompatible mediator ferritin (Frt) and glucose oxidase (GOx) catalyst modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode were carried out using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and charge-discharge studies. The current density of Pth@NiO/Frt/GOx bioanode was found to be 5.4 mA/cm2. The bioanode exhibited a good bio-electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of the glucose. The experimental studies of the bioanode are justifying its employment in biofuel cells. This will cater a platform for the generation of sustainable energy for low temperature devices. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Exergy flow analysis is applied to account wastes, determine the exergetic efficiency, compare substitutes and other types of energy sources and also define economic and environmental policies for resource use. The present study focuses on the exergy flow analysis of biodiesel production by esterification and transesterification of waste cooking canola oil to achieve benefits such as reducing material and energy consumptions and improving energy and exergy efficiencies. The input amounts of esterification for all the runs were kept constant, while the runs of transesterification were carried out in a variety of mass and energy input values as the experimental variables. The thermodynamics analysis was applied to determine exergy input and output of the system for the experimental runs. Impacts of experiment variables, including methanol:oil molar ratio, potassium hydroxide concentration and the reaction temperature of transesterification were evaluated on exergy efficiency and exergy loss in the transesterification. The maximum exergy efficiency (91.7%) and the minimum exergy loss (4320 kJ/kg biodiesel) were achieved at methanol:oil molar ratio of 8:1, potassium hydroxide concentration of 1 wt% and the reaction temperature of 55 °C. Excessive use of methanol and catalyst reduced the yield and the exergy efficiency through increasing exergy loss by waste materials. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates enhanced biogas production via co-Hydrothermal gasification (co–HTG) of wet Chlorella vulgaris biomass and hydrochar (HC). Hydrothermal carbonization was applied to valorize struvite containing waste microalgae stream into solid bio-fuel with improved combustion properties. The effects of HC quality and mixing ratio are investigated on biogas yield, composition and carbon conversion ratio. The results show that the application of blending components promotes H2, CH4 formation and selectivity in hydrothermal gasification. The total co-HTG gas yield is increased from 19.13 to 46.95 mol kg-1 at 650 °C and 300 bar by applying 5 wt% HC blending concentration and reduced level of volatile matter content (24.61 wt%). The obtained high hydrogen, methane yields and carbon conversion ratio (19.49, 2.98 mol kg-1, 82.31%, respectively) indicate effective hydrothermal upgrading potentials in case of wet and waste biomass feedstocks. © 2020

AB  - Synthetic oleochemical esters represents a growing alternative for mineral oil-based lubricants. In this sense, the present study shows the results of enzymatic synthesis of neopentyl glycol-bases biolubricants using biodiesel from soybean and castor bean as raw materials. The potential of two commercial immobilized lipases, lipase B from Candida antarctica (Novozyme 435) and lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (Lipozyme RM IM), to produce NPG esters in a solvent-free medium was evaluated. High conversions (>95%) were obtained for both raw materials, with both enzymes, but in a shorter reaction time for soybean biodiesel (24 h) than castor biodiesel (48 h). Both enzymes could be successfully reused for six reactions, Novozyme 435 maintained ≥70% of the initial conversion using the two raw materials and Lipozyme RM IM maintained ≥90% of the first reaction conversion using castor biodiesel. The soybean NPG esters showed good viscosity index, higher than 198, and the castor NPG esters showed good pour point, lower than −20 °C, and good oxidative stability, higher than 30 min. The physico-chemical properties of the biolubricants were dependent on the biodiesel source which directly influence the final application of the products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to their different growth environments, the slagging problem of aquatic biomass such as microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) is different from that of other fuels such as wood, herbaceous biomass and wastes. Three sample groups of microalgae C. vulgaris were made into ash after different pretreatment processes: non-washing (NW), water-washing (WW) and acid-washing (AW). The slagging-predictive indices (SI), the ash fusibility temperatures (AFT) and ternary equilibrium phase diagram SiO2–CaO–K2O (SCK) system were applied separately to estimate the slagging tendency of aquatic biomass C. vulgaris, six terrestrial biomasses and six wastes. The results showed that the elemental composition of ash for C. vulgaris differed from that of other biofuels, especially regarding the content of P2O5. The WW and AW methods were effective for potassium and sulfur removal from C. vulgaris. The results from SI, AFT and SCK system showed that the three groups of C. vulgaris ash had high slagging tendency caused by the high phosphorus content. The results of SCK were consistent with the SI results of RB/A and RFu for biomass and wastes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel solar salinity energy nexus was developed by combining a photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) and a reverse electrodialysis (RED). The hybrid cell (called a PRC) can effectively transfer the solar energy and salinity gradient energy (which is regenerated by low grade industrial waste heat) to electrical energy coupled with enhanced pollutant (Rhodamine B, RhB) degradation and H2O2 production. Energy-Environment win-win will be realized. The open circuit voltage of the PRC was the sum of those of the PFC and the RED, and the RED stack made the larger contribution to the electricity production of PRC. The bias voltage generated from the RED stack accelerated the separation of photo-induced holes and electrons on the three-dimensional TiO2 array photoanode, which enhanced RhB degradation and H2O2 production. The flow rate and concentration of the working fluids (ammonium bicarbonate) and the reaction conditions in the electrode chambers had substantial effects on the PRC performance. Under the optimal condition, the peak power density and energy efficiency of PRC reached 1500 mW m−2 and 4.21% respectively. The performance of PRC on electricity production is better than photocatalytic electrolytic cell driven by desalination(PFCD), but not good as microbial reverse electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: In times of global climate change, the conversion and capturing of inorganic CO2 have gained increased attention because of its great potential as sustainable feedstock in the production of biofuels and biochemicals. CO2 is not only the substrate for the production of value-added chemicals in CO2-based bioprocesses, it can also be directly hydrated to formic acid, a so-called liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC), by chemical and biological catalysts. Recently, a new group of enzymes were discovered in the two acetogenic bacteria Acetobacterium woodii and Thermoanaerobacter kivui which catalyze the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid with exceptional high rates, the hydrogen-dependent CO2 reductases (HDCRs). Since these enzymes are promising biocatalysts for the capturing of CO2 and the storage of molecular hydrogen in form of formic acid, we designed a whole-cell approach for T. kivui to take advantage of using whole cells from a thermophilic organism as H2/CO2 storage platform. Additionally, T. kivui cells were used as microbial cell factories for the production of formic acid from syngas. Results: This study demonstrates the efficient whole-cell biocatalysis for the conversion of H2 + CO2 to formic acid in the presence of bicarbonate by T. kivui. Interestingly, the addition of KHCO3 not only stimulated formate formation dramatically but it also completely abolished unwanted side product formation (acetate) under these conditions and bicarbonate was shown to inhibit the membrane-bound ATP synthase. Cell suspensions reached specific formate production rates of 234 mmol g protein-1 h-1 (152 mmol g CDW-1 h-1), the highest rates ever reported in closed-batch conditions. The volumetric formate production rate was 270 mmol L-1 h-1 at 4 mg mL-1. Additionally, this study is the first demonstration that syngas can be converted exclusively to formate using an acetogenic bacterium and high titers up to 130 mM of formate were reached. Conclusions: The thermophilic acetogenic bacterium T. kivui is an efficient biocatalyst which makes this organism a promising candidate for future biotechnological applications in hydrogen storage, CO2 capturing and syngas conversion to formate. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a very valuable platform molecule obtained from biomass. It can be catalytically transformed to many industrially relevant products of both oxidation and reduction reactions. In this work, we showed that robust CuZnO can be an efficient, self-tuned catalyst for 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) (biofuel additive) synthesis. We showed that CuZnO catalysts can be further activated in the reaction environment and this process depends strongly on the initial catalyst properties and therefore on the catalyst preparation method. Smaller copper particles are more active but more prone to carbon deposit formation. Based on activity tests and extensive characterization, we have concluded that both Cun+ and Cu0 sites are necessary for high HMF conversion. While these two sites favor high conversion and high 2,5-bishydroxymethylfuran (BHMF) yield, the in situ formation of Lewis acid sites is proposed to be necessary for achieving a high DMF yield.

AB  - In this work, two kinds of catalyst called monometallic Palladium (Pd) and a bimetallic of Pd-Iron (Fe) were synthesised using aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as the supported material via the wet impregnate method. A monometallic catalyst (0.5% Pd/Al2O3) named Pd cat was used as control. For the bimetallic catalyst, ratios of Pd to Fe were varied, and included 0.38% Pd–0.12% Fe (PF1), 0.25% Pd–0.25% Fe (PF2), and 0.12% Pd–0.38% Fe (PF3). The catalysts were characterised to investigate physical properties such as the surface area, pore size, porosity, and pore size distribution including their composition by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Subsequently, all catalysts were applied for biofuels production in terms of green diesel/kerosene/gasoline from palm oil via a hydrocracking reaction. The results showed that the loading of Fe to Pd/Al2O3 could improve the active surface area, porosity, and pore diameter. Considering the catalytic efficiency for the hydrocracking reaction, the highest crude biofuel yield (94.00%) was obtained in the presence of PF3 catalyst, while Pd cat provided the highest refined biofuel yield (86.00%). The largest proportion of biofuel production was green diesel (50.00–62.02%) followed by green kerosene (31.71–43.02%) and green gasoline (6.10–8.11%), respectively. It was clearly shown that the Pd-Fe bimetallic and Pd monometallic catalysts showed potential for use as chemical catalysts in hydrocracking reactions for biofuel production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Zeolites Y, ZSM-5, beta, mordenite and LTL were converted into hierarchical meso-microporous catalysts applying the surfactant templating strategy and the resulting materials were utilised as catalysts for esterification and aldol condensation reactions for the production of the second generation biofuels and platform chemicals from biomass derived molecules. The relationship between the catalytic performance and the accessibility of active sites in zeolites was examined using FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene. It was found that the esterification of oleic acid can be enhanced by the presence of strong acid sites in zeolites and their improved accessibility. In the aldol condensation reaction, furfural conversion over hierarchical catalysts also increased as compared to the parent zeolites. However, K-forms of the studied zeolites exhibited a higher conversion and selectivity toward the desired reaction products in comparison with their H-forms. Overall, mesostructured zeolites demonstrated an improved catalytic performance as a result of increasing accessibility of the zeolite active sites. © 2019

AB  - γ-Valerolactone (GVL) is an interesting bio-based platform molecule that is utilized as green solvent and a versatile building block for the synthesis of bio-fuels and chemicals. Herein, an investigation on the efficient production of GVL from biomass-based carbonyl compounds such as furfural, levulinic acid, and its esters using 2-propanol as H-donor and solvent over stable Zr-incorporated mesoporous silica (KIT-5) catalysts was presented. Both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites were generated by the introduction of Zr into KIT-5, and the acid density of the resulting Zr-KIT-5(Si/Zr) could be controlled by simply adjusting Si/Zr molar ratio. Among these bifunctional catalysts, Zr-KIT-5(10) showed superior catalytic performance in the production of GVL (>91% selectivity) from biomass-derived carboxides (ca. 94% conversion), which was demonstrated to positively correlate with its large amount of acidic sites and facile access of active sites to interconnected pores. Moreover, the spent catalyst held about 90% of its original activity in the sixth run. Due to the presence of Brønsted and Lewis dual acidic sites in Zr-KIT-5, the direct conversion of furfural to GVL was also permitted in a single pot via tandem reactions involving hydrogenation, ring-opening, secondary hydrogenation, and subsequent cyclization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrochlores (H3O)xSbxTe(2-x)O6 (x = 1, 1.1 and 1.25) obtained by ion exchange from KxSbxTe(2-x)O6 oxides were used as catalysts for the conversion of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in H2O/Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). The structure of the resulting compounds as well as the location of the H3O+ units inside the three-dimensional network, were determined by XRD from powder samples. The effect of factors such as reaction time and temperature on the formation of HMF was studied. A fructose conversion of 99% and a yield of 59% were achieved after 120 min of reaction time and at 150 °C temperature. The percentage of substitution of the cations Sb and Te in the position B of the pyrochlore was determinant to achieve the maximum incorporation of H3O + ions in the pyrochlore structure, which allowed to correlate the density of acidic sites present in the materials and their catalytic activity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work combines an organic oxidation catalyst, 4-amino-TEMPO (TEMPO-NH2), and a recombinant enzyme, oxalate decarboxylase (OxDc) to create a hybrid catalytic system able to catalyze complete ethanol electrooxidation. The catalyst system was coupled with a novel small scale electrolysis cell utilizing polycaprolactone (PCL) and carbon composite electrodes for bulk electrolysis. Electrochemical measurements and product detection by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) after 12 h of electrolysis have shown for the first time that an organic catalyst and decarboxylase enzyme can oxidize ethanol to carbon dioxide at acidic pH. The success presented here, coupling a hybrid organic catalyst/enzymatic system to simple carbon composites, has potential value for selective alcohol oxidation and is promising for a wide array of applications, including biosensors, environmental monitoring, and biofuel cells. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic isomerization of glucose to fructose is a key step for the synthesis of bioplastics and biofuels as well as sweeteners. In this study, a record fructose yield of greater than 50% with selectivity exceeding 80% was obtained from glucose concentration of 10 wt % by adopting a 1-butanol/hydrotalcite catalytic system. In this novel process, Mg2+ leaching from hydrotalcite, which is an important issue when utilizing hydrotalcite for glucose isomerization in aqueous solution, was negligible during the reaction. NMR study confirmed that the absence of deuterium at the C-1 position of the fructose product as well as C-2 position of glucose-2-d clearly supports the base-catalyzed deprotonation of the C-2 position in glucose. Also, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the selective formation of fructose from glucose over hydrotalcite surface in 1-butanol than other solvents. Notably, after glucose isomerization, the highly pure glucose (91%) and fructose crystals (95%) were recovered easily from 1-butanol solvent by subsequent cooling and filtration without requiring chromatographic separation. Therefore, the hydrotalcite/1-butanol catalytic system is simple, inexpensive, and a green process for the high-yield fructose production from glucose when compared with current industrial procedures that rely on enzymatic isomerization reactions and chromatographic separations. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - β-Pinene and paraformaldehyde can be activated over catalyst to preferentially produce nopol. Tin supported over MCM-41 has shown high activity in this reaction, achieving complete conversion of pure β-pinene and high selectivity toward nopol (>96%) with a key role of solvents such as toluene and ethyl acetate. In this work, the Prins reaction was performed with turpentine as β-pinene source, avoiding the use of solvents and reaching complete conversion of β-pinene and high selectivity toward nopol (>99%). In this case, α-pinene, which is a component of turpentine, can play the role of solvent. Besides, α-terpineol is also a product of the reaction, probably due to the hydration of limonene and α-pinene. The reaction was scaled-up to produce up to 3.5 L of oxyturpentine (oxyfunctionalized turpentine) with promising results. Sn-MCM-41 catalyst was synthesized by the hydrothermal method at room temperature, providing an easy scale-up of the process. On the basis of the high performance of the production reaction of oxyturpentine, it is a promising biofuel, although a complete assessment of its properties and performance in engine tests is pending. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sorption enhanced gasification (SEG) is a promising technology for production of a renewable feedstock gas for biofuel synthesis processes. The technology has been previously demonstrated at pilot scale. Scaling of the technology to an industrial size requires knowledge from governing phenomena. One-dimensional bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor model was developed and validated against experimental data from 200kWth dual fluidized bed facility. Sub-models for biomass gasification, reactive bed material and fluidized bed hydrodynamics were incorporated into the model frame. The model gave satisfactory predictions for bed material conversion, temperature profiles and gas composition of the producer gas. The conducted validation improved understanding of bed material conversion, water–gas shift reaction and hydrodynamics and their role in SEG reactors. Further refinement and comprehensive validation of the model with additional data from the pilot is required. The knowledge from the comprehensive validation can be utilized in simulation of an industrial size reactor. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this research is to develop and utilize bio-oil collected from palm shell through optimization of pyrolysis conditions and quantitative chemical characterization. To recover maximum value-added chemicals, the fast pyrolysis of palm shell was conducted in a tandem micro-reactor followed by the generation of bio-oil in a fluidized bed pilot plant. The experimental results from tandem micro-reactor showed that the high yield of value-added products such as anhydrosugars (levoglucosan, cellobiosan), and aromatics (phenols, guaicol) was obtained at a temperature of 500 °C and particle size of 600 μm. The higher temperatures favoured the production of carboxylic acids (acetic acids, propionic acid) and furans (hydroxymethyl furfural, furfural) accompanied by a reduction of aromatics from 6.5 wt% to 3.6 wt%. The maximum bio-oil yield obtained was approximately 60 wt% for a feeding rate of 100 g/h, particle size of 600 μm and temperature of 500 °C in the pilot plant. A GC-MS chromatography connected to the system indicated that the pyrolytic gas was predominantly composed of CO2. The experimental results and the subsequent physicochemical characteristics confirmed that the palm residue has the potential to be a good feedstock for pyrolysis process to produce biochemicals or biofuels. © 2019

AB  - One of the ways to produce biodiesel is through fatty acid esterification via heterogeneous catalysis. The water treatment plants in Manaus - Amazonas/Brazil produce about 20 tons of sludge per day. In order to establish an application to this abundant waste as a new heterogeneous catalyst, acid and heat treatments were performed and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, surface area, and scanning electron microscopy. The sludge is mainly composed of Si, Al, and Fe. Only the sludge without heat treatment showed S levels after acid treatment, proving the sulfation in these materials. The obtained materials were applied as catalysts, where the activity was evaluated by fatty acid esterification with methanol. The process was optimized using the best catalyst (WTS3M) and oleic acid, where under the following reaction conditions: 15:1 methanol:acid molar ratio, 5 wt% of catalyst, 100 °C and 3 h of reaction, resulted in conversions higher than 97%. The application of water treatment sludge as a catalyst with high catalytic activity for methyl oleate synthesis and the possibility of regeneration were demonstrated. This study will thus aid in the cost-effective reduction of water treatment sludge and increase the potential for additional biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is a potential and low-cost source for biodiesel production which has been used widely. In this study, novel nanocatalyst (GO@ZrO2–SrO) was synthesized via co-precipitation method by the combination of both potential graphene oxide and bimetal zirconium/strontium oxide nanoparticles. The proposed nanocomposite showed a promising ability as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of WCO to produce FAMEs as biodiesel. The FTIR, SEM/EDX and XRD were used for the characterization of nanocatalyst to evaluate the surface functional groups, nanostructure/elements and crystallinity, respectively. The effective parameters on the transesterification FAMEs yield including oil to alcohol ratio, reaction time, and reaction temperature were studied. Based on the results, the maximum FAMEs yield of 91% was obtained in the conditions of the material ratio of 1:0.5 (w/w) of GO:ZrO2–SrO, oil to methanol ratio (1:4), the reaction time of 90 min and the temperature of 120 °C. Therefore, this study showed that GO@ZrO2–SrO can be used as an alternative potential heterogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel from WCO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study describes the production of biodiesel via the enzymatic transesterification reaction, using waste cooking oil as a substrate. Lipases from Candida rugosa and Rhizomucor miehei were immobilised on polyhydroxybutyrate to serve as environment-friendly catalysts. This enzyme mixture yielded the highest biodiesel production. The optimum conditions for biodiesel production included a reaction temperature of 45 °C, 5% water content, 1% of mixed lipase (50% of each lipase), a methanol:oil ratio of 6:1, a 24-h reaction period, and a 250 rpm stirring speed, which resulted in the highest biodiesel yields (96.5%). This catalyst can be reused for more than six cycles, after which the lipase activity begins to decrease. The chemical and fuel properties such as the density at 15 °C, viscosity at 40 °C and cloud point of the resulting biodiesel were similar to those of other diesels/biodiesels and complied with international specifications (EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to its environment-friendly and replenishable characteristics, biodiesel has the potential to substitute fossil fuels as an alternative source of energy. Although biodiesel has many benefits to offer, manufacturing biodiesel on an industrial scale is uneconomical as a high cost of feedstock is required. A novel sulfonated and magnetic catalyst synthesised from a palm kernel shell (PMB-SO3H) was first introduced in this study for methyl ester or biodiesel production to reduce capital costs. The wasted palm kernel shell (PKS) biochar impregnated with ferrite Fe3O4 was synthesised with concentrated sulphuric acid through the sulfonation process. The SEM, EDX, FTIR, VSM and TGA characterization of the catalysts were presented. Then, the optimisation of biodiesel synthesis was catalysed by PMB-SO3H via the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). It was found that the maximum biodiesel yield of 90.2% was achieved under these optimum operating conditions: 65 °C, 102 min, methanol to oil ratio of 13:1 and the catalyst loading of 3.66 wt%. Overall, PMB-SO3H demonstrated acceptable catalysing capability on its first cycle, which subsequently showed a reduction of the reusability performance after 4 cycles. An important practical implication is that PMB-SO3H can be established as a promising heterogeneous catalyst by incorporating an iron layer which can substantially improve the catalyst separation performance in biodiesel production. © 2020

AB  - Gasification is one of the methods of generating biopower or biofuels from biomass waste. In this study, a bench-scale fluidized bed reactor was used for biomass air and air-steam gasification. Gasification was performed under constant operating conditions (~780 °C, equivalence ratio = ~0.32) to investigate the effect of biomass (switchgrass, pine residues) and bed materials (sand, CaO+ sand, Al2O3, and CaO + Al2O3). All gasification products, such as synthesis gas (syngas), contaminant gases, tar, and biochar (solid) were comprehensively analyzed. The composition of biomass significantly impacted CO and H2 yield from volatile combustible matter and fixed carbon. Further, the presence of CaO made the condition favorable for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction combined with the CO2 carbonation reaction, which increased H2 concentration. Additional steam with CaO increased H2 concentration closer to 50% (N2 free condition) through the combination reactions of steam hydrocarbon reforming and WGS by producing 44 gH2/kgdry biomass and 143 gCO/kgdry biomass. The usage of steam reduced the overall yield of contaminant gases, whereas the usage of CaO or Al2O3 decreased the amount of gasification tar by approximately 5.8–6.5 gtar/kgdry biomass. This study can provide valuable experimental data for biomass waste to produce better quality syngas. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study reports a new nanocomposite design using surface modified silver nanowires decorated on the surface of polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic polymer acting as glue for anchoring nanowires and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The synthesized nanocomposite was employed as a promising electrode material for immobilization of biomolecules and effective transportation of electron, in enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFCs) application. The synthesized nanocomposite was confirmed by analytical techniques, for instance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical behaviour of the nanobioelectrocatalysts rGO-PEI/Frt/GOx, rGO-PEI/AgNWs/Frt/GOx, and rGO-PEI/Naph-SH/AgNWs/Frt/GOx was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The maximum current density obtained by the modified bioanode was found to be 19.9 mA cm−2 at the limiting glucose concentration of 50 mM in PBS (pH 7.0) as supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Plant metacaspases mediate programmed cell death in development, biotic and abiotic stresses, damage-induced immune response, and resistance to pathogen attack. Most metacaspases require Ca2+ for their activation and substrate processing. However, the Ca2+-dependent activation mechanism remains elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of Metacaspase 4 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtMC4) that modulates Ca2+-dependent, damage-induced plant immune defense. The AtMC4 structure exhibits an inhibitory conformation in which a large linker domain blocks activation and substrate access. In addition, the side chain of Lys225 in the linker domain blocks the active site by sitting directly between two catalytic residues. We show that the activation of AtMC4 and cleavage of its physiological substrate involve multiple cleavages in the linker domain upon activation by Ca2+. Our analysis provides insight into the Ca2+-dependent activation of AtMC4 and lays the basis for tuning its activity in response to stresses for engineering of more sustainable crops for food and biofuels. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Pumpkin peel wastes are an unutilized source of starch, whose bioethanol production has not been reported by any research work so far. Such bioethanol is believed to show the potential uses of these wastes. Therefore, the present work was conducted to optimize the reducing sugar concentration and bioethanol production from pumpkin peel wastes using two modeling approaches (artificial neural networks and response surface methodology). Actually, a central composite rotatable design was used to optimize bioethanol production to obtain maximum reducing sugar and bioethanol concentrations. ANN proved to be superior to RSM in terms of its estimation and prediction capabilities. Therefore, the optimum conditions were obtained based on predicted ANN-model as follows. Concerning the hydrolysis process, hydrolysis time was 120 min, loading substrate was 17.5 g/L, α-amylase concentration was 7.5 U/g and amyloglucosidase concentration was 56.40 U/mL. As for the fermentation process, the optimal conditions were: fermentation temperature 45 °C, pH 5.06, shaking speed 188.5 rpm, and yeast concentration of 1.95 g/L. Under these conditions, the experimental concentration values of reducing sugar and bioethanol were 50.60 and 84.36 g/L, respectively, which are in good agreement with those predicted by the ANN-model (84.27 and 50.69 g/L, respectively). Besides, the results revealed that substrate loading and fermentation temperature were the most significant factors affecting the reducing sugar and bioethanol concentration, respectively (p < 0.01). Subsequently, the kinetics of yeast growth and bioethanol formation under the optimized conditions were estimated using the Monod, logistic and modified Gompertz models, respectively. Subsequently, the pumpkin peel wastes would offer an energy-saving alternative for fuel-ethanol production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The growing market for pellets used to produce energy requires research on new feedstocks and technologies (pyrolysis) that increase the energy potential of these products. Thus, the objective of this study was to produce pellets from coffee residues, evaluate their energy potential, pyrolyze the pellets via slow pyrolysis and characterize the final products of the process (bio-oil and biochar). The pellets were produced from coffee husks in a pelletizer; some of the pellets were used for the combustion test, and others were used in the slow pyrolysis process. The efficiency in compacting the bulk biomass to obtain solid fuels was demonstrated by calculating the energy density. The pellet formation efficiency was also evaluated using stereoscopic images. Slow pyrolysis was performed at three final temperatures: 400 °C, 450 °C and 500 °C; the final residence time was 1 h. The product yields were calculated at the end of the pyrolysis process. The chemical compounds present in the bio-oil were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and the proximate analysis, higher heating values and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the biochar were determined. The results showed that the prior addition of water to the coffee husk particles resulted in unstable pellets. The energy density of the pellets was statistically higher than that of the coffee husk. The combustion test allowed the combustion profile of the pellets to be determined, in which high temperatures and uniform burning were obtained. The pyrolysis product yields were influenced by the process final temperature. The biochar yield decreased with increasing temperatures; however, the fixed carbon and calorific values of the biochar collected at 450 °C were higher than the values of the biochar collected at other temperatures. The maximum yield of bio-oil was obtained at 450 °C, while the gas yields were the highest at 500 °C. The bio-oils obtained by higher pyrolysis temperatures comprised greater amounts of phenolic (phenol, phenol, 2-methyl- and phenol, 3-methyl-) and nitrogenous (caffeine) compounds. Lower temperatures yielded more esters (hexanedioic acid and bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester). The low atomic ratios H/C and O/C proved that temperatures ≥ 400 °C made the biochar more aromatic and carbonaceous, this fact was evidenced by the FTIR analysis. It is concluded that the coffee husk pelletizing process is a convenient alternative to obtain higher energy efficiency. Furthermore, from the energetic properties of the biochar the coffee husk has the potential to be used as fuel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In South America, the observations of atmospheric pollutants are deficient, and few cities have implemented air quality monitoring programs. In addition, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) observations are still missing, and little is known about their contributions to the atmospheric composition and impacts in a large ethanol usage context like Brazil. Here, we present a wide range of VOCs that have been measured for ten years in São Paulo Megacity (SPM) in different campaigns at traffic, urban and background sites. When compared with other cities worldwide, the average VOCs ambient concentrations in SPM were higher by factors of 2 to 10. However, the ambient VOCs distribution among these cities is homogeneous even for ethanol, aldehydes and alkenes species. Emission ratios (ER) were established related to carbon monoxide and acetylene, which did not depict strong seasonal and interannual variability in SPM. When compared with previous studies, ERs showed an enrichment from road-tunnel to background, suggesting the presence of other sources than traffic. A good agreement in ER was found with Los Angeles and Paris; but limited consistencies with Middle East and Asia cities. Our ethanol measurements show that contrasted ER can be obtained depending on the emission process involved, with a strong impact of evaporation on ethanol concentrations. The multiyear acetaldehyde analysis displayed that ER could be a valuable metric to assess the long-term changes in emissions sources. Finally, VOCs emissions were calculated from ER and compared with those estimated by the global emission inventory (Edgar). The total VOC emissions estimated by the global inventory agree very well with those from our observations up to 75%. Nevertheless, the VOCs speciation is misrepresented in the inventory, mainly for oxygenated and heavier alkanes compounds. These inconsistencies will also have an impact on the quantification of secondary atmospheric pollutants formation associated to road transport emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation is an essential step for bio-oil upgrading. However, hydrodeoxygenation usually requires a high hydrogen pressure and high temperature due to the good stability of the C–O bonds. Here we report an effective multiphase hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-based bio-oil at temperatures &lt;100 °C and hydrogen pressures &lt;1 atm using a synergetic catalyst system that consists of a low redox potential H4SiW12O40 (SiW12) and suspended Pt-on-carbon (Pt/C) particles. We propose that SiW12 plays three critical roles in bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation. First, it quickly oxidizes the H2 gas to form reduced SiW12 in the presence of Pt/C. Second, it transfers both electrons and H+ ions to the bulk phase to form active H* or H2 on the Pt/C surface. Third, the formation of the oxonium ion in a SiW12 superacid solution reduces the deoxygenation energy. The SiW12-enhanced proton-transfer hydrodeoxygenation mechanism is supported by density functional theory computations. As a result of the hydrogen buffer and acidic effect, up to a 90% yield of hydrocarbons (cyclohexane, benzene and their derivatives) was achieved from the hydrodeoxygenation of phenol and its derivatives. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The most common reaction for biodiesel production is catalysed by acid, base or enzyme catalysts. When transesterification is completed, the reaction mixture contains various impurities such as soap, catalyst, free glycerol and alcohol that have to be removed to meet the biodiesel international standard specifications. In this work, biodiesel was produced by lipase catalysed transesterification from edible sunflower oil and methanol as substrates. The purification of crude biodiesel was carried out by decantation followed by ultrafiltration membrane technology. Four different membranes, polyethersulfone, polyacrylonitrile, polypropylene and regenerated cellulose were selected and used for biodiesel ultrafiltration. Based on permeate flux and glycerol content in the permeate membrane performance was evaluated. The obtained results showed that two out of four tested membranes have potential for biodiesel purification. Polyacrylonitrile membrane showed the best performance resulting in lowest glycerol content in permeate (0.006% (w/w)). Additionally, polyacrylonitrile membrane was successfully reused six times without significant loss of performance. Furthermore, the membrane blocking mechanisms were analysed for all membranes by Hermina's model. Consequently, complete cake layer formation was identified as the most dominant blocking effect. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rising demands of energy and strict regulations of government associated with toxic gases emitted from utilization of conventional fuels are motivating towards biofuels mainly biodiesel. However, some constraints for employing biodiesel as substitution fuel are higher viscosity, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The main intention of this work is to explore biodiesel production and examine the influence of butanol (Bu)-biodiesel (B)-diesel fuels on the diesel engine. In present work, biodiesel (B) is prepared from eucalyptus oil and B20 (20%biodiesel-80%diesel), B100 (neat biodiesel), B20-5Bu (20%biodiesel-75%diesel-5%butanol), B20-10Bu (20%biodiesel-70%diesel-10%butanol) and B20-15Bu (20%biodiesel-65%diesel-15%butanol) prepared fuel samples are tested with varying engine load at 1500 rpm in diesel engine. Approximately 92% yield of biodiesel is obtained with base-catalyzed transesterification method at pre-determined methanol-oil ratio (8:1) and 0.1% (wt) sodium hydroxide (NaOH) catalyst at 65 °C reaction temperature for 3 hrs. It is found that slight increase in brake power (BP) and higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) are attained with butanol-biodiesel-diesel fuels, while brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is decreased. At full load, the results are indicated that 10% and 20% average reduction in carbon mono-oxide (CO); 36.7% and 46% unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are declined for B20 and B100 respectively. Moreover, the NOx and CO2 emissions are found to be increased than diesel. B20-5Bu, B20-10Bu and B20-15Bu shows 23.55%, 21.9% and 25.16% average decrease in NOx emission at great extent, due to cooling effect of butanol. Finally, it is proclaimed that butanol-diesel-biodiesel can become a promising fuel as same as diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Efficient conversion of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a key step for producing fuels and value-added chemicals from carbohydrates. Here, we report for the first time the applicability of phosphate-functionalized porous organic polymers (POPs) as a catalyst for fructose conversion. Two catalysts, B-POP and P-POP, were synthesized via a simple one-pot reaction and B-POP showed high surface area (1193 m2 g−1) and high mesoporosity (54.7 %) with 1.7 mmol g−1 of phosphate groups available as surface acid sites. The catalytic activity of the phosphate functionalized POPs was investigated using different solvents, and B-POP yielded 100 % fructose conversion with 85 % HMF selectivity within 30 min (equivalent to a turnover frequency of 32.2 h−1, the highest activity among other previously reported acid-based heterogeneous catalysts) when DMSO/1,4-dioxane dual solvent medium was used at 130 °C. These results suggested that phosphate group-functionalized POPs can be promising heterogeneous catalysts for producing biobased platform chemicals from renewable resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction was investigated for boosting the reduction of biomass-derived furanic compounds to obtain high-quality liquid biofuels. The CTH of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and furfural to 2-methylfuran (MF) was thoroughly studied over the Ru, Pd, Au, Pt, Ni, Rh and Cu metal catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons (NMCs) by utilizing 2-propanol as a source of hydrogen. The structural characteristics of the materials were examined by employing various physico-chemical methods, such as XRD, N2 sorption, CHN analysis, XPS, FT-IR spectroscopy, H2-TPR, TEM, CO2-TPD, ICP-OES and Raman spectroscopy. The influence of the N content, basicity of the catalyst, reaction temperature, hydrogen donor, nature of the catalyst support and transition metal was systematically investigated with regard to the substrate conversions and product yields. The correlation between the N content (wt%) of the catalysts and the Ru nanoparticle size (nm) and turnover frequency (h-1) was also investigated. Highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles (1.9 nm) supported on NMC displayed admirable catalytic performance in CTH for the conversion of HMF to DMF and furfural to MF. The catalyst Ru-NMC with a good N content (11.4 wt%) gave 84 and 87 mol% yields of DMF and MF, respectively, with 2-propanol as the source of hydrogen under mild reaction conditions. In addition, this catalyst demonstrated excellent recyclability. The better catalytic activity of the Ru-NMC catalyst in the CTH of HMF and furfural was credited to the small size of the Ru metal nanoparticles (1.9 nm), high N content, superior metal-support interaction and mesoporous framework of the catalyst. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Against the worldwide energy crisis and climate change, new forms of energy generation have been investigated. Among the possibilities, microalgae are considered potential feedstock for biofuels production. However, there are still important challenges to overcome. In this context, the integration of biomass cultivation and the treatment of different types of wastewater can represent a source of nutrients and water, with the additional benefit of reducing the discharge of pollutant loads into water bodies. The wastewater grown biomass is composed by a microorganism consortium. These microorganisms can develop important symbiotic relationships for the optimization of biomass production. However, the success of algal biomass cultivation in effluents also involves the development of efficient reactors, which ranges from design criteria to operational parameters. High rate ponds are the most suitable reactors for such a purpose, within the context of a wastewater treatment plant. In this reactor, the addition of CO2 is an important parameter for pH control and, consequently, will influence nutrient assimilation. Another relevant operational parameter is the pond depth, which will have a major role in radiation availability along the water column. With respect to the energy use of the biomass, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) represents an interesting alternative for wastewater grown biomass, since the process does not require complete drying of the biomass, its bio-oil production efficiency is not necessarily attached to the lipid content and may present a positive energy balance. In addition, the possibility of using the HTL by-products, especially the water soluble products, in the context of a biorefinery, represents a route for nutrient recycling, residue minimization, and cost reduction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to produce bio-oils from various lignocellulosic biomass, namely palm empty fruit bunch (EFB), palm fiber (PF), sugarcane bagasse (SB), and sugarcane leaves (SL). Hydrothermal liquefaction, an environmentally benign process, was applied for converting wet bio-resources to bio-oils. The effect of Na2CO3 and La2O3 catalysts were investigated at 300 °C, the results showed higher bio-oil yield from Na2CO3 compared to La2O3. The use of glycerol solvent as a hydrogen donor substantially enhanced bio-oil yield for 300% compared to aqueous solvent. Furthermore, the microwave-assisted wet torrefaction (800 W for 20 min) pretreatment employed for EFB helps to increase aliphatic and aromatic compounds and enhance the light and heavy bio-oils yields to 76.80 wt%. SB and EFB are promising biomass for solvothermolysis liquefaction giving the highest energy ratio. A substantial amount of carbon nanodots and nanoflakes were produced from hydrothermolysis and solvothermolysis liquefaction of EFB with average mean diameters of 49.5 and 100.4 nm, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, transesterification of triacetin was studied using biochar as a greener and environmentally friendly solid catalyst. Biochar and modified biochars were produced from spent malt rootlets with pyrolysis at 850 °C in limited oxygen atmosphere, treated with acid, base, or pure water, characterized with various physicochemical techniques, like N2 adsorption for the determination of Specific Surface Area, thermogravimetric analysis, Infra-Red spectroscopy, Xray powder diffraction and Potentiometric Mass Titration for the determination of acid-base behavior and tested for their transesterification activity. The physicochemical characterization of the biochars showed that the treatment had significant effect on the specific surface area, TGA curves and point of zero charge of the biochars. Treatment with NaOH results to a significant increase in point of zero charge of the biochar, removal of lignin and enrichment of Na on the surface of biochar. Treatment with H2SO4 increases the specific surface area and the microporosity, lowers the point of zero charge and removes almost completely the mineral deposits from the surface. It was found that the two most active biochars were the untreated and the treated with NaOH biochar. The transesterification activity is correlated well with the basicity of the samples. The activity of the biochars is similar to the activity obtained in homogenous catalysis and it is stable for at least 3 cycles. The results are promising and biochars from spent malt rootlets can be used in transesterification reaction for biofuels production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, it has been shown that enzyme encapsulation inside metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can increase enzyme activity and serve as protection from adverse environmental conditions. Little is understood about how the enzymes move into and are held inside the MOFs although it is believed that intermolecular forces between the MOF and the enzyme cause it to be held in place. If this process can be better understood, it can have dramatic implications on the cost-effectiveness and implementation of enzyme-MOF complexes. This is of specific importance in the medical sector for protein therapy and the industrial sector where enzyme use is expected to increase. Herein, we synthesized alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and PCN-333 to study encapsulation, stability, and enzyme activity to expand the knowledge of our field and offer a potential improvement to a synthetic route for biofuel synthesis. From this, we found a correlation between the concentration of a buffer and the loading of an enzyme, with surprising loading trends. We conclude that the buffer solution decreases interactions between the enzyme and MOF, supporting conventional theory and allowing it to penetrate deeper into the structure causing higher enzyme loading while allowing for excellent stability over time at various pH values and temperatures and after multiple reactions. We also observe new trends such as a rebounding effect in loading and "out-of-bounds"reactions. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The design of cost-effective and high-performance bimetallic catalysts has become crucial for the effective conversion of biomass-derived pyrolysis-oil (Py-oil) into liquid biofuels. New bimetallic Ni3Fe catalysts were developed for effective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of Py-oil derived from date seeds. Ni3Fe catalyst showed a well-defined octagon-like morphology with a diameter of 120 nm and high saturation magnetization (Ms) of 78 emu g−1 at room temperature. Py-oil was subjected to catalytic HDO processes at 250 °C for 120 min in a 10 bar H2 atmosphere in the presence of Ni3Fe catalyst. Characterization results confirmed HDO of several components of Py-oil, including phenols, acids, aldehyde and ketones, sugars and aromatic hydrocarbons over the surfaces of Ni3Fe catalyst. The obtained upgraded Py-oil (HDO Py-oil) showed the highest hydrocarbons content of 23.77%, higher heating value (HHV) of 36.78 MJ kg−1, and lower content of water, total acid number, and viscosity than fresh Py-oil. Bimetallic Ni3Fe catalyst resulted in better HDO performance and re-usability for five consecutive cycles than recently reported monometallic or noble metal nanocatalysts. Plausible reaction pathways for the formation of major components including ethane, ethyl acetate, 2,5-dimethylfuran, D-sorbitol, methylcyclohexane, furfural alcohol, and 1,5-pentane diols are discussed. Results demonstrate that this simple and active bimetallic catalytic system leads to a cutting-edge liquid biofuels production pathway in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To decrease the dependence on crude oil, biomass derived liquid transportation fuels are highly desirable. Butyl levulinate is a potential cellulose-derived biofuel additive with properties similar to diesel and low water solubility. Herein we report a direct one-pot production of levulinic acid ester, butyl levulinate, from furfuryl alcohol by alcoholysis using n-butanol. The partial tin exchanged tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) supported on montmorillonite K-10 catalysts showed facile alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol to levulinate ester under mild temperature conditions. Partially exchanging the H+ ion of TPA with Sn (x = 1) resulted in enhanced acidity of the catalyst and showed an increase in the catalytic activity as compared to TPA/K-10 catalyst. A series of tin exchanged tungstophosphoric acid (20 % w/w) supported on montmorillonite K-10 clay (Snx-TPA/K-10, where x = 0.5–1.5) were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by using XRD, FT-IR, UV-VIS, titration and SEM techniques. Among various catalysts, Sn1-TPA/K-10 was found to be the most active catalyst for butyl levulinate synthesis. Two different clay supports and varying tin loadings were used to study the effects on surface acidity as well as catalytic activity in butyl levulinate synthesis. Effects of different reaction parameters were studied and optimized to get high yields of butyl levulinate. Under mild reaction conditions at 110 °C, complete conversion of furfuryl alcohol with 98 % selectivity to butyl levulinate was achieved. The prepared catalyst could be recycled at least five times without significant loss of activity. The overall process is green and clean. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalyst waste from the residue fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) plant process can still be utilized to catalyze the catalytic cracking of palm oil to fuels. However, we should regenerate the active sites of the catalyst waste. This paper focuses on enhancement of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites on the spent RFCC catalyst waste through various acid treatments in order to regenerate its catalyst active sites. In order to regenerate the Brønsted and the Lewis acid sites as active sites in the palm oil catalytic cracking, the spent RFCC catalyst was treated by citric acid, sulfuric acid, and mixture of both acids. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller-Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, and pyridine-FTIR analysis. The modified catalyst performance was tested over a fixed bed reactor for the catalytic cracking process of palm oil to liquid fuels. It was found that the acid treatment on the spent RFCC catalyst can increase surface area, pore volume, and Brønsted to Lewis acid site ratio of catalysts. The Brønsted acid sites of the spent RFCC catalyst strongly increase by the treatment using sulfuric acid, which is because of the proton transfer from acid to catalyst and because of the formation of sulfate groups (HOSO3-) in the catalysts. It was found that the Brønsted acid site leads to the formation of long-chain hydrocarbon, while the Lewis acid site pronounces the formation of short-chain hydrocarbon and coke. Moreover, the total acidity and the Lewis acid site amount on the catalyst have roles in the formation of hydrocarbon fraction in the liquid product. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ligand-protected metal nanoparticles are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis and biomass upgrading. Thiolate surfactants can greatly improve the overall yield; however, the dynamics of the reacting species and the reaction mechanism have remained unknown at the molecular scale. We elucidated the interaction of a series of aromatic compounds with octadecylthiolate-modified palladium nanocatalysts in atomic detail and explain large increases in product selectivity and yield through a detailed reaction mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal adsorption free energies on the order of -5 kcal/mol on the ligand-modified nanoparticles, which are significantly smaller than those on bare metal surfaces, where -10 to -30 kcal/mol are found. The ligands induce a two-step process of condensation in the ligand shell and adsorption, leading to upright molecular orientations, in contrast to single-step adsorption on bare metal surfaces. Exothermic condensation into the ligand shell and binding to the metal surface are accompanied by large entropy losses due to the reduced mobility in the ligand shell and increased confinement of the alkyl chains. Results from molecular dynamics simulations using the interface force field (IFF) show impressive agreement with available thermochemical reference data from experiments. Upright orientations of aromatic alcohol reactants lower the activation energy for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction and suppress competing decarbonylation reactions. The analysis of the HDO reaction mechanism by QM/MM calculations in the presence of the ligands as well as by DFT calculations under vacuum uncovers the acidic and basic properties of hydrogenated Pd surfaces. The rate-limiting step involves the transfer of Pd-bound hydrogen atoms to hydroxyl groups in the alcohol reactants. The mechanism explains prior experimental data and supports the rational design of metal and alloy catalysts of specific shape, ligand coverage, and reaction conditions for biomass upgrading.

AB  - Selectively converting biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) into biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) via hydrogenolysis route is one of significant transformations in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, which is generally performed over supported noble catalysts and/or under harsh conditions such as high temperature (above 423 K, even achieving 533 K) and H2 pressure (1–4 MPa). Herein, non-noble metal (i.e., Co) supported on siliceous *BEA zeolite with open channel systems (Co/Beta-DA) is innovatively proposed for this hydrogenolysis reaction based on strong metal-support interaction. The micro-environment and particle size of metallic Co species were closely related to calcination temperature during the preparation of Co/Beta-DA. The Co species existed in the form of CoOx on the zeolite surface or stabilized inside the zeolite pores as well as isolated Co sites within zeolite framework after calcination (above 723 K), which were reduced by hydrogen to corresponding metallic Co species. It was confirmed that this prepared sample with 20 wt % content of Co, calcined at 723 K, was an efficient catalyst for HMF hydrogenolysis to DMF under mild conditions (423 K, 1.5 MPa H2, 3.0 h), giving an excellent DMF productivity of 1.108 h–1. Thus, this contribution provides new insights for rationally constructing non-noble-based zeolite catalyst for the transformation of biomass into renewable liquid biofuels under mild conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to enhance the yield of high quality biodiesel form diseased swine fat, the ultrasound-assisted two-step catalyzed process was employed. First, three-dimensional ultrasound-assisted concentrated sulfuric acid pre-esterification experiment was carried out. Then, the transesterification reaction catalyzed by KOH was performed, and four parameters (catalyst concentration, reaction time, methanol/oil molar ratio and reaction temperature) were optimized using response surface methodology. The results showed that the optimal transesterification reaction conditions were catalyst concentration of 1.11 wt%, reaction temperature of 62.3 °C, methanol/oil molar ratio of 7.42:1, and reaction time of 116.14 min. The most significant factor affecting biodiesel purity was identified as catalyst concentration. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum biodiesel purity reached to 98% with the reaction time of 176.14 min, shortened by 63.3% compared with previous works. Furthermore, most of the biodiesel properties agreed the quality requirements established by Official Regulations of GB/25199-2017 of China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pretreatment is one of the most important steps in the production of bioethanol from renewable feedstocks like lignocellulosic biomass, however, existing pretreatment approaches have some limitations. In this context, two different acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) i.e. alkylsulfonic acid (Fe3O4-MNPs@Si@AS) and butylcarboxylic acid (Fe3O4-MNPs@Si@BCOOH) were synthesized and evaluated for their efficacy at different concentration in the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse. It was observed that both of these acid-functionalized MNPs showed concentration-dependent promising catalytic activity as compared to conventional acid pretreatment. Both Fe3O4-MNPs@Si@AS and Fe3O4-MNPs@Si@BCOOH at 500 mg/g of bagasse showed the maximum amount of sugar (xylose) liberated i.e. 18.83 g/L and 18.67 g/L, respectively which are comparatively higher than the normal acid pretreatment (15.40 g/L) and untreated sample (0.28 g/L). Further, both the acid-functionalized MNPs used were recovered by applying magnetic field and reused for next two subsequent cycles of pretreatment. Therefore, such nanotechnology-based approaches can be used as a rapid and eco-friendly alternative method for the pretreatment of a variety of lignocellulosic materials. Moreover, the reuse of the same MNPs for more than one cycle of pretreatment can also help to reduce the cost involved in the process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, lithium/zinc based chicken bone catalyst (Li/Zn-Cb) was synthesised by wet impregnation method using different metal ratios (Li:Zn = 1:2, 2:2, and 2:1). The synthesised Li/Zn-Cb catalyst was characterized by FESEM, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), TG-DSC and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The feasibility and activity of Li/Zn-Cb catalyst for transesterification of waste canola oil (WCO) were investigated under different operating conditions. The results showed that integrating the chicken bone powder with Li:Zn = 2:2 could enhance the FAME content significantly (&gt; 4 folds) to 98% at 60 °C reaction temperature, 3.5 h reaction time, catalyst dosage of 4% and 18:1 molar ratio of MeOH/WCO. The kinetic studies revealed that transesterification reaction follows the pseudo first order model with 23.20 kJ mol−1 activation energy (Ea). The reusability studies show only 2% reduction in the FAME content after the 7th cycle of use. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a green and sustainable energy, which is a fatty acid alkyl ester as an alternative to petroleum diesel. In the work, phoenix tree seed oil, one kind of undeveloped woody plant resource, was used as the novel raw material for biodiesel preparation. Several free liquid lipases were used as biocatalysts to catalyze the transesterification of phoenix tree seed oil (PTSO) with methanol. Effects of transesterification variables (enzyme load, substrate ratio, transesterification time and temperature) on biodiesel preparation were evaluated and optimized using RSM. Results showed that PTSO was a good alternative for biodiesel preparation. Among these tested free liquid lipases, lipozyme TL100L from Thermomyces laguginosus showed the best performance for the transesterification. Transesterification variables were optimized and the maximum biodiesel yield (98.8 ± 1.1%) was achieved under the optimal conditions (enzyme load 10%, transesterification temperature 30 °C, substrate ratio (PTSO to methanol) 1:5 (mol/mol) and reaction time 6.98 h). The activation energy of biodiesel formation was 21.3 kJ/mol. Kinetic parameters K’m and Vmax were 2.55 × 10−1 mol/L and 6.9 × 10−3 mol/(L·min), respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the combustion, performance, and emissions of a six-cylinder turbocharged common-rail dimethyl ether engine with biodiesel blends were experimentally investigated. The proportions of biodiesel were 0% (B0), 5% (B5), 10% (B10), 15% (B15) and 20% (B20) by weight, and the effect of the engine load was considered. The results indicate that a higher EGR rate increases the ignition delay and combustion duration. The peak rate of heat release increases as the EGR rate increases at low loads but decreases at high loads. The present investigation shows that the EGR strategy is effective for suppressing NOx formation and the NOx emissions approximately linearly decrease as the EGR rate increases. The retardation of the combustion phase by external EGR effectively reduces the rate of pressure increase. The effect of the biodiesel proportion on the combustion and performance of an engine is complex, and the B5 blend showed the shortest ignition delay and the highest brake thermal efficiency. The influence of the biodiesel proportion on the EGR is not obvious. The disadvantages of EGR and biodiesel addition include the resultant increases in the CO and HC emissions and the particle number concentration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is one of the most popular hot drinks in the world and might represent an opportunity for energetic valorization after its consumption. Alkaline pretreatment appears to be a potential strategy for unlocking cellulosic biofuels. Thereby, in this study, four alkaline agents were evaluated for improving yerba mate anaerobic digestion (AD): (1) sodium hydroxide (NaOH); (2) potassium hydroxide (KOH); (3) lime; and (4) sodium bicarbonate. Complete factorial design with center point repetition was chosen to evaluate all combinations of concentration of alkali (50, 125, and 200 galkaline agent kg−1dry yerba mate), reaction time (12.2, 30.1, and 48 h) and temperature (30, 65, and 100 °C) in carbohydrate solubilization (variable response). Pre-treatment harshness was quantified by the modified severity factor (MSF). The methane production potential was determined for the best pretreatment condition achieved for each alkali tested. Energy balance for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed treatments on net energy gain was performed. NaOH and KOH had the same effect on organic matter solubilization and produced the same optimum value for the MSF. Thermal-alkaline pretreatment of yerba mate can increase the methane yield up to seven-fold as compared to control (maximum cumulated methane yield of 700 N-LCH4.Kg-VS−1added). All of the alkalis evaluated in the yerba mate pretreatment improved the kinetics of the AD process (kh; from 1e−5 to 1e−1 d−1). NaOH pretreatment at its highest levels of alkali concentration and temperature and lowest level of reaction time was found to be the best scenario in terms of net energy gain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The composite catalysts were synthesized with SiC powder and ZSM-5 and were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, pyridine-infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The catalysts showed a high heating rate and excellent catalytic performance for pyrolysis vapors, and the product fractional distribution and chemical compositions of bio-oil in a tandem system (microwave pyrolysis and microwave ex-situ catalytic reforming) was examined. Experimental results confirmed the quality of bio-oil produced by the microwave-induced catalytic reforming was better than that product through electric heating. Additionally, 36.94 wt% of bio-oil was obtained using the catalyst with 20%ZSM-5/SiC under the following conditions: feed-to-catalyst ratio, 2:1; pyrolysis temperature, 550 °C; and catalytic temperature, 350 °C. The selectivities of hydrocarbons reached up to 75.88%. After five cycles, the activity of the regenerated composite catalyst was retained at 95% of the original catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An innovative route for the synthesis of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) is presented herein, which relies on the use of the fluidized bed technology and commercial γ-alumina as a catalyst, for the first time. Specifically, sugar beet pulp, which is the solid by-product of sugar beet industry, has been successfully tested for the synthesis of self-functionalized carbon nanoparticles under mild conditions of temperature (300 °C) and time (30 min). Different techniques including TEM, UV–vis, fluorescence, Raman and XPS spectroscopy have been applied to characterize the as-prepared CQDs. The formation of CQDs on γ-alumina is discussed and a possible mechanism is proposed. A solid biofuel is also obtained as a co-product of the process. The innovative finding that a catalyst can be used to produce CQDs from the volatiles driven off the biomass by heating opens up new possibilities of valorisation for the off-gas substream coming from other biomass conversion processes (e.g., torrefaction). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an economically attractive strategy for avoiding carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from, e.g., power plants to the atmosphere. The combination of CCS and biomass combustion would result in a reduction of atmospheric CO2, or net negative emissions, as plant growth is a form of sequestration of atmospheric carbon. Carbon capture can be achieved in a variety of ways, one of which is chemical looping. Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping gasification (CLG) are two promising technologies for conversion of biomass to heat and power or syngas/methane with carbon capture. There have been significant advances made with respect to CLC in the last two decades for all types of fuel, with much less research on the gasification technology. CLG offers some interesting opportunities for production of biofuels together with carbon capture and may have several advantages with respect to the bench mark indirect gasification process or dual-bed fluidized bed (DFBG) in this respect. In CLG, an oxygen carrier is used as a bed material instead of sand, which is common in indirect gasification, and this could have several advantages: (i) all generated CO2 is present together with the syngas or methane in the fuel reactor outlet stream, thus in a concentrated stream, viable for separation and capture; (ii) the air reactor (or combustion chamber) should largely be free from trace impurities, thus preventing corrosion and fouling in this reactor; and (iii) the highly oxidizing conditions in the fuel reactor together with solid oxide surfaces should be advantageous with respect to limiting formation of tar species. In this study, two manganese ores and an iron-based waste material, LD slag, were investigated with respect to performance in these chemical-looping technologies. The materials were also impregnated with alkali (K) in order to gauge possible catalytic effects and also to establish a better understanding of the general behavior of oxygen carriers with alkali, an important component in biomass and biomass waste streams and often a precursor for high-temperature corrosion. The viability of the oxygen carriers was investigated using a synthetic biogas in a batch fluidized bed reactor. The conversion of CO, H2, CH4, and C2H4 was investigated in the temperature interval 800–950 °C. The reactivity, or oxygen transfer rate, was highest for the manganese ores, followed by the LD slag. The conversion of C2H4 was generally high but could largely be attributed to thermal decomposition. The K-impregnated samples showed enhanced reactivity during combustion conditions, and the Mangagran-K sample was able to achieve full conversion of benzene. The interaction of the solid material with alkali showed widely different behavior. The two manganese ores retained almost all alkali after redox testing, albeit exhibiting different migration patterns inside the particles. LD slag lost most alkali to the gas phase during testing, although some remained, possibly explaining a small difference in reactivity. In summary, the CLC and CLG processes could clearly be interesting for production of heat, power, or biofuel with negative CO2 emissions. Manganese ores are most promising from this study, as they could absorb alkali, giving a better conversion and perhaps also inhibiting or limiting corrosion mechanisms in a combustor or gasifier. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Three dual-fuel strategies, i.e. Strategy S (syngas-biodiesel), Strategy U (upgraded syngas-biodiesel), and Strategy D (DME-biodiesel), for utilization of syngas and biodiesel from biomass wastes in internal combustion engines have been proposed in this study. To compare both the combustion and emission performance of the three strategies, an integrated KIVA4-CHEMKIN CFD platform was constructed implementing a newly combined reaction mechanism. Effects of three dual-fuel strategies have been compared against each other in terms of indicated power, NOx and soot emission. At different engine loads, it was found that the indicated power of all strategies increased with the increasing supplement ratio. Strategy S and Strategy U predict higher indicated power than Strategy D at the high engine load, while lower indicated power than Strategy D at the low engine load. As regards to the NOx emission, an increase in the fuel supplement ratio increases the NOx emission (g/kWh) for both Strategy S and Strategy U at high engine loads, while decreases the NOx emission (g/kWh) due to the enhanced indicated power. Strategy D has relatively higher NOx emission (g/kWh) than Strategy S and Strategy U at all loads. With the increase in fuel supplement ratio, the soot emission generally shows a decreasing trend at all engine loads for all strategies, and Strategy D emits less soot than Strategy S and Strategy U in the cases of high fuel supplement ratio (>0.4) for all engine load conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agave bagasse is a lignocellulosic agroindustrial waste suitable for biofuel production. This study aimed to compare biological, enzymatic, chemical, and hydrothermal pretreatments applied to Agave bagasse in terms of solubilization of carbohydrates (CHO) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), as well as the biochemical methane potential (BMP) from hydrolyzates. Most pretreatments behave similarly, with an average yield of 0.16 ± 0.02 gCOD/g, only the chemical pretreatment overcame this yield by a factor of 2.6 with a CHO/COD ratio of 0.95. The concentrations of inhibitors – furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, and phenols – were higher in the chemical hydrolyzates than in the biological and enzymatic hydrolyzates. BMP from most hydrolyzates was the same, on average 219 ± 15 mL/gCODin, hydrolyzates differentiate only in terms of lag phase and the methane production rates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, much attention has been paid to microbial lipids as promising raw materials for biodiesel production. The use of industrial by-products as carbon sources seems to be a feasible strategy for cost-effective lipid fermentation with oleaginous microorganisms on a large scale. In this work, biodiesel-derived crude glycerol was used as a renewable feedstock for microbial lipid production. Chemical characterization has shown that used crude glycerol sample is mainly composed of 64.5 % glycerol, 5.9 % methanol, 11 % water and 5.8 % ash in addition to other impurities. This industrial waste was used as only carbon source in the culture media of 13 oleaginous yeast strains. Candida viswanathii Y-E4 stood out above the other strains, achieving a higher amount of biomass and lipid content (17.2 g/L and 41 %, respectively). Culture conditions were optimized using response surface methodology to enhance the Y-E4 lipid yield. Box-Behnken model was performed to determine the optimum levels of three independent variables and the eventual effect of their interactions on the response. Under optimal conditions, the total biomass of 26.6 g/L with lipid content of 51.9 % (corresponding to a lipid yield of 13.6 g/L) could be achieved after 166 h of culture. The characterization of obtained lipid showed that fatty acids composition and lipid profile were very different between pure and crude glycerol based cultures, with a predominance of long-chain fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid (45 %). The predictive determination of biodiesel properties suggests that this oil may effectively be used for biodiesel manufacture. The current study, therefore, opens new perspectives in relation to the valorization of biodiesel-derived crude glycerol, through completely eco-friendly processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of microwave heating (MH) constitutes a promising way to upgrade biodiesel via catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) catalyzed by Raney-Ni. However, mechanistic reports on this reaction are rare and the mechanisms involved in CTH process remains unclear. Herein, we presented a thorough mechanistic study of CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel catalyzed by Raney-Ni under MH, using isopropyl alcohol as hydrogen donor and water as solvent. The intensification effect under microwave radiation has been studied from three aspects of catalyst, water, and hydrogen donor. It was found that microwave made an adverse effect on the activity of Raney-Ni. The solvent of water could provide hydrogen to some extent for the CTH of biodiesel, and the influence of Raney-Ni from microwave radiation had a positive role for the water to provide hydrogen during CTH reaction. Under microwave irradiation, the activity of isopropyl alcohol would be enhanced, and the transfer of hydrogen atoms from hydrogen donors to hydrogen acceptors became easy. Based on the characterization of catalyst by SEM, XRD, FTIR and TGA, it was found that the reason for the catalyst deactivation was mainly the carbonaceous deposits of fatty acid methanol esters (FAMEs) on the surface of the catalyst. A schematic representation of mechanism of microwave-assisted CTH has been presented. Furthermore, combining theory of heterogeneous catalytic process with mechanism of six-membered cyclic transition state, the reaction course for the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel under microwave heating has been explained successfully. Lastly, the performance improvement of the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel was briefly analyzed in view of composition change of biodiesel. Overall, our results provide a systematic understanding of CTH of biodiesel catalyzed by Raney-Ni under microwave heating, and our findings help to develop a green technology for the upgrading of biodiesel in industry. © 2019

AB  - In this study, calcium titanate nano-particles (CaTiO3 NPs) were synthesized through solution combustion synthesis (SCS) by using Ochrocarpus longifolius leaves extract as a novel fuel. The CaTiO3 NPs were successfully utilized in the biodiesel synthesis from dairy waste scum oil (DWSO) as a heterogeneous base catalyst. The synthesized CaTiO3 NPs were characterized by SEM, XRD, TEM, BET, FT-IR and CO2-TPD. Response surface methodology (RSM) in arrangement with central composite design (CCD) was utilized to determine the optimum conditions for biodiesel production by varying catalyst loading, molar ratio and reaction time. The maximum 97.7% yield of dairy waste scum oil methyl ester (DWSOME/biodiesel) was obtained for a molar ratio (methanol to DWSO) of 9:1, 1.80 wt% catalyst loading and 45 min reaction time with constant temperature (65 °C) and stirring speed (650 rpm). The CaTiO3 NPs shows a good catalytic stability up to five cycles with a low loss of yield. The kinetic study of biodiesel production fit well to pseudo-first order reaction. For transesterification reaction, the 35.56 kJ/mol of activation energy (Ea) was found. Finally, the DWSOME was characterized by 1H NMR and the fuel properties were also determined and were in the range of ASTM standards. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalysts are critical materials for biodiesel production using sewage sludge feedstock. In this research, different SO42−/Al2O3–SnO2 catalysts were prepared and characterized. The catalysts prepared at different conditions were characterized through Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), NH3 adsorption FT-IR, and TGA. Then, esterification/transesterification reaction was performed with the lipid extracted from sewage sludge to verify the activity of these catalysts. Results showed that the catalysts with n(Al):n(Sn) = 1:10 prepared by 79 wt% H2SO4 possessed the best physical properties with a large number of active catalytic sites, which led to the biodiesel yield of 73.3% (based on dried extracted crude fat) under the optimized reaction conditions at 130 °C as reaction temperature, 0.8 g as catalyst loading for lipids extracted from 10 g freeze-dried sludge, 4 h as reaction time. Catalysts characterization results showed that acidity, acid sites and Al/Sn molar ratio play an important role in the activity of catalysts. The thermal properties showed that 450 °C was the suitable calcination temperature for catalyst preparation. The optimized SO42−/Al2O3–SnO2 catalyst in this research will have a bright future in the field of sludge production of biodiesel. © 2019

AB  - The direct conversion of levulinic acid (LA) to valeric biofuel is highly promising for the development of biorefineries. Herein, LA is converted into valeric acid (VA) via one-pot direct cascade conversion over non-noble metal-based Nb-doped Cu on Zr-doped porous silica (Nb-Cu/ZPS). Under mild reaction conditions (150 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 for 4 h), LA was completely converted into VA in high yield (99.8%) in aqueous medium with a high turnover frequency of 0.038 h-1. The Lewis acid sites of ZPS enhanced the adsorption of LA on the catalyst surface, and both the Lewis and Brønsted acidity associated with Nb2O5 and the metallic Cu0 sites promoted catalysis of the cascade hydrogenation, ring cyclization, ring-opening, and hydrogenation reactions to produce VA from LA. The bimetallic Nb-Cu/ZPS catalyst was also effective for the conversion of VA into various valeric esters in C1-C5 alcohol media. The presence of Nb2O5 effectively suppressed metal leaching and coke formation, which are serious issues in the liquid-phase conversion of highly acidic LA during the reaction. The catalyst could be used for up to five consecutive cycles with marginal loss of activity, even without catalyst re-activation. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The main objective of the present paper comprises the investigation of biodiesel production from low-cost feedstock such as lard oil and waste cooking oil (WCO) using Sr–Al double oxides. Nanocatalyst was characterised FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, BET and XPS. The Sr:Al with 3:1 M ratio showed the best catalytic activity in the conversion of both oils to fatty acid methyl ester. The effect of acetone and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a co-solvent for transesterification were compared and the best result was obtained with 5% THF. The mutual effect of the nanocatalyst and co-solvent on biodiesel production was investigated. The characterisation of biodiesel synthesised from lard oil and WCO was performed with GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR. Moreover, the optimum reaction parameters for transesterification reaction was analysed and the yield was determined by 1H NMR. The maximum yield of 99.7% and 99.4% of lard oil methyl ester and WCO biodiesel were observed with a 0.9 wt% catalyst amount, 1:5.5 oil to methanol ratio in a reaction time of 45 min at 50 °C and 60 °C, respectively. The properties of biodiesel from lard oil and WCO were determined by the EN 14214 method. The regeneration, characterisation and reusability of regenerated catalyst was observed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wet lipid extraction combined with residual biomass anaerobic digestion are alternatives to reduce the overall energy consumption of biodiesel production from microalgae. Solvents with different polarities have been studied to assess dry and wet lipid extraction process from Isochrysis galbana microalga. Ethyl acetate (EA) and a chloroform:methanol (CM) mixture yielded the best lipid extraction results in the dry and wet route with suitable lipid compositions. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) conversion of dry and wet extracted lipids with these solvents was performed by using both homogeneous (H2SO4) and heterogeneous (resin CT 269) catalysts. FAME production from wet extracted lipids with the EA solvent using the CT-269 resin constitutes an advantageous process because it avoids the water elimination step, and the CT-269 is a heterogeneous commercial catalyst, readily to separate after reaction. Lipid-spent microalga was anaerobically digested, obtaining that waste biomass from the wet extraction with EA had the highest methane yield (310 mL CH4/g volatile solids (VS). Energy balance analysis for FAMEs production with EA solvent (wet route) and heterogeneous catalyst yielded an energy recovery of about 80% in terms of biodiesel and biogas. Therefore, this process constitutes a promising route under an energy-driven microalga biorefinery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolytic production of Fe-enriched composite biochar is receiving increasing attention. However, understanding of the environmental risk from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) potentially generated during composite biochar production is lacking. This study investigated the formation of PAHs from the pyrolysis of barley straw impregnated with FeCl3 or Fe(NO3)3 at 350 °C, 500 °C, and 650 °C. The total amount of PAHs formation increased with increasing heating temperature. Most of the PAHs were concentrated in bio-oil (72.7–94.6%), with only a small fraction retained in biochar (1.7–11.1%) and in biogas (2.2–16.2%). Preloading FeCl3 or Fe(NO3)3 onto the biomass greatly reduced PAH formation by up to 33% and 21%, respectively, compared to that obtained with biomass alone. The suppressed formation of PAHs was due to the generation of more reductive forms of Fe, such as Fe0 and FeO, in the O2-starved pyrolysis atmosphere, which reduced C2H2 and C6H5OH, two important PAH precursors in hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition reactions. Although Fe loading reduced the amounts of PAHs in biochar, the toxic equivalent value increased because Fe induced more accumulation of high-molecular-weight PAHs in the biochar. This study proved that Fe loading suppresses PAH generation during biomass pyrolysis, which can guide the design of composite biochar production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Amylase is an important industrially useful enzyme with various applications, widely explored for their applications in food and biofuel industries. In this study, seventeen actinomycetes strains were isolated from the soil sample and screened for amylase biosynthesis. Among the 17 isolates, nine actinomycetes showed activity on starch agar plates. The strain Al-Dhabi-46 showed more hydrolytic zone (19 mm) on starch agar plates. It was identified by biochemical characters and 18S rDNA sequencing and characterized as Streptomyces sp. Al-Dhabi-46. Amylase production was found to be maximum after 5 days of incubation (108 ± 4.1 U/ml) and at pH 8.0 (118.1 ± 2.3 U/ml) and at 40 °C (124 ± 12.1 U/ml). Amylase synthesis was high in the medium containing starch (208 ± 11.4 U/ml). Amylase production was 241 ± 18.1 U/ml in the culture medium supplemented with beef extract and 0.1% Mn2+ ions significantly enhanced amylase production. The molecular weight of purified amylase from Streptomyces sp. Al-Dhabi-46 was 44 kDa. Amylase was highly active up to pH 8.0 and at 40 °C. Amylase activity was enhanced by the addition of Mn2+ at 10 mM concentrations. Purified amylase from Streptomyces sp. Al-Dhabi-46 digested cassava starch at 25% and 55%, 78% and 95.4% level after 15 min, 30 min, 45 min and 60 min of enzymatic reaction. Enhanced production of amylase enzyme from the Streptomyces sp. Al-Dhabi-46 attract for the production of industrially important products. © 2019

AB  - Mounting environmental concerns have given rise to an increasing focus on renewable energies like biofuels. In 2018, three countries – China, the United States, and India – together emitted almost half (50.3%) of the world's CO2 emissions (billion metric tons). The current study aims to forecast biofuels’ production, consumption, and self-sufficiency in these top CO2 emitting countries using a novel grey forecasting model. The study improves on an existing grey forecasting model by optimizing the model architecture (data accumulation operation and background value generation). The proposed forecasting model, EGM (1,1,α,θ), is a generalized form of the even form of the grey forecasting model, and its relative performance turned out to be generally superior to that of the original model. The comparative analyses of the proposed model with two forecasting models revealed that the new model's forecast accuracy is generally better than those of others. The study finds, achieving self-sufficiency in both biofuels (fuel ethanol and biodiesel) would remain a challenge for China, while the United States and India would maintain their self-sufficiency in ethanol and biodiesel, respectively, at least till 2028. The study also argues that biofuel is more likely to be a complementary fuel rather than an alternative fuel. The study helps us understand how, in the next decade, the landscapes of biofuel production and consumption are changing, and concludes with significant policy implications. © 2020

AB  - The acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) is considered as a promising biofuel to partially substitute the diesel fuel. In this paper, the optical constant volume combustion chamber was used to record the chamber pressure, and measured the soot mass and distribution for ABE and diesel blends. Then, the CFD KIVA-3V code coupled with the CANTERA was used to simulate the formation and oxidation processes of soot during the spray combustion. In addition, the CFD simulation cases for pure diesel and ABE20 were comprehensively validated against the experimental data under different initial ambient oxygen concentrations. Finally, a series of CFD cases were performed to investigate the effects of different ABE/diesel blends (up to 50% by volume), different initial ambient temperatures (mimic the traditional combustion and low temperature combustion modes) and oxygen concentrations (represent the free, low and high EGR conditions) on the combustion and soot formation characteristics under the diesel engine-relevant conditions. The results indicated that with the increase of ABE ratio in the ABE/diesel blends, the combustion pressure and heat release rate decreased and the combustion phase was delayed, the combustion temperature distribution was more uniform, while the flame lift-off length was increased gradually. In addition, the soot mass was decreased and its corresponding generation rate was also decreased with increasing the ABE ratio in blends. Furthermore, high concentration of soot mainly distributed in the temperature range of 1800–2000 K and the equivalent ratio range of 1.8–2.0. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The industrial revolution has caused a tremendous impact on our modern way of life. It shapes the economic, social and culture of many modern societies around the world. However, the world's heavy dependence on fossil fuels has exacerbated the effect of modernisation, causing a detrimental effect to the world climate. Recently, the scientific community has shifted their focus to the valorisation of lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable and clean source of energy. Lignocellulosic biomass is a potential substitute for fossil fuel as it could be transformed to various bio-energy and bio-based products by biorefineries. However, the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic biomass hinders the commercialisation at large scale due to the processing difficulties and economically not viable. Hence, ultrasound has been utilised as an auxiliary energy to intensify pretreatments as well as biorefinery processes in the productions of bio-fuels and fine chemicals. In this review, the background information of lignocellulosic biomass and ultrasound is provided. Furthermore, the applications of ultrasound as a complement to existing pretreatments and bioprocessing technologies are discussed by highlighting the importance of mechanoacoustic and sonochemical effect produced by the ultrasound. Lastly, technoeconomic analysis and socioeconomic impact of utilising ultrasound in the biomass processing are elaborated to provide a holistic view on the novel and environmentally friendly green technique. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated the utilisation of biomass wastes as catalyst supports by comparing the catalytic performance of papaya seed, empty fruit bunch (EFB) and corncob biomass waste derived carbon based acid catalysts applied for biodiesel production through esterification reaction of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and methanol. Arylation of 4-benzenediazonium sulfonate synthesis method was able to sulfonate the catalyst support efficiently. The activated carbon (AC) synthesised possessed high porosity with surface area ranged between 639.68 and 972.66 m2/g. The effect of catalyst synthesising condition including carbonisation temperature (600–1000 °C), sulfonation time (0.5–2.5 h) and sulfanilic acid to AC weight ratio (3:1–13:1) towards the FAME yield and free fatty acid (FFA) conversion were evaluated. At the optimum catalyst synthesis conditions, corncob waste derived sulfonated AC catalyst exhibited the highest FAME yield and FFA conversion of 72.09% and 93.49%, respectively. Reusability study showed that corncob waste derived sulfonated AC catalyst was able to achieve relatively high FAME yield at the first two reaction cycles. The esterification reaction followed the irreversible pseudo-homogeneous reaction model. The high catalytic efficiency of the catalyst had shown its high potential to fit into the cost-effective and sustainable framework for biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipase-catalyzed transesterification for biodiesel production is clean, effective and water tolerance compare with conventional chemical or physical biodiesel synthesis methods. Therefore, in the present research, Burkholderia cepacia lipase was immobilized onto mesoporous silica/iron oxide magnetic core-shell nanoparticles for canola waste cooking oil (WCO) conversion to biodiesel. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to optimize the transesterification parameters. A quadratic polynomial equation was obtained for biodiesel yield by multiple regression analysis. Desirability function approach gave the optimal transesterification condition as: immobilized lipase concentration of 36%, reaction time of 25 h, methanol to WCO molar ratio of 6.2 and reaction temperature of 34 °C. The predicted biodiesel yield was 92% at the optimal condition. Transesterification catalyzed by the immobilized lipase carried out three times repeatedly, by losing just 11% of lipase activity in the third cycle of the transesterification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Plastics in many forms have been regarded as one of the most polluting material in the modern world. Therefore, a study has been conducted to check the effectiveness of catalyst-fly ash and zeolite on the production of biofuel from plastics as an attempt to contribute in the reduction of plastic waste pollution to the environment. A lab scale plastic pyrolysis plant has been constructed and feed particle size of 3 ± 1.5 cm2 were used as raw materials. The samples were tested in the pyrolysis plant at about 500 ± 30 °C with and without the presence of catalyst. The catalyst loading ratio of 1:10 catalyst to feed is applied. The result shows that plastic pyrolysis (bottle) without any catalysts have the highest liquid fraction yield with an average yield of 24% while those with catalyst has lower yield (16–22%). Carry bags with zeolite catalyst yield liquid fraction of 22% at a conversion rate of 47%. The inclusion of catalyst has lowered the yield but has produce oil yield of superior quality compared with the samples without catalyst. Engine characteristics study showed that blend fuel D80PO20 (80:20 diesel: plastic pyrolytic oil) have shown similar cylinder pressure during combustion with diesel. Higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake specific energy consumption were also observed from the engine testing using the blend fuel. The blend fuel has lower hydrocarbon emissions while oxides of nitrogen reduces by 19% and 26% compared to pure diesel and PPO respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To upgrade the algae pyrolytic oil, the influence of algae components on co-pyrolysis with LDPE were studied, with Spirulina platensis (SP), Nannochloropsis sp. (NS) and Enteromorpha Prolifera (EP) as typical algae samples, as they are enriched with proteins, lipids and carbohydrate, respectively, especially, the N and O transformation behavior during the co-pyrolysis was studied in depth. During co-pyrolysis, the interaction on products depended on the components of algae. EP and SP were prior to form CO2, rather than CO. For pyrolytic oil, co-pyrolysis effectively inhibited the formation of N- and O-compounds, but promoted the generation of long-chain alcohol and formic/acetic ester. And the obvious decrease of N and O content in co-pyrolytic oil was observed. However, the rich lipids in NS resulted in the improvement of N yield in pyrolytic oil during co-pyrolysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapors from wheat straw over Na2CO3 impregnated γ-Al2O3 was studied as a promising route to biofuels. The Na species were homogenously distributed on the support and created a basicity of ~0.02 mmol CO2/g catalyst, at 80% lower catalyst acidity. Analytical pyrolysis using a micro-pyrolyzer showed that Na-Al2O3 particularly decreased the yield of acids via ketonization, which was confirmed by feeding carboxylic acid model compounds. The presence of Na decreased the coke yield and catalyzed the coke combustion, decreasing the combustion temperature by ~100 °C. Subsequently, 100 g Na-Al2O3 catalyst was tested in an ablative bench scale fast pyrolysis unit where ~5 kg of wheat straw was pyrolyzed and the vapors passed the catalytic reactor during six reaction/regeneration cycles. In agreement with the micro-pyrolyzer results, Na-Al2O3 was highly effective in reducing the acidity of the bio-oils. Total acid numbers (TAN) as low as ~1–4 mg KOH/g could be maintained up to high B:C ratios of ~13. For a given TAN, this allowed operating to higher B:C ratios and provided higher oil yields compared to using acidic catalysts such as γ-Al2O3 and HZSM-5 zeolite for vapor treatment. At bio-oil energy recoveries of ~60–70% relative to raw bio-oil, the deoxygenation was comparable to the acidic catalysts. Operation to higher B:C ratios allowed increasing the energy recovery to ~85% relative to the non-treated bio-oil while still obtaining a good deoxygenation performance of ~60%. Despite the hydrothermal conditions during reaction and oxidative regeneration, the activity of Na-Al2O3 was regained by coke combustion, the Na remained well dispersed on the support, and the catalyst maintained its capacity for CO2 adsorption at 500 °C after six reaction/regeneration cycles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Valorization of algal biomass is often limited by its low lipid content. Here, different alcohols: ethanol, isopropanol, and glycerol, were studied as co-solvents to improve the conversion efficiency of a lipid-poor microalgae, Galdieria sulphuraria, by hydrothermal liquefaction. Bio-crude oil yield increases, from 13 to 73 wt% (on dry algae basis), were attributed to the alcohols facilitating the transfer of algal protein-derived fragments from the aqueous phase into the oil phase. A series of characterization results showed that bio-crude oil formation was mainly the result of alcohols reacting with algal fragments via Maillard reactions, alkylation, and esterification, respectively. Insights into the synergistic effect of low-lipid feed and alcohol provide mechanistic support for choosing an alcohol-rich waste, crude glycerol, to improve bio-crude oil production from HTL of wastewater-grown G. sulphuraria. Promising improvements in yield and energy recovery indicates competitive economics for a low-lipid biomass waste-to-biofuel conversion technique. © 2020

AB  - A major obstacle in the commercialization of biodiesel is its susceptibility to oxidation when exposed to air and light. Approaches to improving the oxidative stability of biofuels include the addition of antioxidants, mixing of vegetable oils or modification of the fatty ester profile. This work aimed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of biodiesel synthesized from Tilapia oil and its oxidative degradation process after addition of both natural ethanolic extract of turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn.) and synthetics butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA), butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT), propyl gallate (PG) antioxidants. In addition, some thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were obtained in order to determine the activation energy during the biodiesel oxidation process from different temperatures. The physicochemical properties of biodiesel obtained after the addition of antioxidants are in accordance with current regulations, which suggests it as an excellent alternative source for the biofuel industry. The oxidative stability showed that the natural antioxidant has the best response in control of oxidative process compared to the other synthetic antioxidants. The kinetic study showed the addition of natural antioxidant to biodiesel increases the activation energy (Ea) hindering its oxidation process. These results reveal an improvement in biodiesel stability corresponding to an increase over 450%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The solid waste from papermaking factory, lime mud (LM), was previously demonstrated as an effective catalyst in biomass pyrolysis. Since understanding the kinetics and thermodynamics is the critical step for pyrolysis development, thereby the effect of LM on the kinetics and thermodynamics for biomass pyrolysis was systematically investigated in this study. More specifically, two representative biomasses, herbaceous corncob and woody aspen sawdust, were blended with LM at different mass ratio of 0:0, 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1. Based on this, pyrolysis was conducted through thermogravimetry under nitrogen atmosphere. The kinetic parameters of activation energy and pre-exponential factor were calculated by iso-conventional method. While the Avrami theory was used to determine the reaction order. Thermodynamic parameters were also calculated and compared with those of non-catalytic pyrolysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW), an inexorable by-product of anthropogenic activities composes of nearly 50% of the organic (biogenic) fraction. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was studied to facilitate thermal depolymerization of organic fraction of MSW to biocrude at sub-critical region of water (200 °C; 100 bar pressure) employing H2 induced reducing conditions. Food, vegetable, and composite wastes were evaluated as feedstocks to produce HTL derivatives in the form of liquor (biocrude and aqueous phase), biochar and bio-gas. The biocrude (HTLOF) showed middle oil as major fraction along with C6-C22 compounds. Composite waste resulted in relatively higher yield of biocrude fraction. The aqueous phase (HTLAF) documented the presence of reducing sugars, sotolon and furfurals as major fraction. Biochar (HTLBC) composition showed maximum carbon fraction followed by hydrogen and oxygen. H2 induced reduced condition facilitated conversion of the biogenic MSW at relatively lower input conditions to various biobased fractions cohesively addressing the basic biorefinery requirement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic conversion of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into high-quality biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is significant for the utilization of biomass but remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a straightforward, eco-friendly, and scalable ball milling method for the synthesis of Co-alloyed Pt (Pt1/Co) single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts at kilogram levels. The catalysts exhibit superior catalytic performance for the hydrodeoxygenation of HMF to DMF, obtaining 100% HMF conversion and 92.9% selectivity to DMF under 1.0 MPa H2 at 180 °C for 2 h. The reaction pathway is also investigated, which shows that the hydrogenolysis of the C=O bond in HMF to form 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran is the main route during the hydrodeoxygenation and promoted by the synergistic effect of Pt and Co. Pt1/Co SAA catalysts display excellent stability without aggregation after five successive runs. More inspiringly, our method achieves the mass production of Pt1/Co at the kilogram scale, rendering its potential for practical applications. Moreover, by varying acetylacetonate precursors, we show the general synthesis of different Co-supported noble metal SAA catalysts (M1/Co, M = Pd, Ru, Ir, and Rh). Our findings not only offer a facile and readily scalable synthetic approach of SAA catalysts but also open new avenue to the exploitation of biomass. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the ability of Klebsiella pneumoniae DSMZ 2026 to biosynthesize 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) during batch fermentations when pure glycerol was supplemented with 10 g of unpurified biodiesel-derived glycerol. The crude glycerol (CG) fraction was obtained at laboratory scale from waste cooking oil. Cell viability, biomass, metabolites production, and substrate consumption were investigated. After 12 h of batch cultivation, 18.81 g/L 1,3-PD (yield 0.42 g/g, productivity 1.57 g/L/h) was reached when only pure glycerol was used, having a starting concentration of 43.5 g/L. When 10 g of unfiltered CG was added to the fermentation media that contained pure glycerol, 9.69 g/L 1,3-PD (yield 0.21 g/g, productivity 0.80 g/L/h) was obtained after 12 h. This work underlines the inhibitory potential of unfiltered GC fraction over the 1,3-PD production by K. pneumoniae DSMZ 2026. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa) can be used to make biodiesel or biojet fuel. This study compares life-cycle energy, environmental impact and economic performance of making biodiesel versus biojet fuel from camelina oil. The data for camelina field production was obtained from a grower in western Washington, USA. Camelina seeds were crushed, and biodiesel and biojet fuel were produced at the University of Idaho's advanced biofuel research lab. Biodiesel was made via a transesterification reaction, and biojet was made using a technology called hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel. This research found that for a base-case scenario, where transportation and fuel additives were not needed, the ratio of energy in produced biofuel to its life-cycle energy was 3.6 for biodiesel and 1.8 for biojet fuel. Biodiesel reduced life-cycle GHG emissions by 69% compared to conventional diesel. In contrast, camelina biojet reduced GHG emissions by 56.6% compared to jet-A fuel. The cost of ingredients and utilities to make biodiesel was US 75¢/L compared to $2.19/L for biojet fuel taking no credit for byproducts. Considering the potential demand for biodiesel, the price of diesel, and price of jet fuel, it was concluded that biojet fuel is unlikely to compete economically with biodiesel in the foreseeable future. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: During lipase-mediated biodiesel production, by-product glycerol adsorbing on immobilized lipase is a common trouble that hinders enzymatic catalytic activity in biodiesel production process. In this work, we built a hydrophobic pore space in macroporous ZIF-8 (named as M-ZIF-8) to accommodate lipase so that the generated glycerol would be hard to be adsorbed in such hydrophobic environment. The performance of the immobilized lipase in biodiesel production as well as its characteristics for glycerol adsorption were systematically studied. The PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) CVD (chemical vapor deposition) method was utilized to get hydrophobic M-ZIF-8-PDMS with hydrophobic macropore space and then ANL (Aspergillus niger lipase) was immobilized on M-ZIF-8 and M-ZIF-8-PDMS by diffusion into the macropores. Results: ANL@M-ZIF-8-PDMS presented higher enzymatic activity recovery and better biodiesel production catalytic performance compared to ANL@M-ZIF-8. Further study revealed that less glycerol adsorption was observed through the hydrophobic modification, which may attribute to the improved immobilized lipase performance during biodiesel production and ANL@M-ZIF-8-PDMS remained more than 96% activity after five cycles' reuse. Through secondary structure and kinetic parameters' analysis, we found that ANL@M-ZIF-8-PDMS had lower extent of protein aggregation and twice catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) than ANL@M-ZIF-8. Conclusions: Hydrophobic pore space constituted in macroporous ZIF-8 for lipase immobilization greatly improved lipase catalytic performance in biodiesel preparation. The hydrophobic modification time showed negligible influence on the reusability of the immobilized lipase. This work broadened the prospect of immobilization of enzyme on MOFs with some inspiration. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of m-Cresol (a representative of lignin bio-oil) has enormous potential for the production of valuable compounds. The products obtained from HDO of m-Cresol (m-Cr) are blendable into conventional fuels and essential for chemical industries such as plastic, fiber, rubber, resin, film, and coating industry. Ruthenium loaded acidic supports (ZSM-5, β-zeolite, y-zeolite, mordenite, COK12, ZrO2, TiO2) were used for the selective hydrodeoxygenation of m-Cresol into methylcyclohexane (MCXane). The effects of acid sites, as well as the pore size of the different supports on the hydrodeoxygenation activity and selectivity towards methylcyclohexane were addressed. The methylcyclohexane yield increased with increasing number of acid sites up to optimum acidity (532 μmol/gm) along with pore size (5.9 Ao). The experiments were carried out at 225–325 °C and 1–40 bar hydrogen pressure in a fixed bed reactor and observed that reaction temperature, and hydrogen pressure promoted the hydrodeoxygenation. The Ru/ZSM-5 is a stable (240 h) catalyst and displayed excellent behavior in both hydrodeoxygenation activity (100%) and methylcyclohexane selectivity (100%) for m-Cresol. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel multifunctional catalytic system, Ni2P/Zr-SBA-15, was synthesized by H2 temperature-programmed reduction of nickel phosphate precursors impregnated in Zr-SBA-15. Zr-SBA-15 was prepared by hydrothermal crystallization. The properties of catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of Jatropha Oil were evaluated by a one-step hydrogenation process in a high-pressure reactor. The best preparation parameters were determined. The multifunction of the catalyst includes excellent deoxidation, aromatization and cracking properties. It is worth noting that this product contains higher concentration aviation fuel components, with amount of C8–C16 accounting for more than 60 wt% of the product oil. The content of paraffin hydrocarbons is 79.25 wt%, aromatic compounds accounting for 10.13 wt% (all consisting of monocyclic aromatics), naphthene accounting for 6.72 wt%. The oil density is 811–828 kg/m3. These physical and chemical properties of C8–C16 are consistent with the detailed requirements for aviation turbine fuels containing synthetic hydrocarbons, as specified in ASTM-D7566-2017b. In this study, the aromatic content and density of nonblended bio-based jet fuels were satisfied with criteria and achieved the one-step hydrogenation process for the preparation of higher quality of bio-jet fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) is a promising renewable platform compound derived from biomass for the manufacture of various valuable chemicals, among which levulinate esters have been demonstrated to be good fuel additives. Many previous studies have focused on the production of short-chain levulinates for biofuels such as methyl and ethyl levulinates, but these esters suffer from some essential issues including a high oxygen content, low energy density (or heating value) and water solubility. Long-chain levulinate esters have similar structures to biodiesel. The long carbon chain may provide a higher carbon content and strong hydrophobicity, therefore improving the energy density and water insolubility. In this work, the synthesis of a long-chain levulinate ester, n-hexyl levulinate (HL), has been fast and efficiently achieved by the catalytic esterification of LA and 1-hexanol at low temperature. Tungsten hexachloride (WCl6) showed the most superior activity among the tested metal salt catalysts under mild conditions. A HL yield of ∼85% with almost complete LA conversion could be obtained at 50 °C after only 30 min. Other hexanols that have larger steric hindrances, such as 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol and cyclohexanol, could also promote efficient esterification with LA over the WCl6 catalyst, resulting in excellent product yields of ∼82-91%. The strategy applies to the efficient synthesis of longer chain levulinate esters such as n-octyl levulinate (OL) as well. The WCl6 catalyst was reusable several times in a consecutive batch reaction mode. The method reported herein offers a strategy for the efficient production of liquid fuels from LA, potentially bridging raw biomass feedstocks and terminal utilization of biobased products. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Diesel emissions have a significant impact on the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution, smog and global warming. As a result, diesel exhaust is dangerous to human health. While emissions reduction efforts have often focused on changing engine design or improving aftertreatment, diesel fuel modifications can also play an important role in improving engine efficiency and reducing exhaust emissions. The aim of this work was to examine the potential for emissions reductions under real-world conditions when employing fuel additives. Three different additives were examined, consisting of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and two commercial additives containing nanoparticles of cerium dioxide and ferrocene. HVO was selected as a renewable fuel, an alternative to commonly used biodiesels with competitive advantages. The new European driving cycle (NEDC) procedure was used to measure emissions of regulated compounds: carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulates (by mass and number) from an 11-year-old passenger car equipped with a diesel engine powered by fuel blends. The fuel blends prepared met the quality requirements for diesel fuel. The results obtained confirm that the application of both HVO and nano-additives to diesel can achieve a significant reduction of carbon monoxide (52%) and hydrocarbon (47%) emissions compared to the B7 base fuel. Particulate emissions (up to 10% by mass of particulates and 7% by number of particulates) were found to be best reduced by adding nanoparticles of cerium dioxide to the B7 fuel (with 30% HVO), while the best results in reducing nitrogen oxide emissions were obtained by adding ferrocene nanoparticles to the B7 fuel with 30% HVO. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soft wheat bran (SWB), one of the most abundant byproducts from the wheat milling industry, is a potential candidate for biofuel production. In this study, bran starch hydrolysates were separately integrated with dilute acid pretreated SWB and alkaline pretreated SWB to boost fermentable sugar concentration. Alkaline pretreatment showed higher sugar recoveries than acid pretreatment. Significant sugar degradation for acid pretreatment was observed when pretreatment temperature higher than 170 ℃. The optimal pretreatment condition was 15% solid loading with 0.08 mol/L NaOH at 150 ℃ for 20 min. The neutralization reaction between dilute alkaline and released acids reduced sugar decomposition and inhibitors formation. Integrating bran starch hydrolysates with alkaline pretreated SWB yielded the highest glucose concentration of 50.91 g/L and a total sugar concentration of 101.29 g/L. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a high-power, non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (GBFC) based on a nano/micro hybrid-structured Au anode is proposed. A uniformly distributed micro-hemispheric array of polycarbonate is fabricated for this novel electrode by hot embossing using a Ni mold. The nano/micro hybrid-structured Au anode is then fabricated by depositing an Au nanoparticle monolayer on the micro-hemispheric array using 1,6-hexanedithiol as a two-sided anchor. The cathode is composed of a graphene film-coated glassy carbon electrode. Nafion, a proton exchange membrane, is used to separate the anode and cathode and complete the battery assembly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed non-enzymatic GBFC has a high-power density of 10.7 mWcm−2, a high current density of 29.5 mAcm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 8.2 V, and a shorted-circuit current of 34 mA at room temperature. The energy conversion efficiency of the electrode is calculated to be 52.47%. In addition, the proposed GBFC possesses advantages such as ease of production on a large scale, low manufacturing cost, high repeatability, and long-term preservation. Therefore, it is highly feasible for commercialization and use in practical applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pd and Ru nanoparticles supported on graphene oxide (GO) [Pd@GO and Ru@GO] and bimetallic [Pd/Ru@GO] were prepared and well characterized by XRD, FT-IR, EDS, TEM, XPS and ICP-AES analyses. The prepared nano-catalysts were tested for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin monomer molecules-vanillyl alcohol and vanillin. In comparison with previously reported methods, Ru@GO and bimetallic Pd/Ru@GO catalysts showed high activity and selectivity, under milder conditions, at room temperature and 145 psi H2 pressure, for the formation of p-creosol, a value added product, as a potential future biofuel with antibacterial and anti-insecticidal properties. The multifold advantages of both these catalysts are in terms of reduced catalyst loading with a lower metal content and ambient temperture conditions resulting in higher conversion of the starting material. Furthermore, the efficacy of the developed methodology using Ru@GO and bimetallic Pd/Ru@GO catalysts under the optimized conditions was tested on the phenolic components of commercial lignin obtained by photo-catalytic fragmentation using TiO2, to obtain a mixture after HDO which contained vanillyl alcohol and p-creosol among others, as indicated by HPLC-MS analysis. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The increase of nitrogen content caused by the re-polymerization of nitrogenous compounds remains an important challenge during aqueous phase recirculation in the water solvent. In this work, aqueous phase recirculation was conducted in the ethanol-water solvent to evaluate the feasibility of ethanol addition in inhabiting the re-polymerization of nitrogenous compounds. The present study provides a comprehensive comparison of yield and quality between bio-oils derived from aqueous phase recirculation in the water solvent and ethanol-water solvent. The results showed that the addition of ethanol in aqueous phase recirculation displayed higher promotion in bio-oil yield (7%) compared with water solvent (3.55%). The energy recovery efficiency of bio-oil from ethanol-water solvent reached 87.43% after recirculation for three times, while that from the water solvent was 74.61%. The elemental analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that ethanol addition could inhibit the re-polymerization of nitrogenous compounds and thus decrease the nitrogen content in bio-oil. This resulted in lower NO and HCN emission peaks during the combustion process. Besides, the addition of ethanol increased the content of light molecular weight fractions and decreased the coke formation, which contributed to complete combustion and resulted in lower CO emission peaks. Overall, this work provides a feasible way for further improving the bio-oil yield and fuel quality through ethanol addition in solvent during aqueous phase recirculation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents an extensive and detailed characterization of products from hydropyrolysis and anaerobic digestion and proposes a multi-pathway assessment of algal biomass conversion. An algal biorefinery based on sequential hydropyrolysis (HyPy) and anaerobic digestion (AD) of algal biofilm has been comprehensively studied for the first time. Wet and untreated biomass from algal biofilm was directly employed as feedstock for the HyPy-AD coupled process and the products obtained were characterized by GC-MS, LC-MS, HPLC, CHNS, SEM and TEM. Based on different morphological and structural characterizations, different biorefinery routes were assessed in terms of net energy recovery and ecological impact. Upto 42% biocrude yield and 200 mL gVS-1 biomethane yield with a net energy ratio (NER) of 1.5 were observed for the coupled process of HyPy and AD, giving it a cutting edge over other conversion routes. A biorefinery based on these results has been presented considering a sustainable approach to valorize whole algal biomass towards multiple product recovery. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of low hydrogen-to-carbon and high hydrogen-to-carbon effective ratio materials with the aid of HZSM-5 and MCM-41 is a promising technique to improve the bio-oil quality. The low content of hydrocarbons and short life cycle of catalyst limit the application of pyrolysis technology in biomass energy conversion. The effects of catalytic temperature, and HZSM-5-to-MCM-41, feedstock-to-catalyst, and straw-to-soapstock ratios on the yield and composition of bio-oil were studied in this work. The quality of bio-oil during biomass pyrolysis can be improved by adjusting the operating conditions. The optimal catalytic temperature, and ratios of HZSM-5-to-MCM-41, feedstock-to-catalyst, and straw-to-soapstock were 400 °C, 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2, respectively. The addition of MCM-41 was beneficial in prolonging the life of HZSM-5 since the macromolecular compounds cracked when MCM-41 was added which restrain the generation of coke. The co-pyrolysis of soapstock with straw advanced the deoxygenation of oxygen-containing compounds especially phenol from straw during pyrolysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work explores the potential to upgrade waste cooking oil (WCO) via deoxygenation using inexpensive, unsupported metal oxide catalysts (CaO, TiO2, Mn(IV)O, and ZnO) in the absence of a hydrogen feedstock. WCO was mixed with 5 wt% catalyst material in a stainless steel reactor and heated to 300 °C for 60 min. The relative concentration of fatty acids increased upon heating in the absence of any catalyst, from ~15% of the total identifiable compounds for WCO to 64% for the Organic Liquid Products as a result of the nearly complete conversion of aldehyde and ester groups to organic acids, alkanes and aromatics. The inorganic catalysts shifted the product distributions significantly. CaO and ZnO slightly increased the concentration of acidic groups (versus WCO) but produced less acids than OLP alone, while Mn(IV)O and TiO2 resulted in overall decreases of free fatty acids. Mn(IV)O showed a slight preference for alkene formation, whereas TiO2 was selective toward alkanes. All catalysts – and uncatalyzed heating – showed significant deoxygenation in terms of ridding the WCO of C-O groups. Thermal treatment of WCO (with and without catalysts) resulted in a 25% increase in higher heating values, in line with those of commercial jet fuels. While the “one-pot” catalytic upgrading of WCO would not result in a direct substitute for aviation fuel, this work demonstrated the potential to significantly upgrade WCO using an inexpensive catalyst without relying on copious amounts of hydrogen gas to affect a hydrodeoxygenation reaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The integrated process of formic acid pretreatment and pyrolysis of bamboo sawdust (BS) under microwave irradiation is developed to produce high-quality bio-oil in this study. Experimental results indicated that microwave-assisted formic acid (MFA) pretreatment was able to reduce the contents of hydrogen, ash, and volatile in biomass. In the meanwhile, a distinct increase in the higher heating value of pretreated BS was observed. Although a higher pretreatment temperature led to lower mass yield, the corresponding energy yield of solid product was remarkably higher. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transfer infrared spectrometry analyses of pretreated BS suggested that MFA pretreatment could destruct the pristine structure of BS. Therefore, thermal properties of pretreated BS were significantly altered in terms of thermal stability and decomposition temperature according to thermogravimetric analysis. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of pretreated samples could produce less acids, phenols, and ketones but more sugars, especially gluopyranose. Furthermore, the relevant mechanism of microwave-assisted pyrolysis of pretreated BS was interpreted. In sum, MFA was a feasible and promising technology to improve the quality of bio-oil from microwave pyrolysis of biomass. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Technical and sustainability analyses of the methanol production via the integrated biomass pyrolysis, gasification, and methanol synthesis (IBPGM) process using rice straw as feedstock, are performed. The utilization of emitted CO2 by recycling to a gasifier as a gasifying agent is investigated for technical and environmental reasons. The effects of CO2 recirculation on the product distribution and energy consumption of the IBPGM process are examined. The production rate of methanol is improved with the increased CO2 recycle fraction, while that of bio-oil does not change. The IBPGM is a highly exothermic process, with the largest energy-releasing unit being the methanol reactor. The energy consumption at the gasifier exhibits the same trend and thermal self-sufficiency is consequently achieved when the recycle fraction is raised to 0.76. Environmental assessment using a life cycle analysis tool reveals that the energy management of methanol synthesis unit and syngas processor needs to be improved as they highly contribute toward the carbon footprint and potential environmental impact. The technical and environmental factors of the IBPGM process are evaluated by the analysis hierarchy process, calculated by a multi-criteria decision analysis method. The IBPGM process with the CO2 recycle fraction of 0.2 offers the best performance. Under this condition, the methanol and bio-oil production rates of 0.23 and 0.09 kmol h−1, respectively, and the energy efficiency of 60.7% can be achieved, based on the biomass feed rate of 1 kmol h−1. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bimetallic Mo-Ni was successfully impregnated on acidic mesoporous alumino-silicates supports. The acidic mesoporous alumino-silicates for instance, SBA-15, MAS, KIT-6, FSM-16 having Si/Al ratio = 10 were synthesized by post-grafting method. The effect of different mesoporous supports and active metals have been investigated through various characterization methods viz. XRD, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, Raman, DR UV–Vis spectra, XPS spectra, TGA and SEM with EDAX and GPC results. The catalytic activity of present system is discussed in detail and compared with the previously reported studies. The prepared materials were analysed in a high-pressure reactor for HDO of non-edible oils (jatropha and watermelon oils) to biofuel productions by changing a number of reaction parameters for instance, reaction temperature (300 °C–375 °C), H2 pressure (10–40 bar), WHSV (0.5–2.0 h−1), and in addition Time on Stream (TOS). The nature of mesoporous supports and interaction between Mo-Ni active metals and acid supports were also investigated. This study demonstrates that Mo-Ni/MAS (10) catalyst have been successfully produced green fuel from non-edible oils (jatropha and watermelon oil) through the HDO pathway at 350 °C, WHSV 1.0 h−1, and 30 bar H2 pressure. The Mo-Ni/MAS (10) catalyst possesses unique surface properties such as high surface area 670 m2 g−1, average pore diameter 4.3 nm, pore volume 0.81 cm3 g−1, total acidity 2.07 mmol g−1, and considerable number of active sites 4.20 μmol g−1. The specific reaction rates, as well as turn over frequency for Mo-Ni/MAS (10) catalyst, were found to be 4.31 × 10−4 g s mol−1 and 10.5 s−1, which are considerably high. It has also been established that the reaction is unaffected by means of any resistance to mass transfer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethanolysis carried out under Lewis-Brønsted acid catalysis was investigated as a possible process to valorize the organic fraction of urban sewage sludge, with the aim of selectively obtaining liquid biofuels. In a single reactive step, the conversion of lipids into fatty acid ethyl esters, of carbohydrates into ethyl levulinate, furanic compounds and ethyl glycosides and of proteins into ethyl ester of amino acids was achieved. The optimization of reactive conditions was conducted using pure chemicals as model compounds. The effect of the co-presence of water was also considered. Then, real samples of sewage sludge (as dried and wet centrifuged samples) were reacted in ethanol in the presence of the appropriate combination of homogeneous Lewis-Brønsted acid catalysts, namely 1 %wt aluminium chloride hexahydrate and sulfuric acid respect to ethanol. After 6 h at 453 K, 99% of lipids and almost 60% of initial complex sugars were effectively converted into the abovementioned target products. Conversions and yields were quite similar to those obtained by reacting pure compounds singularly, confirming the robustness of the process and its applicability to differently composed sludge. At the end of the reaction, products were easily recovered and purified from the alcoholic phase, whereas only a very limited amount of solids remain as inert materials. Final refined biofuels have high calorific values (37 and 40 MJ kg−1) and actually represent the 68.5 and 59.2% of the initial energy content of starting sludge, respectively. This strategy combines valorization of the starting organic fraction of sewage sludge and a considerable reduction of final solid waste (in a stabilised form) to be disposed of. Finally, through a preliminary feasibility study, this acid ethanolysis resulted in a competitive alternative to the anaerobic digestion of mixed sewage sludge to obtain biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mixed, wet, plastic streams containing food waste residues are being increasingly collected at point of use, but are extremely challenging to recycle and are therefore largely sent to landfill. While a challenging waste problem, this also represents an underutilised feedstock, which could be co-processed with biomass, increasing the scope of products, easing out seasonal variation in biomass production and increasing the production capacity of a traditional biorefinery. One promising method of biomass conversion is hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), where lignocellulosic residues are broken down in water at high temperatures and pressures to produce a bio-crude oil, a solid residue and an aqueous fertiliser. In this study, the co-processing of common plastic waste with pistachio hulls was assessed to investigate the suitability of the HTL approach. The HTL of pistachio hulls was undertaken at 350 °C over 15 and 60 min, with four commonly used plastics: polyethylene, polypropylene, PET and nylon-6, in blends of up to 20 wt% plastic to biomass. A novel FT-IR method was developed to estimate the conversion of plastics in the system, and the product phases were fully analysed. High yields of up to 35% bio-crude were achieved, and under optimal conditions, nylon-6 and PET were found to break down almost completely in the system. PET generated numerous products that distributed predominantly into the aqueous phase; the major decomposition product of nylon-6 was found to be the monomer ∊-caprolactam, also largely partitioning into the aqueous phase. The polyolefins were less reactive; a limited degree of decomposition formed oxidised products, which distributed into the bio-crude phase. This result represents a highly promising method for waste plastic valorisation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microwave heating technology has attracted great attention in biorefineries to generate biofuels and biomass-derived chemicals. NaOH and H2SO4 pretreatments are often applied to improve the process efficiency. Traditional heating pretreatments require long reaction times and contribute to rapid sugar degradation. Although effective, H2SO4 pretreatment suffers from the disadvantages of equipment corrosion, inhibitors generation, and waste water production. Herein, we performed NaOH, H2SO4, and FeCl3 pretreatments on sugar cane bagasse under microwave heating, and compared their effects on the biomass physical features, chemical compositions, and sugar release during pretreatment process. Our results showed that high amounts of sugar were obtained, and xylose and glucose were selectively recovered in the pretreatment liquor within 5–10 min of microwave heating by changing pretreatment media. NaOH efficiently fractionated biomass, generated xylose as the major product in pretreatment liquor, and left the solid residue more digestible. H2SO4 and FeCl3 effectively degraded both the hemicellulose and cellulose, producing glucose as the major product in the pretreatment liquor. Compared with H2SO4, FeCl3 pretreatment more efficiently removed lignin and recovered 48% glucose within only 5 min. Biomass chemical composition and morphological characteristics were studied and compared, confirming that microwave assisted FeCl3 pretreatment is a new and feasible approach to replace H2SO4 for biofuel and biomass-derived chemicals production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This research presents an approach for using waste cooking oil as a substrate for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by Bacillus thermoamylovorans. In addition, PHA was utilised as a feedstock for a biofuel, namely 3-hydroxyalkanoate methyl ester (3HAME). The largest amount of biomass (4.0 ± 0.1 g/L) and the greatest production of PHA [3.5 ± 0.1 g/L, corresponding to 87.5% of cell dry mass (CDM)] were obtained under optimal conditions, with 4% (w/v) waste cooking oil (WCO) used as a carbon source at 45 °C and 150 rpm for 48 h under batch cultivation. The isolated polymer was identified as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB-co-3HV)] with 85 mol% of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 15 mol% of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Notably, the properties of the copolymer were similar to the properties of the commercial P(3HB-co-3HV). Moreover, P(3HB-co-3HV) was used as a feedstock for the biofuel. P(3HB-co-3HV) methyl ester, a biofuel, was obtained under optimal conditions, with methanol and 15% (v/v) H2SO4 under a reaction temperature of 65 °C and time of 60 h. The highest yield of 3HAME that was obtained was 74.4%, with 97% methyl ester content. Almost all of the properties of 3HAME pass ASTM and Thailand’s fuel standards. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The feasibility of substituting 50% nutrients by aqueous phase liquid (APL), derived from hydrothermal liquefaction of Tetraselmis sp. biomass, in a semi-continuous cultivation of Tetraselmis sp. was studied. Growth experiments were conducted in indoor photobioreactor and outdoor raceway tank for three consecutive cycles. At the end of exponential growth pahse, 75% of the culture was harvested, and the supernatant was returned to the cultivation system. For control cultures, fresh nutrients were added; however, for the experimental cultures, an appropriate volume of APL was added to replace half of the nutrients. Either indoor or outdoor, the growth rate and biomass yield in APL-added cultures were either equal or slightly better compared to control culture; although APL had little to no effect on the metabolite content of Tetraselmis sp., metabolites profile of Tetraselmis sp. varied between APL-added and control cultures. Nevertheless, 50% nutrients requirements for microalgae cultivation could be replaced by APL. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the nutrient content and reuse potential of wastewater generated during hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgal biomass. The hydrothermal liquefaction reaction was tested at 270, 300, 330, and 345 °C to determine the effect of temperature on the formation of non-biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen (nbDON). Total nitrogen, ammonium, color, and toxicity were selected as key characteristics for the reuse of hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater. Results indicated that a higher concentration of nbDON5 (nbDON defined with a 5 day growth assay) and more diverse heterocyclic N-containing organic compounds were associated with greater toxicity as measured by a growth rate assay. For the tested temperature ranges, the total nitrogen content of the hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater slightly decreased from 5020 ± 690 mg L−1 to 4160 ± 120 mg L−1, but the % nbDON5 fraction increased from 57 ± 3 %DON to 96 ± 5 %DON. The temperature of hydrothermal liquefaction reactions can be optimized to maximize carbon conversion and nitrogen recovery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A study was conducted for fuel characterization of a stable nano-oxide added water emulsified biodiesel blend (NWEB) prepared with optimal emulsifying parameters. NWEB prepared with Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value 5.0 indicated the least separation from emulsion layer as compared to other HLB values 4.3 and 6.0. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy was conducted in Mid-IR range to ensure the quality of biodiesel and emulsified fuel. The stability data of NWEB prepared with varying the emulsifying parameters were used in radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) for simulation of actual and predicted separation from emulsion. The well trained RBFNN model was coupled with particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to find the optimal emulsifying parameters to produce a stable NWEB. The predicted optimal emulsifying parameters were found as 69.7 ppm nano-oxide concentration, 10% water, 1% surfactant and 2500 rpm of stirrer for a predicted separation of 0.90% after 30 h of emulsification against actual separation of 0.84%. The fuel properties of NWEB and base fuels were determined following the standard procedures. These properties were found within the limits of American, European and Indian Standards for diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel blends and thus indicating the suitability of these fuels in diesel engine. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Photocatalysis has offered a promising opportunity for selective transformation of biomass to high-value chemicals or fuels under mild conditions. Whereas titanium oxide has been widely used for photocatalytic pollutant degradation, H2 evolution, and CO2 reduction, few studies have been devoted to TiO2-based photocatalytic valorization of biomass or biomass-derived platform compounds. Here, we report on surface-controlled photocatalysis of TiO2 for selective valorization of furfurals and vanillin that are lignocellulose-derived key platform compounds. The reaction can be switched from hydrogenation of aldehyde group to C–C coupling by manipulating exposed facets; furanic and aromatic alcohols or coupling products, which are fine chemicals or jet-fuel precursors, could be produced with high selectivity. Our studies elucidate that the facet-dependent density of oxygen vacancies governs the charge distribution and adsorption strength of surface species and thus controls product selectivity. The present work offers an example of selectivity control by engineering TiO2 surfaces for valorization of biomass-derived feedstocks. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
Photocatalysis has emerged as a useful approach to the sustainable production of value-added products from biomass, in which selectivity is the key issue because a number of transformations are possible when multifunctional biochemicals are the reactants. As one of the most popular photocatalysts, TiO2 has mainly been applied to reactions like pollutant degradation that concern more about activity than selectivity. The knowledge about selectivity-controlling principles for TiO2 is limited. Here, we report the first illustration of TiO2-based photocatalysis that succeeds in modulating product selectivity in bioplatform transformations. Fine chemicals or jet-fuel precursors have been produced in high yields by controlling the density of oxygen vacancies on TiO2, which governs surface adsorption and reaction and thus determines the product selectivity. This work offers useful insights into the design of selective photocatalysts for biomass valorization by surface engineering. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
Wang and colleagues found that the selectivity for photocatalytic transformations of lignocellulose-derived platform chemicals including furfural, methyl furfural, and vanillin depended strongly on the exposed facet of TiO2. They demonstrated that the facet-dependent density of oxygen vacancies governs the charge distribution and adsorption strength of surface species, and thus determines product selectivity. Hydrogenation products such as fine chemicals and coupling products as biofuel precursors can be produced in high yields over oxygen-vacancy-rich and oxygen-vacancy-free TiO2 surfaces, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biomass Chemical Looping Gasification is a novel technology allowing high quality syngas production at autothermal conditions without CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and low tar generation. This work compiles gasification results corresponding to 38 h of continuous operation in a 1.5 kWth unit using pine wood as fuel and a synthetic Fe-based oxygen carrier, Fe20Al. The main operating conditions such as temperature (T = 820–940 °C), steam-to-biomass ratio (S/B = 0.05–0.65), and oxygen-to-biomass ratio (λ = 0.2–0.6) were analyzed at steady state conditions using a novel method for controlling oxygen in the process. A syngas composed by 37% H2, 21% CO, 34% CO2 and 7% CH4, and tars below 2 g/Nm3 could be obtained at autothermal conditions, leading to a syngas yield of 0.8 Nm3/kg dry biomass and a cold gas efficiency of 68%. The material maintained a high reactivity although some Fe lost was observed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The agricultural wastes disposal and polluted water purification are always the key issues of environmental restoration. In this work, a magnetic biogas residue-based biochar (mBR-C) by direct pyrolysis and sonochemical method was prepared from biogas residue (BR). Response design methodology based on Box-Behnken design was used for the preparation parameters optimization. The characterization results identified that mBR-C had well-developed pore structure and surface area, which was beneficial to diffuse and capture heavy metal ions. Traces of toxic heavy metal in mBR-C was leached (˂0.04 mg/L) through TCLP method, indicating the environmental safety of the magnetic biochar. Meanwhile, the mBR-C exhibited excellent solid-liquid separation efficiency because of its strong magnetism. The series of adsorption experiments indicated that mBR-C could capture Cu2+ and Pb2+ rapidly, and the maximum adsorption capacity for Cu2+ and Pb2+ was 75.76 and 181.82 mg/g, respectively, which was higher than some other biochars previously reported. mBR-C was further applied in the synthetic wastewater treatment, which could effectively purify at least 600 mL (150 BV) to meet emission standards. After several column adsorption-desorption cycles, the adsorption capacity could still reach 85%, implying that mBR-C has good reusability and stability. Overall, the mBR-C can be used as an eco-friendly, desirable, economic and recyclable biosorbent in heavy metal polluted water treatment, providing a new idea for a combination of biogas residue recycle and wastewater treatment. © 2020

AB  - The main challenge of utilizing ethanol in diesel engines in blending mode is the phase separation issue. Therefore, an attempt has been performed to enhance the stability feature of ethanol/Jatropha biodiesel (JME) blends by using n-butanol as co-solvent. The 10% by volume of n-butanol is added to the mixtures of 10% and 20% ethanol and 70% and 80% JME, which is denoted as JME10Bu10E and JME10Bu20E, respectively. The phase stability of the evaluated fuels is examined employing visual approach and Thermogravimetric analysis. These methods confirm that there is no phase separation for more than 2 months under ambient conditions. Then, the combustion and emission features are investigated utilizing a diesel engine run with different loads and constant speed. The findings demonstrate that the pmax. and HRR are increased by adding ethanol. The ignition delay is extended with the addition of ethanol while the combustion period is almost the same. The bsfc is decreased by adding ethanol compared to JME fuel. The CO, UHC, and NOx formations are reduced markedly by 40%, 40%, and 40%, respectively, with adding ethanol. Finally, using n-butanol and JME as co-solvents with ethanol supports the growth of renewable energy in the CI engine. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Microwave-assisted wet torrefaction was adopted in this study for co-processing textile sludge (TS) and biowaste. Key operating parameters, including different temperatures (120–180 °C) and reaction times (10–30 min), for the torrefaction of legally recyclable TS (R-0906 in Taiwan) were evaluated. Furthermore, TS was blended with six widely produced types of lignocellulose biowaste at different blending ratios for improving the biochar quality and combustion characteristics. The results indicated that the optimal temperature and reaction time for TS torrefaction were 180 °C and 20 min, respectively, beyond which the fixed carbon content and higher heating values (HHVs) of biochar increased from 1.7% to 5.1% and 13.0–18.7 MJ/kg, respectively. However, biochar produced through the torrefaction of TS and macadamia husk with a blending ratio of 30/70 (db%) exhibited the highest fixed carbon content (29.8%) and HHV (19.7 MJ/kg) among the six tested lignocellulose biowaste samples with the atomic H/C and O/C ratios close to those of peat. The thermal stability, activation energy, frequency factor, and ignition and combustion temperatures of the biochar produced through microwave-assisted wet torrefaction co-processing were higher than those produced using raw TS or biowaste. The energy return on investment of the biochar system reached 10.9. Greenhouse gas emissions can be decreased by 57.5% if biochar is used as a bituminous coal substitute. Therefore, microwave-assisted wet torrefaction is a sustainable approach for mitigating the disposal problems of TS and lignocellulose biowaste as well as improving the energy performance and environmental friendliness of biochar-to-energy systems. Besides, the protein and carbohydrate contents in the supernatant of TS co-torrefied with biowaste at different blending ratios increased by 1.0–4.1 and 1.2–5.9 times, respectively. These contents can be recycled back to the activated sludge unit as a nutrient source. Overall, the microwave-assisted wet torrefaction process is green and economically beneficial. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study focuses on the use of microwave irradiation to improve the production of lipid, exopolysaccharide and biomass in the microalgae Scenedesmus sp. Microwave treatment conditions such as microwave power, duty cycle % and time was optimized to increase the biomass and lipid content of Scenedesmus sp. Microwave power 100 W, duty cycle 40 %, and 2 min treatment time led to a substantial improvement in the biomass and lipid content. Due to the simultaneous improvement in both the biomass and lipid content, the total lipid production was improved from 0.76 (microwave untreated) to 1.42 g/L (microwave treated) (12 days grown cells). In addition, with biomass and lipid content, microwave treatment also enhanced the production of Exopolysaccharides (EPS) up to 2.3-folds. Furthermore, biodiesel properties were improved to some extent after the microwave treatment. Microwave irradiation is a promising physical treatment method for microalgae to improve total lipid production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enhancing anaerobic digestion performance is highly desired for its large-scale application. In the present work, magnetic fields (0–30 mT) and Ti-sphere core–shell structured additives (Ti-1 and Ti-2) are simultaneously introduced in anaerobic mono-digestion and co-digestions. Compared with the control group, the Ti-sphere core–shell structured additives increase the biogas yield by 27.12%–65.53% for mono-digestion and 8.47%–35.89% for co-digestion systems under the optimized magnetic field intensity (5 mT), respectively. Meanwhile, the degradation rate of total chemical oxygen demand is 54.68%–69.14% for anaerobic mono-digestion and 53.03%–78.25% for anaerobic co-digestion with Ti-sphere core–shell structured additives, respectively. The digestate with Ti-sphere core–shell structured additives exhibits the remarkable stability (45.24%–53.17%) and fertility (4.85%–4.97%). This work clarifies the effect of magnetic field in AD system, and proposes a possible mechanism for understanding the enhanced methanogenesis pathways induced by Ti-sphere core–shell structured additives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the processing of guayule (Parthenium argentatum) for bulk rubber production using solvent extraction, two residue streams are produced: a complex resin-rich liquid and a ground, dry woody bagasse. In order to enhance the economic viability of guayule as an industrial crop, value-added use of the residues is needed and has the potential to reduce gross rubber production costs. The main objective of this research is the characterization of these two residues using analytical techniques to identify potential value-added components and applications. Here, guayule bagasse and resin were characterized by CNHS/O elemental analysis, bomb calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy (FT-ICR MS). Guayule bagasse has high energy content (22–24 MJ/kg), less moisture (0.5–1.5 wt.%) and ash (3.7–4.1 wt.%), low cellulose crystallinity (29–34 %), and abundant carbohydrates (36–38 wt.%) and lignin (22–23 wt.%) relative to plenty of other lignocellulosic biomass, indicating bagasse's potential for thermochemical conversion to fuels. By FT-ICR MS with negative ionization mode, the most abundant classes among the 7200 heteroatom-containing compounds detected in guayule resin were O3, followed by O4 and O2. Identified compounds included fatty acids, steroids, triterpenoids, and sesquiterpene esters, some of which have never been reported, as potential precursors of industrial chemicals. Characterization of guayule bagasse and resin guides exploring potential applications of waste streams, beneficial for enhancing techno-economic feasibility of guayule rubber-derived tires manufacturing industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glycerol is the main by-products obtained from the transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats to produce biodiesel which is an important biofuel used for transportation. The increase in the global energy demand has pushed up the production of biodiesel with a corresponding increase in glycerol production over the years. The thermo-catalytic process is gaining wide popularity as sustainable technical routes of converting glycerol to renewable hydrogen. There exists a great potential of utilizing hydrogen as a critical part of a more sustainable and secure energy mix. Hence, this study focusses on the review of the recent advances and development in the thermo-catalytic conversion of glycerol to renewable hydrogen in the last one decade. The analysis of the reviewed articles showed that substantial efforts had been made in the application of thermo-catalytic process for the conversion of glycerol to renewable hydrogen. Glycerol reforming using steam, carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) have received significant research attention and have been found to have great potential as technological routes for hydrogen production. Whereas, the use of the photocatalytic glycerol reforming has the advantages of energy-saving by utilizing the vast available solar resources and suitable photocatalysts. However, each of the thermo-catalytic processes exhibits inherent challenges which have been a bottleneck to the development of the process to industrial scales. Nevertheless, the prospect of employing each of the thermo-catalytic processes for hydrogen production via glycerol conversion was identified with the possible suggestion of strategies of overcoming the challenges. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Co-processing raw bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass in existing petroleum refineries represents a near-term greenhouse gas mitigation strategy by producing partially renewable and infrastructure-compatible hydrocarbon fuel with minimal capital requirements. One deterrent for risk-averse refinery owners is that a modification to their air permit may be required prior to any changes to refinery operations due to potential air emission changes. However, a lack of information on potential air emission changes resulting from bio-oil co-processing yields uncertainty, which could cause delay in obtaining required permit. To address this concern, we perform a quantitative evaluation of air emission changes across a range of bio-oil co-processing fractions in refineries’ fluid catalytic cracking units. We find that 92% of U.S. petroleum refineries could co-process 5% or more (up to 20%, by weight) raw bio-oil without triggering major permitting requirements. We then develop an upper bound estimate of the potential for co-processing bio-oil considering permitting and technical limits; our results suggest that U.S. refineries could co-process 573,000 barrels per day (0.79 cubic meter per second) of raw bio-oil, implying ~1.92 billion gallons gasoline equivalent of renewable fuel per year (0.23 cubic meter per second), equivalent to 1.4% of U.S. gasoline consumption or 18% of ethanol production in 2018. This first-of-its-kind analysis integrates process and environmental engineering with air permitting analysis and demonstrates the importance of coupling regulatory considerations with engineering analysis to guide informed decision-making to minimize investment risks while fully leveraging refinery infrastructure. This novel approach is also applicable to refineries in other jurisdictions. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Bioelectrocatalysis is a phenomenon concerned with biological catalysts, which accelerates the electrochemical reactions. The bioelectrocatalysis has been widely explored by the research community in various aspects. Enzymes can catalyze different chemical reactions in living organisms by enzymes as the most important biological catalysts. These enzymatic biocatalysts are commercially available and commonly called enzyme electrodes. Electron transfer between the active center of the enzyme and the electrode can be performed either by direct electron transfer (DET) or by means of mediators (i.e. mediated electron transfer (MET), which are discussed in details in the review presented. Therefore, different strategies have been used to increase the efficiency and stability of bioelectrocatalysis. In this review, different strategies of the bioelectrode designs are discussed and the application of the common bioelectrodes used in the biosensors are presented in the various fields. Moreover, a summary of the research status in the applications of bioelectrocatalysis in biosensors and biofuel cells was provided. © 2020 Iranian Chemical Society.

AB  - An integrated treatment system with co-fermentation of food waste (FW) and syngas generated from digestate pyrolysis was verified as a promising approach to improve biofuel recovery. Syngas was injected and co-fermented with the FW at different injection volumes starting from 560 mL (Stage II). More stable methane production (MP) was exhibited in the thermophilic reactor than the mesophilic reactor. As syngas injection volume gradually increased to 5300 mL in stage V, the MP in the thermophilic reactor was about 22% higher than that in the mesophilic reactor. It was calculated that the syngas was not only almost stoichiometrically converted into CH4 but also accelerated the digestion process of FW, resulting in the improvement of biofuel recovery. The different pathways of syngas biomethanation under the different temperatures were revealed by 16S rRNA genes analysis. Methanosaeta spp. was dominant in the mesophilic reactor and CO and H2 could be converted into acetate and then CH4. On the other hand, hydrogenotrophic methanogens were dominant in the thermophilic reactor indicating that CO may be converted with H2 as the intermediary. This integrated treatment system has the potential for industrial applications and provides a useful approach for the development of a circular bio-economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - H2-free deoxygenation is a very important process in producing high-quality biofuel without the use of H2 gas supply. Considering the costly price of the noble metals, transition metal (TM) based catalysts are more affordable, and the performance is comparable to the noble metal-based catalyst. In this study, TMO supported on zeolite Y catalysts (Ni-, Cu-, Co-, Zn- and Mn-Y) are prepared via wet-impregnation for deoxygenation of triolein, a model compound of non-edible oil under H2-free condition. The deoxygenation activity of TMO supported on zeolite Y is following the order of Ni-Y &gt; Co-Y &gt; Cu-Y &gt; Mn-Y &gt; Zn-Y. The nickel oxide supported on zeolite-Y (Ni-Y) shows the highest conversion up to 76.21 % with 84.28 % hydrocarbon selectivity after reacted at 380 °C for 2 h. Besides, the selectivity toward diesel range hydrocarbon is 92.61 %. The superior deoxygenation activity of Ni-Y can be related to synergistic effect between the reduced B/L and high hydrogenolysis ability of Ni that promote the decarboxylation reaction, suppress the cracking and polymerization of heavy hydrocarbon. Therefore, Ni-Y is a potential catalyst to obtain high quality green diesel from non-edible oil through catalytic deoxygenation without addition of external H2 source. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) upgrades prosopis juliflora biomass to liquid fuels. We pyrolysed prosopis juliflora to crude bio-oil with 55% oxygen and 10% bound water. NbMo/C catalytically hydrodeoxygenated bio-oil to upgraded oil, light oil, gas, and biochar. After 1 h at 300 °C and a catalyst/oil ratio of 0.05, the upgraded bio-oil yield reached 42%. Oxygen and moisture content dropped to 19% and 0.1%. The latter two properties were independent of temperature between 275 °C and 325 °C while yield was optimal at 300 °C. The upgraded oil fuel properties - viscosity (3.2 mm2/s at 40 °C), density (0.98 g/cc at 15 °C), HHV (30 MJ/kg), and stability at room temperature were improved after HDO. A GC–MS detected monomers (39% yield), one-third which were oxygen-free. The oil yield dropped 5% after 5 cycles. Coke contributed most to deactivation but air combusted it at 380 °C. NbMo/C is an efficient catalyst to upgrade bio-oil to bio-fuels. © 2020

AB  - Iron and cobalt co-doped ordered mesoporous porphyrinic carbon (FeCo-OMPC) is employed as the catalyst for both electrodes in membraneless enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs). FeCo-OMPC is used for catalyzing oxygen redox reaction (ORR), while GOx/[FeCo-OMPC/CNT] is utilized as a catalyst for a series of glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) and hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction (HPOR). The onset potential of the ORR by FeCo-OMPC is 0.31 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while that of HPOR by FeCo-OMPC/CNT and GOR-HPOR by GOx/[FeCo-OMPC/CNT] are both 0.12 V. The activity of this catalyst is better than previously reported similar catalysts due to the presence of Co species and high metal contents. As a result, the concentration of H2O2 generated by GOR is 1.02–1.56 mM when the same glucose concentration as human blood is used. In addition, the EBC using GOx/[FeCo-OMPC/CNT] and FeCO-OMPC shows the maximum power density of 21.3 ± 2.97 μW cm−2 with open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.17 ± 0.016 V. These values are significantly higher than those of EBC using the competitive Fe–N/CNT catalyst (0.11 V and 9.6 μW cm−2). Moreover, the OCV is close to the expected value by CV (0.19 V), confirming that the FeCo-OMPC catalyst can be used for implantable bioelectronics, such as biosensors and electroceuticals. © 2020

AB  - Rice straw and sugarcane bagasse were co-pyrolyzed with polypropylene and polystyrene using microwaves, and the pyrolysis vapors were catalytically upgraded using HZSM-5 catalyst. The product yields, composition and properties of bio-oil from pyrolysis of individual feedstocks and equal composition mixtures before and after catalytic upgradation were thoroughly investigated. The pyrolysis oil yields from polypropylene (82 wt%) and polystyrene (98 wt%) were high compared to that from rice straw (26 wt%) and bagasse (29 wt%). Catalytic upgradation at weight hourly space velocity of 11 h−1 resulted in higher selectivity to unsaturated aliphatics and aromatic hydrocarbons. Properties of upgraded bio-oil from biomass-polypropylene mixtures were similar to that of light fuel oil with high calorific value (43 MJ/kg), low viscosity (1 cP), optimum density (0.850 g/cm3) and flash point (70 °C). Oxygen content in catalytically upgraded co-pyrolysis bio-oil was low (&lt;5%) as compared to upgraded pyrolysis bio-oil (14–18%), and pyrolysis bio-oil without upgradation (20–24%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three nickel-alumina catalysts were prepared with nickel content 60, 80 and 90 wt % (symbols: 60NiAl, 80NiAl, 90NiAl) following a co-precipitation methodology. The catalysts were characterized and evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of waste cooking oil for the production of third generation green diesel under solvent free conditions. Metallic Ni, NiO, and NiAl2O4 were detected in the 60NiAl catalyst. NiAl2O4 is hardly detected in the 80NiAl catalyst but not at all in the 90NiAl catalyst. The extent of reduction of NiO to metallic Ni upon activation is considerably higher in the 80NiAl and 90NiAl samples with respect to the 60NiAl sample resulting in much higher active site population. The increase in the nickel content causes a change in the porous structure and a decrease in the specific surface area. The catalytic performance increases considerably from the 60NiAl catalyst to the 80NiAl one due to the increase in the active site population. The higher catalytic performance of the 80NiAl catalyst with respect to that of the 90NiAl catalyst, exhibiting almost equal active site population, is due to convenient porous structure of 80NiAl catalyst, which hinder the insertion of deleterious bulky compounds present in the waste cooking oil, as well as to its strong acid sites. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - • Catalytic treating of biomass fast pyrolysis vapors offers a promising route to convert many different types of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels. Considerable research efforts have focused on using zeolite catalysts, especially the microporous HZSM-5 zeolite. Unfortunately, the zeolite's initial high activity in forming coke and light gases reduces the overall oil yield. In this contribution, we synthesized conventional HZSM-5 zeolite, mesoporous HZSM-5 zeolite, and a core-shell catalyst consisting of mesoporous HZSM-5 zeolite coated with a thin layer (&lt;20 nm) of silicalite-1 zeolite. The catalysts were characterized by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 and Ar physisorption, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) spectra, and 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The catalysts were tested in a tandem micro-pyrolyzer system for deoxygenation of wheat straw derived fast pyrolysis vapors in a downstream catalytic fixed bed reactor and the quantitative product analysis was performed with GC-MS/FID/TCD and TGA-MS. The change in yields of different product groups was monitored during catalyst deactivation for an increasing number of pyrolysis vapor pulses and the cumulative carbon recoveries of all product streams (char, vapors, gas, and coke) were compared at different biomass-to-catalyst ratios (∼4 and ∼1) for catalyst loadings of 2 and 8 mg, respectively. In addition, the yields were compared for the same number of zeolitic acid sites. Even though the coking propensity was highest for the mesoporous HZSM-5 (5.1% carbon recovery of fed biomass at B:C = 1), it showed improved conversion of oxygenates (wt% O of vapors = 15) and a higher tolerance towards deactivation by coking compared to the conventional HZSM-5 (wt% O of vapors = 20). Coating of mesoporous HZSM-5 with silicalite-1 reduced the number of acid sites per mass of catalyst by ∼20%, which is attributed to the addition of the inert silicalite-1 layer and passivation of the external acid sites of the mesoporous HZSM-5. Compared to mesoporous HZSM-5, the added silicalite-1 shell reduced the coke yield by 43% (from 5.1–2.9 wt% of fed biomass carbon) for the same catalyst mass and by 8% (4.7 wt% of fed biomass carbon) for the same total number of acid sites. Furthermore, the tolerance towards deactivation observed for the mesoporous HZSM-5 core was largely preserved—especially for conversion of small oxygenates like acids, alcohols and aldehydes, resulting in vapors with 14 wt% O. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wearable electronics have been extensively studied owing to their capability of undertaking continuous multi-task for daily needs. Meanwhile, lightweight, flexible, and wearable power sources that enable high-power and sustainable energy conversion from ambient resources (e.g. bodily fluids) have attracted attention. We propose a wearable and flexible textile-based biofuel cell using moisture management fabric (MMF) widely used in sportswear as a transport layer for sustainable and high-power energy harvesting. The reduction of PB-modified cathode is driven by the oxidation of glucose catalyzed by GOD-modified anode, and this enables a single-compartment structure where MMF acts as biofuel transport media. MMF made of polyester can naturally induce a continuous, high-speed flow which facilitates molecule transport for efficient chemical reactions without an additional pump. The resulting highly efficient power generation in MMF is explored and verified by comparing it with those of cotton and paper. Additionally, multi-stack biofuel cell in both parallel and series was successfully realized, and the open circuit voltage and maximum power reached 1.08 V and 80.2 μW, respectively. Integrated into a bandage and sportswear, a six-stack biofuel cell was able to generate sufficient electrical power from human sweat and turn on a sports watch directly. Owing to low-cost and scalable fabrication process, the proposed biofuel cell has great potential to be systematically integrated into clothes, and generate sufficient and sustainable electrical power for wearable electronics using biofuel (e.g. glucose, lactase) from various bodily fluids, like sweat and urine. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nanostructured calcium oxides supported onto biochar obtained by pyrolysis of avocado seeds were prepared, characterized and successfully used as catalysts to produce biodiesel from waste oils. The effect of increasing calcium load (5, 10 and 20 wt%) was investigated. Elemental analysis, FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, acid and basic sites were used to characterize the resulting carbon-based calcium oxides. Supported systems efficiently promoted the transesterification of oil with methanol, but differently from calcium oxide, they were easily recoverable and reusable for three cycles without any loss of activity. Kinetic data were better fitted by a pseudo-second order model with an activation energy of 39.9 kJ mol−1. Thermodynamic parameters of activation energy were also determined for the transesterification reaction (Δ‡ G: 98.68-106.08 kJ mol−1, Δ‡ H: 37.05 kJ mol−1 and Δ‡S: 0.185 kJ mol−1 K). Finally, reaction conditions were optimized using the desirability function applied on the response surface methodology analysis of a Box–Behnken factorial design of experiments. By carrying out the reaction at 99.5 °C for 5 h with 7.3 wt% of catalyst and a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 15.6, a FAME content over 96% was achieved. Even starting from waste cooking oil, final biodiesel was conform to the main EN14214 specifications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the essential characteristics of diesel oils is their cetane number (CN) which indicates the ignition delay of the fuel in the process. In this study, using PSO-ANFIS technique, CNs of biodiesel and conventional diesel (called petrodiesel) oils were modeled and estimated based on the fatty acid methyl ester compositions of biodiesel oils and carbon type structure of the diesel fuels. For the first time, novel correlations were developed for the estimation of CNs of biodiesel and conventional diesel oils. For the models development, as the raw data, 232 biodiesel and 134 conventional diesel oils samples were derived from the literature. Based on the obtained results, the coefficient determinations (R2) of 0.91 and 0.93 and %AARD of 6.4 and 9.6 were obtained by PSO-ANFIS and MNR models for the estimation of biodiesel oil CN, respectively. The R2 of 0.98 and 0.96 and %AARD of 2 and 2.9 were resulted using PSO-ANFIS and MNR models for the prognostication of diesel oil CN, respectively. Based on the gained results, PSO-ANFIS and MNR algorithms are capable of estimating the biodiesel and diesel oils CNs. The novelty of this study is the development of novel correlations and smart models with high accuracies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Homogeneous catalysts used for biodiesel synthesis have several limitations, including non-recoverability/reusability, saponification, emulsification, equipment corrosion, and environmental pollution. To overcome these limitations, we synthesized a novel catalyst via calcination of pineapple leaves waste. This catalyst was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and soluble alkalinity measurements. The catalyst's activity with regards to soybean oil transesterification was analyzed, and multiple process parameters (temperature, catalyst amount, reaction time, and methanol:oil molar ratio) were examined. A high catalytic activity, probably related to the 85 wt% content of alkali/alkali metals (K, Ca and Mg), was observed after a 30 min reaction time, 60 °C, 4 wt% of catalyst, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:40, reaching an oil to biodiesel conversion above 98%. We conclude that the novel catalyst presented here is efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable, while simultaneously abundant waste is reduced. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Effective catalytic hydrotreatment of highly nitrogenous biocrudes derived from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of primary sewage sludge and microalga Spirulina biomass was explored. A critical issue is the lack of thermal stability of raw HTL biocrudes at the severe conditions (~400 °C) required for hydrodenitrogenation. This fact suggests the need for a two-stage approach, involving a first low-temperature stabilization stage followed by another one operated at higher temperature. In this study, DSC was successfully used to indicate the thermal stability of both biocrudes. During hydrotreating, it was observed that complete deoxygenation was already achieved in the first stage at 350 °C, with limited coke formation. Moreover, after second stage up to 92% denitrogenation associated with the higher hydrogen consumption (39.9 g kg −1 for Spirulina and 36.9 g kg −1 for sewage sludge) was obtained for both biocrudes. Consequently, comparable oil yields but significantly less coke yields were recorded during two-stage upgrading (1.0% for Spirulina and 0.7% for sewage sludge), compared to direct processing at 400 °C (9.1% for Spirulina and 3.4% for sewage sludge). In addition, the properties of the upgraded oils were enhanced by increasing the temperature in the first stage (310 °C, 330 °C and 350 °C respectively). Finally, the results indicated that remarkable drop-in fuel properties were obtained, with respect to heteroatom (O and N) removal, HHV, and H/C ratio during the two-stage hydrotreatment. Two-stage hydrotreating is therefore proposed as a successful approach for the upgrading of HTL biocrudes with high nitrogen content. © 2020

AB  - This work aimed at investigating the synthesis of 5-HMF from the ultrasound-ionic liquid pretreated sugarcane bagasse in a microwave-solid acid-ionic liquid system. The XRD analysis indicated that the macrostructure of cellulose remained intact after the ultrasound-ionic pretreatment, [Bmim]OAc showed better performance than [Bmim]Cl. The best conditions for the untreated bagasse conversion to 5-HMF were [Bmim]OAc, ion-exchange resin catalyst, D001-cc, 140 ℃ and 25 min. The ultrasound-ionic liquid pretreatment at different frequencies (20–50 kHz) increased the 5-HMF yield by 39.73–165.43 % compared with that of the untreated bagasse, indicating the role of the acoustic cavitation in enhancing the transformation of bagasse into 5-HMF. The bagasse pretreated with [Bmim]OAc/ultrasound at 40 kHz/30 min showed the highest yield of 5-HMF (65.72 %). The synthesis of 5-HMF from the pretreated sugarcane bagasse in the microwave-solid acid/ionic liquid system could be a promising channel for production of biofuels and related chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Stability of the calcined dolomite in catalyzing transesterification during the reused cycles is poor due to the leaching out of the calcium active sites and dolomite is incorporated with cerium to overcome the drawback in this study. Three different methods of the wet impregnation, direct wet impregnation and solid mixing are used for the cerium incorporation, where the wet impregnation method with the cerium to calcium molar ratio of 0.6 is preferred for the best catalytic performance. The maximum biodiesel yield of 97.21% is achieved with the catalyst to oil mass ratio of 0.05 and methanol to oil molar ratio of 15 at 65 °C for 2 h. Attributed to the strong synergistic effect between CaO and CeO2, the leaching out of the calcium active sites from the cerium incorporated dolomite catalyst into the liquid transesterification products is greatly reduced and the biodiesel yield of 88.63% is obtained for the fifth reused cycle. The physical properties of the produced biodiesel are in accordance with the ASTM D 6751 or EN 14214 standard to guarantee its industrial application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In present work, the catalytic properties of MCM-41 were boosted by introducing Zr into its structure with various amounts of Si/Zr molar ratios. Then it was loaded by calcium through conventional impregnation and sono-dispersion. Synthesized nanocatalysts were analysed using EDX, XRD, FTIR, FESEM and BET-BJH techniques. The results of XRD technique revealed the fabrication of MCM-41 and CaO. The FESEM images proved that the surface particle sizes of the synthesized catalysts were in the range of nanoscale and EDX results represented that Ca was more effectively scattered over the support in sonicated samples compared to non-sonicated one. Also, both FESEM and BET-BJH analysis represented a decrease in MCM-41 specific surface area with Si/Zr molar ratio reduction. The catalytic performances of bifunctional samples were evaluated for transesterification and esterification reactions. The constant operational conditions were as follows: 70 °C, MeOH/Oil = 9 and 5 wt% catalyst. Generally, the obtained results demonstrated a remarkable improvement in biodiesel conversion due to an increase of Zr amounts in catalysts and also the sample which was exposed to ultrasound represented better reusability in comparison with the non-sonicated sample. Among the prepared samples, the sonicated Ca/ZM-U (Si/Zr = 10) sample was the best catalyst for biodiesel production with high reusability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The world is challenged with depletion of non-renewable fossil fuel and environmental pollution. Thus, this research was emphasized on converting refined used cooking oil to safer and low toxicity biodiesel by base-catalyzed transesterification reaction. Alumina supported magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium oxide-based catalysts with iron as its dopant were optimized according to various calcination temperatures and iron loadings. The optimum conditions over potential catalyst was achieved with 20 wt% of Fe loading for Fe/Ba/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 800 °C which gave the maximum biodiesel production of 84.02%. Characterization of catalyst carried out by XRD showed that the 20Fe:80Ba/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at 800 °C had a polycrystalline structure with high BET surface area (133.59 m2/g) while FESEM analysis displayed a morphology of uniform plate-like shape grains with fine particles in the range of 55–60 nm. CO2-TPD results showed that the catalyst exhibited highest basicity of 2.5854 mmol/g, while TGA analysis proved that 800 °C was the optimum calcination temperature. The transesterification process of refined used cooking oil to produce high yield biodiesel was effectively attained using 20Fe:80Ba/Al2O3 catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to explore the different characteristics of bio-fuels generated by microwave pyrolysis of sludge in the temperature and power control modes, the differences in the distribution, composition, lower heating value and energy utilization efficiency have been analyzed. The heat conversion mechanism was preliminarily explored via changes in the dielectric constants of the sludge. The results showed that: First, there were differences between the two modes during the pyrolysis process. This was the main reason that the lower heating value of the products in the temperature control mode was higher than it in the power control mode. For instance, the lower heating values of bio-gas and bio-oil generated at 800 °C were 16.04 MJ/kg and 35.96 MJ/kg, respectively. Second, the energy utilization efficiency of the temperature control mode was higher than that of the power control mode. This was because the required microwave energy input in the temperature control mode (40.32–65.52 MJ) was lower than that in the power control mode (72.80–88.00 MJ). This can be proven by the integral calculation results of output power and reaction time. Third, during the process of microwave pyrolysis, the ability of sludge to absorb microwave energy and convert it into heat (tanθ) first decreased and then increased due to the water evaporation and subsequent formation of pyrolysis residues. Therefore, choosing a suitable pyrolysis mode (temperature control mode) and condition (800 °C) is crucial to improving the efficiencies of resource recovery and energy utilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainable generation of green energy and fine chemicals from carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most desirable and promising route for justifying the atmospheric CO2 build-up and carbon sequestration. This additionally serves to mitigate or defer global warming and avoid serious climate change. Renewable carbon is a possible source to reduce CO2 emission and avoid the combustion of coal and petroleum products. In this context, there is a dire need to introduce modern industrial procedures to develop new carbon recycling strategies for CO2, like spent carbon from CO2. The role of diverse industrial processes for the proper utilization of renewable carbon would fruitfully simulate the natural procedure. For the past few decades, both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis approaches have been useful for the conversion of CO2. Still, unfortunately, none of them addressed the current safety needs, cost-effectiveness, efficiency, reaction conditions, and selectivity. This review signifies the thermochemical and electrochemical approaches for the useful conversion of CO2, in the presence of catalyst material, to some high-value products of industrial interests, such as fuels (methane). Furthermore, several suitable examples are discussed to represent the potential and perspective of these technologies. In summary, a highly efficient conversion of CO2 to fuels and related high-value chemicals would fulfill the rising demands of diverse sectors of the modern world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Olive mill wastewater (OMWW) management is recognized as the major defy that olive oil industry is facing. Recently, we have established an eco-friendly strategy for the OMWW conversion into irrigation water sources, green biofuels and biofertilizers. This work is a part of a series of papers detailing the different steps established in this environmental friendly strategy for OMWW management. It deals with the bio-oil production and characterization during the pyrolysis of OMWW impregnated on olive pomace (OP) in a pyrolyzer pilot. Results show a bio-oil production yield of 36 wt% during the pyrolysis test. This yield could be attributed to the recovery of organic compounds from OMWW through OP impregnation and their conversion to bio-oil. The bio-oil properties show that viscosity and flash point values could reach the European standards. However, the lower heating values (26 MJ/kg) and the acidic character limit its direct use. These values are attributed to the higher water and oxygen contents. The GC/MS analysis confirms these properties showing the presence of phenolic molecules and long chain organic acids. Therefore, OMWW impregnation on OP and pyrolysis could be considered as a promising issue for bio-oil production. However, this bio-oil requires an upgrading step for a better valorization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bamboo has been considered a potential feedstock of energy for the future. It can be subjected to the pyrolysis for biofuels production. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) for bamboo was carried out prior to pyrolysis. The thermal degradation of bamboo was mainly between 230 and 420 °C. The conventional pyrolysis of bamboo was investigated in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor using silica sand. The product distribution and composition of pyrolysis bio-oil were dependent on biomass component and operating conditions such as pyrolysis temperature, fluidization velocity, and particle size of biomass. The fractional catalytic pyrolysis of bamboo was also studied to upgrade the pyrolysis vapor, using HZSM-5 and red mud. The highest yield of bio-oil was 54.03 wt% compared to 49.14 wt% and 50.34 wt% of HZSM-5 and red mud catalyst, respectively. In the red mud catalytic pyrolysis, the oxygen content was rejected from pyrolysis vapor mostly via decarboxylation to produce more CO2 than CO; in contrast, for the HZSM-5 catalytic pyrolysis, the production of CO through decarbonylation was more favored than CO2. The main composition of catalytic pyrolysis bio-oil was 4-vinylphenol, which was employed as a raw material source to synthesize valuable material for energy storage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The large quantities of residual biomass produced in the palm oil industry have become one of the main environmental and financial concerns of this industry. For this reason, biorefineries are gaining strength in recent years, since through their production model the residual biomass can be used as raw material to produce bioenergetics (biofuels and bio-products), hence contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to compare and evaluate alternatives to convert a conventional palm oil mill into a biorefinery considering energy and environmental sustainability indicators. In this context, this work presents a study of three scenarios: the first (I), the base case, consists of a traditional palm oil mill; the second (II) considers a palm oil mill working under the biorefinery concept that uses the fast pyrolysis process for the production of bio-oil and biochar; and the third (III) considers a biorefinery that, besides incorporating the pyrolysis process, has an extraction/transesterification stage for the production of biodiesel and glycerin in the palm oil mill. The surplus electricity index was calculated for the three scenarios, and scenario III was the most favorable, achieving 110.23 kW per ton of fresh fruit bunch with an overall efficiency of 82.69%. The environmental assessment carried out for scenario III indicates that environmental impacts of bio-oil production are 32.5% lower than the ones to produce electricity (climate change category) and 14.2% lower than environmental impacts to produce biodiesel (resources category), demonstrating that the production of bio-oil using fast pyrolysis result in lower environmental impacts compared with the other products obtained in the biorefinery. Finally, the Net Energy Ratio was calculated for the scenario with the best thermodynamic performance (scenario III: 21.17) and compared with previously published studies, resulting in a gain of total energy flow of up to 17.77. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Palm oil mill effluent (POME), a liquid waste from the palm oil industry, presents an alternative source for biodiesel production without interfering with food supply. This study attempted to produce biodiesel from untreated POME with aqueous ethanol using Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase as a biocatalyst. The effects of enzyme concentration, alcohol to oil ratio, and ethanol concentration were considered in the transesterification reaction. The optimum conditions were 2100 U lipase loading, 4 : 1 ethanol to oil molar ratio, and 45% (v/v) ethanol concentration at 40 °C reaction, and under 24 hours. The maximum fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) yield reached 97.43% (w/w) under these conditions. Integration of dilute ethanol for the conversion of POME to biodiesel could be promising as both feedstocks could be obtained from the same location, and thus reduce the logistical burden on biodiesel production.

AB  - This work details the synthesis and characterization of iron nanoparticles (GT-INP) from green-tea extract and its effect on biohydrogen production from CO by anaerobic biomass. Analysis of the GT-INP by UV–visible spectroscopy revealed spherical or quasi-spherical shape of the iron oxide nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the presence of iron oxide (Fe3O4) and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH)) in the GT-INP. The appearance of strong vibrational bands in fourier transform infrared spectra indicated the presence of amide, C–N and hydroxyl groups due to flavonoids, alkaloids and polyphenols as capping agents in the GT-INP. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and field emission transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that the size of GT-INP was within 50–90 nm range with a spherical shaped aggregated structure. In the presence of GT-INP at 1000 mg/l, more than 56 ± 5.32% enhancement in aqueous solubility of CO was achieved along with a maximum H2 production of 1.58 ± 0.13 mmol/l by anaerobic biomass, which is nearly 44% more than that obtained without any GT-INP addition. Continuous bioreactor study using a gas lift reactor further established the potential of GT-INP in improving biohydrogen production from CO with a maximum H2 titre of 30.7 mmol/l due to GT-INP addition in the system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, hybrid bio-support catalyst (BSC) has been prepared for the production of biodiesel from Castor oil. Lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia has been immobilized on a hybrid bio-support material (BSM) by entrapment method and characterized. The highest immobilized lipase activity and loading efficiency were 87.28 (U/g) and 55.2%, respectively. The composition of Castor oil expelled from Castor seeds evaluated through Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) technique. GCMS spectra show the percentage composition of ricinoleic, linoleic, oleic, stearic, palmitic, and nonanoic acid, as 78.67, 9.62, 6.65, 1.53, 2.19, and 0.08, respectively. Optimized conditions for the transesterification of Castor oil with propan-2-ol as acyl acceptor in solvent free medium were, 10% immobilized lipase relying on oil-weight, molar ratio of alcohol to oil (6:1) at 50±1°C for the period of 24 h. The product yield was estimated as 75% while the calculated conversion of biodiesel was approximately 78%. The reusability of hybrid BSC for 12 runs was found to be 70% of its initial biodiesel yield after 6 cycles. The properties of oil and biodiesel were calculated using American Standards for Testing Material (ASTM) D6751; formation of biodiesel confirmed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding biomass pyrolysis is important for biofuel production and fire safety. Inverse modelling is an increasingly used technique to find values for the kinetic parameters that control pyrolysis. The quality of this inverse modelling depends on, in order of importance, the quality of the experimental data, the kinetic model, and the optimisation method used. Unlike the two former components, the optimisation method chosen, i.e. the combination of algorithm and objective function, is rarely discussed in the literature. This work compares the accuracy and efficiency of five commonly used advanced algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, AMALGAM, Shuffled Complex Evolution, Cuckoo Search, and Multi-Start Nonlinear Program) and a simple algorithm (Random Search) to find the kinetic parameters for cellulose and wood pyrolysis at the microscale via thermogravimetric measurements in the literature. These algorithms are combined with seven objective functions comprising concentrated and dispersed functions. The results show that for cellulose (simple chemistry) the use of an advanced optimisation algorithm is unnecessary, since a simple algorithm achieves similarly high accuracy with higher efficiency (40% to 350% faster). However, for wood (complex chemistry) a combination of an advanced algorithm and a concentrated function greatly improves accuracy. Among the 25 possible combinations we investigated for wood, Shuffled Complex Evolution with mean square error objective function performed best with 0.91% error in mass loss rate and 0.88 × 1013 CPU time. These findings can guide the selection of the optimal optimisation method to use in inverse modelling of kinetic parameters, improving accuracy and efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Within the framework of an economy excessively dependent on fossil resources, the concept of sustainable development, aimed at obtaining environmentally friendly consumer goods, has given rise to the development of biorefineries. These facilities are based on the production of biofuels and platform chemicals from the most abundant raw material on the planet: biomass. The use of biomass such as wood or lignocellulosic residues makes it possible to seize opportunities offered by the implementation of renewable feedstocks, which in many cases can be embedded within the perspective of circular economy, through the exploitation of residual fractions. Among the multiple basic chemicals that can be obtained from biomass, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a great potential, as it is the precursor of poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF) polymer, which is considered a feasible substitute for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The purpose of this study is the simulation and environmental analysis of two separation routes for FDCA production with the objective of identifying the environmental hotspots at an early stage of the process design. The present study addresses the modelling of FDCA production from hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) by heterogeneous catalysis using commercial Aspen Plus® V9 software. Two different downstream separation options resulting in purified FDCA were simulated: crystallization (Scenario A) and distillation (Scenario B). The estimation of the mass and energy balances were considered in the development of the data inventories required to conduct Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA-assisted decision making identifies the conceptual configuration that would eventually lead to the least environmental burden. In the case of Scenario A, the stage with the highest environmental burden was the reaction unit, due to the use of HMF. In Scenario B, on the other hand, the separation stages contributed most to the impact due to their high energy demand. The combination of process simulation and LCA allowed acquiring a detailed vision of the process, through the analysis of the sensitivity of the environmental profile to different process parameters. The operating pressure in flash and distillation units for both scenarios affects plant operation by influencing total energy consumption and FDCA production. The sensitivity of environmental outcomes to these parameters was also studied, resulting in small variations. Thus, the results of this assessment provide strategic information of the early decision-making process on potential configurations for industrial-scale FDCA production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We performed microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) of rice husk (RH) over an alkali-treated HZSM-5 zeolite, for production of hydrocarbons. The treatment consisted in the modification of the HZSM-5 by the organic base tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) solution at several concentrations. We characterized the resulting catalysts by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption, and temperature-programmed sorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). The results suggest that the TPAOH treatment generated mesoporous structures in the HZSM-5, while preserving its microporous structure and crystallinity. We obtained the highest yield (45.9%) of hydrocarbons from MACFP of rice husk (RH) at 550 °C. As the TPAOH concentration increases, the relative content of BTEX hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) reaches a maximum value of 22.9% at 2.0 mol/L. A comparison of results obtained over the organic base TPAOH (HZSM-5 modified by 2.0 mol/L TPAOH solution) with those obtained over an inorganic base (HZSM-5 modified by 2.0 mol/L NaOH solution) shows a 4.3% increase in the relative content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for the TPAOH. In addition, the TPAOH-treated catalyst shows excellent selectivity of BTEX (58.5%), which is higher than the selectivity obtained with the parent HZSM-5 (51.2%) and NaOH-treated HZSM-5 (53.9%). The TPAOH-modified HZSM-5 catalyst effectively reduced coke formation by 4.6% compared to MACFP over the parent HZSM-5, most likely because TPAOH decreases the concentration of strong acidic sites on the outer surface of the catalyst, creating a mesoporous structure while retaining the weak acidic sites on the HZSM-5 inner surface. The new catalyst generated in this work contains a moderate amount of mesopores structures, which allows for effective upgrading of pyrolysis vapors while simultaneously reducing coke formation, thereby addressing a significant problem in the development of the catalytic fast pyrolysis process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) and ethyl levulinate (EL) in the presence of tungsten disulfide has been studied for the first time. The catalyst was synthesized at 600 °C in a tubular furnace using elemental tungsten and sulfur to obtain multilayered flakes/sheets of WS2. The textural and morphological properties of the synthesized WS2 catalyst were characterized using XRD, Raman, SEM, SEM-EDX, TEM, TEM-EDX, HR-TEM, SAED, and surface area analyzer, which showed the formation of multiple two-dimensional layers of sheet/flake-type structure. Activity test of the catalyst in a microwave-assisted reaction resulted in 100% fructose conversion and 62% EMF yield for the experiment performed at 160 °C temperature in 15 min. A qualitative analysis of the product samples using GC-MS spectrometry showed the presence of several intermediates and byproducts based on which a mechanistic insight into the production of EMF from fructose has been proposed.

AB  - Agricultural residues are one of the large untapped sources of bio-energy in Thailand, with over 30 million tons available per year. They may be utilized to generate renewable liquid and solid fuels. In this work, pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass residues (corncobs, coconut shells, and bamboo residue) was carried out in an ablative pyrolysis reactor with rotating blades. Influences of inert carrier gas flows (5–15 L/min) and rotating frequency (4–8 Hz) at a fixed hot plate temperature of 500 °C on generating bio-oil were investigated. Characterization of bio-oil as well as biochar products was performed. Maximum bio-oil yield was found to be about 50% w/w for coconut shell at 5 L/min of flowrate and 8 Hz of the rotating frequency, and 45% w/w for bamboo residues at the same condition. For corncob, the highest bio-oil yield was 72% w/w at 5 L/min of flowrate and 6 Hz of the rotating frequency. Solid char yields were around 23–28% w/w. The heating values of the liquid oil and solid char were about 20–25 and 23–30 MJ/kg, respectively. Rotating blade ablative reactor was able to generate high yields of bio-oil for agricultural residues. The main compounds of the bio-oil obtained were phenolics, including furfuran, organic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ethers, and ketones. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The multiproduct upgrade of ethanol and acetaldehyde to butadiene as a high-value chemical and butanol as a biofuel was investigated over the Y-SiO2 heterogeneous catalysts. The sum selectivity of butanol and butadiene is over 90% for the Y-SiO2 catalysts with Y/Si ratios from 0.05 to 0.35, while the distribution changes with the Y/Si ratio. The highest butadiene selectivity of 81.2% with a butanol selectivity of 10.3% was obtained over the Y-SiO2 catalyst with a Y/Si ratio of 0.05. To study the effect of the catalyst structure and acid-base property on catalytic performance, the Y-SiO2 catalysts with different Y/Si ratios were further comprehensively characterized by techniques including nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 29Si cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si CP MAS NMR), Fourier transform infrared resonance (FTIR), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS), temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 and NH3 (NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD), and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Pyridine-IR). Results from XPS, 29Si CP MAS NMR, FTIR, and UV-Vis DRS reveal the electron transfer and the formation of chemical linkages between Y2O3 and SiO2 rather than the simple deposition of Y2O3 on the surface of the fumed silica. What is more, the amounts and coordination of Y-O-Si linkages on the surface of the fumed silica vary with the Y/Si ratio varying, thus resulting in variation of the acid-base property. Combining with the catalytic activity, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and Pyridine-IR results indicate that the strength of acid and base sites has a significant role on the catalytic performance. The base sites with stronger strength contribute to the formation of butanol. To obtain a high butadiene selectivity, a balance of the acid-base property is necessary. A combination of Y3+ Lewis acid sites with a higher density ratio of stronger acid sites to the total acid sites and base sites with an intermediate strength is inclined toward a high butadiene selectivity. It means that a proper distribution between butadiene and butanol could be achieved by tuning the acid-base property of theY-SiO2 catalysts on the premise of a high C4 selectivity of over 90%.

AB  - Biofuels have gained much attention in the recent years. Microalgae hold tremendous potential for production of biofuels as a suitable alternative to conventional fossil fuels. However, in order to ensure sustainability of the biofuel production from microalgae, many issues needs to be considered. Large-scale production of such biofuels is often limited by high cost of production, various environmental concerns including water footprint, and low yield. The algal biorefinery strategy, which can integrate several different conversion technologies to produce biofuels, holds potential for reducing the overall production cost. This paper is a review on various aspects associated with algal cultivation, lipid extraction and biodiesel production. Different factors reported to affect the process of algal cultivation and advancements in transesterification process and product recovery are summarized here. A brief on biorefinery approach is also discussed. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Microbial electrosynthesis is an innovative technology capable of producing biofuels (particularly CH4) via CO2 reduction. Electron-uptaking from biocathode by microorganisms is the key step in the process of microbial electrosynthesis. However, the lack of understanding of electron transfer behaviors and their affecting factors largely limit the development of microbial electrosynthesis. Herein, we investigated the effects of initial startup cathode potentials (-0.7,-0.8,-0.9,-1.0 and-1.1»V vs. Ag/AgCl) on the electron transfer behaviors of biocathodes. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed typical sigmoidal catalytic currents corresponding to the CO2 reduction on the biocathodes started up at-0.7 and-0.8»V, but not on the other biocathodes. The CH4 production rate, Faradaic efficiency, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and microbial community were also investigated. All the results indicated that the startup cathode potentials determine the electron transfer behaviors of biocathode: The biocathodes started up at-0.7 and-0.8»V mainly possessed a direct electron transfer manner, while the biocathodes started up at-0.9,-1.0 and-1.1»V mainly possessed an indirect electron transfer pathway. This study provides a guidance for the development of CH4-producing biocathodes with a desired electron transfer behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we present the ethyl esters biodiesel production from Nannochloropsis oculata and Spirulina sp. microalgal lipids on 60 wt% CaO on Al2O3 catalyst at 50 °C and 1.0 atm. The activity of the catalyst was studied as a function of ethanol:lipid molar ratios, catalyst amounts and reaction times. It was found that 6 wt% of the lipids as catalyst amount resulted in 59% biodiesel yield in 30 min at 12 of ethanol:lipid molar ratio whereas 90–99% biodiesel yield was obtained at 24 and 48 of ethanol:lipid molar ratios. In order to achieve 90–99% yields, the basic strength was found to be weak and to be in the form of bicarbonate, whereas high basicity was not necessary. Besides, pure CaO and Al2O3 were not active under the same reaction conditions. We found that the glycerolysis of triacylglyceride occurred in series with the reverse of the transesterification of the triacylglyceride when the catalyst amount was 6 wt% of the lipids and the ethanol:lipid molar ratio was 24 and 48 and the reaction time was 60 min. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Omega-3 fatty acids, and specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are important and essential nutrients for human health. Thraustochytrids are recognised as commercial strains for nutraceuticals production, they are group of marine oleaginous microorganisms capable of co-synthesis of DHA and other valuable carotenoids in their cellular compartment. The present study sought to optimize DHA and squalene production by the thraustochytrid Schizochytrium limacinum SR21. The highest biomass yield (0.46 g/gsubstrate) and lipid productivity (0.239 g/gsubstrate) were observed with 60 g/L of glucose, following cultivation in a bioreactor, with the DHA content to be 67.76% w/wtotal lipids. To reduce costs, cheaper feedstocks and simultaneous production of various value-added products for pharmaceutical or energy use should be attempted. To this end, we replaced pure glucose with organosolv-pretreated spruce hydrolysate and assessed the simultaneous production of DHA and squalene from S. limacinum SR21. After the 72 h of cultivation period in bioreactor, the maximum DHA content was observed to 66.72% w/wtotal lipids that was corresponded to 10.15 g/L of DHA concentration. While the highest DHA productivity was 3.38 ± 0.27 g/L/d and squalene reached a total of 933.72 ± 6.53 mg/L (16.34 ± 1.81 mg/gCDW). In summary, we show that the co-production of DHA and squalene makes S. limacinum SR21 appropriate strain for commercial-scale production of nutraceuticals. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The kinetics of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis is beneficial for reactor design to efficiently produce biofuel and bioenergy. Pyrolysis is a well-developed thermochemical process that converts biomass into valuable gaseous products, bio-oils, and solid products. To understand the complex pyrolysis process of lignocellulosic biomass, three model components of cellulose, hemicelluloses (xylan), and lignin were pyrolyzed using a thermogravimetric analyzer. An independent parallel reaction (IPR) kinetic model was optimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The IPR kinetic models of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin could be modeled with 1 pseudo-reaction, 4 pseudo-reactions, and 5 pseudo-reactions, respectively, and good fit qualities higher than 95% can be achieved (except a few cases for lignin). Four different heating rates of 1, 5, 20, and 40 °C·min−1 were applied to examine the effect of heating rate on the pyrolysis process. When increasing the heating rate, the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) peaks shifted to a higher temperature range, stemming from the thermal lag between the samples and heating environment. Overall, the temperature ranges of the thermal decomposition for cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin were within 269–394, 170–776, and 127–791 °C, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Among the various problems the world is facing, two problems are addressed in this paper. On the one hand, biomass, the fourth largest and most important renewable energy option that can provide different forms of energy, is criticized because it competes, sometimes, with the food chain. On the other hand, the amount of municipal sewage sludge has continued to increase over the years, and its disposal remains a crucial point of discussion between urban planners, wastewater managers, and leaders of environmental protection. To address this problem, researchers are directing their focus toward alternatives to conventional biomass resources, such as organic wastes and residues. Thus, municipal sewage sludge is a likely candidate for energy and high-value added material production. Regarding this issue, one of the main methods proposed by researchers is the pyrolysis process. The aim of this paper is to review the research conducted on sewage sludge conversion through the pyrolysis process. After characterizing municipal sewage sludge, we present a summary of the sewage sludge pyrolysis process. Then, the effects of some of the most influential parameters are examined. The last main part of this work is dedicated to the nitrogen transformation pathway during this process. © 2020 American Chemical Society

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is considered as a promising technique for wastes conversion into carbon rich materials for various energetic, environmental and agricultural applications. In this work, the HTC of olive mill wastewater (OMWW) was investigated at different temperatures (180–220 °C) and both, the solid (i.e., hydrochars) and the final process liquid derived from the thermal conversion process were deeply analyzed. Results showed that the solid yield was affected by the temperature, i.e., decrease from 57% to 25% for temperatures of 180 °C and 220 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the hydrochars presented an increasing fixed carbon percentage with the increase of the carbonization temperature, suggesting that decarboxylation is the main reaction driving the HTC process. The decrease in the O/C ratio promoted an increase of the high heating value (HHV) by 32% for hydrochar prepared at 220 °C. The process liquids were sampled and their organic contents were analyzed using GC–MS technique. Acids, alcohols, phenols and sugar derivatives were detected and their concentrations varied with carbonization temperatures. The assessment of the physico-chemical properties of the generated HTC by-products suggested the possible application of the hydrochars for energetic insights while the liquid fraction could be practical for in agricultural field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this work was to analyse the influence of the pyrolysis temperature and feedstock composition on biochar yield and physicochemical properties. The raw materials to be pyrolyzed were characterized, and an experimental design was applied to carry out a statistical study. Three operating temperatures (673, 773 and 873 K) and two bio-wastes (nut and almond shells) were used. Several correlations linking the values of different physicochemical properties of the biochar with the two variables were proposed. On the basis of these correlations, it was found that almost all physicochemical characteristics of both almond and nut shell-based biochars depended on both the pyrolysis temperature and bio-waste composition, and an interaction of the two variables was observed in our experiments. Only the biochar yield did not exhibit an interaction between these two variables. The biochars presented H/C and O/C ratios and higher heating values similar to those of bituminous coal, confirming their potential as solid bio-fuels. They also presented high K and Ca contents. The obtained values for the aromaticity factor, stable C mass fraction and recalcitrance potential, indicated that the biochars could also be used for soil amendments, especially as acidic or basic compounds, according to their pH values. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The European Union has set an ambitious plan for addressing the Global Challanges in the coming years. One of these challenges is the use of biomass and the production of biomass-derived products following the spirit of a circular economy. Biogas obtained from biomass anaerobic digestion could play a pivotal role in this strategy. Herein an innovative strategy for synergizing biogas upgrading to biomethane and formic acid production from CO2 is presented. A profitability analysis of the combined biogas upgrading – CO2 utilization process was conducted to assess the economic viability of this novel approach. The profitability study focuses mainly on net present value and profitability index. Even though the process is environmentally favourable, negative profitability results are obtained. To revert the negative outputs, out of the market formic acid prices (1767–3135 €/t) would be needed to achieve a net present value equal to zero. The alternative of feed-in tariffs biomethane subsidies needs high values (121.1–269.4 €/MW) to reach profitable scenarios. These unsuccessful profitability results are ascribed to high consumables costs, mainly associated with the catalytic conversion of a CO2-rich feedstock. A 80% reduction of catalysts costs can considerably improve net present value up to 50%. This result indicates that further research is needed to find econimocally appealing catalysts to perform this process. The effect of biomethane subsidies as percentage of investment was also considered, evidencing encouraging results for small scale plants. © 2020

AB  - In this study, three types of biomass were first pretreated with an aqueous phase bio-oil instead of traditional acid washing. Then, the washed samples were pretreated with drying (100 ℃, 30 min) and torrefaction (250 ℃, 30 min) using a parabolic-trough solar receiver system. The subsequent pyrolysis was performed at 550 ℃ for 10 min using a parabolic-dish solar receiver system. Results showed that the solar energy can effectively ensure the temperature required for biomass drying, torrefaction, and pyrolysis, having thus a potential to replace the conventional electric heating or fossil fuel heating. Such a strategy combines the advantages of the independent pretreatments, i.e., leaching out of metallic species and reduction of oxygen content. Consequently, the high heating value of bio-oil increased remarkably, the generation of acids was strongly inhibited, whereas the formation of phenols and anhydrosugars was promoted. Therefore, the method proposed herein is promising for upgrading of biomass and bio-oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, biodiesel was used to upgrade bio-oil by extracting the high-quality fuel fractions in bio-oil through solvent extraction. After the extraction, the upper layer blends of biodiesel and the high-quality bio-oil components, also called the “extraction phase liquid”, was obtained and denoted as EPBB. Firstly, Thermogravimetric (TG) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses indicated that the light components originally in bio-oil, such as alcohols, ethers, ketones and carboxylic acids were extracted from bio-oil to biodiesel and formed the EPBB. Then the fuel properties of EPBB were measured at different temperatures. The results showed that the density of EPBB was higher, while its viscosity, surface tension and lower heating value (LHV) were lower than those of biodiesel. Accordingly, EPBB revealed better atomization and evaporation characteristics as compared to biodiesel. Finally, the engine performance of EPBB was tested on an unmodified direct-injection diesel engine. When compared with biodiesel, the ignition delay of EPBB was longer, the premixed combustion duration was longer, while the total combustion duration was shorter. The fuel economy of EPBB was comparable to that of biodiesel, and the NOx, soot, CO and UHC emissions of EPBB were all lower than those of biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a widely adopted tool, which is regarded as a suitable set of methods to evaluate sustainability in a variety of energy applications. The MCDA is usually performed employing a deterministic approach. Such an approach is rather not adequate to include model uncertainties connected with both: decision maker preferences (criteria weights) and process input data. By considering the stochastic nature of uncertainties, it is possible to generate results that can easily be analyzed statistically. In addition, such an approach allows investigating the consequences of the resulting uncertainty of multi-attribute aggregation on the final decision. In this study, we define, analyze and compare four different technologies of biodiesel production from used cooking oil (UCO) using probabilistic MCDA. Among the criteria, we consider energy, economic, environmental, as well as social aspects. To evaluate the uncertainty of the final results, we propose a novel method, coupling Monte Carlo simulation and method of data reconciliation. Firstly, we present the results of the deterministic case, in which we assume the exact values of criteria and the preferences. Besides, we investigate on a sensitivity of the results to identify the major factors affecting the economic, energy, environmental and social viability of biodiesel production. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis of the contributions of the different phases of the UCO processing to the resulting criteria. Finally, we introduce inaccurate or uncertain criteria values and criteria preferences to evaluate the uncertainty of the results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The reported study discusses fuel-grade mahua oil methyl esters production from Madhuca indica oil, utilizing Delonix regia pods as a precursor to develop activated carbon support for preparing sulfonated carbon catalyst by H2SO4 impregnation. Raw pods were found to be thermally stable based on TGA analysis, making it suitable as raw material for catalyst synthesis. The catalyst is characterized using BET, XRD, SEM and FT-IR to check desired properties like surface area, porosity enhancement and doping of required functional groups. MOME production is optimized through L16 Taguchi design. Optimum yield of 97.04% is observed at 50 °C for 1 h with 4% w/w catalyst, methanol:oil of 6:1 and 1000 rpm. Catalyst load (1−4% w/w) affects the reaction most prominently, while methanol to oil molar ratio (3:1–12:1) is insignificant. The optimal product is characterized through ASTM standardized tests and gas chromatography analysis and conforms to acceptable biodiesel properties. The reaction adheres to pseudo-first order kinetics with low EA (4.257 kJ/mol) and high A (174.66 min−1). Catalyst shows appreciable reusability with &gt;85% yield after 4 uses. Cost analysis of catalyst preparation shows that indigenously developed catalyst cuts down biodiesel production costs, thus the production process discussed is lucrative for commercialization. © 2019

AB  - The objective of this work is to evaluate the potential of oil palm biomass (OPB) in terms of physicochemical properties for producing biofuels via pyrolysis processes. The OPB included oil palm trunk (OPT), oil palm fronds (OPF), oil palm shell (OPS), oil palm roots (OPR), oil palm decanter cake (OPDC), empty fruit bunches (EFB), oil palm fiber (OPFB), and oil palm sewage sludge (OPSS). Their physicochemical properties are considered on several physical, chemical, and thermal aspects. The results showed that particle size distribution and bulk density of ground OPB were different. The proximate analysis results of OPB were consistent with the lignocellulose content and extractives. The carbon and hydrogen content of the OPB were also correlated with the organic components. Some OPB contained high lignin and extractives. The lignin content of OPB strongly influenced to thermal decomposition trend. OPB contained high inorganic elements such as potassium (K), calcium (C), and iron (Fe). The higher heating value and potential use as energy equivalent with fossil fuels of the OPB were relatively low. OPB had low thermal conductivity, and the dielectric constant, loss factor, and tangent loss of the OPB were also low. Thus, these results will be beneficial for the researchers and biofuel producers for choosing the appropriate OPB, as well as the operating conditions and reactor types. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this investigation, three chemical processes for biodiesel production evaluated based on the financial standpoint. Due to its strongness and flexibility in economic evaluations, the COMFAR III software utilized for assessing processes. The alkali catalyzed process using virgin vegetable oil (process I), an-acid catalyzed process utilizing waste cooking oil (process II), and two-step supercritical methanol process using waste cooking oil (process III) considered as three deferent chemical processes and financial analyzes applied on all processes. The results of financial evaluation revealed that the process II with 2.992 million $, had the lowest manufacturing prices and with 7.541 million $ net present value would be considered as the most attractive proposal for investment. However, concerning total equipment costs of process III (1.141 million $) and its fixed investment prices (2.158 million $), this process selected as the most economically attractive process. In the next step, to evaluate the impacts of increased sales revenue, reduction in fixed assets, and operating costs on net present value, a sensitivity analysis was carried out. Sensitivity evaluation revealed that alteration in operating costs significantly impacts the net present value, and this significant change is more tangible in the process III. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated the production of biodiesel from the microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa by direct transesterification using 2-methyltetrahydrofuran or cyclopentyl methyl ether co-solvents as an alternative to chloroform. Acid-catalyzed transesterification using hydrochloric acid was developed for biodiesel production. Biodiesel was purified by column chromatography using one of the two green solvents as eluents. The highly ecological biodiesel quality was compared to the biodiesel produced using chloroform as co-solvent. A 33 factorial design was conducted to optimize the production of fatty acid methyl esters, being the independent variables investigated: solvent and catalyst volume, solvent and catalyst ratio (methanol:co-solvent:hydrochloric acid), and temperature, with a reaction time of 150 min. Biodiesel production was mainly influenced by temperature increase. The achieved yields using cyclopentyl methyl ether, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and chloroform were 71–92%, 67–91%, and 61–76%, respectively. The fatty acid methyl esters profile of biodiesel produced with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and cyclopentyl methyl ether consisted of approximately 45% polyunsaturated components. The biodiesel obtained was within the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. The replacement of fossil solvents used in direct transesterification of biomass with a green solvent resulted in a further ecological biodiesel production process towards a circular bioeconomy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study evaluated the sequential biodiesel-bioethanol production from seaweeds. A total of 22 macroalgal species were collected at different seasons and screened based on lipid and carbohydrate contents as well as biomass production. The promising species was selected, based on the relative increase in energy compounds (REEC, %), for further energy conversion. Seasonal and annual biomass yields of the studied species showed significant variations. The rhodophyte Amphiroa compressa and the chlorophyte Ulva intestinalis showed the highest annual biomass yield of 75.2 and 61.5 g m−2 year−1, respectively. However, the highest annual carbohydrate productivity (ACP) and annual lipid productivity (ALP) were recorded for Ulva fasciata and Ulva intestinalis (17.0 and 3.0 g m−2 year−1, respectively). The later was selected for further studies because it showed 14.8% higher REEC value than Ulva fasciata. Saturated fatty acids (SAFs) showed 73.4%, with palmitic acid as a dominant fatty acid (43.8%). Therefore, biodiesel showed high saturation degree, with average degree of unsaturation (ADU) of 0.508. All the measured biodiesel characteristics complied the international standards. The first route of biodiesel production (R1) from Ulva intestinalis showed biodiesel recovery of 32.3 mg g−1 dw. The hydrolysate obtained after saccharification of the whole biomass (R2) and lipid-free biomass (R3) contained 1.22 and 1.15 g L−1, respectively, reducing sugars. However, bioethanol yield from R3 was 0.081 g g−1 dw, which represented 14.1% higher than that of R2. Therefore, application of sequential biofuel production using R3 resulted in gross energy output of 3.44 GJ ton−1 dw, which was 170.9% and 82.0% higher than R1 and R2, respectively. The present study recommended the naturally-grown Ulva intestinalis as a potential feedstock for enhanced energy recovery through sequential biodiesel-bioethanol production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Digestate is a nutrient-rich substance produced by anaerobic digestion, it contains organic and inorganic compounds as well as micro-organisms. The European Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) gives the regulations concerning the wider implementation of digestate. Due to a significant amount of organic matter in the digestate, it can be utilized as a solid biofuel, a soil amendment or a substrate for activated carbon production. HTC is a pretreatment process which can change digestate into potentially more hydrophobic product with higher energy potential. In this study, two kinds of digestate were examined as a potential feedstock for preparing hydrochar applied as a porous material and a solid biofuel. First digestate sample was a clean digestate from a typical biogas plant, performing anaerobic digestion of typical agricultural residues (cow dung). The second one was a digestate from wet fraction of municipal solid waste, after separation at the MSW sorting plant. HTC was performed in the autoclave, at 200 °C process temperature, 4.5 h residence time, under the saturation pressure of water. The proximate and ultimate analysis of hydrochars, along with porosimetry and morphology structure were examined. Additionally, the thermal behaviour under pyrolysis and combustion was analysed using TGA. HTC resulted in increased carbon contents for both types of digestate. Results of DSC and TGA analysis suggests improved ignition due to HTC. HTC increased total pore volume in both of the cases. The change was most visible in the macropore range. © 2020 The Authors

In the Indian context, due to the energy needs, agricultural growth, surrounding degradation and rural development these biofuels have achieved an acknowledgment as an alternative. Biofuels derived from the bio seeds such as rubber seed oil, cottonseed oil, jatropha and rapeseed oil etc. can hold the carbon emissions from vehicles in an efficient and economical method. In this research paper, an attempt has been made with blends from bio-seed based Sapindus seed oil with nano additive as an alternative for diesel. Its performance and emission characteristics were investigated on the constant speed single cylinder CI engine and results were compared. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - 2, 5-Dimethylfuran (DMF), which is one of the most promising liquid biofuels, has received widely concern due to the development and utilization of biomass energy. In this work, Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts with different nickel content were prepared by a simple solid-phase grinding synthesis method and exhibited a significant activity for the selective hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce DMF. The characterization of catalysts was tested by XRD, FT-IR, TG-DTG and N2 adsorption–desorption techniques. The effects of nickel loading ratios, reaction conditions and reaction mechanism were investigated. Under optimal experimental conditions, HMF conversion of 91.2% and DMF selectivity of 96.2% were obtained. It was found that a suitable proportion of metal sites and acidic sites on the catalyst surface were important for the selective hydrogenolysis, and 5-methylfurfural was detected as an important intermediate product in this reaction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bacterial contamination causes various problems ranging from bacterial infection to biofouling. As an effective and non-toxic agent for bacterial de-contamination, glucose oxidase (GOx)-copper hybrid nanoflowers embedded with amine-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (NH2-MNPs), called ‘MNP-GOx NFs’, are developed. Positively-charged NH2-MNPs and negatively-charged GOx molecules are first interacted via electrostatic attraction which can be controlled by changing the buffer pH, and the follow-up addition of copper(II) sulfate leads to blooming of nanoflowers (MNP-GOx NFs) after incubation at room temperature for 3 days. MNP-GOx NFs show effective antibacterial activity by generating H2O2 from GOx-catalyzed glucose oxidation. For example, 99.9% killings of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli are achieved after 3 h treatment of 106/mL cells with 0.2 and 3.0 mg/mL MNP-GOx NFs, respectively, revealing that Gram-positive S. aureus with mono-layer membrane system is more vulnerable to the treatment of MNP-GOx NFs than Gram-negative E. coli with two-layer membrane system. MNP-GOx NFs can maintain 97% of bactericidal activity even after recycled uses by magnetic separation for eight times iterative bacterial killings. Finally, MNP-GOx NFs are employed for the fabrication of antibacterial gauzes. MNP-GOx NFs have also opened up a great potential for their applications in biosensors, biofuel cells and bioconversion as well as bacterial de-contamination. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The efficient transformation of biomass resources to biofuels has attracted much attention. Herein, ordered mesoporous alumina supported nickel-molybdenum sulfide catalysts (denoted as Ni-MoS2/mAl2O3) were prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method and used for the hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). Under mild conditions (130 °C, 1 MPa H2), the 5Ni-7MoS2/mAl2O3 catalyst achieved 95 % yield of DMF. The results of characterizations and DFT calculation showed that the active center was proposed to the coordinated unsaturated site (CUS) located at S-edge. And the intrinsic activity of CUS was directly related to the proportion of Mo substituted by Ni. The 5Ni-7MoS2/mAl2O3 catalyst containing CUS with high proportions of Ni replacing Mo showed higher TOF and lower apparent activated energy. Besides, 2-propanol can cooperate with molecular hydrogen to improve DMF yield by forming ethers that were easier to be hydrogenolyzed. The present findings provided a new catalytic system for converting HMF to DMF. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Precisely designing the morphology and size of nanostructures is vital in green chemistry as various advanced applications depend upon the shapes and dimensions of the functionalised materials. Herein, we report on a green and efficient self-assembly strategy for synthesising hollow polymeric nanospheres with tunable wall thicknesses. The morphology and shell thickness of the nanospheres can be easily tailored by rationally manipulating monomer and catalyst combinations during the one-pot Friedel-Crafts polymerisation process, without using any templates or surfactants. Heterogeneous solid sulfonic acid catalysts can be easily achievedviathe post-sulfonation strategy. These porous materials have preferable surface areas, ordered hollow pore structures, and accessible acidic sites, and they serve as promising catalysts for biodiesel production. This study provides insights into the production of template- and metal-free based catalysts for biofuel production, which is imperative for the green and efficient design and manufacture of high-activity heterogeneous catalysts. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - A synergistic effect of the activated limestone-based catalyst (LBC) and microwave irradiation on the transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) was screened using a two-level factorial design and response surface methodology. The catalyst was prepared using a wet-impregnation method and was characterised for its surface element, surface morphology, surface area and porosity. The reaction was performed in a purpose-built continuous microwave assisted reactor (CMAR), while the conversion and yield of biodiesel were measured using a gas chromatography. The results showed that the catalyst loading, methanol to oil molar ratio and the reaction time significantly affect the WCO conversion. The optimum conversion of oil to biodiesel up to 96.65% was achieved at catalyst loading of 5.47 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 12.21:1 and the reaction time of 55.26 min. The application of CMAR in this work reduced the transesterification time by about 77% compared to the reaction time needed for a conventional reactor. The biodiesel produced in this work met the specification of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D6751). Engine test results shows the biodiesel has a lower NOx and particulate matters emissions compared to petrodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to optimize, by composite central design coupled to response surface methodology, the enzymatic biodiesel production from oil coming from fish waste, and to characterize the obtained product. The lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus immobilized on octadecyl metacrylate beads was used as biocatalyst. Optimal conditions were temperature of 35 °C, 10% w/w of biocatalyst content and 216 rpm of agitation rate. Under optimal conditions, an experimental biodiesel yield of 75.3% was obtained after 24 h of reaction time. The biodiesel presented an acid value (0.9 ± 0.28 mg KOH/g) that was higher than the established limits, while other parameters like density (0.89 ± 0.01 g/mL), viscosity (5.3 ± 0.004 mm2/s), calorific value (38.1 ± 0.21 MJ/kg) and cloud point (10.5 ± 0.47 °C), complied with the recommendations of the ASTM D6751 standard. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Olive stones are a lignocellulosic biomass generated as a by-product in the olive oil industry. They are of interest for use as a feedstock in the production of biofuels and other bioproducts in a biorefinery context. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of sugar production from olive stones, as a first approach in a valorisation process for this by-product. The process strategy tested consisted of a sequential fractionation process of the lignocellulosic components of olive stones based on acid pretreatment and steam explosion followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. In the first acid step, the study of pretreatment temperature, sulfuric acid concentration and biomass loading led to optimized conditions of 128 °C, 10.5 g acid/100 g olive stones and 33 % solids. This yielded a pre-treatment liquor with a xylose recovery of 71 %. In the steam explosion pre-treatment, the influence of increasing temperature from 180 to 225 °C at a fixed time of 5 min was evaluated through the assessment of sugar recovery and the enzymatic digestibility of sequentially pretreated olive stones. This permitted the selection of the most adequate steam explosion conditions (i.e., 195 °C for 5 min). As a result of the combined pretreatment under the selected operation conditions, an overall sugar production yield of 83 % of the total sugar content in raw olive stones can be obtained, taking into account the different sugar streams generated along the whole process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Alternanthera philoxeroides, a notorious invasive aquatic weed, is a typical lignocellulosic feedstock for fermentative biohydrogen production. To improve the dark fermentation performance, steam-heated acid pretreatment and enzymolysis were employed to release reducing sugars from A. philoxeroides, and Enterobacter aerogenes ZJU1 mutagenized by 60Co-γ irradiation was used as the inoculum. Dilute acid accompanied by steam heating significantly disrupted the fiber structures of A. philoxeroides. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that many pores and fissures were generated in the surface of A. philoxeroides after pretreatment. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses showed that the pretreatment facilitated the transformation of cellulose I to cellulose II in A. philoxeroides biomass, resulting in the increase of amorphous regions and the decrease of crystallinity. Under the optimum pretreatment condition (1.0 v/v% H2SO4, 135 °C for 15 min), the reducing sugar yield reached 0.354 g/g A. philoxeroides, which was further increased to 0.575 g/g A. philoxeroides after enzymolysis. The biohydrogen yield increased by 59.9% from 38.9 mL/g volatile solids (VS) of raw A. philoxeroides to 62.2 mL/gVS of the pretreated one. As compared to the wild strain, E. aerogenes ZJU1 contributed to an increase of 31.8% in the biohydrogen yield from pretreated A. philoxeroides. Further optimization of bacteria suspensions significantly increased the maximum biohydrogen production rate from 1.42 to 4.64 mL/gVS/h, advanced the biohydrogen production peak, and resulted in an increase of 42.8% in biohydrogen yield to 89.8 mL/gVS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The strong new restrictions in the vehicle CO2 emissions together with the instability of the fossil fuels reserves reinforces the necessity to continue developing high efficiency combustion engines that operate with renewable energy sources. Bio-ethanol appears as a potential fuel to replace well-established fossil fuels, such as gasoline, due to the overall carbon neutral emission. In addition, the high-octane number allows to increase the compression ratio of the engine to improve the thermal efficiency. Apart from the CO2, the emissions legislation restricts the NOx and particle matter emissions to ultra-low values, and they will continue decreasing down to almost zero. In this work, two advanced dual-fuel combustion modes using bio-ethanol as main fuel are studied. A pre-chamber ignition system (PCIS) using bio-ethanol and hydrogen, and a reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion mode operating with bio-ethanol/diesel was selected due to the potential to reduce NOx emissions. These combustion technologies were studied by a numerical 0-D vehicle simulations in homologation and real-life driving cycles for a range extender hybrid powertrain. As a baseline, the original manufacturer spark ignition (SI) no-hybrid powertrain fueled with pure bio-ethanol was used. The powertrain components and control system were optimized to obtain the maximum overall vehicle efficiency, and low CO2-NOx emissions. Finally, a life cycle analysis (LCA) was performed to study the global potential of the bio-ethanol to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A battery electric vehicle (BEV) and a gasoline SI no-hybrid vehicle were added for comparison. The results show that the RCCI mode presents the highest potential to reduce the NOx emissions. However, the PCIS allows to reduce the tank to wheel CO2 emissions up to 60 g/km when high rates of H2 are used. The LCA-GHG for the vehicles using bio-ethanol is 50% and 95% lower than a BEV and SI-gasoline vehicle, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyclohexanone is an important oxygenated intermediate in the conversion of lignin to bio-fuel. Following the importance of bio-fuel production and conversion of lignin-derived bio-oils, the deoxygenation of cyclohexanone is pursued. Two hydrotreating catalysts composed of cobalt, molybdenum, and alumina support were evaluated at 300–400 °C and 1–15 bar. The catalysts showed high activity and selectivity toward the conversion of cyclohexanone in the presence of hydrogen. The major obtained hydrocarbons were cyclohexane, cyclohexene, benzene, and cyclohexylbenzene indicating the capability of producing hydrocarbon-rich products. The catalysts composed of 3.4 wt% cobalt and 13.6 wt% molybdenum gave more than 89% cyclohexanone conversion and 100% hydrocarbon selectivity at 400 °C and 15 bar. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study was aimed at environmentally analyzing an ultrasound-assisted system converting waste cooking oil (WCO) into biodiesel in order to make decisions on its operating conditions. Twenty-seven different experiments (scenarios) carried out at three levels of methanol content, methanolysis temperature, and reaction duration, were compared from environmental viewpoint using the Impact 2002 + life cycle impact assessment approach. The effects of different scenarios on four endpoint impact categories including human health, ecosystem quality, climate change, and resource consumption were quantitatively evaluated and comprehensively discussed. The effects of material and energy flows on the endpoint impact categories were also appraised through a sensitivity analysis. Overall, the experimental variables profoundly affected all the endpoint impact categories considered herein. Methanol content exhibited the highest influence on the studied impact categories, while methanolysis temperature showed the lowest impact on these environmental indices. Overall, methanol:oil molar ratio of 6:1, methanolysis temperature of 60 °C, and reaction duration of 10 min could be recommend as the most suitable operating conditions from both technical and environmental perspectives. The environmental impacts of biodiesel produced at the selected conditions were significantly lower than those of the conventional fossil-based diesel fuel. The sensitivity analysis showed that the electrical power utilized in the process was the most influential impact on the human health and climate change damage categories. The phosphoric acid utilized for neutralizing crude glycerol was the most effective input on the ecosystem quality damage category, while the methanol consumed in the process significantly affected the resource consumption damage category. The outcomes of this study revealed that LCA approach could offer relevant environmental impact indices supporting decision-making on the development of sustainable biodiesel production systems and on the identification of their optimal operating conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, added nano-catalysts to fuels has improved their thermo-physical properties. In present study, the alumina as additive with concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 ppm were added to B5 and B10 blends for evaluation of the engine performance, emissions, and vibration levels. An ANN model based on standard back-propagation learning algorithm for the engine was developed. Multi-layer perception network (MLP) was used for a non-linear mapping between the input and target parameters. The input or independent parameters were fuel blend, engine speed, fuel density, fuel viscosity, LHV, intake manifold pressure, fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, oxygen contained in exhaust gases, oil temperature, relative humidity, and ambient air pressure. Whereas, the target parameters separately were engine power, torque, emissions of CO, CO2, UHC, NO, RMS and Kurtosis of engine's vibration. The results for optimum ANN model showed, the training algorithm of back-propagation with 25-25 neurons in hidden layers (logsig-logsig) is able to predict different parameters of engine for different conditions. The corresponding R-values for training, validation and testing were 0.9999, 0.9994 and 0.9995, respectively. The performance and accuracy of the proposed ANN model was completely satisfactory. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of biodiesel using vegetable oil is an effective way to meet growing energy demands, which could potentially reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. The aim of this study was to evaluate grape seed (Vitis vinifera), Philippine tung (Reutealis trisperma), and kesambi (Schleichera oleosa) oils as potential feedstocks for biodiesel production to meet this demand. Firstly, biodiesels from these oils were produced and then their fatty acid methyl ester profiles and physicochemical properties were evaluated and compared with palm biodiesel. The results showed that the biodiesel produced from grape seed oil possessed the highest oxidation stability of 4.62 h. On the other hand, poor oxidation stability was observed for Philippine tung biodiesel at 2.47 h. The poor properties of Philippine tung biodiesel can be attributed to the presence of α-elaeostearic fatty acid. Furthermore, synthetic antioxidants (pyrogallol) and diesel were used to improve the oxidation stability. The 0.2 wt.% concentration of pyrogallol antioxidant could increase the oxidation stability of grape seed biodiesel to 6.24 h, while for kesambi and Philippine tung, biodiesels at higher concentrations of 0.3% and 0.4 wt.%, respectively, were needed to meet the minimum limit of 8 h. The blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at different ratios can also increase the oxidation stability. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The utilization of non-edible and low-cost feedstock in bioenergy research is getting more attention in recent decades. Catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids from waste oil feedstocks is a promising route to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons. Here we report the conversion of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), a low-value side product of physical refining of crude palm oil, into green diesel using a solventless and hydrogen-free deoxygenation (DO) reaction using catalytic deoxygenation over solid acid catalysts (Co/SBA-15, Ni/SBA-15, and Ni–Co/SBA-15) with total metal loadings of 5 wt%. Metal precursors (Ni, Co, Ni–Co) were doped on the mesostructured catalyst supporter, SBA-15 by wet impregnation. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with elemental mapping. The DO reaction was carried out in a semi-batch reactor with a catalyst loading of 10 wt% at 350 °C for 3 h. The use of both Ni/SBA-15 and Ni–Co/SBA-15 afforded products with high contents of liquid hydrocarbons (C8–C17) with yields of 85.8% and 88.1%, respectively, and selectivity for diesel-range hydrocarbons (C13–C17) above 85% were achieved. Cobalt seems to have a larger particle size, then associates with the carbon formation and introduces coke formation. It blocks some pores and deactivates the active sites of the catalyst, thus reducing the catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) of a novel process to produce ethanol from rice straw in India. The process has been successfully demonstrated and proposed to be scaled-up, and detailed LCA of that process is the key novel contribution of this work. Cradle-to-gate system boundary is considered, which includes rice farming, transportation, and processing at the biorefinery. 1 l of ethanol is used as the functional unit. The process data are based on the demonstration-scale plant as well as the scale-up plant of 100 kilo litres per day being designed based on the same process. The life cycle inventory data are taken from the Ecoinvent® database. OpenLCA 1.6 is used to develop the LCA model, and impact assessment is performed using ILCD 2011 midpoint indicators. The GWP was 2.82 kg of CO2 eq. per liter of ethanol using economic impact allocation. Electricity contributed 86% of the total impact, and use of hydroelectricity reduced the impact to 0.07 kg of CO2 eq. per liter of ethanol. If additional benefits due to this process are considered, the impact reduced to − 0.392 kg of CO2 eq. per liter of ethanol indicating considerable relative reduction in the GWP. Without allocation and implementing system expansion, the impact was 3.35 kg of CO2 eq. per liter of ethanol. The energy return on investment was 1.59, indicating that the process was net energy positive. The lower bound on the life cycle water use was 507.4 l per liter of ethanol. The integrated nature of the process producing various value-added chemicals provided significant benefits from the perspective of environmental impacts.

AB  - The conversion of algal lipids to fatty acid alkyl esters is a promising way for the production of high-grade biofuel, due to the lower oxygen content of lipids than that of saccharides and proteins. Herein, a catalyst-free conversion process of natural microalgae cyanobacteria was developed for biodiesel production. The conversion involved two steps: (1) pretreatment of raw microalgae by Soxhlet extraction of lipids or hydrothermal treatment for extraction of saccharides and part of proteins at 200 °C; (2) liquefaction of raw and pretreated samples in sub/supercritical ethanol. In the first step, a maximum lipid yield of 6.5 wt% was extracted by Soxhlet extraction, while the hydrothermal treatment dissolved saccharides and a part of proteins. The composition of biocrude obtained from raw algae was complex, containing hydrocarbons, N-containing compounds, esters, fatty acids and other oxy-compounds. The biocrude from lipid extracted algae had a poor quality, from which the degradation of proteins was facilitated. Better yet, the extraction of saccharides and part of proteins by hydrothermal pretreatment simplified the composition (mainly fatty acid ethyl esters), reduced the nitrogen content (&lt;4%) and improved the higher heating value (∼41 MJ kg−1) for biocrude. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A precisely localized enzyme cascade was constructed by integrating two sequential enzymes, glucoamylase (GA) and glucose oxidase (GOx), on a yeast cell surface through an a-agglutinin receptor as the anchoring motif with cohesin-dockerin interaction. The overall catalytic activities of the combinant strains were significantly dependent on the assembly method, enzyme molecular size, enzyme order, and enzyme stoichiometry. The combinant strain with GA-DocC initially bound scaffoldin prior to GOx-DocT exhibited a higher overall reaction rate. The highest overall reaction rate (29.28 ± 1.15 nmol H2O2 min-1mL-1) was achieved when GA/GOx ratio was 2:1 with enzyme order: Yeast-GA-GOx-GA, 4-fold enhancement compared to free enzyme mixture. Further, the first example of starch/O2 enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) using codisplayed GA/GOx based bioanodes were assembled, demonstrating excellent direct biomass-to-electricity conversion. The optimized EBFC registered an open-circuit voltage of 0.78 V and maximum power density (Pmax) of 36.1 ± 2.5 μW cm-2, significantly higher than the Pmax for other starch/O2 EBFCs reported so far. Therefore, this work highlights rational organization of sequential enzymes for enhanced biocatalytic activity and stability, which would find applications in biocatalysis, enzymatic biofuel cells, biosensing, and bioelectro-synthesis.

AB  - Rice husk is a widespread agriculture waste in rice-farming country. High silica content in rice husk prevent its efficient utilization. So in this work, concept of poly-generation was introduced to improve its utilization value. This study provided CO-rich syngas, phenol-abundant bio-oil, high-adsorption porous carbon and amorphous SiO2 as four end products for first time via combination of acid washing and activated carbon catalyst. Specifically, acid washing effectively decreased soluble ash, which altered pyrolysis paths, increased volatiles release and reduced impurities in bio-char. After catalytic pyrolysis, phenol content of 65.56% and CO of 56.09 vol% were detected in bio-oil and syngas from AWRH. For solid products, acid washing benefited both bio-char and silica. A low-cost porous carbon with developed pores and rich surface functional groups was prepared for water absorption. And high purity amorphous SiO2 was recycled from alkali etching solution. Finally, a green process with no waste emission was proposed. © 2019

AB  - In the present study, the effect of ultrasound irradiation on the transesterification parameters, biodiesel properties, and its combustion profiles in the diesel engine was investigated. Moreover, date seed oil (DSO) was firstly utilized in the ultrasound-assisted transesterification reaction. DSO was extracted from Zahidi type date (Phoenix dactylifera) and was esterified to reduce its Free Fatty Acid (FFA) content. Biodiesel yield was optimized in both heating methods, so that the yield of 96.4% (containing 93.5% ester) at 60 °C, with 6 M ratio of methanol/oil, 1 wt% of catalyst (NaOH) and at 90 min of reaction time was reported. The ultrasound irradiation did not influence the reaction conditions except reaction time, reduced to 5 min (96.9% yield and 91.9% ester). The ultrasonic irradiation also influenced on the physicochemical properties of DSO biodiesel and improved its combustion in the diesel engine. The analysis results related to the engine and gas emission confirmed that the ultrasound-assisted produced biodiesel has lower density and viscosity, and higher oxygen content facilitating injection of fuel in the engine chamber and its combustion, respectively. Although, B40 (biodiesel blend consisting of 40% biodiesel and 60% net diesel fuel) as a blend of both fuels presented higher CO2 and lower CO and HC in the emissions, the DSO biodiesel produced by ultrasound irradiation presented better specifications (caused about 2-fold improvement in emissions than that of conventional method). The findings of the study confirmed the positive effect of the ultrasound irradiation on the properties of the produced biodiesel along with its combustion properties in the diesel engine, consequently reducing air pollution problems. © 2019

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternative to fossil energy, especially when non edible feedstocks are used in the production process. In the present work, biodiesel was produced from university campus restaurants waste frying soybean oil by means of transesterification reaction. The objective of this study was to reduce the energy and reactants consumption and waste generation to achieve a truly green process. For this purpose, a multiobjective optimization using central composite design (CCD) was performed considering three responses: the reaction conversion, the energy consumption and the green chemistry balance. The last two parameters i.e. the energy consumption and the green chemistry balance were considered as responses for the first time, hence an interesting originality. Temperature, KOH catalyst amount and oil to methanol molar ratio were the CCD independent variables. Five green metrics were used to account for the greenness of the reaction, namely: carbon efficiency, atom economy, reaction mass efficiency, stoichiometric factor and environmental factor. The obtained quadratic models for the prediction of the optimum responses fitted reasonably well the experimental data. The results showed a maximum oil conversion of 100%, minimum energy consumption of 2.69 kJ and maximum green chemistry balance of 77.36% at KOH catalyst concentration of 2 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of about 4.73 and a minimum temperature of 45 °C. The physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel agreed well with the international standards ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass-based feedstock is an attractive alternative to fossil fuel due to its sustainability and potential as a clean energy source. The present work focuses on the valorisation of horse manure biowaste to produce bioenergy via microwave-assisted pyrolysis technique. The thermal decomposition process is conducted by considering the effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalyst loading and carrier gas flow rate on the yield and quality of end products. The pyrolysed gaseous product contains up to 73.1 vol% of syngas components. The solid biochar obtained contains a heating value of 35.5 MJ/kg with high surface to pore volume ratio. The relatively high specific energy contents of gaseous products and biochar indicate their potential as biofuels. The liquid product is found to contain oxygenated phenolic compound of up to 79.4 wt%. In spite of an overall energy deficit achieved when comparing the total energy of end products with the feedstock, the energy balance analysis indicates the optimum production parameters. The least energy deficit is achieved at the reactive conditions of 350–450 °C and manure-to-catalyst ratio of 1:1. A reaction mechanism pathway for the pyrolysis of horse manure is presented to show the production route for bioenergy and valuable chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rapid depletion of natural oil resources and growing environmental problems has led to the hunt for a cost-efficient method for production of fuel-grade Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The supremacy of heterogeneous catalysis urges the development of bio-based catalyst as an alternative to the previously used catalyst. The present study elevates the practicability of utilizing residual ash from sugarcane leaves as a catalyst for the production of Calophyllum inophyllum methyl esters. XRD, SEM, FT-IR were used to characterize the residual ash. Central Composite design based response surface methodology was employed to study the relationship between process parameters on FAME yield. In optimum conditions of methanol to oil ratio of 19:1, 5 wt% of catalyst and temperature of 64 °C, there obtained a maximum FAME yield of 97%.85% yield up to 6 cycles has been shown by reusability data. Performance and emission exhaust analysis of produced FAME shows that blended version of B10 and B80 has a better efficiency of using biodiesel as a backup energy source. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The growing concerns over the depleting fossil fuels and increase in the release of greenhouse gas emissions have necessitated the search for the potential biomass source for alternative energy generation. In this context, third generation biomass specifically maroalgae has gained a lot of research interest in the recent years for energy and products generation such as ethanol, butanol, alginates, agars, and carrageenans. There are a few reviews available in scientific domain on macroalgal biomass utilization for bioethanol production but none of them has addressed precisely from phenolic precursor compounds to the entire ethanol production process and its bottlenecks. Here, we explained critically the processes involved in bioethanol, value added products and chemicals production utilizing macroalgal biomass as a feedstock along with its zero waste feasibility approach. Apart from this, we have also summarized the major issues linked to the macroalgae based biofuels and bioproducts generation processes and their possible corrective measures. Biorefinery is a promising way to generate multiple products from a single source with short processing time. Thus, this review also focuses on the recent advancement in the macroalgal biomass scaling up and how this could help in the growth of macroalgal biorefinery industry in the near future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Magnetic microfuel-reforming is a promising method of biofuel processing in diesel engines. However, the complex interactions amongst the non-Newtonian biofuel flow, magnetic field and reactor have hindered understanding of their influences upon the transport phenomena in the system. To resolve this issue, the transport of heat and mass in a porous microreactor containing a Casson rheological fluid and subject to a magnetic field is investigated analytically. The system is assumed to host a homogenous and uniformly distributed endothermic/exothermic chemical reaction. Two-dimensional analytical solutions are developed for the temperature and concentration fields as well as the Nusselt number and local entropy generations, and the results are rigorously validated. It is demonstrated that changes in the non-Newtonian characteristics of the fluid and altering the magnetic and thermal radiation properties can lead to bifurcation of temperature gradient on the surface of the porous medium. The general behaviour of such bifurcation is dominated by the exothermicity (or endothermicity) of the chemical reaction in the fluid phase. It is also shown that variations in the Casson fluid parameter and changes in the intensity and incident angle of the magnetic field can modify the Nusselt number considerably. The extent of these modifications is found to be heavily dependent upon the wall thickness and diminishes as the walls become thicker. Further, the total entropy generation is shown to be highly sensitive to the wall thickness and increases by intensifying the magnetic field, provided that the microreactor walls are thin. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Directional depolymerization is a critical step for the integrated utilization of waste lignocellulosic biomass resources to produce value-added biofuels and biochemicals. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient and environmentally benign liquefied process for converting cellulose and waste lignocellulosic residues into levulinic acid (LA) in a polar aprotic solvent using a low-cost sulfate as catalyst. Due to the synergistic effect between the γ-valerolactone (GVL) and an active acid center derived from sulfate, more than 77 mol % and 61 mol % of biochemicals were obtained from cellulose and bamboo meal wastes in GVL/H2O (m/m = 9:1) solvent at 200 °C for 2 h, respectively. A combination of 27Al NMR spectroscopy and electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) revealed that the [Al(OH)2(aq)]+ species significantly contributed to cellulose depolymerization under cationic polarization of polar aprotic solvents. Besides, the existence of an appropriate amount of water was believed to be responsible for promoting the destruction of cellulose and the restraint of humin formation. Notably, all solvents and byproducts could be efficiently retrieved during this process, which shed light on its considerable industrial application prospects and facilitated the high value-added utilization of waste biomass resources. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Low-lipid content algae have demonstrated potential in the bio-crude production because of their high yield and robust ability to adapt to hostile cultivation environment in mass cultivation. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technology is an effective method to convert wet algae to bio-crudes directly. In this study, the HTL processes of two low-lipid content algae, Nannochloropsis sp. and Sargassum sp., were investigated under various reaction temperatures (260–320 °C). Results showed that the bio-crudes yield of Nannochloropsis sp. (39.05 wt% to 54.11 wt%) was significantly higher than that of Sargassum sp. (3.11 wt% to 9.49 wt%). The higher heating value of Nannochloropsis sp. (35.92 MJ/kg to 37.88 MJ/kg) were also slightly higher than that of Sargassum sp., (33.63 MJ/kg to 35.23 MJ/kg). GC–MS analyses showed that Nannochloropsis sp. bio-crude mainly contained amides and N-heterocyclic compounds while Sargassum sp. bio-crude mainly contained N-heterocyclic compounds and ketones. Alcohols were the major aqueous phase compounds for both algae. For Nannochloropsis sp., glycerin accounted for the largest proportion in alcohols, while dianhydromannitol and 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol were the major alcohols component for Sargassum sp. Based on the compositions of the HTL products and the feedstock, a reaction pathway network of the HTL process of low-lipid algae was proposed in this study. Amino acids related interactions like acylation and Maillard reaction were prominent in HTL process of these two algae, which effectively converted protein and carbohydrate compounds into bio-crudes. © 2019

AB  - The prevailing trends in global energy consumption and the rapid depletion of fossil fuel present an urgent need for alternative fuels, particularly from renewable sources of biomass. In this study, date palm tree mixture wastes (DTM) and date seed (DS) biomass were used as starting materials in the production of bio-oil by pyrolysis. The yields of the pyrolysis oils from DTM and DS were optimized by tuning the experimental parameters. The DS provided a maximum yield of 68 wt% obtained from 30 min of pyrolysis with a biomass loading of 200 g, fluidizing gas flow rate of 10 mL min−1, and at a temperature of 500 °C. In addition, we evaluated the impact of the aging process of the obtained pyrolysis oils. The produced pyrolysis oils (freshly made) were aged for 15 and 30 days at room temperature under closed conditions. All the feedstock biomass were subjected to proximate and ultimate analysis. The TG-DTA results indicated that both biomasses were richer in cellulose and hemicellulose contents than in lignin content. The FT-IR and GC/MS analyses of the fresh and aged oil samples demonstrated the outstanding characteristics of the DS derived bio-oil for use as a bio-fuel. The variation in the chemical composition of the fresh and aged pyrolysis oils are completely described and presented elaborately. This study demonstrates the significance of and a new functionality for the date palm industry to process date palm wastes, particularly the DS as a rich biomass source for the production of bio-fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to reveal the mechanism of high thermal efficiency of diesel methanol dual fuel (DMDF) engine, the exergy loss of DMDF engine under different operating parameters is investigated by using experimental and calculative methods based on the second law of thermodynamics. It has been found that DMDF has lower heat transfer exergy loss under all engine loads due to the high latent heat of vaporization of methanol which reduces the temperature in-cylinder. The exhaust exergy loss of DMDF under high load is relatively low compared with that of pure diesel fuel, while it is opposite to that under medium-low load. This is due to the influence of different temperatures on the incomplete combustion of methanol, which also indicates the main cause for the high thermal efficiency of DMDF under high load. Then studies on exergy analysis of DMDF under different temperatures were carried out. The studies covers the effect of intake air temperature on exergy efficiency, the heat transfer exergy loss and the exhaust physical exergy loss increase with rising intake air temperature as well. The results shows that the exhaust chemical exergy loss decreases significantly with the increase of intake air temperature and higher intake air temperature helps to improve exergy efficiency. Additionally, it is concluded that higher methanol temperature and cooling water temperature can improve exergy efficiency by decreasing exhaust exergy loss and combustion irreversible exergy loss. Finally, some feasible measures are proposed to further improve DMDF engine's performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic and non-catalytic co-pyrolysis behaviors, kinetics and products distribution of rural solid waste (RSW) and chlorella vulgaris (CV) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and fixed bed reactor. TGA results showed that co-pyrolysis of RSW and CV presented synergism by decreasing the temperature relating to the first mass loss peak. All the additives reduced residual mass for co-pyrolysis (5.21%, 1.57% and 4.89% for CaO, MgO and HZSM-5). Addition of CaO increased activation energy while HZSM-5 and MgO reduced it. Co-pyrolysis of RSW and CV remarkably reduced carboxylic acids and nitrogenous compounds especially for 1:1 ratio. (30.85% and 25.87%). Catalytic pyrolysis with CaO showed the best results by increasing aliphatic hydrocarbons especially light fraction (5.96%–11.98%), reducing acids (0%–30.85%) and nitrogenous compounds (0.08%–17.26%), causing higher HHV of oil. Overall, catalytic co-pyrolysis of CV and RSW with CaO could obtain bio-oil of higher quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, the effectiveness of ultrasonic transesterification in situ was appraised with the aim of biodiesel synthesis from almonds of Syagrus cearensis, commonly known as Catolé. This raw material was investigated as an innovative and non-conventional alternative for biodiesel production. S. cearensis appears in this article as an energy source with valuable sustainable factors, allowing for financial savings and low environmental impact compared to fossil fuels. Influences of ultrasonic energy on different process variable were elucidated. An experimental design was applied, employing 4 main factors (type and proportion of catalyst, the proportion of methanol and reaction time) to evaluate the effect of the process variables and determine the optimal conditions for biodiesel production. The present study revealed two main factors interactions, ratio, and type of catalyst, which had significant effects on the ultrasonic-assisted in situ transesterification based on statistical evaluation. The results indicated as optimal conditions: basic catalyst (KOH), 5 wt % catalyst, 1:6 methanol: oil (molar ratio) and reaction time of 30 (min). Besides, a kinetic study exposed that the ultrasonic assistance in situ transesterification reaction complies properly with first-order kinetics and activation energy of 27.53 kJ.mol-1. Yields of up to 99.99% conversion to biodiesel were achieved in the present study. By the results, it is possible to affirm that the in situ transesterification of S. cearensis almonds associated with the ultrasound technique was effective for the production of biodiesel proving the benefit of utilizing S. cearensis a new feedstock for biofuels production in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Spent Coffee Ground (SCG) was studied as a potential source of oil feedstock for biodiesel production as an alternative waste utilisation instead of being disposed as municipal waste. This study evaluated the ultrasonic assisted oil extraction from SCG, which was followed by biodiesel conversion via transesterification. Hexane was found to be the most effective extractant for SCG oil. Soxhlet extraction could obtain maximum SCG oil yield of 12.5% within 3 h whereas the highest SCG oil yield (14.52%) using ultrasonic extraction was obtained at hexane to SCG ratio of 4 mL g−1 and at 30% ultrasonic amplitude for 30 min. The improved oil yield with shorter extraction time was due to the ultrasonic fragmentation on SCG cells, which enhanced the interactions between oil and solvents. Fourier transform infrared analysis showed that the SCG oil possessed suitable functional groups for biodiesel conversion. Then, the SCG oil was successfully converted to biodiesel via ultrasonic assisted transesterification. The optimal FAME yield (97.11%) was achieved with molar ratio of methanol to SCG oil of 30:1, 4 wt% of catalyst concentration, at 30% ultrasonic amplitude and for 3 h. The produced SCG biodiesel has promising properties which adhere to the biodiesel standards but acid value was beyond the permissible limit which could be overcome by utilising as blend feedstock with other commercially available biodiesel. The high calorific value along with low viscosity, density and corrosion properties suggested SCG biodiesel as an interesting and viable option for biodiesel blending. © 2019

AB  - We report that the performance of enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) can be boosted by exploiting the dual function of iron- and nitrogen-codoped carbon nanotube (Fe–N/CNT) catalysts. The Fe–N/CNT is directly used as a cathode catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction while it is combined with glucose oxidase (GOx) and polyethylenimine (PEI) to form GOx/PEI/[Fe–N/CNT] for catalyzing the overall oxidation reactions including glucose oxidation reaction at the anode. The cathode employing Fe–N/CNT catalyst shows excellent onset potential and current density (0.29 V and of 0.9 mA cm−2). In anode, GOx/PEI/[Fe–N/CNT] shows proper onset potential and current density (0.17 V and 74.3 μA cm−2) with the injection of 8 mM glucose solution. More quantitatively, its Michaelis-Menten constant and maximum current density are 139.4 mM and 347.1 μA cm−2, respectively, and its catalytic activity is well maintained preserving 81.2% of its initial value even after four weeks. The EBC comprising Fe–N/CNT at the cathode and GOx/PEI/[Fe–N/CNT] at the anode exhibits the maximum power density (MPD) of 63 μW cm−2. This is the first report that demonstrates the possibility of the heme mimicking nanocatalyst as both anodic and cathodic catalysts for EBCs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production via esterification/transesterification reactions can be catalyzed by homogenous or heterogeneous catalysts. Development of heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production is highly advantageous due to the ease of product purification and of catalyst recyclability. In this current work, a novel acidic [DABCODBS][CF3SO3]2 dicationic ionic liquid (DIL) was used as heterogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel using oleic acid as model oil. The esterification was conducted under ultrasonic irradiation (20 kHz) using a 14 mm ultrasonic horn transducer operated at various duty cycles. It was observed that the duty cycle, amplitude, methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst amount and reaction temperature were the major factors that greatly impact the necessary reaction time to lead to a high yield of biodiesel. The reaction conditions were optimized with the aid of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) designed according to the Quadratic model of the Box Behnken method. The optimum conditions were found to be at catalyst amount of 0.64 mol%, methanol to oil ratio of 14.3:1, temperature of 59 °C, reaction time of 83 min and amplitude of 60% in continuous mode. The results showed that the oleic acid was successfully converted into esters with conversion value of 93.20% together with significant reduction of reaction time from 7 h (using mechanical stirring) to 83 min (using ultrasonication). The results also showed that the acidic DIL catalyst we designed purposely was efficient to catalyze the ultrasonic-assisted esterification yielding high conversion of oleic acid to methyl oleate on short times. The DIL was also recycled and reused for at least five times without significant reduction in performance. Overall, the procedure offers advantages including short reaction time, good yield, operational simplicity and environmentally benign characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Experimental study of 1-pentanol addition and EGR rates on the combustion, performance and emission of a CRDI diesel engine is carried out in this work. 1-Pentanol being a higher alcohol has fuel properties comparable to diesel. Experiments were conducted on a 4 stroke two cylinder, CRDI diesel engine running at a constant speed of 2000 rpm for lower load and higher load. Test fuels were prepared by blending the 1-pentanol with diesel, and tests were carried out for 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%, 1-pentanol blended in diesel on a volume basis. Effect of EGR rates of 10% and 20% were also studied. It had observed that engine can be run up to 30% of 1-pentanol blended fuel without any engine modification, but with raise in the percentage of 1-pentanol in the blends, BSFC increases and BTE decreases. Combustion characteristic for blended fuel depends upon the load. At higher load due to premixed combustion MGT, CP and NHR were almost same compared to the diesel. Reduction in NOx emissions was noted for all the fuel blends at the cost of HC and CO emission. 1-pentanol is a renewable biofuel, with use of 1-pentanol the dependency on petrodiesel can be overcome. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Methanol is a clean liquid energy carrier of sunshine and a key platform chemical for the synthesis of olefins and aromatics. Herein, we report the conversion of biomass-derived polyols and sugars into methanol and syngas (CO+H2) via UV light irradiation under room temperature, and the bio-syngas can be further used for the synthesis of methanol. The cellulose and even raw wood sawdust could be converted into methanol or syngas after hydrogenolysis or hydrolysis pretreatment. We find Cu dispersed on titanium oxide nanorod (TNR) rich in defects is effective for the selective C−C bond cleavage to methanol. Methanol is obtained from glycerol with a co-production of H2. A syngas with CO selectivity up to 90% in the gas phase is obtained via controlling the energy band structure of Cu/TNR. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding the specific chemical activation mechanism during biomass pyrolysis is critical for the more efficient use of biomass and biochar. In this study, the effects of KOH/biomass ratios (1:8 to 1:1) and temperatures (400–800 °C) on biomass pyrolysis were investigated. The KOH chemical activation mechanism was explored by revealing the evolution mechanisms of the gaseous product, bio-oil, biochar, and KOH, based on experiments and quantum calculations. Results showed that KOH can react with active O-containing species in biomass, which was the main reaction at lower ratios (1:8–1:2) or lower temperatures (400–600 °C). Here, KOH was completely transformed to K2CO3, leading to the formation of large amounts of gaseous products and phenols (reaching 75%). The reaction between KOH and more stable carbon fragments, however, was enhanced at higher ratios (&gt;1:2) or higher temperatures (700–800 °C), such that it became the main reaction. With a significant decrease in the phenols and O-species, the hydrocarbons became the dominant species (reaching a content of 57.43%). For biochar, the reactions among KOH, O-containing species, and carbon fragments generated an abundance of vacancies in the biochar. The OH– from KOH rapidly entered these vacancies, forming a large amount of new O-containing groups (i.e., C[dbnd]O, –OH, C–O, O–C[dbnd]O, and –COOH groups). This also caused an increase in oxygen content (reaching 23.68 wt%) in biochar. At higher temperatures, the reactions between KOH and biomass were significantly enhanced, along with a sharp increase in the specific surface area (reaching 1351.13 m2/g). O-containing groups further transformed to more stable –OH, C–O, and –COOH groups. Based on the evolution mechanism of pyrolytic products and KOH, the KOH chemical activation mechanism during biomass pyrolysis was revealed, allowing us, for the first time, to propose a possible chemical reaction pathway between KOH and O-containing groups. © 2020

AB  - Plastic waste is an environmental burden substance, which poses a high threat to the society during disposal. Rather than disposal, recycling of this waste to liquid fuel gains importance owing to its high utility. Among various techniques, thermo-chemical recycling techniques hold more benefits in generating high value added liquid fuels. In this review, the details of municipal plastic waste generation are provided with a brief description of the plastic waste management option and importance of recycling is explained. The overview of the thermo-chemical treatment focusing on the pyrolysis, gasification and hydrocracking process was elaborated. Catalysts mediated pyrolysis have wide-open their prospective for the generation of bio-oil, hydrocarbons, syngas and deterioration of undesired substances. Generally, advance development of enthusiastic catalysts for the synthesis of bio-oil would be vital for scaling up the pyrolysis process to succeed in commercial manufacture of biofuels from waste plastics. Overall rate treatment depends on operating parameter which determines the process efficiency and product yield. Hence, critical assessment of various parameter that has remarkable effect in the thermo-chemical treatment process was documented in detail. Moreover, endorsements of liquid fuel production, economic viability, and energy requirement of the treatment process, were delivered to attain effectual plastic wastes management. © 2020

AB  - In this research, biomass from oil palm empty fruit bunch was used as the carbon precursor and sulfonated by 4-benzenediazonium sulfonate (4-BDS) to produce solid acid catalyst. The as-synthesized catalysts were characterized and the performances were tested in esterification of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) for biodiesel production. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed that clear porous and rough carbon surface was successfully developed after calcination which favored the attachment of sulfonic groups. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) result showed that the catalyst was thermally stable up to 600 °C. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) proved that S[dbnd]O and S[sbnd]O3H sulfonic groups were successfully attached to the carbon catalyst. From the catalytic activity tests, the results showed that the catalyst which was calcined at 200 °C and sulfonated with 15:1 sulfanilic acid to AC ratio was the optimum catalyst as it provided the highest biodiesel yield. Further investigation showed that the reaction time of 7 h and 20 wt.% of catalyst loading were reported as optimum esterification conditions which provided the highest biodiesel yield at 98.1 %. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The elution of metallic content from cotton stalk (CS) and its co-pyrolysis with waste tires (WT) was investigated in fixed bed reactor. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used for leaching and successful removal of metals from cotton stalk was observed. Removal efficiencies of 86%, 58%, 48%, 58% and 35% for potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and iron metals were achieved, respectively. Pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis using various mixing ratios of raw (R-CS) and acid washed cotton stalk (W-CS) with waste tire were carried out at 550 °C. Co-pyrolyzing W-CS with WT not only resulted in increased liquid yield with reduced char and gas yields, but also improved the quality of pyrolytic oil evincing the occurrence of strong positive synergistic effect. The addition of WT reduced oxygenates, density and water content of oil whilst pH and calorific value are increased compared to both, R-CS and W-CS pyrolytic oils. Relative percentage area of hydrocarbons increased to 65% in co-pyrolysis of WT with W-CS as compared to 47% for that of R-CS at optimum blend ratio (CS:WT 1:3). Likewise, 19% higher reduction in oxygenated compounds was observed in W-CS and WT co-pyrolytic oil. Co-pyrolyzing WT with R-CS and W-CS resulted in improved quality of oil. However, the synergistic effect was less significant for R-CS suggesting that the presence of intrinsic metals in R-CS hampered the occurrence of synergistic effects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - At present, the increasing consumption of fossil fuels as well as the expanding of more effective avenues to prepare carbon materials have inspired scholars' confidence to seek for alternative carbon sources. To address this issue, a N-doped graphene shell encapsulated metallic Co (Co@NGs) catalyst was fabricated using glucose and melamine as carbon source and nitrogen source via carbonization and employed for 5-hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) hydrogenation to produce 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) biofuel. Here, the prepared Co@NGs catalyst which possessed striking Mott-Schottky effect presented strong electronic interaction at the interface of surface metallic Co and doped N, leading to the electron transfer from metallic Co to doped N on carbon substrate. Experimental results indicated that the decreased electron density of metallic Co was more conductive to selective catalytic hydrogenation of HMF to form DMF. More importantly, the catalytic activity of the Mott-Schottky-type Co@NGs catalyst could be regulated by adjusting the nitrogen content. That is, the high nitrogen content increased the work function of Co@NGs and thus the enhanced rectifying response at the interface by which to enhance the catalytic performance. The best Co@NGs catalyst exhibited both high HMF conversion (close to 100 %) and DMF selectivity (94.7 %), much better than those of conventional N-doped carbon supported Co catalysts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The disposal of digested sewage sludge is becoming a global problem. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) combined with the pyrolysis of digested sewage sludge was investigated by using a new conversion route for the exploitation of sewage sludge in energy applications. The thermochemical properties of the material were investigated by using HTC pre-treatments, thermogravimetric analyses, pyrolysis tests in Py-GC/MS and a bench-scale fixed bed reactor at temperatures of 450, 550, and 650 °C. It was found that the thermal decomposition of the hydrothermally treated digested sewage sludge takes place in a two-stage reaction. After pyrolysis, the ash in the sample was oxidized in the O2 atmosphere at 900 °C. Therefore, a new characterization method for determination of the non-oxdized ash content and fixed carbon content was proposed. The result from Py-GC/MS shows that the abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons in pyrolytic vapors present a positive correlation with increased temperature. In the bench-scale experiments, the highest HHV of the organic fraction was obtained at 650 °C as 38.46 MJ/kg. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic transformation of biomass-derived furans into value-added chemicals and biofuels has received considerable interest recently. In this work, aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) were identified from Comamonas testosteroni SC1588 for the oxidation of bio-based furans into furan carboxylic acids. Of the whole-cell biocatalysts constructed, Escherichia coli expressing a vanillin dehydrogenase (E. coli_CtVDH1) proved to be the best for the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) was obtained in the yield of approximately 92 % within 12 h using this recombinant strain when the HMF concentration was up to 200 mM. In a fed-batch process, 292 mM of HMFCA was produced within 20.5 h, thereby providing a productivity as high as 2.0 g/L h. Other furan carboxylic acids were synthesized in the yields of 83–95%. Besides, the partially purified HMF was smoothly converted into HMFCA by this recombinant strain, with a 90% yield. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the pyrolysis of lignin pyrolysis in a temperature region from 200 to 800 °C, aiming to understand influence of pyrolysis temperature on evolution of structures of the resulting char. The results showed that fusion of the ring structure initiated at 200 °C, where the C/H ratio in the char was equal to that in naphthalene (two fused rings). The C/H ratio in the char obtained at 350 °C corresponded to that in pyrene (four fused rings), while the char produced at 550 °C was equivalent to 20 fused benzene rings in terms of C/H ratio. The increasing pyrolysis temperature also shifted the oxygen-containing functionalities such as the carbonyl, esters, ketones in the bio-oil to the ether functionality that had a higher thermal stability. The DRIFTS study of pyrolysis of lignin showed that drastic changes of the functionalities and the internal structure of the char occurred in a narrow temperature region from 520 to 530 °C. The carbonyl functionality and the aliphatic structure were eliminated, and new conjugated π-bond systems formed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocelluloses’ pretreatment is targeted for the improvement of hydrolysis of their carbohydrates, i.e., cellulose and hemicelluloses. Modification of the hardheaded structure of lignocelluloses is a fundamental stair in biofuels and biochemicals production. The high crystalline configurations of cellulose embed with hemicelluloses and lignin, give rise to recalcitrance structure. Second-generation biofuel production processes, using lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock, is based on a three-stage process, including pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. The pretreatment stage is the most critical, influencing, costly stage. The perfect pretreatment process is designated to provide minimum cellulosic crystallinity with remarkable low lignin content as well as inhibitory compounds through a sustainable economical process. In the present review, advances in lignocellulosic pretreatment technologies for biofuels production are reviewed and critically discussed. The article further discusses the pros and cons of the various pretreatment methodologies as well as addresses the role and impact of different process parameters associated with the pretreatment process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Highly selective upgrade of biomass-derived source to biofuels is crucial for the utilization of biomass. Herein, we report a strategy for the highly selective conversion of biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) to gamma-valerolactone (GVL) or valeric biofuels simply by tuning the used metal Ni or Ru on HZSM-5 support. The catalytic experimental results show that 3 wt% Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst achieves high yield (93.1%) of GVL with negligible formation of pentanoic acid (<1% yield) or pentanoic esters (<1% yield), while 3 wt% Ru/HZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a high yield (85.7%) of pentanoic esters (PE) and pentanoic acid (PA) under the identical conditions. It is found that the introduction of Ru into HZSM-5 would increase the strong acidic sites and enhance the ring-opening of GVL intermediate, promoting the formation of PE and PA. In comparison, 3 wt% Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst shows relative lower acidic sites and negligible ring-opening ability of GVL. The metal effect is further confirmed using GVL and 1, 4-dioxane as substrate, respectively. After that, reaction kinetics are investigated in details and a rational pathway is proposed for the metal effect in deciding the product distribution of LA hydrogenation. This work provides a useful guideline to design proper catalyst for the valorization of biomass resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been actively studied in academia and industry for their properties comparable to petroleum-derived plastics and high biocompatibility. However, the major limitation for commercialization is their high cost. Feedstock costs, especially carbon costs, account for the majority of the final cost. Finding cheap feedstocks for PHA production and associated process development are critical for a cost-effective PHA production. In this study, waste materials from different sources, particularly lignocellulosic biomass, were proposed as suitable feedstocks for PHA production. Strains involved in the conversion of these feedstocks into PHA were reviewed. Newly isolated strains were emphasized. Related process development, including the factors that affect PHA production, fermentation modes and downstream processing, was elaborated upon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels through enzymatic hydrolysis has become a promising strategy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. β-Glucosidase (BG) is a key enzyme in the enzymatic degradation of cellulose. However, free β-glucosidase is relatively unstable, costly and difficult to recover. Immobilization of β-glucosidase may help to improve its reusability and stability, allowing developing a sustainable low-carbon and resource-efficient circular economy. BG was immobilized by adsorption on synthesised tannic acid templated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (TA-MSNPs). The synthesis procedure adopts a green templating agent cheap and biocompatible. Textural and morphological characterization was performed. We studied the effect induced by the morphology, pore size and surface features of supports, by using different amounts of templating agent, on the catalytic performance of the biocatalyst. The immobilization procedure used preserved most of the secondary structure of the enzyme and consequently its catalytic activity. The biocatalyst exhibiting the best activity and operational stability is obtained with the sorbent prepared with the largest quantity of tannic acid. In this case, the mesopores are too small for the enzyme to enter them, and the large amount of adsorbed enzyme is due to its peculiar surface features, favouring the formation of a multilayer enzyme corona. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The performance of anaerobic digestion (AD) can be improved by the addition of accelerants. Three types of biomass-derived carbon-based composites (Co/C, CoO/C, and Co3O4/C) were used as accelerants to investigate the effect on AD systems in this work. These accelerants significantly improved the cumulative biogas yield (576–585 mL/g VS), and the total chemical oxygen demand degradation rate (68.48–71.11%) compared to the reference group (435.8 mL/g VS, 50.74%). The digestates with accelerants exhibited exceptional stability (59.24–63.67%) and superior fertilizer utilization (3.50–4.55%). In addition, first-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to provide the theoretical basis for the direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), and a general strategy was proposed to help understand the enhanced methanogenesis pathway induced by the biomass-derived carbon-based composites. These important findings provide a novel avenue for the development of composite accelerants for AD systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study suggests the economic potential of biochar-based biodiesel production by conducting the techno-economic analysis. The itemized cost estimation was performed by categorizing biochar production facility and biodiesel conversion plants for 30,000 ton y−1 of biodiesel production capacity. The result of sensitivity analysis shows the methanol and waste cooking oil (WCO) costs are significantly sensitive to determine a unit biodiesel production cost. When the biodiesel selling price was 1.70 $ kg−1, the discounted payback period was varied from 1.91 (not discounted) to 2.06 years (10% discounted). In addition, the break-even price of biodiesel was calculated to 1.55 $ kg−1 when the discount rate was 10%. It means that this technology is to be feasible because of commercial diesel price (0.97 to 1.88 $ kg−1). The consideration of tax exemption and subsidy for biodiesel can be good option to supply WCO based energy production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel synthesis through transesterification of used cooking oil or frying oils using the viscera lipase from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as a low-cost feedstock and catalyst, respectively, was optimized. The influences of operating factors, including methanol/oil molar ratio, enzyme loading, reaction time, type of alcohol, water content and reaction temperature on the yield of biodiesel were investigated. The optimized conditions to achieve maximum biodiesel yield were obtained using an enzyme loading of 30 kUnit, a methanol to oil molar ratio of 4:1, a water content of 3%, a reaction temperature of 45 °C and a 28 h reaction time. Under these optimal operating conditions, the highest biodiesel yield observed was 96.5%. The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was applied to ensure the conversion of used cooking oil into biodiesel. The biodiesel characteristics met the specifications set as prescribed by EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751. The results from this investigation show the viability of economical biodiesel production using byproducts as both source and catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Selection of indigenous and potential algal strain with high lipid content is paramount challenge in the avenues of microalgal biodiesel production. Particularly, hyper lipid producing algae with maximal triacyglycerols (TAGs) content and preferable fatty acid composition is of interest for sustainable biodiesel. Hence, the present study on comparative assessment of Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus sp. and Synechococcus sp. was done in terms of cell density, lipid, TAGs and fatty acid. Higher biomass yield was obtained in Chlorella vulgaris (0.54 gL−1) on 13th day while maximal lipid content of 36% was observed in Scenedesmus sp. followed by Chlorella vulgaris (33%). Lipidomic analysis revealed higher non-polar lipids in Chlorella vulgaris (57%) and Scenedesmus sp. (54%), whereas in Synechococcus sp. 69% polar lipids were present. In fatty acid profile, C24:0 (22.11%) was predominant in Chlorella vulgaris, while C20:0 (31.72%) and C18:2 (22.26%) was prevalent in Scenedesmus sp. and Synechococcus sp. respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste Sesamum indicum plant derived heterogeneous catalyst was utilized for the first time for biodiesel synthesis from sunflower oil. The derived catalyst was characterized by using Powder XRD, FT-IR, BET, TGA, XRF, AAS, XPS, SEM-EDX and TEM, and the characterization revealed the presence of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Si, Sr and Cl with high percentage of K (29.64 wt %) and Ca (33.80 wt %) as oxides and carbonates. The catalyst with a moderate surface area of 3.66 m2 g−1 exhibited excellent catalytic activity producing a yield of 98.9% biodiesel under the optimized conditions of 12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio and catalyst loading of 7 wt % at the reaction temperature of 65 °C in a short reaction time of only 40 min. The catalyst could be reused up to the 3rd cycle of reaction with the yield of 94.2% biodiesel. The characterization of biodiesel was done by using FT-IR, NMR, and GC-MS techniques. The fuel property of produced biodiesel meets the prescribed limits of international standard. The prepared catalyst is easy to handle, reusable, and found to be highly efficient green catalyst that could help in reduction of biodiesel cost. Thus, the catalyst can be recommended as a potential candidate for cost-effective biodiesel production at a large scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Among alternative fuels, biodiesel has been emphasized as a substantial candidate for diesel engines because of many advantages. However, the main shortcomings preventing more widespread use of biodiesel are high production cost and viscosity. In order to simultaneously overcome both of these shortcomings, the reaction conditions for the transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) were optimized using Taguchi and the full factorial design approaches. The analyses of signal to noise ratio and variance were also performed to identify the dominance of reaction conditions on viscosity and biodiesel yield. As a result, the optimal reaction conditions giving the lowest kinematic viscosity (3.991 cSt) and the highest biodiesel yield (98.19%) were determined to be as follows: sodium methoxide amount of 1.00 wt%, reaction time of 60 min, reaction temperature of 55 °C, and methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1. The catalyst amount and methanol to oil molar ratio were found to be the most significant conditions influencing on the viscosity (10.36% and 78.87% contributions) and the yield (58.48% and 20.17% contributions), respectively. Finally, all physicochemical properties of final waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) produced under optimal reaction conditions were found to meet the EN 14214. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) provides a "green" route to upgrade oxygenated bio-oil under mild conditions, but is still challenged with the issues of low working current density (&lt;60 mA cm-2) and low faradaic efficiency (usually 20-60%) that seriously hinder its practical applications. Herein, we present a dual-catalyst electrochemical route that achieves extremely high faradaic efficiency (&gt;99% for many chemicals) and high working current density (up to 800 mA cm-2) in the hydrogenation of model bio-oil compounds. More importantly, efficient deoxygenation to alkanes, often thought to be very difficult in conventional ECH, was achieved in the aqueous electrolysis. The dual-catalyst system consists of a suspended noble-metal catalyst and soluble polyoxometalate (POM). The theoretical calculations indicate that the POM functions as a superacid, changing the common hydrogenation route to a carbocation mechanism and resulting in effective electrolytic deoxygenation of oxygenates. Because no current flows through the catalyst, even a non-conductive catalyst can be used, which provides a great opportunity for extension to general applications. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of pine needles over HBeta catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (25 and 300) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. TGA showed that the main decomposition of pine needles occurred between 150 and 550 °C. The catalytic DTG curves revealed the same decomposition temperature region as the non-catalytic TG curve of pine needles. Pyrolyzergas chromatography/mass spectrometry suggested that the effective catalytic conversion of pyrolyzate intermediates and other hydrocarbons to aromatic hydrocarbons can be achieved using HBeta catalysts at 600 °C. HBeta(25) produced a larger amount of aromatic hydrocarbons than HBeta(300) because of its higher acid amounts. By increasing the reaction temperature from 500 to 700 °C, the formation of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEXs) and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was increased with a concomitant decrease in phenolics and other oxygenates. The formation efficiency of BTEXs was increased further by increasing the catalyst loading. © 2020, The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - This contribution reports an unprecedentedly efficient dimerization and the first successful polymerization of lignocellulose-based β-angelica lactone (β-AL) by utilizing a selective Lewis pair (LP) catalytic system, thereby establishing a versatile bio-refinery platform wherein two products, including a dimer for high-quality gasoline-like biofuel (C8–C9 branched alkanes, yield=87 %) and a heat- and solvent-resistant acrylic bioplastic (Mn up to 26.0 kg mol−1), can be synthesized from one feedstock by one catalytic system. The underlying reason for exquisite selectivity of the LP catalytic system toward dimerization and polymerization was explored mechanistically. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Various types of energy exist everywhere around us, and these energies can be harvested from multiple sources to power micro-/nanoelectronic system and even personal electronic products. In this work, we proposed a hybrid energy-harvesting system (HEHS) for potential in vivo applications. The HEHS consisted of a triboelectric nanogenerator and a glucose fuel cell for simultaneously harvesting biomechanical energy and biochemical energy in simulated body fluid. These two energy-harvesting units can work individually as a single power source or work simultaneously as an integrated system. This design strengthened the flexibility of harvesting multiple energies and enhanced corresponding electric output. Compared with any individual device, the integrated HEHS outputs a superimposed current and has a faster charging rate. Using the harvested energy, HEHS can power a calculator or a green light-emitting diode pattern. Considering the widely existed biomechanical energy and glucose molecules in the body, the developed HEHS can be a promising candidate for building in vivo self-powered healthcare monitoring system.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020, © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Enzymes are biological catalysts that significantly speed up reactions by lowering their activation energy. Compared to chemical catalysts, enzymatic reactions take place in milder temperature conditions. The wide range of advantageous catalytic properties has enabled the use of enzymes in different fields of biotechnology. Microbial lipolytic enzymes have gained attention for the ability to catalyse biotransformation reactions of different esters-bond containing compounds. Conversion of the latter into high-energy products like biofuel and other value-added products (fatty acid esters, mono- and diacylglycerols, etc.) via energy-efficient and ecologically-friendly way makes these biocatalysts an important tool for sustainable biotechnology. However, the role of lipolytic enzymes in the waste management was not being well explored. This review highlighted some important aspects and strategies of lipolytic enzyme-mediated bioremediation to detoxify the lipid, plastic, pesticide and other environmental waste combined with production of important industrial compounds via less energy consuming way. Future perspectives of microbial lipolytic biocatalysts in environmental safety and energy saving are discussed herein as well. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste biomass derived heterogeneous catalyst is an excellent alternative to chemically synthesized catalysts. In this work, calcined Tectona grandis leaves were proposed as an eco-friendly, renewable and low cost heterogeneous base catalyst. The prepared catalyst was examined by FTIR, XRD, XPS, SEM, EDX, TEM, TGA, BET and Hammett indicator test. The catalyst has an appealing nature towards various chemical transformations due to its basic surface sites provided by alkali and alkaline earth metals. The efficiency of the catalyst was successfully investigated by its application in biodiesel production. The products were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR. 100% FAME conversion was attained using a catalyst loading of 2.5 wt% under optimized reaction parameters. The catalyst was further explored for Knoevenagel condensation reaction, in which it showed its effectiveness and recyclability towards the formation of benzylidenemalononitrile derivatives of aryl aldehydes. Thus, it is a potential ‘green catalyst’ derived from waste biomass without any addition of chemicals that can replace the industrial base catalysts used for biodiesel production and Knoevenagel reaction and makes the protocol environmentally benign. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Palm oil is largely produced in Thailand and sufficient to utilize as a biofuel feedstock through hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). In this work a new bifunctional catalyst consisting of nickel phosphide supported on zeolite mordenite in sodium form (Ni-P/NaMOR) was prepared by sequential impregnation and characterized extensively by several techniques to understand the reduction behavior, phases and distribution of nickel phosphides on the support. Nickel and phosphate precursors were transformed to Ni2P2O7 species by calcination and to a mixed phase between Ni12P5 and Ni2P by reduction. The phosphide species distributed in the zeolite cavities and external surface. The HDO of palm oil was tested in a down-flow stainless steel trickle bed reactor and the atmosphere was hydrogen. The mixed phase of nickel phosphides enhanced the HDO reaction. When tested by various temperatures and pressures, the optimum condition in this work was at 425 °C and 50 bar in which a complete of palm oil conversion, the largest HDO yield and selectivity toward C15-C18 alkanes were obtained. The green diesel and HDO yields from reduced Ni-P/NaMOR were larger than those from pure Ni2P and mixed Ni2P-Ni12P5. Interestingly, a small amount of isoparaffins was also observed likely due to the contribution of NaMOR support. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Organosilicon compounds are the most undesirable compounds for the energy recovery of biogas. These compounds are still resistant to biodegradation when biotechnologies are considered for biogas purification. Herein we isolated 52 bacterial species from anaerobic batch enrichment cultures (BEC) saturated with D4 and from an anaerobic lab-scale biotrickling filter (BTF) fed with a gas flow containing D4 as unique carbon source. Among those Methylibium sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the highest capacity to remove D4 (53.04% ± 0.03 and 24.42% ± 0.02, respectively). Contrarily, co-culture evaluation treatment for the biodegradation of siloxanes together with volatile organic compounds removed a lower concentration of D4 compared to toluene and limonene, which were completely removed. Remarkably, the siloxane D5 proved to be more biodegradable than D4. Substrates removal values achieved by Methylibium sp. suggested that this bacterial isolate could be used in biological removal technologies of siloxanes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solar fuels production is a cornerstone in the development of emerging sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. Light-induced H2 production from water represents one of the most crucial challenges to produce renewable fuel. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are being investigated in this process, due to the ability to assemble new structures with the use of suitable photoactive building blocks. However, the identification of the reaction intermediates remains elusive, having negative impacts in the design of more efficient materials. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new MOF prepared with the use of bismuth and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (DTTDC), an electron-rich linker with hole transport ability. By combining theoretical studies and time-resolved spectroscopies, such as core hole clock and laser flash photolysis measurements, we have completed a comprehensive study at different time scales (fs to ms) to determine the effect of competitive reactions on the overall H2 production. We detect the formation of an intermediate radical anion upon reaction of photogenerated holes with an electron donor, which plays a key role in the photoelectrocatalytic processes. These results shed new light on the use of MOFs for solar fuel production. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, the cerium oxide (CeO2) nanocatalyst was employed as a catalyst to enhance the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae to bio-oil conversion. The HTL optimized parameters were obtained from response surface methodology (RSM). The Spirulina Platensis is blue-green algae were used to convert into bio-oil. The major processing method for bio-oil conversion was designed based on three key parameters, such as temperature, residence time and catalyst concentration. A remarkable enhancement of bio-oil production was observed for 0.20 g of CeO2 catalyzed HTL at 250 °C for 30 min, and around 26% of conversion was achieved which is higher than catalyst-free HTL reaction (16%). The synthetic CeO2 nanostructure was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), brunauer-emmett-teller surface area (BET), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The chemical composition of bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the functional group analysis was done using fourier transform-infra red spectroscopy (FT-IR). The obtained results clearly reveal that the major chemical constituents such as hydrocarbons (7.55%), amino acids (36.69%) and nitrogen compounds (21.58%) for the bio-oil increased during CeO2 catalyzed HTL reaction. This investigation depicts that, the CeO2 nanoparticle could be employed as a potential candidate to accelerate the bio-oil conversion through HTL at low temperature from Spirulina platensis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of novel bifunctional catalysts (SrO–ZnO/Al2O3) have been synthesised via the wet impregnation method for biodiesel production. The basic and acidic activities of the prepared catalysts were investigated using corn oil and oleic acid, respectively. Physio-chemical characteristics of the synthesised catalysts were analysed by XRD, SEM-EDS, TGA-DSC, and FT-IR. 1H NMR was used for analysing the fatty acid ethyl ester and the free fatty acid. The catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity in transesterification reaction, with 95.1% reaction conversion at operating conditions of 10:1 ethanol to corn oil molar ratio, 10 wt% catalyst loading, and 180 min at 70 °C. However, the conversion for esterification reaction was 71.4% at operating conditions 5:1 ethanol to corn oil molar ratio, 10 wt% catalyst loading, 6 h reaction time at 70 °C reaction temperature. The kinetic studies revealed that the transesterification and esterification reactions have good agreement with the first-order model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study explores the catalytic application of waste clam shell in hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae (Scenedesmus obliquus) for liquid hydrocarbons production. Novel catalyst (calcium hydroxide) was derived from clam shells. Catalytic HTL was performed at varying temperature of 240–320 °C for catalyst load (0.2–1 wt%) at a reaction time of 60 min. Bio-oil yield was maximum (39.6 wt%) at a temperature of 300 °C for catalyst load of 0.6 wt% at a reaction time of 60 min with calorific value of 35.01 MJ/kg. Compounds like phenols, aromatic hydrocarbons, acids and aldehydes were detected in bio-oil through Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrophotometry (GC–MS). Gasification of microalgae with waste solid residue obtained from HTL was carried out for hydrogen production. Valuable hydrogen gas production was maximum (37 wt%) at a temperature of 400 °C for 3 wt% of solid residue. Water-gas shift, methanation and steam reforming reactions favoured the hydrogen gas production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study tested the suitability of solid residue (CaO) derived from the mixture of wastes biomass as based catalyst transesterification conversion of the blend of neem oilseed (Azadirachta indica A.Juss) with rendered pig fat. Blending was done in the ratio of Neem oil: Pig fat oil (v/v) as 10:90 (NO10),20:80 (NO20),30:70 (NO30), 40:60 (NO40), 50:50 (NO50), 60:40 (NO60), 70:30 (NO70), 80:20 (NO80), and 90:10 (NO90), respectively. Process parameter transesterification optimization of methanolysis CaO catalyst for synthesis of 60:40 to mixed oil biodiesel (MOB) was investigated using central composite design that generates thirty experimental runs and were carried out. Results showed low viscous oil at blend of 60:40. The predicted MOB yield of 98.05 (wt. %) at catalyst amount of 2.179 (g), reaction time of 57.45 min, reaction temperature of 59.91 °C, and MeOH/OMR of 5.9:1 (ml/ml), was validated in triplicate, and an average MOB yield of 98.03 (wt. %) was obtained. Results of XRD analysis indicated CaO as the predominant constituent element obtained from the mixture of calcined palm kernel shell husk (CPKSH) and calcined fermented kola nut husk (CFKNH). The qualities of MOB produced were within the biodiesel standard. © 2020

AB  - The present study demonstrates the use of highly stable single-molecule enzyme nanocapsules (SMENs) instead of traditional native enzyme as biorecognition element in enzyme-based biosensors. The main purpose of this study is to resolve the major obstacle and challenge in the biosensor field, i.e., the poor stability of enzyme-based biosensors, including thermal stability, organic solvent tolerance, long-term operational stability, etc. Highly active and robust SMENs of glucose oxidase (GOx, as a model enzyme) were synthesized (nGOx) using an in situ polymerization strategy in an aqueous environment. The particle-size distribution, transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images, and UV-vis spectral characterization revealed the formation of a thin polymer layer around each enzyme molecule. The polymer shell effectively stabilized the GOx enzyme core while enabling rapid substrate transportation, resulting in a new class of biocatalytic nanocapsules. Multiple covalent attachments between a thin polymer layer and an enzyme molecule strengthened the encapsulated GOx molecule. Encapsulation created a favorable microenvironment to avoid any structural dissociation at high temperature and helped to retain essential water during the organic solvent operation. The present work reports a study implementing nGOx SMENs as highly stable nano(bio)sensors for point-of-care diagnostic applications. Prepared nGOx SMENs manifested significantly improved thermal stability (even at 65 °C) and organic solvent tolerance without any compromise in biocatalytic activity. For example, the native GOx-based biosensor lost its catalytic activity for glucose after 4 h of incubation at high temperature (65 °C), while the nGOx/N-CNTs-Chi/GCE nano(bio)sensor maintained ∼56% of its original catalytic activity for glucose oxidation. The proposed SMENs-based nano(bio)sensors with robust stability in variable working environment could promote the development and applications of biosensors in point-of care diagnostics, biomedical detection, wearable devices, implantable equipment, and biofuel cells.

AB  - To meet the worldwide rapid growth of industrialization and population, the demand for the production of bioethanol as an alternative green biofuel is gaining significant prominence. The bioethanol production process is still considered one of the largest energy-consuming processes and is challenging due to the limited effectiveness of conventional pretreatment processes, saccharification processes, and extreme use of electricity in common fermentation and purification processes. Thus, it became necessary to improve the bioethanol production process through reduced energy requirements. Membrane-based separation technologies have already gained attention due to their reduced energy requirements, investment in lower labor costs, lower space requirements, and wide flexibility in operations. For the selective conversion of biomasses to bioethanol, membrane bioreactors are specifically well suited. Advanced membrane-integrated processes can effectively contribute to different stages of bioethanol production processes, including enzymatic saccharification, concentrating feed solutions for fermentation, improving pretreatment processes, and finally purification processes. Advanced membrane-integrated simultaneous saccharification, filtration, and fermentation strategies consisting of ultrafiltration-based enzyme recycle system with nanofiltration-based high-density cell recycle fermentation system or the combination of high-density cell recycle fermentation system with membrane pervaporation or distillation can definitely contribute to the development of the most efficient and economically sustainable second-generation bioethanol production process. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - The cleanest form of energy, i.e., biohydrogen, and advanced biofuel, i.e., biobutanol, were produced from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Ethanol as a byproduct of this process was used for the pretreatment of this substrate, and this pretreatment was improved by other process byproducts, i.e., acetic acid and butyric acid. The pretreatment was conducted with 85% ethanol and 0–1% (w/w) acetic/butyric acid at 120 and 160 °C for 30 min. The pretreatment catalyzed by 1% (w/w) acetic acid at 120 °C resulted in a hydrolysate with 49.8 g/L total fermentable sugars, which was fermented to the highest overall yield of acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) and hydrogen. Through this process, 114.1 g butanol, 43.8 g acetone, 15.1 g ethanol, 97.5 L hydrogen were obtained from each kg of OFMSW, producing 270 g ABE and 151 L H2 from each kg of substrate, corresponding to 6000 kJ energy production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Emissions from biodiesel combustion depend on types of feedstocks. This study investigated physicochemical properties of biodiesels in three various feedstocks generations and the effect of them on emissions and performance of the unmodified engine. Methyl esters from Eruca sativa (ES) which has crops with short production cycle and drought-tolerant capacity, waste cooking oil (WCO) as an economic feedstock, and microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (MCV) which have high growth rate and productivity without farmland requirement, were produced by transesterification process with methanol and KOH catalyst. Physicochemical properties of these biodiesels were determined by GC-MS and FTIR analysis and evaluated with ASTM D6751 standard. FAME components profile illustrated the high value of oleic acid (C18:1) in ES and WCO and long-chain fatty acids (C18:2 and higher) in MCV. The engine tests results indicated that MCV biodiesel produced slightly lower power and higher BSFC compared with others. There was a slight increase in NOx for MCV biodiesel compared with pure diesel. Conversely, ES and WCO biodiesels had a reduction in NOx. On the other hand, MCV biodiesel resulted in the greatest reduction in CO and HC emissions. Based on the results, MCV blends had the lowest emissions and the best function among all feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, refined bleached deodorised palm oil (RPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) obtained from palm oil refinery, were used as feedstocks to investigate the production of bio-hydrogenated kerosene (BHK) via hydrocracking reaction. A statistical tool of box-behnken design (BBD) was applied to consider the effects of reaction temperature, pressure and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on biofuel production from RPO. The results revealed that the temperature was strongly significant effect on the yield and the optimal condition was found at 477 °C, 5.6 MPa and 1.5 h−1 of LHSV. Subsequently, crude biofuel was separated by fractional distillation, the biofuel yield was obtained at approximately 90% and providing 49.59% kerosene selectivity. Curiously, another feedstock of PKO which has lauric acid as the main composition whereas RPO contained palmitic and oleic acids, was used to produce BHK by using operating condition based-on RPO optimal condition. The biofuel yield derived from PKO reached at the same quantity. On the other hand, kerosene selectivity obtained was higher than in case of RPO (55.35%). However, high oxygen content was found in PKO-derived BHK, and this affected to freezing point and total acid number. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Flocculants are foreign particles that aggregate suspended microalgae cells and due to cost factor and toxicity, harvesting of microalgae biomass has shifted towards the use of bioflocculants. In this study, mild acid-extracted bioflocculants from waste chicken's eggshell and clam shell were used to harvest Chlorella vulgaris that was cultivated using chicken compost as nutrient source. It was found that a maximum of 99% flocculation efficiency can be attained at pH medium of 9.8 using 60 mg/L of hydrochloric acid-extracted chicken's eggshell bioflocculant at 50 °C of reaction temperature. On the other hand, 80 mg/L of hydrochloric acid-extracted clam shell bioflocculant was sufficient to recover C. vulgaris biomass at pH 9.8 and optimum temperature of 40 °C. The bioflocculants and bioflocs were characterized using microscopic, zeta potential, XRD, AAS and FT-IR analysis. The result revealed that calcium ions in the bioflocculants are the main contributor towards the flocculation of C. vulgaris, employing charge neutralization and sweeping as possible flocculation mechanisms. The kinetic parameters were best fitted pseudo-second order which resulted in R2 of 0.99 under optimal flocculation temperature. The results herein, disclosed the applicability of shell waste-derived bioflocculants for up-scaled microalgae harvesting for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper studied the catalytic pyrolysis of rice husk (RH) with different K-compounds (i.e., KOH, K2CO3, and K2C2O4) for co-production of biofuels and porous carbons. The decomposition of biomass occurred at lower temperature ranges due to the catalytic performance of K-compounds, following the order of KOH &gt; K2CO3 &gt; K2C2O4. By fast pyrolysis of RH with the K-compounds, the number of organic compounds was significantly reduced. More hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, long-chain alkanes) were generated due to the in-situ catalytic upgrading (e.g., deoxygenation) of bio-oil. Pyrolysis of biomass with K-compounds could also accelerate the generation of unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. In particular, pyrolysis of RH with K2C2O4 could result in the bio-oil with high-content of hydrocarbons and with low-content of oxygenated compounds (e.g., acids, phenols). Furthermore, the activated char with hierarchically micro-mesoporous structure was applied for toluene sorption. The pristine biochar had a relatively low adsorption time and capacity. By the chemical activation followed by the washing process, the specific surface area (SBET) of the RH-derived chars was significantly increased. The RHC-K2C2O4 had a maximum SBET of 1347 m2/g due to its mild activation process, which further contributed to a highest breakthrough time (1230 min) and capacity (609.38 mg/g) on toluene adsorption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algae are fast-growing, microscopic, and eukaryotic organisms that can perform photosynthesis, and simultaneously fix atmospheric CO2. Algal cells contain high quantity of biofuel precursors such as starch and lipid granules. In the past decades, microalgal biomass has emerged as a potential feedstock for bioenergy generation. In the current scenario, it is being extensively explored to produce liquid (bioethanol, biodiesel) and gaseous (biomethane, biohydrogen) fuels. Algal technology has four crucial aspects including strain selection and its cultivation, harvesting techniques, conversion routes, and pretreatment of biomass. The quality and quantity of biomass, available media source, cultivation system as well as environmental conditions collectively help in the selection of the specific algal strain. Despite several in-depth attempts, there are various hurdles and limitations to make algal biofuel technically and economically viable. To meet the operational and economic feasibility, a collective approach is desirable. The present state-of-the-art review deals with all four crucial aspects of algal technology. The manuscript especially covers the significant methods of harvesting, energy conversion, and pretreatment. Moreover, it also revels the advantage of biological agent mediated harvesting, energy conversion and the pretreatment of algal biomass for sustainable biofuel recovery. The prime objective of this review is to give an insight into the aspects of algal technology to promote collective research in the area of algal biofuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studies have shown that biochar enhances methane formation due to the presence of redox active moieties and its conductive properties. This study investigated the influence of biochar, which was produced from Douglas fir pyrolysis, on biogas production and microbial community during anaerobic digestion (AD) of wastewater sludge. The results showed that biochar significantly enhances methane (CH4) production rate and increases its final yield during AD. The cumulative highest CH4 production obtaining in cultures with DF500 (biochar from Douglas fir at 500 °C) were about 11% and 98% more than the culture without biochar at 37 °C and 25 °C AD temperature, respectively. At 55 °C, the maximum CH4 yield reached 172.3 ml/g COD with DF730, which was about 48.3% more than control culture. The microbial community analysis results showed that biochar could up-regulate the role of micro-ecology especially the methanogens and improve the AD process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental sustainability of second-generation biodiesel (used-cooking-oil) was examined, at industrial-scale, in Greece. The total carbon and environmental footprint per tonne of biodiesel production was ∼0.55t CO2eq (i.e. ∼14g CO2eq/MJ) and 58.37 Pt, respectively. This is ∼40% lower compared to first-generation biodiesel, an order of magnitude lower than the third-generation (microalgae), since the latter is not a fully-fledged technology yet. A threefold reduction in environmental impacts was observed compared to petrodiesel. Environmental hotspots include energy inputs to drive the process, followed by methanol (CH3OH) and potassium methoxide (CH3KO) consumption. Glycerol (C3H8O3) and potassium sulfate (K2SO4), both process co-products, resulted to avoided environmental burdens. Furthermore, used-cooking-oil valorisation for biodiesel production can address water pollution concerns from its disposal to the sewage system. The total distance and means of transport were found to influence the system's environmental sustainability. Strong incentives for used-cooking-oil recycling, widespread collection systems, and biodiesel supply chain optimization are still pending in Greece, Europe, and further afield. Given its overall low environmental footprint and capability to be produced at commercial scales, the second-generation biodiesel, which currently represents 15% of the biodiesel market in Greece, could act as a stepping-stone in decarbonizing Europe's transport sector and improving supply and energy security. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A versatile catalyst based on halloysite and zinc oxide (HNT@ZnO) was prepared, for the first time, starting from ZnO commercial bulk form as Zn precursor source, in a one-pot procedure. This strategy gives the possibility to obtain small ZnO nanoparticles loaded on the HNT surface without the use of inorganic salts which envisage the removal of undesired anions and therefore a calcination process at high temperature. It was found that the presence of halloysite improved the UV–vis spectral absorption ability of ZnO. The hybrid was successful used as photocatalyst for the methylorange and rhodamine B degradation. In addition, after eight consecutive cycles for the methylorange photodegradation, the hybrid did not exhibit significant reduction in its photocatalytic performances confirming its stability. Based on trapping experiments and calculated energy bands we also proposed a photocatalytic mechanism. Furthermore, to evaluate the versatility of the synthetized HNT@ZnO hybrid, we used it as catalyst for biodiesel production from soybean oil, too. Also, in this case, the hybrid showed good catalytic performance and recyclability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the use of higher blend percentage of biodiesel in diesel engines without affecting much on the performance of engines using fuel additives. Waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel B30 blend (WCO 30% + neat diesel 70%) and B40 (WCO 40% + neat diesel 70%) are used as the fuel together with diethyl ether and Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles as additives. Biodiesel is mixed with 2% by volume of diethyl ether (DEE) and 80 ppm concentration of CeO2 nanoparticles which are maintained constant throughout the study. Performance, combustion characteristics and emission parameters have been studied and compared with the values for neat B30 and B40 biodiesel. Results showed that brake thermal efficiency of B30 with additives is 29.57% and is at par with neat B20 operation (29.72%). Maximum reduction of HC and smoke emissions are observed for B40 with additives, which are 16% and 11.7% less than neat B20 fuel operation. B30 with diethyl ether and CeO2 nanoparticles showed minimum NOx emission which is 6% less than neat B20. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, thermophilic lipase QLM from Alcaligenes sp. has been successfully immobilized in bio-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through biomimetic mineralization, using zinc acetate and adenine as metal ion and organic ligand, respectively. The morphology and structure of lipase@Bio-MOF was systematically characterized by scanning electron microcopy (SEM), transmission electron microcopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR). The enzyme loading in immobilized enzyme was measured to be 15.9 % by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Further, it was demonstrated to possess favorable catalytic activity and stability under high temperature and alkaline conditions and in the presence of metal ions, using the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl caprylate as a model. Finally, the immobilized enzyme was successfully applied in the preparation of biodiesel through the trans-esterification of sunflower oil with methanol, obtaining a conversion of >60 % at a high oil/methanol ratio of 8:1. Meanwhile, it showed excellent recyclability during the biodiesel production, and no changes of morphology and crystal structure were observed after being used for 3 cycles. Overall, the immobilized lipase in bio-based MOFs provided an economically and environmentally viable biocatalyst for the synthesis of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study characterized the catalytic combustions and emissions of litchi peels as a function of five catalysts as well as the effect of the best catalyst on the pyrolysis by-products. Na2CO3 and K2CO3 accelerated the devolatilization but delayed the coke burnout, while Al2O3 enhanced the coke oxidation rate. Both comprehensive combustion index and average activation energy dropped with the added catalysts. CO2, CO, and H2O were the main combustion gases between 300 and 510 °C. CO2, C-H, C=O, and C-O were generated from the pyrolysis between 200 and 430 °C above which CO2 and CH4 were slightly released. Total H2O, CO2, CO, NOx and SOx emissions declined with the added catalysts among which K2CO3 performed better. The main pyrolytic by-products at 330 °C were terpenoids and steroids (71.87%), phenols (15.51%), aliphates (9.95%), and small molecules (2.78%). At 500 °C, terpenoids and steroids (78.35%), and small molecules (3.20%) rose, whereas phenols (12.87%), and aliphates (5.83%) fell. Fatty acid, and ester decreased, while terpenoids, and steroids increased with MgCO3 at 330 °C. Litchi peels appeared to be a promising biowaste, with MgCO3 as the optimal catalytic option in terms of the bioenergy performance, and emission reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diesel-like hydrocarbons were produced by the catalytic deoxygenation (DO) of Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) over novel Agx/AC and Niy-Agx/AC catalysts under an H2-free atmosphere. The AC was synthesized from coconut fibre residues (CFR), where CFR is the by-product from coconut milk extraction and is particularly rich in soft fibres with high mineral content. The Niy-Agx/AC catalyst afforded higher DO activity via the decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) route than Agx/AC due to the properties of Ni, synergistic interaction of Ni and Ag species, adequate amount of strong acid sites and large number of weak acid sites, which cause extensive C-O cleavage and lead to rich formation of n-(C15+C17) hydrocarbons. The effect of Ag and Ni content were studied within the 5 to 15 wt% range. An optimum Ni and Ag metal content (5 wt%) for deCOx reaction was observed. Excess Ni is not preferable due to a tendency for cracking and Ag-rich containing catalyst weakly enforced triglycerides breaking. The Ni5-Ag5/AC govern exclusively decarbonylation reaction, which corroborates the presence of Ni2+ species and a high amount of strong acid sites. Ultimately, Ni5-Ag5/AC in the present study shows excellent chemical stability with consistent five reusability without drastic reduction of hydrocarbon yield (78–95%) and n-(C15+C17) selectivity (82–83%), which indicate favourable application in JCO DO. © 2019

AB  - This paper aims in assessing the effect of biofuel blend such as butanol, jatropha methyl ester, soya methyl ester and rapeseed methyl ester as an additive for the aviation fuel. In addition to the blends, the nanoparticle TiO2 of 3% is added to the biofuel. The nanoparticle mixed at the concentration of 300ppm by ultrasonication process. The fuel Jet A, B27T, J27T, S27T and R27T are investigated for combustion and emission characteristics for various throttle settings in micro gas turbine engine. Addition of additives improves the ultimate property of the fuel by reducing the kinematic viscosity. The fuel blend B27T reports 25% increase in total static thrust and 22% reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption. From the results it is evident that, all fuel blends showed a significant reduction in emission values owing to high oxygen content. In addition, the thermal efficiency of the B27T and J27T is improved appreciably to 30% and 10% higher than Jet A fuel owing to the influence of the nanoparticle TiO2. On the other hand, the emissions like CO and NOx reduced drastically up to 70% and 45% respectively. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of waste greenhouse plastic films and rice husk over a hierarchical HZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst was performed in an analytical Py-GC/MS. We evaluated the effect of pyrolysis temperature and the ratio of rice husk to waste greenhouse plastic films on the total peak area of condensable organic products and CO2. In order to evaluate synergy possibilities among the two feedstocks, we performed non-catalytic pyrolysis and catalytic fast pyrolysis of rice husk and waste greenhouse plastic films separately. In addition, we report results for the catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of the mixture rice husk and waste greenhouse plastic films. The maximum relative content of hydrocarbons from catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of rice husk and waste greenhouse plastic films is obtained at 600 °C. When the mass ratio of rice husk to waste greenhouse plastic films is 1:1.5, the relative content of hydrocarbons reaches a maximum (71.1%). The hierarchical micro-mesoporous composite molecular sieve used in this work has outstanding catalytic activity and increases the relative content of hydrocarbons. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The large-scale application of bio-oil has been restricted due to its high O content, strong acidity and low heat value. Therefore, the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenols, acids, and ketones as bio-oil model compounds for hydrocarbon fuel via Ni-based catalysts modified by metal oxides (Al, La and Ga) was investigated. The results showed that the hydrocarbon content was over 70.65% when the mixed supported catalysts Ni/HZSM-5-γ-Al2O3, Ni/HBeta-La2O3 and Ni/HBeta-Ga2O3 were used for the HDO of guaiacol (GUA). Cyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons were the main products. Among these catalysts, Ni/HZSM-5-γ-Al2O3 was the most effective in the HDO of acetic acid. The conversion and hydrocarbon content were 100.00% and 88.62%, respectively. Long-chain alkanes were the main components of the upgraded liquid. Ni/HZSM-5-γ-Al2O3 was beneficial for the HDO of hydroxyacetone with 100.00% conversion, 80.30% hydrocarbon content and 48.67% yield. The HDO pathways of GUA, acetic acid and hydroxyacetone were as follows: 1) GUA was mainly converted into benzene and its derivatives by transmethylation, isomerization and hydrogenation (HYD). 2) Acetic acid was converted to long-chain alkanes by HYD, self-condensation, saturated HYD and isomerization. 3) Hydroxyacetone was converted into long-chain alkanes by HYD, self-condensation, demethylation, aldol condensation and saturated HYD. This work provides basic data for obtaining renewable hydrocarbon fuel from biomass via HDO with a low-cost catalyst. © 2019

AB  - Algae are potential feedstock for the production of bioenergy and valuable chemicals. After the extraction of specific value-added products, algal residues can be further converted into biogas, biofuel, and biochar through various thermochemical treatments such as conventional pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis, hydrothermal conversion, and torrefaction. The compositions and physicochemical characteristics of algal biochar that determine the subsequent applications are comprehensively discussed. Algal biochar carbonized at high-temperature showed remarkable performance for use as supercapacitors, CO2 adsorbents, and persulfate activation, due to its graphitic carbon structure, high electron transport, and specific surface area. The algal biochar produced by pyrolysis at moderate-temperature exhibits high performance for adsorption of pollutants due to combination of miscellaneous functional groups and porous structures, whereas coal fuel can be obtained from algae via torrefaction by pyrolysis at relatively low-temperature. The aim of this review is to study the production of algal biochar in a cost-effective and environmental-friendly method and to reduce the environmental pollution associated with bioenergy generation, achieving zero emission energy production. © 2020 The Author

AB  - This study investigated the influence of operating parameters on the physical and chemical properties of solid and liquid products after the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of green waste, e.g. - acacia: residence time (2 and 4 h), biomass to water ratio (1:10, 1:8, and 1:5) and temperature (180, 200 and 220 °C). The hydrochars had a higher carbon content (from c.a. 50–67%) which resulted in a two times higher fixed carbon and calorific value. Additionally, the structural features were investigated by a scanning electron microscope, van Soest fibre analysis (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin), and Fourier Infrared Spectroscopy to confirm any changes in the chemical structure. Moreover, the thermal behaviour of the hydrochars under combustion conditions were studied. Collaterally, the liquid products were analysed by measuring pH and conductivity, which confirmed their acidic and polar character. Chemical Oxygen Demand with very high values was conducted indicating that the liquid phase contained a high concentration of organic matter and nutrients. The collected and analysed data revealed that residence time and reaction temperature were the most prominent factors which caused enhancement of the energetic properties of the hydrochars. Whereas, biomass to water ratio was found to be negligible. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - In this work, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of corn stover, obtained from north Alberta farms, was performed at different temperatures of 250, 300, 350 and 375 °C, initial pressures (Pi) of 300 and 600 psi and retention time (tr) of 0, 15, 30 and 60 min. All experiments were performed in a 250 mL autoclave reactor with 5 g corn stover and 30 mL de-ionized water (corresponding feed to water ratio of 1:6) in inert N2 condition. The highest yield of heavy oil (29.25 wt%) was obtained at 300 °C, final pressure (Pf) of 2200 psi and 0 min retention time. The highest yield of hydrochar (30.21 wt%) was obtained at 350 °C, Pf of 3150 psi and tr of 15 min. Based on elemental analysis and energy calculation, highest carbon content and higher heating value for heavy oil was 76.32 wt% and 35.13 MJ/kg at 375 °C, Pf of 600 psi and tr of 15 min; and for hydrochar it was 68.23 wt% and 24.7 MJ/kg at 350 °C, Pf of 3150 psi and tr of 15 min. The GC–MS results for heavy oil indicated that majority of the compounds were phenolic in nature. SEM and FTIR results confirmed the presence of oxygen containing function groups on hydrochar surface. The gas was mainly composed of CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, C4H8, C4H6, C5H12, C6H14, and C6H12. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, combined approach of torrefaction deoxygenation pretreatment (TDP) and shape selective catalytic fast pyrolysis (SS-CFP) using bifunctional catalyst (metal modified HZSM-5) were employed to improve the yield of bio-BTX derived from the renewable starting material of lignin. Results showed that after TDP, the oxygen element could be removed effectively. The oxygen removal efficiency reached its maximum value of 22.27% at 300 °C, resulting in markedly decrease of unnecessary oxygenates in bio-oil. Compared to parent HZSM-5, all metal modified HZSM-5 (Ga/HZSM-5, Zn/HZSM-5, and Ga-Zn/HZSM-5) promoted the formation of bio-BTX. Zn/HZSM-5 showed the highest selective yield of bio-BTX because of the enhancement deoxygenation reaction of oxygenates and the aromatization reaction of olefins. The combined approach of TDP and SS-CFP remarkably improved the selective yield of bio-BTX, reaching the maximum value of 65.19%, which was much higher than that from single approach of TDP (33.84%) and SS-CFP (47.36%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae bio-oil production is related to the sustainable use of world energy in the future. In the present work, catalytic pyrolysis and liquefaction behavior of microalgae for bio-oil production were investigated. The results show that the rare earth compounds as catalysts contributed to significantly accelerating the pyrolysis of microalgae via reducing the activation energy of pyrolysis process. Ce(II)/HZSM-5 presented the optimal catalytic pyrolysis and liquefaction effects by helping cut the microalgae molecule chains. The maximum bio-oil yield amounted to 49.71 wt% at the catalyst concentration of 5 wt%. The chemical components of the Spirulina bio-oil were composed of carboxylic acids, ketones, olefins, amides, ethers, esters, and partially cyclic N-containing compounds. Although the combustion performances of the Spirulina bio-oil are worse than those of the diesel fuel, it is superior to the reported rice husk bio-oil, suggesting a promising potential application prospect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study proposes a sustainable waste-to-energy/biochar platform using a toxic microalgal biomass waste. In particular, CO2-feeding pyrolysis of Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) waste was investigated, focusing on the analysis of gaseous pyrolysates and properties of biochar with a construction of mass balance. Also, the catalytic capability of biochar produced from M. aeruginosa was explored to reinforce the mechanistic impact of CO2 on the pyrolysis process within the overall process level. Ni impregnated biochar composite was further synthesized and used as a catalyst to promote syngas formation in the CO2-feeding pyrolysis process of M. aeruginosa. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Valorization of lignin to valuable chemicals and biofuels increases the economic viability of sustainable biorefineries. This work aimed at elucidating how the lignin structures recovered from various agricultural and industrial residues governed the downstream catalytic conversion. Three types of lignins, namely bio-enzymatic lignin (BL), organosolv lignin (OL), and Kraft lignin (KL), were fully characterized by HSQC-NMR, TGA, FTIR, and SEM to obtain a detailed description of their structures. In consideration of redox-active CuO and highly active carbon-modified boron nitride (BCN) in oxidative dehydrogenation, a two-dimensional CuO/BCN catalyst was prepared and explored in microwave-assisted lignin conversion to improve the yields of aromatic monomers. BL achieved the highest yield of monomers (10 wt%) over the CuO/BCN catalyst after the 3rd cycle in 30 min under mild conditions (200 °C). The yields of bio-oils reached 70 wt% in 10 min when BL and OL were used as the substrate. High efficiency of the microwave-assisted reaction was illustrated by comparing with that of the hydrothermal reaction. This work demonstrated strong dependence of the conversion efficiency on the interunit linkages and functional groups of lignin structures. The strong metal-support interaction between CuO and BCN not only facilitated lignin depolymerization via the promoted electron transfer, but also enhanced the stability of Cu catalysts under hydrothermal conditions. In addition, elucidation of the catalyst redox evolution shed light on the role of the CuO/BCN catalyst in lignin depolymerization in recycle runs. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The current experimental study presents solid (non-volatile) particle number emissions with a size cut-off at 23 nm (SPN23, referred to as PN hereinafter) under real-world driving conditions for 8 passenger cars powered by diesel, gasoline, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and hybrid-electric powertrains. The objective was to identify the highest emitters and assess whether PN focus should be extended to engine and fuel types other than diesel and gasoline direct injection (GDI). Results (under the cold-start RDE-compliant route) show that a Euro 6b gasoline vehicle equipped with port fuel injection (PFI) engine, comprised the highest PN emitter (4.5 times higher than the Euro 6 limit of 6 × 1011 p/km), while similar emission levels (up to 3.7 times higher than this limit) were detected in the older-technology (Euro 3 and 4) gasoline and (retrofitted) LPG PFI vehicles. This limit was also exceeded (by 1.7 times) by one gasoline direct injection (GDI) Euro 6b non-GPF vehicle. PN emissions from the hybrid-electric vehicle (equipped with gasoline PFI engine) were lower than the other Euro 6b PFI vehicle, but still high compared to typical PFI engines found in literature. The lowest emissions were detected in diesel and CNG engines (as low as 7.8 × 109 and 2.4 × 1010 p/km respectively). Euro 6b LPG vehicle was found to be a low emitter (3.3 times lower than the 6 × 1011 p/km limit), while similar emission levels were detected in the other Euro 6b non-GPF GDI vehicle. Among the different driving sections (urban, rural, motorway), urban and especially the cold phase had the highest contribution in most cases. Finally, a significant PN reduction potential was observed with LPG and CNG over gasoline (up to 93% and 90% respectively), although the opposite trend was detected in an old-technology retrofitted LPG vehicle. These results indicate that close attention should be focused on other engine and fuel types, apart from diesel and GDI. Regulatory initiatives towards air pollution reduction should include measures for the reduction of high-emission old-technology gasoline and LPG vehicles, while modern gasoline PFI engines should also be further scrutinized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluates the use of engineered biochar as a heterogeneous solid acid catalyst for transesterification of algal oil derived from a native microalgal consortium. Biochar derived from sugarcane bagasse, coconut shell, corncob and peanut shell were evaluated for catalytic activity following surface modification. Peanut shell pyrolyzed at 400 °C with the sulfonic acid density of 0.837 mmol/g having 6.616 m2/g surface area was selected for efficient catalysis. The efficiency of transesterification was evaluated with 1–7 wt% catalyst loading, methanol: oil ratio of 6:1 to 30:1 at 55–85 °C over 2–8 h. Biodiesel yield of 94.91% was obtained with 5 wt% catalyst loading, MeOH: oil ratio of 20:1 at 65 °C after 4 h. Spectral analysis of algal biodiesel showed the presence of functional groups corresponding to esters. GC–MS analysis revealed the prominent presence of palmitic and oleic acids, further advocating the suitability of the technology for commercial application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biochar production from invasive species biomass discarded as waste was studied in a fixed bed reactor pyrolysis system under different temperature conditions for value-added applications. Prior to pyrolysis, the biomass feedstock was characterized by proximate, ultimate, and heating value analyses, while the biomass decomposition behavior was examined by thermogravimetric analysis. The heating values of the feedstock biomass ranged from 18.65 to 20.65 MJ/kg, whereas the volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash content were 61.54–72.04 wt %, 19.27–26.61 wt % and 1.51–1.86 wt %, respectively. The elemental composition of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the samples was reported to be in the range of 47.41–48.47 wt %, 5.50–5.88 wt % and 46.10–45.18 wt %, respectively, while the nitrogen and sulphur content in the biomass samples were at very low concentrations, making it more useful for valorization from environmental aspects. The biochar yields were reported in the range of 45.36–58.35 wt %, 28.63–44.38 wt % and 22.68–29.42 wt % at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C, respectively. The biochars were characterized from ultimate analysis, heating value, energy densification ratio, energy yield, pH, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM and EDX), to evaluate their potential for value-added applications. The carbon content, heating value, energy densification ratio, and the porosity of the biochars improved with the increase in pyrolysis temperature, while the energy yield, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen content of the biochars decreased. This study revealed the potential of the valorization of underutilized discarded biomass of invasive species via a pyrolysis process to produce biochar for value-added applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A graphene based acid catalyst, GO-PrSO3H, was prepared through a simple two-step process. Surface modification with (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane followed by oxidation of sulfide groups led to the production of sulfonic acid sites on graphene oxide nanosheets. The results of various physicochemical techniques approved the synthesis of desired catalyst. The amount of acid sites was measured via the acid-base treatment with triethylamine which exhibited 1.07 mmol/g H+ in the catalyst structure. Two kinds of acid-catalyzed reactions i.e. esterification and acetalization were adopted to evaluate the catalytic performance of prepared catalyst. More than 90% conversion was achieved for butyl acetate production in acetic acid esterification with n-butanol. Moreover, methyl oleate as one of the main components of biodiesel was produced with good yield over the prepared catalyst via oleic acid esterification with methanol. The 1H NMR technique was also conducted to characterize and determine the amount of produced methyl oleate. Finally, the benzaldehyde acetalization with ethylene glycol was performed which high conversion (92%) was obtained at 3 h. The catalyst reusability for both esterification and acetalization reactions demonstrated the catalyst stability after five reaction cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study critically reviews the recent developments and future opportunities pertinent to the conversion of CO2 as a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) to fuels and valuable products. CO2 emissions have reached an alarming level of around 410 ppm and have become the primary driver of global warming and climate change leading to devastating events such as droughts, hurricanes, torrential rains, floods, tornados and wildfires across the world. These events are responsible for thousands of deaths and have adversely affected the economic development of many countries, loss of billions of dollars, across the globe. One of the promising choices to tackle this issue is carbon sequestration by pre- and post-combustion processes and oxyfuel combustion. The captured CO2 can be converted into fuels and valuable products, including methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), and methane (CH4). The efficient use of the sequestered CO2 for the desalinization might be critical in overcoming water scarcity and energy issues in developing countries. Using the sequestered CO2 to produce algae in combination with wastewater, and producing biofuels is among the promising strategies. Many methods, like direct combustion, fermentation, transesterification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion (AD), and gasification, can be used for the conversion of algae into biofuel. Direct air capturing (DAC) is another productive technique for absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and converting it into various useful energy resources like CH4. These methods can effectively tackle the issues of climate change, water security, and energy crises. However, future research is required to make these conversion methods cost-effective and commercially applicable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Immobilization of industrially important enzymes on supports is important to decrease the cost of the overall enzymatic production procedure. Herein, a novel method for synthesizing a new support, magnetic rice straw (MRS) in one step is reported: rice straw (RS) was soaked with Fe2+ ions and these were further reduced to form embedded Fe2O3 nanoparticles on the RS surface, forming MRS. This material presented a magnetic saturation value of 27.32 emu g−1. Lipase immobilization on MRS resulted in 94.3% immobilization efficiency and 91.3 mg g−1 of enzyme loading, which are higher than immobilization on native RS. The lipase stability was increased approximately 8-fold at 70 °C. The lipase-MRS composite was tested in the esterification reaction of biodiesel production, where it showed prominent reusability. Therefore, this novel and rapid synthesis method can provide ecological and economic support for enzyme immobilization and industrially important product formation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Phosphorus content of the digestate is crucial for evaluating its fertilizer utilization in anaerobic digestion system. The vermiculite containing rich-phosphorus is firstly used as an accelerant in anaerobic batch co-digestion system of aloe peel waste and dairy manure. After introducing vermiculite, the cumulative biogas production (295.14–353.96 mL/g VS), chemical oxygen demand removal rate (45.53%–71.03%), and volatile solid removal rate (50.70%–52.76%) are remarkably higher than those of reference reactor (234.08 mL/g VS, 39.38%, 45.10%). The thermal and fertility analyses manifest the digestates with vermiculite possess superior stability, admirable fertilizer values (5.97%–6.81%), and excellent total phosphorus content (11.44–13.29 g/kg). The improved co-digestion performance can be attributed to the addition of vermiculite. This work introduces a novel approach for improving the performance of anaerobic co-digestion and the fertilizer utilization of digestate in the co-digestion systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Microalgae, due to its well-recognized advantages have gained renewed interest as potentially good feedstock for biodiesel. Production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as a type of biodiesel was carried out from Chlorella vulgaris bio-oil. Biodiesel was produced in the presence of nano-biocatalysts composed of immobilized lipase on functionalized superparamagnetic few-layer graphene oxide via a transesterification reaction. A hybrid of few-layer graphene oxide and Fe3O4 (MGO) was prepared and characterized. The MGO was functionalized with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (MGO-AP) as well as with a couple of AP and glutaraldehyde (MGO-AP-GA). The Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) was immobilized on MGO and MGO-AP using electrostatic interactions as well as on MGO-AP-GA using covalent bonding. The supports, MGO, MGO-AP, and MGO-AP-GA, as well as nano-biocatalyst, ROL/MGO, ROL/MGO-AP, and ROL/MGO-AP-GA, were characterized using FESEM, VSM, FTIR, and XRD. The few-layer graphene oxide was characterized using AFM and the surface charge of supports was evaluated with the zeta potential technique. The nano-biocatalysts assay was performed with an evaluation of kinetic parameters, loading capacity, relative activity, time-course thermal stability, and storage stability. Biodiesel production was carried out in the presence of nano-biocatalysts and their reusability was evaluated in 5 cycles of transesterification reaction. Results: The AFM analysis confirmed the few-layer structure of graphene oxide and VSM also confirmed that all supports were superparamagnetic. The maximum loading of ROL (70.2%) was related to MGO-AP-GA. The highest biodiesel conversion of 71.19% achieved in the presence of ROL/MGO-AP-GA. Furthermore, this nano-biocatalyst could maintain 58.77% of its catalytic performance after 5 cycles of the transesterification reaction and was the best catalyst in the case of reusability. Conclusions: In this study, the synthesized nano-biocatalyst based on bare and functionalized magnetic graphene oxide was applied and optimized in the process of converting microalgae bio-oil to biodiesel for the first time and compared with bare lipase immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles. Results showed that the loading capacity, kinetic parameters, thermal stability, and storage stability improved by the functionalization of MGO. The biocatalysts, which were prepared via covalent bonding immobilization of enzyme generally, showed better characteristics. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels produced from lignocellulosic feedstocks are gaining popularity because of the elevating energy demand, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, escalating fuel prices and dwindling fossil fuel resources. Therefore, it has become important to seek alternative energy resources from renewable waste biomass. In this study, agricultural crop residues such as soybean straw and flax straw were gasified in subcritical water (300 °C) and supercritical water (400 and 500 °C) for H2 production. To maximize the non-catalytic process, the impacts of temperature (300–500 °C), biomass-to-water ratio, BTW (1:5 and 1:10), biomass particle size (0.13 mm and 0.8 mm) and residence time (30–60 min) on H2 production were studied at a pressure range of 22–25 MPa. Maximum H2 yield and total gas yields of 6.62 mmol/g and 14.91 mmol/g, respectively were obtained from soybean straw at the highest temperature (500 °C), lower feed concentration (1:10 BTW), smaller particle size biomass (0.13 mm) and longer residence time (45 min). To evaluate the drift in the experimental H2 yield from the theoretical values, thermodynamic modeling using Gibbs free minimization method was performed. The experimental results showed slight deviations from the thermodynamic models due to the temperature gradient and absence of agitation in the tubular batch reactor. However, the KOH catalyst was found to elevate the H2, CO2 and CH4 yields for soybean straw and flax straw. The findings suggest that supercritical water gasification could be an efficient green technology for H2 production from waste biomass. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass pyrolysis is a renewable technology for the production of bio-oil and chemicals. The present study aims to develop a fundamental and plausible model for cellulose pyrolysis. The product formation characteristics of cellulose pyrolysis were investigated via Py-GC/MS and TGA-FTIR spectroscopy. The density functional theory method was employed to calculate the energy barriers of different pathways, and the formation and interaction mechanisms of the three most abundant components, levoglucosan, hydroxyacetaldehyde, and pyruvaldehyde, were compared. Levoglucosan is most likely formed via a concerted mechanism; hydroxyacetaldehyde can be formed from C1-C2 and C5-C6 via a ring-opening reaction and dehydration, while pyruvaldehyde is produced via ring opening, followed by dehydration and retro-aldol reactions. Related to the variations in products, the formation of hydroxyacetaldehyde and pyruvaldehyde was suggested to compete with that of levoglucosan. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, a plausible reaction scheme was proposed. By accounting for these main reactions, approximately 80% (in relative area) of the products of cellulose pyrolysis were included. This investigation is crucial to downstream process development for biomass and provides guidance for product control. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increasing transportation needs, demand for petroleum-based diesel and harmful vehicular emissions take us to look for safer and economically feasible alternative fuels. Biodiesel produced from Chlorella variabilis MK039712.1 and waste cooking oil was tested and compared with petroleum-based diesel for their performance and emission characteristics using IC Engine set up, tested under Kirloskar TV1 having power 5.20 kW @ 1500 rpm. The effect of algal oil biodiesel (AOBD) on Waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOBD) as blends (0–100%) on Brake thermal efficiency (%) (BTE), Brake power (KW) (BP), Brake specific fuel consumption (kg/kWh) (BSFC), Smoke opacity (%) (SO), CO, CO2, NOx and HC emissions have been investigated. WCOBD has better engine performance than AOBD which is evident from its lower BSFC, higher BTE and BP than AOBD. However, AOBD proves better from an emissions point of view as emission reports show lesser CO% and higher CO2% than WCOBD and CD. NOx emissions for both the fuels were higher compared to Conventional diesel (CD). The properties and performance characteristics of the test blends are found to be comparable with ASTM Standards which is a favourable fuel requirement. Reduction in Smoke opacity (SO) of WCOBD in comparison with CD shows the clean-burning tendency. Overall, the pure and blend of AOBD with WCOBD has improved engine performance and emission characteristics, which is substantiated by the analysis of properties, performance and emission data by absolute percentage deviation (APD) a statistical method of analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The investigation was conducted with an aim to explore the potential of novel, less explored biodiesel from Spirulina platensis algae, which can be used as an alternate fuel for conventional diesel. The effect of biodiesel on performance, combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine was experimentally investigated. The ignition delay period declined to 7.3 °CA for B100 blend compared to 10 °CA for diesel. The heat release rate with biodiesel-diesel blends was lower than base diesel. The duration of combustion for base diesel, B10, B20 and B100 algae biodiesel-diesel blends was found out to be 37.5 ° CA, 38 ° CA, 38 ° CA and 40 ° CA respectively. The carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions were reduced significantly as the percentage of biodiesel in fuel blend is increased. The CO emission decreased from 3.10 g/kWh with diesel to 1.20 g/kWh for B100 at full load. The HC emission showed the decrease from 0.06 g/kWh with diesel to 0.04 g/kWh for B100 whereas smoke emission reduced from 0.7% with diesel to 0.6% for B100 at full load. NOx emission with biodiesel and its blends increased significantly. NOx was 16.19 g/kWh and 13.3 g/kWh with B100 and base diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The concept of thermochemical exhaust heat recuperation by steam reforming of biofuels is considered. Thermochemical recuperation can be considered as an on-board hydrogen production technology. A schematic diagram of a fuel-consuming equipment with thermochemical heat recuperation is described. The thermodynamic analysis of the thermochemical recuperation systems was performed to determine the efficiency of using various fuels, in particular, methanol, ethanol, n-butanol, and glycerol. The thermodynamic analysis was performed by Gibbs free energy minimization method and implemented using the Aspen Hysys program. The thermodynamic analysis was performed for a wide temperature range from 400 to 900 K, for steam-to-fuel of 1, and pressures of 1 bar. The maximum fuel conversion reaches for the following temperatures: methanol - 600 K, ethanol - 730 K, n-butanol - 860 K, glycerol - 890 K. The dependence of the reforming enthalpy on temperature is determined. It was shown that the reaction enthalpy determines the heat transformation coefficient, which shows the ratio of the low heat value of synthetic fuel and the low heat value of the initial fuel. For all studied fuels, the maximum value of the transformation coefficient is observed for steam reforming of ethanol and the maximum heat transformation coefficient is 1.187. The temperature range is determined at which the maximum efficiency of the use of thermochemical recuperation occurs due to the reforming of biofuels. For methanol, the effective temperature is about 600 K, for ethanol is about 700 K, for n-butanol is 850 K, for glycerol is more than 900 K. The results obtained make it possible to efficiently select the type of fuel for thermochemical recuperation due to steam reforming. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Chemical synthesis of amino acids directly from biomass feedstock is rare. Reported here is a one-step protocol to convert crude glycerol, from the biodiesel industry, into 43 % alanine over a Ru1Ni7/MgO catalyst. The multifunctional catalytic system promotes glycerol conversion into lactic acid, and then into alanine. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the existence of bimetallic RuNi species, whereas density-functional theory calculations suggested Ni-doped Ru substantially decreased the Ea of C−H bond dissociation of lactate alkoxide to form pyruvate, which is the rate-determining step. The catalytic route established in this work creates new opportunities for glycerol utilization and enriches the substrate scope of renewable feedstock to access value-added amino acids. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The present work espouses a zero-waste approach for relying on indigenous waste resources to deliver green and sustainable biofuel. This investigation reports biodiesel production from waste cooking oils (WCO) via cheap heterogeneous catalyst obtained from waste Ostrich (Struthio camelus) bones for the first-time. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by Thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Hammett indicator method and surface area calculations. The powdered ostrich bones were calcined at different temperatures, ranging from 600 to 1000 °C. Upon temperature rise, sharp peaks of hydroxyapatite (HAp) appeared as observed by XRD. The reaction parameters have been optimized in presence of the synthesized catalyst to maximize biodiesel yield. The optimum biodiesel yield of 90.56% was attained at methanol/oil ratio 15/1, process temperature 60 °C, catalyst loading 5 wt% within reaction duration of 4 h. It concludes that hydroxyapatite (HAp) derived from ostrich bones showed good catalytic performance to produce biodiesel from WCO. The synthesized catalyst sustained adequate catalytic activity even after being repeatedly recycled four times, which infers low-cost biodiesel production opportunities. Furthermore, an integrated waste oil/bone collection approach is recommended for the effective utilization of indigenous waste to produce biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Interest in biodiesel research has escalated over the years due to dwindling fossil fuel reserves. The implementation of a carbon-based solid acid catalyst in biodiesel production eradicates the separation problems associated with homogeneous catalysis. However, its application in the glycerol-free interesterification process for biodiesel production is still rarely being studied in the literature. In this study, novel environmentally benign catalysts were prepared from oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) derived activated carbon (AC) which is sustainable and low cost via direct sulfonation using concentrated sulfuric acid. The effects of synthesizing variables such as carbonization and sulfonation temperatures with different holding times towards the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield in interesterification reaction with oleic acid and methyl acetate were investigated in detail. It was found that the optimum carbonization temperature and duration together with sulfonation temperature and duration were 600 °C, 3 h, 100 °C and 6 h, respectively. The catalyst possessed an amorphous structure with a high total acid density of 9.0 mmol NaOH g−1 due to the well-developed porous framework structure of the carbon support. Under these optimum conditions, the OPEFB derived solid acid catalyst recorded an excellent catalytic activity of 50.5% methyl oleate yield at 100 °C after 8 h with 50:1 methyl acetate to oleic acid molar ratio and 10 wt% catalyst dosage. The heterogeneous acid catalyst derived from OPEFB had shown promising properties that made them highly suitable for cost-effective and environmental-friendly glycerol-free biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Heterogeneous solid catalysts have been largely developed for biodiesel production, because of their attractive acid-base properties, strong hydrothermal stability, and efficient recovery/reusability. In this framework, developing bio-waste derived heterogeneous catalysts has attracted immense attention for several catalytic applications, owing to their inexpensive, high abundance, non-toxic, and adequate acid-base properties. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a biomass-derived orange peel ash (OPA), which contains a porous structure, as a raw heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel. About 98 % conversion of soybean oil to biodiesel was obtained under the optimized reaction conditions i.e., 6:1 methanol:oil ratio, 7 wt. % catalyst loading, 7 h reaction time at ambient reaction temperature, which ascribed to the presence of abundant basic sites in the developed OPA catalyst. The catalyst can be reused for five successive cycles and shows good stability towards the biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, activated carbon (AC) powder prepared by lotus leaves was impregnated with CuFe2O4 nanoparticles and the AC/CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were then encapsulated with CaO. Therefore, the AC/CuFe2O4@CaO was used as an efficient and novel nanocatalyst to produce biodiesel from chicken fat. In order to determine the physical characteristics of the AC/CuFe2O4@CaO nanocatalyst, a number of analyses were performed, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX), X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) analyses. The results of EDX analysis showed that the catalyst was well synthesized. Also, TEM analysis proved that the catalyst consists of nanoscale particles. In addition, impacts of various factors including methanol/oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time and temperature on the produced biodiesel from the chicken fat were investigated. The results showed that the best biodiesel yield of 95.6% could be achieved at a methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, catalyst concentration of 3 wt%, reaction time of 4 h, and reaction temperature of 65 °C which was a considerable amount. Moreover, the characteristics of the biodiesel fuel such as density, kinematic viscosity, pour point, flash point, cloud point, Ca content, acid number, and oxidation stability were measured and compared to ASTM D6751 and EN14214 international standards. The results illustrated that biodiesel was not suitable for cold weather, while very good outcomes were observed in terms of the flash point. Besides, biodiesel had density, viscosity, acid number, and oxidation stability within the range of above mentioned standards. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis combined to either thermal cracking or catalytic cracking of municipal solid waste was performed in a laboratory-scale facility consisting of a fixed-bed reactor followed by a tubular cracking reactor. The results showed great potential for the production of syngas. The incorporation of inexpensive and widely available dolomite in the cracking reactor (with a constant feedstock to calcined dolomite ratio of 5:1) favoured the catalytic cracking of the primary pyrolysis products towards H2 and CO in a temperature range of 800–900 °C. More particularly, it was possible at 900 °C to achieve a syngas consisting of more than 80 vol% CO and H2 with a heating value of 16 MJ/Nm3. Additionally, a homogeneous solid fuel was obtained as a solid residue, which can be used to provide additional energy to support the process or as a refuse-derived fuel. Thus, the great potential of this process was demonstrated for turning municipal solid waste into a valuable gas fraction that can be used directly as a fuel or as a source of different value-added products. © 2019

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) uses enzymes to convert the chemical energy of renewable biofuels into electrical energy, which shows great promise in the continuous power supply of implantable devices. Meanwhile, integrating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with high conductivity and superior structural properties of bacterial cellulose (BC) as backbone to construct CNTs-BC based nanocomposites has proven to be an effective strategy. Herein, a highly flexible electrode of amidoxime-modified BC (AOBC)/carboxylated multi-walled CNTs (c-MWCNTs) were prepared by vacuum filtration with excellent laccase (LAC) immobilization. Subsequently, we developed a novel EBFC that intramolecular electron transfer was achieved by an alternative pathway for generating electricity within a single enzyme molecule of LAC. Sufficient power was efficiently extracted from unconventional fuels in single-LAC biofuel cells, including persistent pollutants (e.g., bisphenol A, hydroquinone and pyrocatechol). The open circuit voltage generated by EBFC was 0.14 V and the power density reached 1.897 W m−3. This novel single-enzymatic biofuel cell exhibited a potential for recycling of waste water as fuel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable alternative to “petro-diesel”. There is an established conventional production technology based on refined vegetable oils. However, this is always more expensive than petroleum-based diesel, mainly due to the feedstock cost, and the biodiesel market is based on subsidies. Use of a cheap non-edible feedstock, such as waste shark liver oil (WSLO), would reduce the biodiesel production cost and make the process more economically viable. In this study, production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) from WSLO using both acid (H2SO4) and base (NaOH) catalysts were investigated using a Design of Experiments approach (response surface methodology). Due to the high levels of FFA (free fatty acids) homogeneous alkali-catalysed transesterification of WSLO was less effective than the acid-catalysed process, resulting in WSLO to FAME conversion of 12% after 60 min, with maximum FAME conversion of about 40% after 15 min. Acid-catalysed WSLO transesterification achieved 99% FAME conversion at 10.3 M ratio of methanol to WSLO, 6.5 h reaction time, 60 °C temperature, and 5.9 wt % of H2SO4 catalyst. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae can be easily integrated into an effective and scalable zero-carbon-emission circular process that exploits their CO2 fixation and wastewater remediation capabilities while simultaneously using their residues as an energy and biofuel source to power global sustainable development. Herein, the use of glycogen-rich Arthrospira platensis microalgae for efficient water decontamination, biofuel production, and CO2 fixation is explored. The circular process is initiated by efficient bioremediation of heavy metals (removal &gt;99%) during microalgal growth, followed by bioethanol production, pellet production, and mineralization of persistent organic pollutants from wastewater, and is accompanied by CO2 fixation and/or oxygen production. Microalgal biomass generated during heavy metal bioremediation is used to produce bioethanol via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (0.4 L per kg of dried microalgal biomass). The residual biomass obtained after bioethanol production is dried and compressed into pellets for its use as a fuel in biomass boilers (calorific power = 20.6 ± 0.2 MJ kg−1). The iron-rich ashes produced during pellet combustion are subsequently used as heterogeneous re-usable Fenton-like catalysts for the photo-Fenton degradation (mineralization &gt;99%) of persistent organic pollutants. Finally, the low-activity ashes are incorporated into an ash-based medium for the efficient cultivation of microalgae. For each proposed step, product characterization and evaluation were conducted to optimize and enhance the process performance while minimizing negative effects on the environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fuelling methyl ester derived from green algae, Chlorella emersonii in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes Chlorella emersonii methyl ester (CEME) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in fresh water, marine and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. CEME was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single cylinder diesel engine at constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion and emission (regulated and unregulated) characteristics. Test results projected that, the characteristics of 20% CEME+80%diesel fuel blend was in par with diesel fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, THC, CO and smoke emissions. However, CEME blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO2 and NOx emissions. In terms of unregulated emissions, CEME blends in diesel showed lowered toluene and acetaldehyde emissions. However, acetone and formaldehyde emissions increased with higher percentage of CEME in diesel blend. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of CEME were comparatively lower than diesel fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction has emerged as a preferred means of converting wet biomass to biocrude. In this study, we examined the hydrothermal conversion of sludge over a large range of conditions (300–600 °C, 1–60 min) that included both nominally isothermal processing and non-isothermal processing (rapid heating, short times). An empirical severity index was employed to combine the effects of reaction temperature and holding time into a single parameter. The highest biocrude yields (20.1–30.9 wt%) were achieved at 10−1 &lt; severity index &lt; 102 and about 32% and 63% of the nitrogen in sludge transferred into the biocrude and aqueous phase products, respectively. A Van Krevelen diagram illustrated that dehydration and decarboxylation pathways were important for biocrude and light biocrude formation whereas dehydration paths were more important for heavy biocrude. We developed a quantitative kinetics model that faithfully correlated the effects of time and temperature on the yields of biocrude, aqueous phase products, solid, gas, and volatiles. It also accurately predicted the yields of the product fractions from hydrothermal liquefaction at 350 °C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, pyrolysis of residual biomass from the agro-alimentary industry of Argentina was investigated. The studied biomasses were rice husk, peanut shell and wheat straw. The effect of pyrolysis temperature over solid (bio-char), liquid (bio-oil) and gas (bio-gas) fractions weight yields were evaluated for each biomass, in the range of 350–650 °C. The maximum yield of bio-oil was obtained at 550 °C for rice husk (45 wt%) and wheat straw (58 wt%), and at 500 °C for peanut shells (51 wt%). At those temperatures, the data recorded the smallest spread around the mean. Different characterization techniques of raw biomass were reported, namely, thermal behavior; proximate and ultimate analysis; content of Ca, Al, K, Si and Fe; and hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin composition. Bio-oils characterization included water content and chemical compounds identification. Furthermore, bio-char HHV and BET surface area were measured. Rice husk bio-oil showed 21% selectivity towards furans of which 75% corresponded to furfural and 5-HMF. Peanut shell bio-char presented the highest Higher Heating Value (7250 kcal/kg) and BET surface area (215 m2/g). In addition, co-pyrolysis reactions and the synergistic effects over obtained products completed this study. Co-pyrolysis bio-oils yields varied between 41 and 46 wt%, for all the mixtures. Bio-oil water content decreased up to 15% for rice husk mixed with peanut shell or wheat straw. Moreover, 5-HMF was detected in all bio-oils, and furfural selectivity was higher than 5% in the three mixtures investigated. © 2019

AB  - An immobilization protocol of a model enzyme into silica nanoparticles was applied. This protocol exploited the use of the bifunctional molecule triethoxysilylpropylisocyanate (TEPI) for covalent binding through a linker of suitable length. The enzyme β-glucosidase (BG) was anchored onto wrinkled silica nanoparticles (WSNs). BG represents a bottleneck in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels through cellulose hydrolysis and fermentation. The key aspect of the procedure was the use of an organic solvent (anhydrous acetone) in which the enzyme was not soluble. This aimed to restrict its conformational changes and thus preserve its native structure. This approach led to a biocatalyst with improved thermal stability, characterized by high immobilization efficiency and yield. It was found that the apparent KM value was about half of that of the free enzyme. The Vmax was about the same than that of the free enzyme. The biocatalyst showed a high operational stability, losing only 30% of its activity after seven reuses. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microalgae are recognized as a potential source of biomass for obtaining bioenergy. However, the lack of studies towards economic viability and environmental sustainability of the entire production chain limits its large-scale application. The use of wastewaters economizes natural resources used for algal biomass cultivation. However, desirable biomass characteristics for a good fuel may be impaired when wastewaters are used, namely low lipid content and high ash and protein contents. Thus, the choice of wastewaters with more favorable characteristics may be one way of obtaining a more balanced macromolecular composition of the algal biomass and therefore, a more suitable feedstock for the desired energetic route. The exploration of biorefinery concept and the use of wastewaters as culture medium are considered as the main strategic tools in the search of this viability. Considering the economics of overall process, direct utilization of wet biomass using hydrothermal liquefaction or hydrothermal carbonization and anaerobic digestion is recommended. Among the explored routes, anaerobic digestion is the most studied process. However, some main challenges remain as little explored, such as a low energy pretreatment and suitable and large-scale reactors for algal biomass digestion. On the other hand, thermochemical conversion routes offer better valorization of the algal biomass but have higher costs. A biorefinery combining anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction processes would provide the maximum possible output from the biomass depending on its characteristics. Therefore, the choice must be made in an integrated way, aiming at optimizing the quality of the final product to be obtained. Life cycle assessment studies are critical for scaling up of any algal biomass valorization technique for sustainability. Although there are limitations, suitable integrations of these processes would enable to make an economically feasible process which require further study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sulfonated activated carbon-based catalysts were prepared by microwaved-assisted carbonization of phosphoric acid activated corncob followed by sulfonation using concentrated sulfuric acid. Sulfonation at different temperatures and times resulted in varied SO3H group density of the SAC catalysts. Sulfonation temperature showed a significant effect on the introduction of SO3H on the AC precursor while time had minor role. The SAC catalysts were characterized by means of N2 sorption analysis (specific surface area, pore-volume, average pore width), FTIR spectroscopy, SEM imaging, and sulfur analysis. The impact of catalysts SO3H density on the product distribution and bio-oil composition from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir and LDPE was evaluated. The highest bio-jet fuels (aromatics and C9-16 alkanes) obtained was 97.51% using the SAC catalyst sulfonated at 100 °C for 5 h. Results showed that SAC has great potential as catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics for the production of jet-fuel range hydrocarbons. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Here we report a study on the technical feasibility of using purified animal fat as additive in a diesel fuel for internal combustion engines. The objective is to obtain a base fat with contaminant-free and ready to be diluted in petroleum diesel to obtain a diesel fuel blend with acceptable characteristics in terms of engine-system tolerances. A crude fat refining process composed of a vacuum distillation step and a glycerolysis step to convert the free fatty acids (FFA) recovered from distillation step into triglycerides (TAG) is used. Parametric study to determine the optimal purification-process conditions are used. The TAG obtained after a refining step, is then blended with standard diesel. A satisfactory formulation has already been used to power a system-equipped (converted) diesel engine, and blend ratio of up to 40% in standard diesel perform well enough to run the target engine. The results of this study show that this approach is technically feasible and economically interesting for recovering this waste into fuel. Moreover, it permits a decrease of the fuel carbon balance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The exploration for alternative fuels was prompted by increasing environmental concerns, rising conventional fuel prices and fossil fuel depletion. The improved potential of waste cooking oil makes it desirable for its utilization for biodiesel production. In the present study, enzymatic transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) is done using lipase enzyme to produce waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME) and three different test blends were used namely, Diesel+20% of WCOME, Diesel+40% of WCOME, and Diesel+60% of WCOME. After several trials the optimum reaction factors found to be methanol as the alcohol, 1.5% enzyme concentration (by weight of WCO), 3:1 M ratio and 4 h reaction time. The performance and engine characteristics like as brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, and the emissions of CO, HC, and NOx were analyzed in unmodified compression ignition engine. Test results revealed that the blend with lower biodiesel content performed well in the engine with lowered CO, HC and NOx emissions. But with the higher biodiesel concentrations, there was a considerable increase in the emission spectrum. Overall, Diesel+20% of WCOME and diesel+40% of WCOME blends resulted in improved performance with minimized emissions and can be utilized in an unmodified DI diesel engine. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioelectricity generation, by Shewanella oneidensis (S. oneidensis) MR-1, has become particularly alluring, thanks to its extraordinary prospects for energy production, pollution treatment, and biosynthesis. Attempts to improve its technological output by modification of S. oneidensis MR-1 remains complicated, expensive and inefficient. Herein, we report on the augmentation of S. oneidensis MR-1 with carbon dots (CDs). The CDs-fed cells show accelerated extracellular electron transfer and metabolic rate, with increased intracellular charge, higher adenosine triphosphate level, quicker substrate consumption and more abundant extracellular secretion. Meanwhile, the CDs promote cellular adhesion, electronegativity, and biofilm formation. In bioelectrical systems the CDs-fed cells increase the maximum current value, 7.34 fold, and power output, 6.46 fold. The enhancement efficacy is found to be strongly dependent on the surface charge of the CDs. This work demonstrates a simple, cost-effective and efficient route to improve bioelectricity generation of S. oneidensis MR-1, holding promise in all relevant technologies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) was loaded on Fe3O4 superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with electrostatic attractions and covalent bonding. The nano-biocatalysts were used in biodiesel production process to investigate the effect of enzyme covalent bonding on catalytic performance. For nano-biocatalysts preparation, ROL was loaded on pure MNPs and MNPs functionalized with 3-aminopropyl triethylenesilane (MNP-AP), electrostatically. The enzyme was also bonded to MNPs functionalized with 3-aminopropyl triethylenesilane-glutaraldehyde (MNP-AP-GA), covalently. The hydrolytic activity, kinetic parameters, esterification productivity, and reusability of ROL/MNP, ROL/MNP-AP, and ROL/MNP-AP-GA as the four nano-biocatalysts were investigated and compared. The morphology, structure and magnetic characteristics of the MNPs were evaluated using FESEM, FTIR, XRD and VSM. The components of products were analyzed using GC-MS technique. The covalent bonding increased enzyme loading on the support from 36.35 to 51.75 wt %. Transesterification reaction in the presence of ROL/MNP-AP-GA showed the highest conversion (69.8 wt %) among immobilized biocatalysts. Reusability analysis showed that the covalent bonding of enzyme (ROL/MNP-AP-GA) can prevent catalyst wasting, significantly. The conversion after five cycles of reuse for ROL/MNP-AP-GA was 2 times higher than ROL/MNP-AP and 3 times higher than ROL/MNP. The covalent bonding of lipase using relatively long chain coupler agents showed to be a reliable method for enhancing enzyme loading and productivity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass derived polyols represent one of the most attractive resources for modern bio-refineries that need renewable feedstocks directly convertible into chemicals, biofuels and energy carriers. In the past two decades, the reductive catalytic conversion of polyols via hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and aqueous phase reforming processes has received more and more attention allowing the sustainable production of important products such as glycols, alkanes and H2. In this contribution, the state of the art in the processing of biomass derived C6 and C5 polyols, namely sorbitol and xylitol, to produce added value chemicals, fuels and energy (H2) is reviewed highlighting the most reliable and promising catalytic systems used so far merging, at the same time, the reaction conditions adopted for obtaining a target products. The final aim is to provide a simple and comprehensive guide to academic and industrial researchers for the development of both the future generation of catalysts and greener chemical processes to be used in the valorization of biomass derived sorbitol and xylitol. © 2020

AB  - In this work, the density of biofuel is estimated using four intelligent models: a Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), a Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (RBF-ANN), a Multi-layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), and an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). These models are used to estimate the density of biofuel based on intermolecular interactions and the van der Waals radii of the atoms. Various statistical analyses are performed on the original (experimental) and estimated data. It is found that the LSSVM model can provide more accurate predictions than the other three models. The R-squared value (R2) and the mean absolute relative error (MARE) for the LSSVM, RBF-ANN, MLP-ANN and ANFIS models are 0.847 &amp; 0.056, 52.067 &amp; 0.379, 57.385 &amp; 0.371 and 65.096 &amp; 0.678, respectively. This study shows that the LSSVM model is a promising tool for estimating the density of biofuel, offering an alternative to classic thermodynamic models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the kinetics of the biomass and to determine the influence of temperature on the distribution and quality of the products of slow pyrolysis. Coffee husk briquettes were produced by densification and subsequently subjected to slow pyrolysis at different final temperatures of 623 K, 673 K and 723 K at a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min. The results of the TGA showed that the pyrolysis of coffee husks occurred mainly at temperatures between 400 K and 700 K. The activation energy values ranged from 104.90 kJ/mol to 345.2 kJ/mol for the Friedman model and from 70.4 kJ/mol to 288.8 kJ/mol for the FWO model. In the composition of the bio-oil, at higher pyrolysis temperatures, there was a greater production of phenolic compounds and nitrogen compounds. Lower temperatures promoted the greater formation of hydrocarbons and acetic acid. The energy content of the biochar did not differ with the increasing temperature, but the fixed carbon was slightly higher at 723 K. It was concluded that the TGA provided information on the kinetics of the coffee husk pyrolysis, making it possible to improve the conversion process of this waste into products. Both isoconversional models were effective in estimating the Ea of the pyrolysis process with good accuracy. High final pyrolysis temperatures improve the quality of bio-oil, producing bio-oil with smaller amounts of acidic compounds, and this bio-oil is desirable for use as fuels. In addition, the bio-oil contains numerous chemical compounds that can be extracted and used in value-added chemical products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are a promising material for sustainable preparation of biodiesel. This study proposed a new approach for biodiesel synthesis from wet SCGs using 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as both a green solvent and catalyst. The optimal reaction conditions were determined as a methanol amount of 6.25 mL/g of wet SCGs, DBU amount of 14.46 mL/g of wet SCGs, temperature of 60.2 °C, and reaction time of 28.65 min through response surface methodology. Under these conditions, the maximum biodiesel yield was 97.18%. Notably, DBU polarity could be regulated reversibly, facilitating its reusability and a simple process for product separation. Under optimal conditions, DBU could be potentially reused for at least 10 cycles to yield high amounts of biodiesel. This study suggests that the switchable solvent-assisted direct transesterification of wet SCGs is a potential, efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly approach for biodiesel synthesis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The catalytic activity of the walnut shell ash was investigated in the biodiesel production by the sunflower oil methanolysis. The catalyst was characterized by the TG-DTA, XRD, Hg porosimetry, N2 physisorption, SEM, and Hammett method. In addition, the effects of the catalyst loading and the methanol-to-oil molar ratio on the methyl esters synthesis were tested at the reaction temperature of 60 °C. The walnut shell ash provided a very fast reaction and a high FAME content (over 98%). As the reaction occurred in the absence of triacylglycerols mass transfer limitation, the pseudo-first-order model was employed for describing the kinetics of the reaction. The catalyst was successfully reused four times after the regeneration of the catalytic activity by recalcination at 800 °C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The alternative approach to the production of biodiesel from sludge palm oil (SPO) via two steps of extraction and enzymatic esterification was performed. Free fatty acids (FFAs) from SPO were obtained through saponification reaction and subsequent extraction. The FFAs were further converted to biodiesel (fatty acids methyl esters) via esterification reaction catalysed by immobilised Rhizopus oryzae lipase on alginate-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) beads. The esterification reaction was investigated by variations of temperature (30–50 °C), molar ratio of methanol to FFAs (1:1 to 5:1), agitation rate (100–300 rpm) and for 4 h. The results were revealed that optimal condition for biodiesel production reached at reaction temperature of 40 °C, methanol to FFAs molar ratio of 3:1 and agitation rate of 200 rpm. Under the optimum condition, the highest biodiesel yield of 91.30% was achieved. Successfully, biodiesel production from SPO gave high conversion rate. In addition, the biocatalyst also showed in high catalytic efficiency and stability up to 15 cycles. The process cost could be reduced cost effectively for biodiesel production when a low cost substrate of SPO as well as the capable biocatalyst were used. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sequestering CO2 in the form of carbon-based liquid fuels would provide both a convenient and sustainable form of energy for practical use as well as mitigate the effects of global warming and climate change. Ocean wave energy is an abundant and relatively stable source of renewable energy, which would be highly desirable for the conversion of CO2 to conveniently stored and transported liquid fuels. In this work, we demonstrate a wave-energy-driven electrochemical CO2 reduction system, consisting of triboelectric nanogenerators, a supercapacitor and a CO2 reduction reactor, that converts ocean wave energy to chemical energy in the form of formic acid, a liquid fuel. We optimize the energy storage component of the system and operation voltage of the electrochemical cell to achieve efficient energy storage and maximize the production of formic acid. Under simulated waves, the system can produce 2.798 μmol of formic acid per day via the wave energy harvested from a water surface area of 0.04 m2. Moreover, we have performed field tests in the Red Sea to demonstrate the practicality of such an electrochemical CO2 reduction system. Finally, we present design guidelines for achieving a cost-effective, efficient, and large-scale wave-energy-driven CO2 reduction system for liquid fuel production. © The Royal Society 2020 of Chemistry.

AB  - Physicochemical characteristics of three type biodiesel feedstock and diesel engine parameters fuelled with graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles addition in diesel/biodiesel blends have been investigated. Three types of oilseeds, namely Evening primrose (Oenothera lamarckiana), the fruit of Tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) and Camelina (Camelina sativa), were selected as suitable resources for Iran. The result showed that the Tree of heaven contains 38% oil which is higher than the Evening primrose (26%) and Camelina (29%). Physicochemical properties of the oils showed that the viscosity of the Camelina oilseeds was less than the Tree of heaven oilseeds and Evening primrose oilseeds. Therefore, in terms of viscosity, the Camelina oilseeds is preferable. Experimental results showed that the biodiesel from all three types of oilseeds are consistent with the ASTM biodiesel standards. However, Camelina biodiesel has better physicochemical properties than another feedstock. Therefore, biodiesel of Camelina oil can be an appropriate alternative to diesel fuels in Iran. Performance and emission parameters of diesel engine fuelled with graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles addition in three biodiesel resources compared with diesel. A reduction in UHCs, CO, and BSFC with a penalty of increased NOx emissions was realized with all graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles addition in diesel/biodiesel blends. Also, with Camelina biodiesel, the power increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of protein-rich biomass, such as microalgae, macroalgae, sewage sludge, energy crops, and some lignocellulosic biomass, produces bio-oil with high nitrogen (N) content, sometimes as high as 10 wt% or even higher. Major nitrogenous compounds in bio-oil include amines/amides, N-containing heterocycles, and nitriles. Such bio-oil cannot be used as fuel directly since the high N content will induce massive emission of nitrogen oxides during combustion. The present review comprehensively summarized the effects of biomass compositions (i.e., elemental, biochemical, and mineral compositions) and pyrolysis parameters (i.e., temperature, heating rate, atmosphere, bio-oil collection/fractionation methods, and catalysts) on the contents of N and the N-containing chemical components in bio-oil. The migration and transformation mechanisms of N during the pyrolysis of biomass were then discussed in detail. Finally, the research gaps were identified, followed by the proposals for future investigations to achieve the denitrogenation of bio-oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the feasibility of utilizing Musa spp “Pisang Awak” peduncle derived ash as a highly effective renewable heterogeneous basic catalyst for transesterification of underutilized non-edible Ceiba pentandra oil (CPO) was investigated. The physiochemical characteristics of the calcined banana peduncle (CBP) were studied by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Atomic X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDAX). Biodiesel was produced by a two-step esterification-transesterification process. In the first step, FFA content of the oil was reduced from 7% to 1.6% using reaction conditions of 1.0 vol% H2SO4 concentration, 1h reaction time, 1:4 v/v methanol to oil volumetric ratio with constant reaction temperature of 60 °C. In the second step, response surface methodology (RSM) using central composite design (CCD) was employed to determine the optimal process conditions of transesterification process variables. Based on the RSM results, the optimum process conditions for transesterification of CPO into fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was found to be 1.978 wt% catalyst concentration, 60 min reaction time, 9.20:1 methanol to oil molar ratio with a maximum predicted FAME yield of 99.36% which was evaluated experimentally as 98.69 ± 0.18%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An effective pretreatment is the first step to enhance the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass – a source of renewable, eco-friendly and energy-dense materials – for biofuel and biochemical productions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the advantages and disadvantages of lignocellulosic pretreatment techniques, which have been studied at the lab-, pilot- and full-scale levels. Biological pretreatment is environmentally friendly but time consuming (i.e. 15–40 days). Chemical pretreatment is effective in breaking down lignocellulose and increasing sugar yield (e.g. 4 to 10-fold improvement) but entails chemical cost and expensive reactors. Whereas the combination of physical and chemical (i.e. physicochemical) pretreatment is energy intensive (e.g. energy production can only compensate 80% of the input energy) despite offering good process efficiency (i.e. > 100% increase in product yield). Demonstrations of pretreatment techniques (e.g. acid, alkaline, and hydrothermal) in pilot-scale have reported 50–80% hemicellulose solubilisation and enhanced sugar yields. The feasibility of these pilot and full-scale plants has been supported by government subsidies to encourage biofuel consumption (e.g. tax credits and mandates). Due to the variability in their mechanisms and characteristics, no superior pretreatment has been identified. The main challenge lies in the capability to achieve a positive energy balance and great economic viability with minimal environmental impacts i.e. the energy or product output significantly surpasses the energy and monetary input. Enhancement of the current pretreatment techno-economic efficiency (e.g. higher product yield, chemical recycling, and by-products conversion to increase environmental sustainability) and the integration of pretreatment methods to effectively treat a range of biomass will be the steppingstone for commercial lignocellulosic biorefineries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, lignocellulosic biomass was converted into liquid products by catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction. Zn, Fe, and Zn + Fe were used to obtaining products with high energy value as heterogeneous catalyst systems in this study. The different experimental parameters were used to examine temperature (220, 240, 260, 280, 300 °C), reaction time (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 min.), and the synergistic effect of catalysts (Zn + Fe) on conversion rate. The products obtained were examined by GC–MS, Elemental, FT-IR, 1H NMR, SEM-EDX, and XRD analysis methods. According to the results of the experiment, it has been determined that Fe is the most effective catalyst for light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil yields and Zn + Fe is the most effective catalyst system for the gas + aqueous phase products. Fe catalyst in monoaromatics formation, Zn catalyst in polyaromatic and aliphatics compound formation, Zn + Fe catalyst system in oxygen compounds formation are effective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

In this study, a series of co-AD of different urban derived organic wastes (sewage sludge-SS, food waste-FW, yard waste-YW) were conducted in a semi-continuous mode, and the corresponding dynamic evolutions of microbial community structure were followed by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). As for co-AD of two feedstocks, introduction of SS (25%, VS basis) in FW significantly improved the process stability and archaea/total microbe ratio (from 0.4% to 17.1%), which might be due to the regulating effect of abundant trace metals in SS; co-AD of SS (25%, VS basis) with YW improved the methane yield by 2.04 times than AD of YW only together with higher methane contents (57.4 ± 1.3% vs. 50.9 ± 2.2%); in co-AD of FW and YW, synergistic effects in terms of increased methane production (3.4–19.1%) were observed, which was correlated with more robust growth of both bacteria and archaea. As for co-AD of three feedstocks, high methane yields of 314.9 ± 17.1 mL/g VS were achieved with a reliable stability. These findings could provide some fundamental and technical information for the co-treatment of urban derived organic wastes in centralized AD facilities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Different Ca–Mg–Al catalysts were prepared by the hydrotalcite route using co-precipitation and impregnation techniques. The effect of thermal treatment was studied and the obtained mixed oxides were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption and CO2-temperature programmed desorption. Catalysts were then tested in the transesterification of sunflower oil. The catalyst that showed the best catalytic performance was an uncalcined Mg4Al2 support impregnated with 40 wt% of calcium followed by a calcination at 600 °C (Ca600/Mg4Al2HT). Optimum conditions for biodiesel production over this catalyst were a reaction time of 6 h, a catalyst to oil ratio of 2.5 wt%, a 15:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, a stirring rate of 400 rpm and a temperature of 60 °C giving a final FAME yield of 95%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, modified polyporous magnetic cellulose beads (PMCBs) were synthesized by several organic amines (EDA, DETA, TETA and AST) grafting PMCBs and then utilized as a new kind of support to immobilize Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) for biodiesel production. The immobilized lipase catalysts based on PMCBs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that PMCBs-DETA was a more suitable immobilization support and the catalytic activity of immobilized lipases could reach 1.0 U/mg. Then the synthesized catalyst of CALB-PMCBs-DETA was used to produce biodiesel from Yellow horn seed oil via transesterification reaction. A high biodiesel yield (92.3%) was obtained under the optimal reaction conditions and the main compositions of the prepared biodiesel were tested by GC-MS. Moreover, the catalyst of CALB-PMCBs-DETA could be removed easily by a magnet and recycled at least 5 times. As a new kind of support, the modified PMCBs could be a promising alternative for the carriers of immobilizing enzymes used for the green and efficient production of biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the circular bio-economy, effective biomass valorization through the strategic use of resources is essential in terms of generating valuable products, sustainable development, and maximizing ecological and socio-economic benefits. Technologies are being developed and improved to optimize the use of abundant biomass and to generate several value-added products. Efficient nutrient recovery requires additional energy-intensive steps for effective valorization. Moreover, appropriate waste collection and pretreatment practices increase the degree of valorization. The use of biomass waste in biorefineries has significant potential to yield biofuels and organic fertilizers. Further research and development are required to develop effective biorefining technologies to enable the efficient exploitation of bioresources. Greater consideration should be applied to energy pathways to support this technology. Therefore, there is a demand for innovation in the integrated biorefining approach in response to changing markets, and novel commercial models should be introduced into the circular economy. © 2020

AB  - Dependence on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas are on alarming increase, thereby causing such resources to be in a depletion mode and a novel sustainable approach for bioenergy production are in demand. Successful implementation of zero waste discharge policy is one such way to attain a sustainable development of bioenergy. Zero waste discharge can be induced only through the conversion of organic wastes into bioenergy. Waste management is pivotal and considering its importance of minimizing the issue and menace of wastes, conversion strategy of organic waste is effectively recommended. Present review is concentrated on providing a keen view on the potential organic waste sources and the way in which the bioenergy is produced through efficient conversion processes. Biogas, bioethanol, biocoal, biohydrogen and biodiesel are the principal renewable energy sources. Different types of organic wastes used for bioenergy generation and its sources, anaerobic digestion-biogas production and its related process affecting parameters including fermentation, photosynthetic process and novel nano-inspired techniques are discussed. Bioenergy production from organic waste is associated with mitigation of lump waste generation and its dumping into land, specifically reducing all hazards and negativities in all sectors during waste disposal. A sustainable bioenergy sector with upgraded security for fuels, tackles the challenging climatic change problem also. Thus, intensification of organic waste conversion strategies to bioenergy, specially, biogas and biohydrogen production is elaborated and analyzed in the present article. Predominantly, persistent drawbacks of the existing organic waste conversion methods have been noted, providing consideration to economic, environmental and social development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research investigates the behavior of ethanol and biodiesel, blended with diesel fuel in a multiple injection engine. Numerical study and engine simulation were carried out using ESE Diesel environment of AVL Fire. The simulations were conducted for 10 and 20% biofuel blends and also, 20 and 30% pilot injection and for two different injection timings. Heat release rate and pressure were compared to the studies in the literature. Agreement between pressure charts was very good while it was acceptable for the heat release rate. For the first case, the injection started at 695 CA while for the second one, it started at 700 CA. The duration of injection for both injection stages lasted 10 CA degree with a dwell angle of 15 CA. According to the results, unlike biodiesel combustion, ethanol combustion resulted in lower chamber temperature and lower NOx emission subsequently. The effect of pilot injection percentage on emissions and heat release rate significantly depends on the injection timing. And finally, as injection start changed from 695 to 700, a noticeable reduction was observed in engine performance and emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The quest for efficient and sustainable route for biodiesel production motivates the investigation of synergies between microwave reactor and calcium oxide (CaO) loaded on zeolite in waste lard biodiesel (WLB) production. The optimum concentration of the precursor used in the impregnation of the zeolite was practically determined. The resultant CaO/zeolite was characterized using some classical techniques and the characterized catalyst in synergy with the microwave reactor was used to optimize and model the biodiesel production process and the reaction optimum conditions in relation to CaO/zeolite amount, microwave power, methanol/oil ratio and time as independent variables were established (8% (wt./vol), 595 Watts, 30:1 and 1.25 h respectively) using central composite design. The conditions generated a maximum WLB yield of 90.89% signifying that the synergies between the reactor and the synthesized catalyst result in an efficient biodiesel production method. Additionally, the catalyst is shown to be easily separated from the reaction product and has the potential to be recycled a number of times under the optimum conditions. This study establishes synergies between microwave reactor system and heterogeneous CaO/zeolite catalyst that result in an economically feasible route for production of an efficient and sustainable WLB. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present research, application of waste edible oil (WEO) as a suitable and abundant source for biodiesel production using CaO@MgO nanocatalyst derived from waste chicken eggshells was studied. To this end, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, EDX, Map, and TEM analyses were performed to investigate characteristics of the CaO@MgO nanocatalyst. Also, the physical properties of the biodiesel such as flash point, kinematic viscosity, density, distillation point, cloud point, pour point, cetane number, oxidation stability, and acid number were determined according to the international standards. In addition, FT-IR and HNMR analyses were used to determine the biodiesel characteristics. Moreover, the produced catalyst was successively reused for up to 6 cycles and the results showed that the catalytic activity of the catalyst produced was sufficient for biodiesel production from WEO for up to three cycles, beyond which its catalytic activity decreased. The present work further considered the effects of different parameters on biodiesel production using central composite design to determine optimal conditions. According to the results, the highest biodiesel conversion yield (98.37%) was achieved in a reaction time of 7.08 h, reaction temperature of 69.37 °C, methanol-to-oil ratio of 16.7:1, and catalyst concentration of 4.571 wt% which shows the highest biodiesel conversion yield ever achieved from waste edible oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Development of solid mixed oxide catalyst from waste biomass is a scarcely studied area. Thus, present protocol aims to prepare an environmentally friendly, efficient, renewable and recyclable heterogeneous base catalyst from Carica papaya stem. The chemical and structural properties of the catalyst were examined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractograms (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The CO2-TPD and Hammett indicator test was conducted to determine the basicity of the prepared catalyst. The study revealed the presence of alkali and alkaline earth metals that provide the basic sites to facilitate transesterification reaction for biodiesel production and formation of benzylidenemalononitrile (BMN). The conversion of the waste cooking oil (WO) and Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) lipid to biodiesel was confirmed by the NMR and Gas chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) technique. Biodiesel conversions of 95.23% and 93.33% were achieved using 2 wt % catalyst loading under optimized reaction conditions for WO and SO respectively. Reusing the catalyst showed a slight drop in activity after 6 repeated uses. The reported catalyst has shown its potential as an alternative and cheaper green solid catalyst for biodiesel production and Knoevenagel reaction. © 2019

AB  - The purpose of this study was the improvement of cold flow and lubricity characteristics of biodiesel produced from the palm-sesame oil blend. Extreme learning machine (ELM) and response surface methodology (RSM) techniques were used to model the production process and the input variables (time, catalyst amount, methanol to oil ratio, and duty cycle) were optimized using cuckoo search algorithm. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and standard error of prediction (SEP) were calculated to evaluate the performance of RSM and ELM. The results showed that ELM model had better performance in prediction than RSM model. The optimum yield of P50S50 biodiesel obtained was 96.6138% under operating parameters of time (38.96 min), duty cycle (59.52%), methanol to oil ratio (60 V/V %) and catalyst amount (0.70 wt%). The cold flow characteristics of P50S50 biodiesel are significantly improved like cloud point (7.89 °C), pour point (3.80 °C), and cold filter plugging point (- 1.77 °C) with better oxidation stability 6.89 h. The average coefficient of friction P50S50 biodiesel was lower than palm biodiesel (B100) and B10 commercial diesel by 2.29% and 12.37% respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study unveiled the synergistic effects of catalytic co-pyrolysis of the macroalgae (Enteromorpha prolifera) and waste plastics (HDPE) for enhanced biofuels production. Results revealed that catalytic co-pyrolysis of macroalgae (seaweeds) and waste plastics lowered greatly the high contents of the acids, oxygenates and nitrogen-containing compounds in the seaweed bio-oils, while the aromatics and light hydrocarbons contents of the bio-oils were significantly increased, owing to blending of seaweeds with co-feeding element of high hydrogen content. Results also unveiled that the existence of the co-pyrolysis synergy inhibited catalytic coking and reduced solid residues’ formation. Also, the addition of HZSM-5 catalyst further improved the reaction activity, yields and selectivity of aliphatic hydrocarbons than aromatics, and reduced the activation energy without changing the reaction mechanisms. This significant reduction in activation energy can be easily observed in the results of non-isothermal kinetic analyses performed using the TGA data via five different methods: Friedman, FWO, Vyazovkin, KAS and DAEM methods, as a single kinetics-evaluation model lacks the flexibility to account for different types of materials without further modifications to reaction scheme. The FTIR-spectra of the catalytic co-pyrolysis oils were consistent with the results of the GC/MS analysis of the oils from catalytic-co-pyrolysis. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Bio-oil is a mixture of organics produced from pyrolysis of biomass. The organics in bio-oil serve as the feedstock for the production of hydrogen, chemicals, biofuels, and carbon materials. In many processes for conversion of bio-oil, heating is required. The thermal treatment of bio-oil induces the polymerization/cracking of the organics in bio-oil, producing coke. Coke could lower the carbon conversion efficiency of bio-oil, clog the reactor chamber, and deactivate the catalyst, imposing the main challenge for the utilization of bio-oil involving the heating of bio-oil. This review investigates the coking issues in the processes for bio-oil upgrading including esterification, hydrotreatment, catalytic pyrolysis, pyrolysis, steam reforming, and the process for the conversion of bio-oil to carbon materials. The properties of coke formed from thermal treatment of bio-oil, the mechanism for coking of bio-oil, and the methods developed for tackling the coking of bio-oil are the focus. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Self-powered biosensor, as a new sensing platform, utilizes biofuel cells as synchronous power source and biosensor system, with the advantages of no external power source, simple instrumentation and easy miniaturization. Meanwhile, inspired by biomimics for the encapsulation of soft tissue within protective exteriors in nature, encapsulation of biological macromolecules by metal organic-frameworks (MOFs) have been proved to be an effective strategy for enhancing the biocatalytic activity in maintaining biological functions. Herein, we successfully encapsulated laccase (LAC) in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and combined it with bacterial cellulose (BC)/carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (c-MWCNTs) skeleton to prepare highly flexible BC/c-MWCNTs/ZIF-8@LAC electrode. Subsequently, we ingeniously designed an highly flexible self-powered sensing platform based on biofuel-cell driven by single-enzyme, harvesting bisphenol A (BPA) as a model analyte. The maximum power density (Pmax) of single-enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) exhibited an excellent linear dynamic range from 0.01 to 0.4 mM with a lower detection limit of 1.95 × 10−3 mM for BPA concentrations. Therefore, the designed single-EBFC-based self-powered sensor is feasible in BPA detection and has a broad application prospect in the field of water pollutants detection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Sargassum tenerrimum (ST) macroalgae was carried out for 15 min, over various solid base catalysts (CaO supported on CeO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2) at different reaction temperatures (260–300 °C), different catalyst quantities (5–25 wt%) and using different solvent systems. Maximum bio-oil (BO) yields for the non-catalytic HTL with single solvent water, ethanol, and water-ethanol co-solvent were 3.3 wt%, 23.3 wt%, and 32.0 wt%, respectively, at 280 °C. Ethanol as single solvent elicited highest BO yield of 25.2 wt% with CaO/ZrO2 (10.0 wt%) catalyst. However, the highest BO yield (33.0 wt%) accompanied by higher conversion (70.5%) was obtained with CaO/ZrO2 (10.0 wt%) under water-ethanol co-solvent. The selectively higher percentage of ester functional compounds (87.8%) was found with CaO/ZrO2 catalyst under water-ethanol co-solvent. Also, the bio-oil obtained from catalytic liquefaction showed a higher high heating value (HHV) compared to that from the non-catalytic HTL reaction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study is an effort to optimize the production of biodiesel from dairy scum and Hydnocarpus wightiana oil using Snail shell CaO nanocatalyst for transesterification. Response surface methodology is used to optimize the reaction parameter that affects the transesterification process for the biodiesel yield. The CaO nanocatalyst was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, Fourier Transformer Infrared Spectroscopy, Thermo Gravimetric/Differential Thermal Analysis and Atomic Force Microscopy. The maximum biodiesel yield for Scum Oil Methyl Ester and Hydnocarpus wightiana Oil Methyl Ester was (96.929%) and (98.93%) at the optimized condition: Methanol to oil molar ratio 12.7:1 and 12.4:1, catalyst dosage of 0.866 wt.% and 0.892 wt.%, reaction temperature 58.56°C and 61.6°C and reaction time 119.684 min and 145.154 min respectively. A comprehensive kinetic study for the transesterification reaction was performed at different temperatures (50-65°C) for the methanolysis of SO and HWO catalyzed by CaO nanoparticles. A pseudo-first order kinetic reaction was established and the activation energy (Ea) and frequency factor (A) for SO and HWO to be 67.21kJmol-1 & 5.182×108 min-1 & 73.15 kJmol-1 & 4.59×109 min-1 respectively. Recovered CaO nanocatalyst is reused for 5 times with substantial loss in biodiesel yield. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The richness of high-value bio-compounds derived from microalgae has made microalgae a promising and sustainable source of useful product. The present work starts with a review on the usage of open pond and photobioreactor in culturing various microalgae strains, followed by an in-depth evaluation on the common harvesting techniques used to collect microalgae from culture medium. The harvesting methods discussed include filtration, centrifugation, flocculation, and flotation. Additionally, the advanced extraction technologies using ionic liquids as extractive solvents applied to extract high-value bio-compounds such as lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and other bioactive compounds from microalgae biomass are summarized and discussed. However, more work needs to be done to fully utilize the potential of microalgae biomass for the application in large-scale production of biofuels, food additives, and nutritive supplements. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Rapid depletion in fossil fuels, inflation in petroleum prices, and rising energy demand have forced towards alternative transport fuels. Among these alternative fuels, diesel-ethanol and diesel-biodiesel blends gain the most attention due to their quality characteristics and environmentally friendly nature. The viscosity and density of these biodiesel blends are slightly higher than diesel, which is a significant barrier to the commercialization of biodiesel. In this study, the density and viscosity of 30 different ternary biodiesel blends was investigated at 15 °C and 40 °C, respectively. Different density and viscosity models were developed and tested on biodiesel blends soured from different feedstock's including palm, coconut, soybean, mustard, and calophyllum oils. The prognostic ability and precisions of these developed models was assessed statistically using Absolute Percentage Error (APE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE of 0.045% and 0.085% for density model and 1.85%, 1.41%, 3.48% and 2.27%, 1.85%, 3.50% for viscosity models were obtained on % volume and % mass basis. These developed correlations are useful for ternary biodiesel blends where alcohols are the part of biodiesel blends. The modeled values of densities and viscosities of ternary blends were significantly comparable with the measured densities and viscosities, which are feasible to avoid the harm of vehicles' operability. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Highly selective β-methylation of alcohols was achieved using an earth-abundant first row transition metal in the air stable molecular manganese complex [Mn(CO)2Br[HN(C2H4PiPr2)2]] 1 ([HN(C2H4PiPr2)2]=MACHO-iPr). The reaction requires only low loadings of 1 (0.5 mol %), methanolate as base and MeOH as methylation reagent as well as solvent. Various alcohols were β-methylated with very good selectivity (&gt;99 %) and excellent yield (up to 94 %). Biomass derived aliphatic alcohols and diols were also selectively methylated on the β-position, opening a pathway to “biohybrid” molecules constructed entirely from non-fossil carbon. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through a borrowing hydrogen pathway involving metal–ligand cooperation at the Mn-pincer complex. This transformation provides a convenient, economical, and environmentally benign pathway for the selective C−C bond formation with potential applications for the preparation of advanced biofuels, fine chemicals, and biologically active molecules. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - From the perspective of renewability and environmental pollution, biodiesels are appropriate alternatives to conventional diesel fuels due to their proper combustion behavior and atomization characteristics, which can be influenced by the viscosity as an essential factor. Therefore, the viscosity prediction would be of importance for blend of biodiesel/diesel fuels. For biodiesel/diesel mixtures, the blended viscosity has been predicted with numerous empirical correlations available in the literature. In this work, the viscosity of fuel mixtures was evaluated through Generalized regression neural network (GRNN), Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBFNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), and Cascade Feed-forward Neural Network (CFNN), based on various experimental data. These developed models were then compared in terms of predictive accuracy and available empirical correlations to select the best model. Finally, the proposed model was compared with the most prominent biodiesel viscosity models confirming that the developed model has been superior in predicting the value of viscosity for biodiesel blends with reported values of 0.9997 and 0.87% for parameters of the coefficient of determination (R2) and absolute average relative deviation (AARD%), respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research, the effects of the spirulina microalgae biodiesel (SMB) blends containing 20, 40, 60 and 80% in volume based were investigated in a naturally aspirated diesel engine at various loads. The performance, combustion and emission analyses showed that of the injection timings (23.0° b TDC) with higher injection pressure of 220 bar. The results show that SMB1 (20% of spirulina microalgae biodiesel and 80% diesel) produces lower exhaust emission and cylinder pressures, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust temperature and maximum rise pressure rates as compared to diesel fuel. Specific fuel consumption and ignition delay period results increased up to 3.3%, 8.2% and BTE reduced up to 3.03% when the spirulina microalgae blend was increased to 20% at the higher load. The SMB blends also resulted in lower nitrogen oxides (NOX) emission by 4.9%, particulate matter (PM) emission by 20.7% as well as lower smoke by 5.4%, but CO2 emissions increased for all loads. The results showed that addition spirulina microalgae produced a lower of brake thermal efficiency and exhaust temperature, the CO2 emission were improved. Hence, spirulina microalgae can be used in diesel engine. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transition and decarbonization of the energy sector require the utilisation of new technologies and energy sources. Higher penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources implies the installation of energy storage, to store electricity excess and enhanced system efficiency. These electricity surpluses that will occur more often in the future energy system could be effectively utilized for the production of alternative fuels. Most of the alternative fuels that are considered for future applications are already known chemicals or products, nowadays used for other purposes. Another great advantage of some alternative fuels lies in their possibilities to act as an energy carrier. This feature might be crucial while discussing their utilisation potential and further development. Fuels which can simultaneously be used for power generation and as an energy carrier will have a more important role in the future and are likely to be utilized on a greater scale. Renewable energy source like biomass, on the other hand, is already widely used, and their role in the future system is not questionable. Even though significant increment in biomass consumption raises serious concerns about its sustainability, and seeks for new approaches. In this work, the authors tried to review alternative fuel characteristics, alongside their utilisation and production opportunities. To come up with the optimal solutions, the authors compared various proposed alternative fuels, alongside their advantages and drawbacks with an aim to find the most appropriate role for each fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the effects of graphene oxide (GO) nano-particles on performance and emissions of a diesel engine fueled with Oenothera lamarckiana biodiesel was investigated. Biodiesel was used in the blend of B20. The GO nano-particles with concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 ppm were considered for each fuel blend. Experiments were performed at a constant speed of 2100 rpm at loads of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Various parameters, such as power, exhaust gas temperature (EGT), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), were investigated. Results showed that by using GO, power and EGT significantly increase. Furthermore, by using GO nano-particles, significant reductions in CO (∼5%–22%) and UHCs (∼17%–26%) were observed. However, under similar conditions, a slight increase in CO2 (∼7%–11%) and NOx (∼4%–9%) emissions observed. Finally, it can be concluded that nano-graphene oxide can be introduced as a suitable alternative fuel additive for Oenothera lamarckiana biodiesel blends. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The escalating consumption of fossil fuels and dumping of palm kernel shells (PKS) drives biofuel production to improve supply and waste disposal. To convert PKS into modified biochar (MBC) value-added solid fuel, we use microwave vacuum pyrolysis accompanied by sodium-potassium hydroxide mixture modification. First, PKS underwent microwave vacuum pyrolysis to produce biochar, and then it was chemically activated using sodium-potassium hydroxide mixture. The MBC surface morphology, porous characteristics, proximate content, and energy properties depended on microwave irradiation period and power. High yields (79 ± 1.5 wt%) were recorded at microwave power 700 W and irradiation period of 10 min, giving a high BET surface area (1320 m2/g) and pore volume (0.70 cm3/g). The MBC had acceptable low content of ash, nitrogen, and no sulphur, demonstrating its potential as an environmental friendly fuel to replace conventional coal in combustion. The MBC shows high energy yield (≤90.5%), fuel ratio (≤26.47), and heating value (≤28.69 MJ/kg) comparable to conventional fuels, thus showing desirable solid fuel properties. Energy balance analysis shows positive energy ratio of up to 10 and net energy output of up to 24.47 MJ/kg, recovering a product with a higher energy content compared to electrical power input for the pyrolysis operation. These findings demonstrate the exceptional potential of the MBC produced by this innovative approach for bioenergy generation that per se will reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and thereby reducing global warming and climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis has been investigated over decades as an alternative route to obtain synthetic fuels from synthesis gas. FT is a high-performance synthesis based on metallic catalysis, mainly using ruthenium, cobalt and iron catalysts, which converts syngas in hydrocarbons and chemical precursors. This work presents a review on the aspects of the syngas production from biomass gasification and its subsequent conversion into fuels through the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The usage of biomass, including lignocellulosic residues, as a raw material in the gasification process. Biosyngas is highlighted as a synthetic fuel source to replace nonrenewable, conventional fossil fuels. Lignocellulosic material must be considered a low-cost feedstock to the liquid biofuel production on a large scale. Studies on syngas cleaning to attain the purity required by the FT process is revised. Recent understanding of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics has contributed to increasing the FT performance and economic viability. This paper includes also the debate on main catalysts, industrial process requirements, and chemical reaction kinetics and mechanisms of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Regarding the supply of fossil fuels, greenhouse gasses emission, global warming, and increasing fuel price; there is a need to find alternative energy resources, which are renewable, environmentally sustainable, and economically viable. Agro-industrial biomass such as sugarcane bagasse, rice and wheat straw, corn stover, and switchgrass, named as lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) which is inexpensive, abundant, renewable, and provides a unique natural resource for large-scale and cost-effective bio-energy production. During the production of biofuels, pretreatment is a necessary step due to the recalcitrant structure of LCB. Various pretreatment methods were employed with a different mechanism of action, feasibility, and practicability to produce high yield biofuels. Since many years ago, the development of an effective pretreatment method has been challenging due to the existence of barriers and obstacles. Besides, each pretreatment method has its advantage and disadvantage, which should be investigated to obtain a higher yield of bioethanol. In this paper, the recent findings regarding the application of various pretreatment techniques such as chemical, physical and biological methods for bioethanol production from LCBs have been reviewed. The limitations of the mentioned methods based on the existing barriers were explained, and the future recommendations were discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study is intended to examine the ignition characteristics of a cashew nut shell biodiesel (C100) along with ethyne (acetylene) as a dual fuel in a diesel engine. Cashew nut shell oil is employed in this study owing to non-toxic nature, free from sulphur, biodegradable, and free of aromatics. Ethyne gas was introduced at different flow rate of 2, 4, 6 litres per minute (lpm). Experimental results revealed that duel fuelling ethyne gas to base fuel (C100) at 6 lpm reduce 18.1% CO, 9.7% HC, 6.87% Smoke with 11.1% increase in NOx emissions. Higher thermal efficiency was observed for ethyne–biodiesel mixture than neat biodiesel in all flow rates. Furthermore, the heat release and peak pressure were enhanced by duel fuelling ethyne gas to base fuel (C100). © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Existing electronic skin (e-skin) sensing platforms are equipped to monitor physical parameters using power from batteries or near-field communication. For e-skins to be applied in the next generation of robotics and medical devices, they must operate wirelessly and be self-powered. However, despite recent efforts to harvest energy from the human body, self-powered e-skin with the ability to perform biosensing with Bluetooth communication are limited because of lack of a continuous energy source and limited power efficiency. Here, we report a flexible and fully perspiration-powered integrated electronic skin (PPES) for multiplexed metabolic sensing in situ. The battery-free e-skin contains multimodal sensors and highly efficient lactate biofuel cells that use a unique integration of zero- to three-dimensional nanomaterials to achieve high power intensity and long-term stability. The PPES delivered a record-breaking power density of 3.5 milliwatt·centimeter−2 for biofuel cells in untreated human body fluids (human sweat) and displayed a very stable performance during a 60-hour continuous operation. It selectively monitored key metabolic analytes (e.g., urea, NH4+, glucose, and pH) and the skin temperature during prolonged physical activities and wirelessly transmitted the data to the user interface using Bluetooth. The PPES was also able to monitor muscle contraction and work as a human-machine interface for human-prosthesis walking.

AB  - Fossil fuel continued overuse and carbon emissions issues have prompted increased research efforts on sustainable and renewable energy sources as alternative to fossil fuels. Biofuels include products derived from biomasses or their residues, such as: biogas, biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethanol, synthetic biofuels, biohydrogen and vegetable oil. Due to their properties, all of these may be used in conventional engines as produced, or blended with fossil fuels. First and second generation biofuels may be produced from a large variety of feedstocks, including food crops such as sugar beet, sugar cane, sorghum, energy-crops, such as lignocellulosic masses, and waste, like the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, or landfill leachate. In the last decade, a third generation of biofuels has emerged, i.e. those derived from microalgae. Even though their yield is higher, and their greenhouse gas footprint lower than previous generations’, they still need large amounts of water and nutrients for production. In this paper, the most common biofuels (biogas, syngas, biodiesel, bioetha-nol and biobutanol) are reviewed and analyzed with particular attention on their carbon and water footprints and economic sustainability perspective. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, a heterogeneous catalyst prepared by pyrolysis of waste cork (Quercus suber) was used for the transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO). Physicochemical properties of the synthesized biochar catalyst were studied using BET, SEM, FTIR, and XRD. The experiment results demonstrate that heterogeneous catalyst synthesized at 600 °C showed maximum fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) conversion (98%) at alcohol:oil (25:1), catalyst loading (1.5% w/v) and temperature 65 °C. Biodiesel produced from WCO (Canola oil) mainly composed of FAMEs in following order C18:1 > C18:2 > C16:0 > C18:0 > C20:0. Properties of produced biodiesel were analysed as cetane number (CN) 50.56, higher heating value (HHV) 39.5, kinematic viscosity (ʋ) 3.9, and density (ρ) 0.87. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In accordance with the need of green and sustainable development, a magnetically recyclable solid catalyst was developed for the transformation of low-cost oils to biodiesel via simultaneous transesterification and esterifications in an efficient and environmentally benign manner. For this aim, the magnetic Fe3O4/SiO2 composites composed of iron oxides as the core and silica as the shell, were prepared, and then polymeric acidic ionic liquid (IL) was immobilized on the magnetic support through radical grafting copolymerization of Brønsted acidic IL, 1-vinyl-3-(3-sulfopropyl)imidazolium hydrogen sulfate, onto the magnetic support. The characterization results showed that the perfect core-shell structured Fe3O4/SiO2 support with good magnetic responsiveness was formed, and the polymeric acidic IL was tethered on the magnetic support. The combination of polymeric acidic IL with magnetic porous nanoparticles could enhance the catalytic activity and favored the separation performance of the catalyst. The solid catalyst exhibited high activities for both transesterification of soybean oil and esterification of free fatty acids generally presented in low-cost oils. Moreover, the catalyst could be simply recovered magnetically and efficiently reutilized for several times without significant loss in its activity, thus allowing its being potentially applicable for green and economic production of biodiesel especially from the low-cost oil feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification was used to produce Ceiba pentandra biodiesel, which accelerates the rate of reaction and temperature within a shorter period. The improvement of biodiesel production requires a reliable model that accurately reflects the effects of input variables on output variables. In this study, an extreme learning machine integrated with cuckoo search algorithm was developed to predict and optimize the process parameters. This model will be useful for virtual experimentations in order to enhance biodiesel research and development. The optimum parameters of the microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification process conditions were obtained as follows: (1) methanol/oil ratio: 60%, (2) potassium hydroxide catalyst concentration: 0.84%(w/w), (3) stirring speed: 800 rpm, and (4) reaction time: 388 s. The corresponding Ceiba pentandra biodiesel yield was 96.19%. Three independent experiments were conducted using the optimum process parameters and the average biodiesel yield was found to be 95.42%. In conclusion, microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification is an effective method for biodiesel production because it is more energy-efficient, which will reduce the overall cost of biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd
