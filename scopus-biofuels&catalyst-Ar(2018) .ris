AB  - The development of the commercial air carriers market causes an increase in the aviation fuel consumption and the air pollution. There are intensive works in order to invent the possibility of supplying the aviation engines with biofuels. The hydrogen gas is needed for technological processes to obtain the synthetic biocomponents from biomass, which met the quality standards for fuels and aviation fuels. Pure hydrogen gas is scarce in the Earth's atmosphere and has to be derived from petroleum products. Its acquisition currently requires the processing of petroleum-based matter. The whole world is looking for easy, cheap and safe ways of producing hydrogen from a variety of renewable raw materials, that are an alternative to fossil fuels. The article shows the technological potential of experimental methods for hydrogen production from ethanol produced from biodegradable waste, which is widely considered as a renewable and environmentally friendly resource. © 2018 Anna Turlej et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

AB  - Bio-oil pyrolyzed from rice husk was separated into light-oil and heavy-oil by vacuum distillation. The heavy-oil was upgraded by catalytic esterification with sulfuric acid to prepare ethanol-bio-oil. Then the sulfuric acid catalyst was separated from ethanol-bio-oil using neutralizer. Effects of the catalytic esterification and neutralization on the pH value of ethanol-bio-oil were investigated. The component and molecular weight of raw bio-oil and the ethanol-bio-oil were analyzed by GC/MS and GPC. The results show that the pH value of ethanol-bio-oil can reach 5.86 under the following optimized reaction conditions, 120 ℃, 3 h, sulfuric acid as catalyst, ethanol as solvent. The influence sequence of neutralizers on the pH value of ethanol-bio-oil is as following, BaO≈BaCO 3 &lt;CaCO 3 &lt;nano-CaCO 3 &lt;CaO. In addition, after the progress of catalytic esterification, not only did esters increase by 26.1%, acids and phenols in ethanol bio-oil decrease by 15.9% and 12.8%, respectively, but also did the molecular weight of ethanol-bio-oil decrease by 90%. © 2018, Higher Education Press.

AB  - Use of biodiesel in compression ignition engine is widely recognized due to its reduced exhaust emissions, enhanced carbon dioxide cycle, less toxicity and improved safety. Biodiesel derived from vegetable and biological sources encompasses a substantial quantity of saturated FFA, which leads to increased kinematic viscosity. The present work aims at comparing the feasibility of using the methyl esters of cottonseed and alga (Stoechospermum marginatum) oil separately in a compression ignition engine. The bio-oils were transesterified through base catalysed transesterification using methanol and potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Addition of n-butanol up to 10% improves the physico-chemical properties of fuel, thereby promoting enhanced combustion. The test fuels were formulated on analysing their stability through Taguchi’s approach in design of the experiments. The L9 orthogonal array show cast a stable blend as mineral diesel 80%, biodiesel 20% and n-butanol oxygenate 10% for 21 days without precipitation. The performance and emission analysis of the test fuel blends showed higher brake thermal efficiency with lower brake specific energy consumption for algal biodiesel blends. The oxygenated blends of algal biodiesel emitted lesser carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and smoke in comparison with cottonseed biodiesel. © 2018 Technoscience Publications. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The thermostable endo-1,5-α-l-arabinanase from Bacillus thermodenitrificans TS-3 (ABN-TS) hydrolyzes the α-1,5-l-arabinofuranoside linkages of arabinan. In this study, the crystal structures of inactive ABN-TS mutants, D27A and D147N, were determined in complex with arabino-oligosaccharides. The crystal structures revealed that ABN-TS has at least six subsites in the deep V-shaped cleft formed across one face of the propeller structure. The structural features indicate that substrate recognition is profoundly influenced by the remote subsites as well as by the subsites surrounding the active center. The 'open' structure of the substrate-binding cleft of the endo-acting ABN-TS is suitable for the random binding of several sugar units in polymeric substrates.Crystal structures of D27A and D147N mutants of the endo-1,5-α-l-arabinanase from Bacillus thermodenitrificans TS-3 in complex with arabinohexaose were determined. © International Union of Crystallography, 2018.

AB  - MCM-41 and Zr-MCM-41 with different initial n(Si)/n(Zr) ratios were synthesized by hydrothermal method. Mo2N/Zr-MCM-41 hydrodeoxygenation catalysts were prepared by (NH4)6Mo7O24 carrier co-impregnation, calaination, temperature programing and nitridation, and characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM and Py-FTIR methods. The catalytic performance of Mo2N/Zr-MCM-41 in hydrodeoxygenation of Jatropha curcas oil was evaluated in a high pressure reactor. The results indicate that Zr modified carrier has the same pore structure as pure silicon MCM-41, and the value of L acid and B acid increases. As the active component, the Mo2N has an excellent HDO performance. Under the reaction temperature of 350℃ and the hydrogen pressure of 3.0 MPa, the catalyzed product oil is mainly composed of straight chain alkanes and aromatic compounds, accounting for more than 90% of the product components. The deoxygenation rates of the new catalysts with different n(Si)/n(Zr) ratios are all above 98%, and the content of aromatic compounds is higher than that of straight chain alkanes, which accounts for 72.09% of the total composition. The aromatic compounds are mainly single ring and bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with the length of carbon chain of C8-16. After the leprosy oils catalyzed by Mo2N/ Zr-MCM-41 are fractionated, it can be prepared to be biofuels. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Fuel emissions from vehicles damage the environment and contribute to air pollution. In order to reduce fossil fuels consumption, alternative fuels are mostly preferable. The choice of the vegetable oil for engine naturally depends upon local condition. In this work involves performance analysis of biofuel, which is extracted from the sunflower fatty acid distillate. Bio diesel is produced by the trans-esterification process. Sunflower fatty acid distillate is a recycle product from the wastage of sunflower oil with low- cost preparation. The biofuel extracted from sunflower fatty acid distillate can make it as the best substitute for diesel. From the experimental observation optimum mechanical efficiency, 60.786 %obtained at B20 blend ratio. © IAEMEPublication.

AB  - Reactions between immiscible reagents in the presence of solid catalysts (liquid-liquid-solid, L-L-S reactions) are extensively used in the chemical industry. However, conventional reactors such as stirred tanks can suffer from strong mass/heat transfer limitations due to the poor contact between the phases and a reduced accessibility of the reactants to the catalyst surface. For a major improvement on current systems in terms of cost efficiency, energy savings and environmental footprint, L-L-S reactors operating at the nanoscale are required. Recently, we have reported the Pickering interfacial catalysis (PIC) concept. It addresses the reaction between two immiscible reagents by the formation of L-L-S nanoreactors based on Pickering emulsions promoting the contact between the phases. This paper presents an overview of recent examples of PIC systems developed at the E2P2L Laboratory in Shanghai and applied to industrially relevant reactions encompassing biomass-derived reagents for which reactivity is usually imprisoned due to low miscibility of the reagents. The PIC concept constitutes a hotbed for innovation, opening an avenue to the industrial synthesis of high added-value fine chemicals, specialties and biofuels that can only be afforded today using inefficient processes. © 2018 Societe Francaise de Chimie.

AB  - The idea of this innovative filter concept is to combine three individual flue gas technology treatment systems into one product to be more economic and efficient. The central part of the filter is a ceramic filter candle, which is used for common dust separation. The ceramic filter material is activated with modified catalysts to enable selective catalytic reduction at low temperatures (150–200 °C). To reduce acid components while simultaneously increasing dust separation, the activated filter candle surface is precoated with an absorbent. The developed filter is suitable for many applications, especially decentralized applications such as solid biomass combustion or utilization of biofuels in combined heat and power engines, which are target markets. The production of the filter material and the practical test using exhaust gas from a dual fuel engine operating with biofuels are described. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - A method for conversion of furfural, widely available platform chemical from biomass, to ethylcyclopentane, is reported. Ethylcyclopentane is a cyclic alkane with a relatively high octane number (RON 67, bp 103 °C) and could potentially serve as a drop-in biofuel. The synthetic route includes a transformation of furfural to 1-(furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol that is further subjected to Piancatelli rearrangement to give 5-ethyl-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one. The subsequent hydrodeoxygenation affords ethylcyclopentane in 48% isolated yield. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The activity of sulfated zirconia catalyst for simultaneous esterification of free fatty acid and transesterification of triglyceride was studied. Oleic acid (free fatty acid) and tributyrin (triglyceride) were used as model compounds respectively. Mixtures of free fatty acids and triglycerides are typical biodiesel feedstock in low grade oils such as animal fats and used cooking oils. The effect of calcination temperature of synthesized sulfated zirconia catalyst XZO-01 on its activity was investigated. The activity of the synthesized sulfated zirconia XZO-01 and commercial sulfated zirconia XZO-1720 was compared. The optimum calcination temperature for the sulfated zirconia XZO- 01 was found to be 600oC for both reactions. The results reveal that the synthesized sulfated zirconia catalyzes both esterification and transesterification reactions simultaneously. This catalyst is promising used as solid acid catalyst for biodiesel production using low grade oils as starting material. The simultaneous reactions were performed in pressurized reactor at 120 °C. Characterization by X-ray diffraction and total BET surface area allowed to correlate the crystal structure and surface area was changes with calcination temperature and the effect on its activity. © 2018 World Research Association.

AB  - Introduction: Waste frying oils transesterification was studied for the purpose of achieving the best conditions for biodiesel production. Biodiesel is proved to be the best replacement for diesel because of its unique properties such as significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, non-sulfur emissions, non-particulate matter pollutants, low toxicity, and biodegradability. Waste edible oil is an feedstock in the biodiesel production. The discussion will cover various aspects from oil composition, oil yielding, economics, cultivation materials, land availability, and also the resources availability. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire has been conducted among 100 students from Saveetha Dental College on awareness on the production of biodiesel from household waste. Results: Most of the waste accumulated in India is found to be form household wastes. 80% of the participants do not know about the zero waste system. There are 45% of the participants who are aware of glass Büchner system. In the present generation, more than 95% of the world biodiesel is produced from the edible oil which is easily available in many large-scale industries from the agriculture land. Conclusion: Production of biodiesel from waste cooking oils for diesel substitute is particularly important because of the decreasing trend of economical oil reserves, environmental problems caused due to fossil fuel use, and the high price of petroleum products in the international market. An awareness on the production of biodiesel from household waste was created. © JPR Solutions. All rights reserved.

AB  - A sulfonated carbon material was developed and investigated as an environmentally benign catalyst for furfural production. The sulfonic acid functionality was introduced by sequential hydrothermal carbonization and sulfonation of xylose. The morphology and textural properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy and N2 sorption measurements, respectively. The presence of sulfonic acid on the surface was proven by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Meanwhile, the acid properties were studied using an NH3-TPD profile. Two different sulfonated carbons that was activated with KOH before sulfonation and one that was compared. The KOH-activated sulfonated carbon contained both a porous structure and a high sulfonic acid content that improved the furfural yield and selectivity by more than 50% compared to the nonactivated sulfonated carbon. The reusability of the catalyst was investigated by monitoring the furfural selectivity over several reaction cycles, and after the 3rd cycle, a reduction in the selectivity from 72 to 30% was observed. However, the acid-functionalized carbon could still be useful for furfural production due to its low environmental impact in both the preparation and disposal steps. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1455–1461, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - The development of renewable liquid biofuel is a crucial route to increase the energy supply and reduce the pollutant emission.The catalysts were tested in the hydrocracking of bio-alkanes,produced from biodiesel hydrodeoxygenation for producing the bio-jet fuel.The ratio of metal sites to acid sites(C Pt /C A )on Pt/Al-MCM-41 bifunctional catalyst was important to both the catalyst activity and product selectivity.Catalysts with different metal/acid ratios were prepared on Al-MCM-41 support with Si/Al ratio of 10 using various platinum loadings.Both the hydrocracking activity and selectivity to kerosene increased with the increasing in C Pt /C A ratio in the range of 0.182~0.338.However,too high metal/acid ratio could cause the agglomeration of platinum particles,resulting in the waste of catalyst and reduction of catalyst activity and selectivity to kerosene.The optimal C Pt /C A ratio was 0.203,under which the bio-alkanes conversion,kerosene yield and kerosene/gasoline ratio could reach 98.7%,47.0% and 1.12,respectively. © 2018, Dept. of JCCOA.

AB  - Different ratios (3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, 15%) of acetone and ethyl acetate were added into crude bio-oil from fast pyrolysis to invest the effects of these two additives on the storage stability of bio-oil. The results show that both acetone and ethyl acetate can reduce the water content of bio-oil, and the ethyl acetate performes better than acetone. Compared to the blank control group, the water content decreases by 17.8% (from 16.32% to 13.41%) at 15% dose of ethyl acetate. The viscosities of bio-oil decrease a lot after adding acetone and ethyl acetate, and acetone shows more obvious effect. With the increasing of additive dose, the viscosity of bio-oil decreases. The viscosity of bio-oil decreases more than that of the control group by 37.20%, 57.78%, 71.92%, 79.79%, 84.67% with 3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, 15% dose of acetone, respectively. There is no significant difference in pH values among acetone and ethyl acetate addition groups and control group. According to the FT-IR and GC-MS analysis, it indicates that acetone and ethyl acetate inhibit the aging reactions of bio-oil during storage. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - In order to explore the characteristic and mechanism of bio- oil hydrocarbon through the method of copyrolysis, guaiacol was used as bio-oil model compound. In this paper,the co-pyrolysis process was taken under 550 ℃, in the presence of HZSM- 5. The experiments confirm that the catalytic co- pyrolysis process has benefit in the deoxidization of guaiacol,which makes a high yield of hydrocarbon. Though investigating guaiacol co- pyrolysis with Nbutanol, N- butanone,and N- butyric acid,we know that N- butanol is the best in all the three co- pyrolysis materials. Additionally,alcohols of C1- C6 was also co- pyrolysed with guaiacol. The results indicate that alcohols of low carbon number are more likely to produce water,and they are not so benefit to the deoxidation of guaiacol. On the contrary, alcohols of high carbon number could result in high carbon deposition,however,they can improve the yield of hydrocarbons. N-pentanol is the best in all the co-pyrolysis materials. © 2018, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica. All right reserved.

AB  - Bamboo is viewed as a potential feedstock for the future global energy supply due to the existence of many significantly fast-growing and abundant species. In this study, ma bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus) and green bamboo (Bambusa oldhamii) were used as feedstock to produce pyrolysis liquid (bio-oil) using a fast pyrolysis technology at a pyrolytic temperature of 460℃, and the basic properties of the bio-oils were analyzed. Results were compared to those of a previous study, which applied the same procedure to produce bio-oils from thorny bamboo (B. stenostachya) and long-branch bamboo (B. dolichoclada Hayat). Therefore, this study presents an integrated characterization of bio-oils from the 4 bamboo species. Results showed that higher heating values (HHVs) of bio-oils were 5.65 MJ kg-1 for ma bamboo at a moisture content of 44.2% and 9.39 MJ kg-1 for green bamboo at a moisture content of 43.4%. Both HHVs were relatively lower than those of thorny bamboo and long-branch bamboo for use as a bioenergy source. Analytical results of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that the main compounds of bio-oils from both ma bamboo and green bamboo consisted of similar proportions to those from thorny bamboo, including a good distribution of phenols, carboxylic acids, and ketones. Only the bio-oil of long-branch bamboo contained a significant proportion of such compounds, the major one of which was phenols with a large proportion of &gt; 50%. Generally, these 4 bamboo bio-oils can be utilized as fuels. The refining technology must be further researched; however, they would be great potential materials instead of fossil fuel resources to provide various chemical compounds. In particular, the bio-oil of long-branch bamboo has the greatest potential. © 2018 Taiwan Forestry Research Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - On a global scale many countries are still heavily dependent on crude oil to produce energy and fuel for transport, with a resulting increase of atmospheric pollution. A possible solution to obviate this problem is to find eco-sustainable energy sources. A potential choice could be the use of biodiesel as fuel. The work presented aims to characterise the transesterification reaction of waste peanut frying oil using colour analysis and wavelet analysis. The biodiesel production, with the complete absence of mucilages, was evaluated through a suitable set of energy wavelet coefficients and scalograms. The physical characteristics of the biodiesel are influenced by mucilages. In particular the viscosity, that is a fundamental parameter for the correct use of the biodiesel, might be compromised. The presence of contaminants in the samples can often be missed by visual analysis. The low and high frequency wavelet analysis, by investigating the energy change of wavelet coefficient, provided a valid characterisation of the quality of the samples, related to the absence of mucilages, which is consistent with the experimental results. The proposed method of this work represents a preliminary analysis, before the subsequent chemical physical analysis, that can be develop during the production phases of the biodiesel in order to optimise the process, avoiding the presence of impurities in suspension in the final product. © 2018 MDPI AG.

AB  - Micro-mesoporous ZSM-5/MCM-41 composites were prepared and then loaded with varied contents of NiMoW by the wet impregnation method. The hydrocracking conversion of crude palm oil to liquid biofuels with the prepared catalysts was carried out in a batch reactor at 400°C for 2 h. ZSM-5/MCM-41 composite exhibited 51.00% conversion with a yield of 9.23% gasoline, 20.60% kerosene, and 21.17% diesel. Upon loading of NiMoW, the catalysts exhibited an improved conversion (≥ 62.60%) and a reduced formation of coke, which resulted from combined properties of ZSM-5 with MCM-41 and the presence of dispersed NiMoW. The contents of impregnated metals also affected the performance of catalysts. Using ANOVA analysis (p < 0.05), we found that 8:8:8 wt.% NiMoW-ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst was suitable for the production of biofuels, when considering the efficiency and cost-effectiveness. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - As a non-toxic, renewable fuel with little or no modifications in diesel engines, biodiesel has the potential to replace diesel fuel. Biodiesel produced from used cooking oil reduces the total processing cost, minimises pollution and environmental degradation. Accordingly, there is a need for scale-up production. In this study, two steps procedures: Acid-catalysed and transesterification were employed to reduce the free fatty acid (FFA) content of waste cooking oil for an improved biodiesel yield. Furthermore, some physicochemical properties such as flash point, cloud point, pour point, density, sulphur content, and viscosity were measured according to the ASTM Testing Method. A rare 96.3% biodiesel yield was achieved using the two steps, and the physicochemical properties of all blends were in line with the set standards. Unlike conventional industrial diesel production, individuals can use the techniques in this study to maximally produce biodiesel from waste vegetable oil, to perverse the environment in addition to job creation. © 2018, Nova Science Publishers, Inc..

AB  - This article evaluates the efficiency of the degradation of pollutants present in water from the purification of biodiesel, characterized by high content of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), oils and greases, methanol, soap, and glycerol. The treatment process proposed was of the photo-Fenton type using iron immobilized in chitosan. The characterization of the material was performed according to degree of deacetylation (DD) and thermal stability (TG). The results revealed a DD of 66.5% and that the material undergoes decomposition in three temperature stages: 100; 150-350 and above 350 °C. The evaluated parameters were: COD, suspended solids, oils and greases, color and turbidity. After a 180-minutes long treatment, the removal percentage was 94.52, 70, 55, and 60% respectively. These results indicate that the photo-Fenton process can be an alternative for pre-treatment this type of effluent. © 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Polimeros. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Supported rhenium nanoparticles have been synthesised via wet impregnation and sol immobilisation. Deionised water was used as the solvent for both methods and the supports used were zirconia (ZrO2) and sulphated-zirconia (SO4-ZrO2). Characterisation involved BET surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD showed that samples were crystalline while BET showed that nanoparticles synthesised via sol immobilisation had a higher surface area while those synthesised via impregnation had a higher pore volume and diameter. Adsorption-desorption isotherms revealed that the particles were mesoporous (2-50 nm), which is in agreement with the data obtained from TEM. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The dehydration of bioethanol was investigated by breaking the azeotrope, using ionic liquids as entrainers. Three ionic liquids (LI) [EMIM][Cl], [EMIM][OAc], and [BMIM][Cl] were tested as entrainers. The behavior of ternary mixes of bioethanol-water-LI were evaluated through the activity coefficients and the relative volatility of bioethanol at 80°C and atmospheric pressure. [EMIM][Cl] was the most effective IL for dehydration purposes wherein bioethanol (93.45 % v/v) after three cycles of extraction was (99.20 % v/v) when a mass ratio bioethanol-IL of 0.55 was used. Based on these results, a composite was prepared by anchoring the LI 1-ethyl-(3-trimethoxysilil) propyl imidazolium chloride to mesoporous SiO2. The composite was characterized and it has been confirmed that there is a covalent bond between the IL and the matrix. The material was tested as dehydrating agent. Results of these two studies were compared and showed that the pure ionic liquids could be used as entrainers in extractive distillations, breaking water-ethanol azeotrope, also showing the same ionic liquids able to be anchored to matrices as solid composites for dehydration, offering additional advantages, e.g., as selectivity, less time consuming, recyclability, and significantly diminishes (84%), the requirement for the amount of the IL.

AB  - In fossil-based refinery and biorefinery applications hydrogen is recovered by pressure swing adsorption and subsequently re-pressurized using mechanical compressors. Electrochemical hydrogen compression is an efficient way of separating and compressing H2 from a gaseous mixture within a compact device. In this work, a preliminary investigation of the integration of a bio-oil hydroprocessing unit with a complete novel gas polishing and separation unit was conducted. Apart from the electrochemical compressor, this includes a CO methanation reactor and a ZnO bed to remove the contained CO and H2S impurities of the hydroprocessing reactor outlet and safeguard the trouble-free operation of the electrochemical device. This first assessment revealed that several operating parameters such as the hydrotreating pressure, the gas polishing and separation temperature and the hydrogen recycling ratio limit the possible operating modes of the subsequent units.

AB  - This document focuses on a life cycle assessment of a biodiesel production process from vegetal waste fats. The goal was to evaluate the environmental performance of the process and to identify opportunities to improve it. Those wastes are originatedby the restaurant industry on the urban zone of Tijuana, Mexico and they are processed byEnremex S. de R. L. de C. V. A transesterification reaction with homogeneous catalyst is used to produce 1 200 000 L of biodiesel and around 240 000 L of glycerol per year. As an alternative to the homogeneous catalyst, a based natural zeolite heterogeneous catalyst is proposed. Then, a series of laboratory experiments were performed. Concerning the environmental assessment, the biodiesel production process was separated in three steps: a) raw material collection, b) biodiesel production, and c) wastes management. In addi­tion, two scenarios were considered: 1) transesterification with homogeneous catalyst, 2) transesterification with heterogeneous catalyst. The results show that the production stage is the one that contributes the most on the environmental impact. Also, the use of a heterogeneous catalyst reduces the environmental impact in comparison with the homogeneous one. © 2018, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have synthesized bismuth complexes incorporating polydentate mono-and di-thiolate ligands and examined their utility as water-tolerant Lewis acid catalysts. The reaction of Bi(OAc)3 or Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and the corresponding mono-or di-thiol(ate) yielded the compounds [(SNNS)Bi(OAc)] (4), [(SNNSPr)Bi(OAc)] (5), [(NNS2)Bi(OAc)] (6), [(ONS2)Bi(OAc)] (7), [(ONS2)Bi(NO3)] (8), and [(NNS)2Bi][NO3] (9) [H2(SNNS) = N,N′-dimethyl-N,N′-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)ethylenediamine; H2(SNNSPr) = N,N′-diethyl-N,N′-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)propanediamine; H2(NNS2) = N,N-diethyl-N′,N′-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)ethanediamine; H2(ONS2) = 2-methoxyethyl-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)amine; H(NNS) = N,N-diethyl-N′-(2-mercaptoethyl)ethanediamine]. The solid-state structures of 4-8 show similar distorted pentagonal pyramidal geometries at the bismuth centre with a thiolate sulfur atom in the axial site, whereas 8 shows second structural arrangement with a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry at bismuth. The cation of 9 shows two NNS-bonded ligands and a distorted octahedral geometry at bismuth. Two-dimensional NMR studies of 4-8 show geminal 1H coupling in-SCH2CH2N-groups and suggests strong dative Bi-N intramolecular interactions. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and BiCl3 show high activity toward the esterification of stearic acid, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, and 4-7 and 9 show high activity toward the transesterification of methyl stearate in butanol, and 7 shows moderate activity as a catalyst for the transesterification of glyceryl trioctanoate in methanol. © 2018 Published by NRC Research Press.

AB  - As an ideal clean energy, biomass is friendly to the environment. Bio-oil is a brown and black viscous liquid obtained by rapid pyrolysis of biomass under anoxic conditions. As a kind of liquid fuel, it has the disadvantages of high acid value, high water content, high viscosity and low calorific value. In addition, bio-oil is the mixture of hundreds of chemicals. Carboxylic acids enhance corrosion resistance of bio-oil. Amounts of water reduce the calorific value of the bio-oil. Aldehydes and other labile compounds make the bio-oil coking or polymerize easily during storage, with the increased viscosity, affecting the quality of the bio-oil. In this experiment, in order to reduce the content of carboxylic acid in bio-oil, the carbon-based solid acid catalysts were used to catalyze esterification of bio-oil. In the experiment, 4 kinds of carbon-based solid acid catalysts were prepared by incomplete carbonization and carbonization-sulfonation. They were starch-TsOH, sucrose-TsOH, glucose-TsOH and corn flour-sulfuric acid. The catalysts were characterized by FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), indicating that the carbon-based solid acid catalyst is an aromatic carbon compound with sulfonic groups. Esterification was carried out with acid and alcohol as model compounds. Among the 4 catalysts, starch-TsOH had the highest esterification rate, and the conversion of acetic acid reached 91.58%. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst mass fraction and ratio of alcohol to acid on the conversion of acetic acid were investigated by single factor experiment. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the catalytic esterification conditions of the bio-oil model compound. The optimum reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperature 100℃, alkyd ratio 3.37, reaction time 2.49 h, and catalyst mass fraction 5.26%, and the acetic acid conversion rate reached 95.51%. Under these conditions, 3 validation experiments were carried out, the conversion rates were 94.89%, 94.26% and 95.01%, respectively, and the relative deviation was 0.83%, which was very close to the predicted value. This indicated that the model was reliable for the analysis and prediction of the optimum esterification conditions. Under the optimum reaction conditions, the starch-TsOH catalyst was reused 5 times, and the activity of the catalyst was investigated. The results showed that the catalyst was deactivated seriously after 4 times, and the conversion rate of acetic acid was reduced to 52.14%. After esterification of bio-oil with methanol, ethanol and n-butanol, the carboxylic acid was converted into neutral ester, and the acid value was reduced by 82.82%-91.41%. Moreover, after esterification, the density and viscosity of bio-oil decreased obviously, and the calorific value increased. The bio-oil and esterified bio-oil were analyzed by FTIR and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometer), which showed that some carboxylic acids in bio-oil were converted into esters, some acetals were produced, and phenols were unchanged basically. So, in the future experiments, we should consider how to make better use of phenolic compounds. After esterification and dehydration of bio-oil, the water content of bio-oil was reduced to 2.5%, and the calorific value was increased. The effect was significant, which indicated the necessity of water separation. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.

AB  - This study is relevant to developing biomass, specifically microalgae, as a source for biofuel production through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a thermochemical conversion that requires no drying of the feedstock because the whole microalgae biomass is decomposed and converted in hot compressed water. A biocrude oil is obtained as the main product, along with gaseous, aqueous and solid by-products. It was observed in different studies that catalysts, particularly alkali catalysts, improve liquefaction efficiency. This study investigated the effects of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) on the yield and properties of biocrude oil. Different amounts of catalysts used were 5, 7.5, and 10 wt. %, respectively. Biocrude oil was produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of Arthrospira platensis (formerly referred to as Spirulina platensis) in a micro-reactor at 280 and 350 degrees Celsius for two levels of residence time, 15 and 45 minutes. The biocrude produced under these different conditions were analyzed for C, H, O, and N content. Biocrude oil yield and its calorific value were also determined. The highest biocrude oil yield with catalyst (32.18 wt. %) was obtained at 280°C with 15 minutes residence time and 5 wt. % K2CO3. Highest HHV of 39.17 MJ/kg was obtained with the addition of 10 wt. % K2CO3 at 280°C and 45 minutes residence time. Biocrude oil obtained from the experiment runs had almost similar H/C, and O/C values to that of biodiesel and plant oil and was better than biomass pyrolysis oil. The N/C ratios of the biocrude oil ranged between 0.03 to 0.09 with a starting N/C ratio of 0.17. © 2018, Engineering and Technology Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid industrialisation and hike in fuel prices has led to a growing concern for the development of alternative fuel from renewable sources. Biodiesel is one of the promising biofuels as a replacement to petroleum diesel in the future. The present study reports the synthesis of a strontium functionalised calcium oxide (Sr/CaO) catalyst via wet impregnation method for biodiesel production from Prunus armeniaca oil. The characterisation data suggested the formation of fine particles of Sr/CaO catalyst with high pore diameter after the solid phase reaction. Response surface methodology in conjunction with central composite design was applied for the development of a quadratic model to optimize the biodiesel yield. The optimal yield of 90.4% was obtained at the following reaction conditions: 1.75% (w/v) catalyst dose, 12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 60 °C reaction temperature and 140 min reaction time and the prepared catalyst could be reused for four times with slight loss in activity. The obtained result was found to be in agreement with the predicted values which verified the accuracy of the model. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Wet storage is synonymous with ensilage, a simple biotechnology that has been used to preserve forage for livestock feed for millennia. In this natural process, organic acids are produced by anaerobic microbial degradation of a small fraction of the biomass, and these acids reduce the pH to levels that minimize further microbial activity and can preserve the biomass for years as long as anaerobic conditions are maintained. These organic acids also result in mild pretreatment with potential to enhance downstream conversion processes, making this an effective storage strategy. However, the degree and significance of this natural pretreatment capability of ensiled storage on downstream processes has not previously been quantified across a range of storage conditions. In this study, the degree of pretreatment was investigated by measuring the reactivity of corn stover fiber to cellulolytic enzymes. Although the results indicated significant improvement in hydrolytic outcomes after wet storage, by a factor of up to 2.4, saccharification of cellulose to sugar monomers was still limited. The results also show that dominance of lactic acid in the ensilage process is key to wet storage (pretreatment) effectiveness as in the livestock feed industry. Lactic acid pKa value is lower than the pKa of other silage acids and lower than typical silage pH. This gives lactic acid the advantage of being in the more dissociated form, with more protons available to facilitate pretreatment hydrolysis. However, unlike the livestock feed industry, where quality feedstock is attainable within very narrow storage moisture range, for biofuel purposes, a wider range of 35-65% is appropriate in achieving a similar quality outcome. This is true both for the immediate fiber response to enzymes and with subsequent pretreatment. This wider moisture range implies more flexibility in harvest schedule without sacrificing feedstock quality, thus alleviating concerns over feedstock quality that biomass suppliers or biorefineries may have. © 2018 Essien, Marshall, Richard and Ray.

AB  - A series of low-cost and sustainable amino-acid derived catalysts including glutamic acid hydrochlorate (GluCl), glycine hydrochlorate (GlyCl), alanine hydrochlorate (AlaCl) and valine hydrochlorate (ValCl) were prepared by using a simple assembly method and characterized by 1H/13C NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared) techniques. These amino-acid based catalysts were highly efficient for the production of an important platform molecule 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from biomass-derived sugars under oil-heating conditions. A high HMF yield of 83.7% at fructose conversion of 99.3% was achieved in merely 15 min at 120ºC. The catalyst could be reused for four times with no significant loss of its catalytic activity. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the present study, tests were conducted to reduce CO 2 emissions from a single-cylinder CI engine using biofuels and an exhaust catalytic carbon capture system (ECCCS) to evaluate CO 2 sequestration of biofuels. Karanja oil is a second generation non-edible oil available abundantly in India. A Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) operated CI engine emits higher CO 2 emissions due to the higher carbon content in its structure compared to diesel. Hence, the low carbon biofuel Orange oil (ORG) was blended on an equal volume basis with KOME. The blend reduced CO 2 emissions by 27% compared to KOME at 100% load condition. For further enhancement, acetone (A) was blended 20% by volume basis with the KOME-ORG blend. CO 2 emissions were reduced by about 30% for KOME-ORG + A20 blend compared to KOME at 100% load condition. Employing ECCCS along with KOME-ORG + A20 blend reduces CO 2 emissions further. CO 2 emissions are reduced by about 44% for KOME-ORG + A20 + Zeolite and reduced by about 32% for KOME-ORG + A20 + activated carbon. The results clearly indicate that KOME-ORG + A20 + zeolite is optimal among the blends based on carbon capture and maximum CO 2 sequestration. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Valeric biofuels are renewable and environmental friendly fuels whose production avoids the competition with the food industry for edible oils since its route of production uses lignocellulose of residue from crops as raw material. After the reaction steps several purification operations are necessary for the valeric biofuels to meet purity standards. Therefore, it is of utter importance the knowledge of both liquid-liquid (LLE) and vapor-liquid (VLE) equilibrium behavior of species present in the process, such as ethyl valerate, valeric acid, ethanol and water. In this sense, the objective of this work is to provide a general overview for the phase equilibria of the system aforementioned using experimental data collected as background for the thermodynamic modeling. Experimental data concerning to LLE were evaluated at local atmospheric pressure (around 90.9 kPa) and 293.15 K and 318.15 K, while VLE data were collected at several different controlled pressures, ranging from approximately 7 kPa to local atmospheric pressure (around 91 kPa). UNIFAC and PC-SAFT (Perturbed Chain form of the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory) were used to perform the thermodynamic modeling. The results obtained in this work are helpful to prove the importance of carefully evaluate the interactions between the molecules present in the system. Otherwise, the design of unit operations could underestimate the number of stages required for the purification, causing the products to not reach purity specifications. © 2018

AB  - With the inevitable depletion of non-renewable petroleum resources and the rising environmental concerns, renewable biomass has been regarded as a potential resource for sustainable supply of biofuels. The development of simple, cheap and sustainable catalytic process for the production of biofuels has become a major target. Among the promising biofuels, EMF (5-ethoxymethylfurfural) has been considered as a new generation of biofuel or fuel additive due to its unique properties, such as its liquid characteristics under room temperature, non-toxicity, high lubricity, stable flashpoint and excellent flow properties under cold conditions. Recently, an increasing number of reports have been focused on the direct conversion of carbohydrates and platform chemicals such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), fructose, sucrose, or inulin into EMF catalyzed by different catalysts. However, from a point of view that raw materials are cheap and rich, it is more valuable to use cellulose or cellulosic biomass instead of model compounds, such as HMF and fructose, for the production of EMF. In the existing researches, cellulose was usually used as raw material to be converted into intermediate product HMF, 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF) or 5-bromomethylfurfural (BMF), and so on, and then the target product EMF was obtained through the intermediate product. Using cheap and renewable cellulose as the raw material, and ethanol as the solvent, and combining the dehydration of cellulose to HMF, followed by the etherification of HMF to EMF in one-pot, is a more attractive reaction pathway. This one-pot reaction avoids the isolation and purification of HMF, which saves time, energy and solvent. The side reaction of process using extremely low sulfuric acid is slight, in which standard grade stainless steel facility can be used instead of high nickel alloy, which has a significant cost advantage in the equipment. In this paper, sulfuric acid with ultra low mass concentration (0.1% of the mass of ethanol) was used as catalyst to catalyze cellulose and ethanol to produce EMF in one-pot reaction. The effects of temperature, reaction time and substrate concentration on EMF yield were firstly studied and then the response surface methodology was used to design experiments to optimize the reaction conditions. The interactions of factors and the optimum reaction conditions were obtained. The results showed that the reaction temperature was the factor that mostly impacted the one-pot EMF production from cellulose and ethanol catalyzed by sulfuric acid with ultra low mass concentration. The maximum mean EMF yield of 14.93% was obtained under the optimum reaction conditions: reaction temperature of 200 ℃, reaction time of 75 min and substrate concentration of 30 g/L, with the prediction error of 2.03%, which showed that the model had a good fitting property. Compared to other studies, the study showed that EMF can be obtained directly from cellulose catalyzed by extremely low acid in one-pot reaction for the first time. The process conditions for producing EMF from cellulose catalyzed by extremely low acid in one-pot reaction had been optimized. This study can provide reference for the EMF one-pot production from much cheaper and abundant cellulosic biomass such as agricultural wastes catalyzed by sulfuric acid with extremely low concentration. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Modification of carbonaceous materials with different conductive coatings is a successful approach to enhance their electrocatalytic activity and thus to increase the electrical outputs when used as electrodes in biofuel cells. In this study, a methodology for electrodeposition of styrylquinolinium dye on carbon felt was developed. The produced dye electrodeposits were characterized by means of AFM, ESI-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The obtained data reveal that the dye forms overlaid layers consisting of monomer molecules most likely with an antiparallel orientation. The UV–VIS spectroscopy, CV and EIS analyses show that the dye molecules preserve their redox activity within the coating and a charge transfer between NADH/NAD+ and electrodeposit is possible as a coupled redox reaction. The fabricated nano-modified electrodes were also tested as anodes in batch-mode operating yeast-based biofuel cell. The results indicate that the electrodeposited dye acts as an immobilized exogenous mediator, contributing to enhanced extracellular electron transfer. © 2018

AB  - The corncob impregnated by ZnCl2 was used as the material in the pyrolysis experiment and the changes of micro- morphology before and after pretreatment were examined. The effects of ZnCl2 dosage and temperature on the pyrolysis characteristics and product distribution and bio- oil composition of corncobs were investigated. The results showed that the surface structure of corncob pretreated by ZnCl2 changed looser with squamous structure formed. The pyrolytic initial temperature and the corresponding temperature to maximum loss rate removed towards low temperature phase as the dosage of ZnCl2 increased. The bio- oil yield decreased with the increase of ZnCl2 dosage when reaction temperature was constant. The highest bio-oil yield was 47.39% obtained at 450℃and 1.69% ZnCl2, which higher than that of the untreated corncob. The furfural relative peak area in bio-oil decreased with the increase of temperature, and the higher the impregnation amount of ZnCl2, the higher furfural relative peak area. The relative peak area of furfural in the bio-oil was 51.61% at 350℃ and 5.89% ZnCl2. © 2018, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica. All right reserved.

AB  - In 2015, California established a mandate that requires on-road greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be reduced by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. We explore the feasibility of meeting this goal by large-scale commercialization of drop-in biofuels. Drop-in biofuels, although not clearly defined, are a class of fuels that can be produced from biomass and blended with either crude oil or finished fuels without requiring equipment retrofits. This article focuses on thermochemical routes at or near commercialization. We provide a bottom-up, spatially explicit cost analysis to evaluate whether California can meet its 2030 GHG reduction target with drop-in fuels alone. A takeaway from our analysis is that drop-in fuels, if their performance is consistent with small-scale and simulated results, can be viable low-carbon substitutes for gasoline and diesel. We find that California can meet, and even exceed, its 2030 GHG emissions target for on-road vehicles with drop-in biofuels alone, but this requires use of biomass resources located outside the state. Meeting the 40% reduction target in a cost-effective manner requires pyrolysis of herbaceous agricultural residues (96% of total fuel output) and the conversion of woody residues via methanol-to-gasoline (4%). This scale of production would require 58 million metric tons of biomass feedstock, or 20% of total available biomass residues in the United States. For comparison, California is responsible for 11% of transportation-related petroleum consumption in the US. The approximately 5 billion gallons (19 billion liters) per year of drop-in fuel would displace 30% of gasoline and 60% of diesel demand in California. If electricity offset credits are eliminated, the target can be met with a similar scale of production, but methanol-to-gasoline becomes the dominant route (>99%), biomass requirements increase by 33%, and average production costs increase by 20%. Following this policy pathway would increase national biofuel production by 30% relative to 2015 production levels. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - New technologies such as microwaves have gained a large deal of attention from scientists and industries who sought increased rate of production processes. In this study, microwave irradiation was utilized to produce a novel KOH/Ca12Al14O33 nanocatalyst used for biodiesel production. As support, calcium aluminate was prepared by microwave combustion method using different fuels including urea, glycine, sorbitol, and citric acid. The samples were then impregnated by KOH to improve their catalytic activities for microwave-enhanced transesterification of canola oil for biodiesel production. Results of XRD, BET, FTIR, TG, EDX, and FE-SEM analyses showed differences in physicochemical properties of the samples when using different fuels with different flame characteristics and combustion temperatures. Only the urea-fueled sample showed the crystalline structure of monocalcium aluminate (CaAl2O4), with the other samples exhibiting amorphous structure of CaO–Al2O3. However, all samples, except for that prepared by citric acid, transformed to crystalline structure of Ca12Al14O33 by calcination during KOH impregnation. Among the samples, the KOH/Ca12Al14O33 nanocatalyst prepared by sorbitol showed the highest activity in microwave-enhanced biodiesel production because of its large surface area, pore size, and basicity, converting 93.4% of canola oil to biodiesel at a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 18, catalyst concentration of 4 wt%, and microwave output power of 450 W in 60 min of reaction time. Moreover, the sample showed well-distributed particle sizes without any agglomeration, so that it could easily maintain its level of activity for several rounds of use. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Synergistic online upgrading of pyrolysis vapors have been performed on a two- staged fixed- bed reactor in which two different catalysts are placed in different layers and different sequences(HZSM-5/MCM-41 and MCM-41/ HZSM-5). The result is compared with that of experiments using MCM-41 and HZSM-5 as the catalyst respectively. The physical and chemical characteristics and composition of organic phase in purified bio-oil have been analyzed to explore the synergistic catalytic mechanism. The results showed that the bio-oil obtained from synergistic catalytic reaction shows lower organic phase products but better physicochemical properties than that obtained from singular catalytic reaction. The bio- oil obtained from synergistic catalytic reaction has relatively high calorific value which are 33.56 MJ/kg and 34.31 MJ/kg respectively. The catalytic reaction increases hydrocarbon content in the refined bio- oil significantly. The MCM-41/HZSM-5 synergistic catalytic reaction produces many hydrocarbons of which the carbon atoms are mainly C6-C9 and few aromatic substances. The bio-oil's organic phase shows that monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon takes up a relatively high proportion of the hydrocarbons. MCM-41/HZSM-5 synergistic catalytic reaction removes oxygen out of oxygenated macromolecular at a relatively high rate, leading to a relatively lower content of high oxygenated organic compounds in organic phase of refined bio-oil. © 2018, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

AB  - The pyrolysis behaviors of the three major organic components of eucalyptus alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping (APMP) spent liquor including alkali lignin (AL), lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC), and polysaccharide (PLS) were studied with emphasis on the effect and contributions of components on the overall pyrolysates of APMP spent liquor solid (ASLS). Profound differences on product properties from each component pyrolysis were illustrated. The results indicated that the bio-oil during ASLS pyrolysis was mainly attributed to AL, while the bio-gas and char were mostly affected by PLS. Small molecule hydrocarbons released during ASLS pyrolysis mainly came from AL and LCC, and CO and CO2 mainly produced from PLS. As for bio-oils, AL generated the largest proportion of monomeric phenols and aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs), while PLS and LCC mainly contributed to the production of ketones, furans and acids. The correlation shown here is of interest for further studies on pulping spent liquor grading utilization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biocrude pyrolysis oil is obtained by a process called fast-pyrolysis, in which almost any organic-based feedstock is thermally processed at moderate temperatures, in the range of 400–600 °C, in the absence of oxygen at short residence times. After condensing the vapors in a cooling tray, a dark-brown bioliquid is obtained. The quality of the thus obtained fast pyrolysis oil has some barriers for its direct use as transportation fuel. Low caloric value, high viscosity, and corrosion are the major challenges for its implementation in conventional engines. There have been sustained efforts to improve the quality of the oil. In this Communication we are reporting a concept on improving the acidic properties by means of a combined catalysis and adsorption approach. We found that fast pyrolysis oil can be upgraded through alcoholysis using n-butanol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, which are biomass-derived bulk chemicals. The reaction is acid catalyzed whereas water is continuously separated from the condensate mixture through molecular sieve adsorption. Under optimal conditions, the ultimate acidity and water content of the upgraded product are negligible. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Caesalpinea eriostachys seed oil, as a source of triglycerides with potential application for biodiesel production in Mexico is introduced. Its lipid profile obtained by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed saturated and unsaturated glycerol esters as the constituents. Therefore, heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyzed transesterification reactions were assayed employing ZnAl hydrotalcites and KOH, as the catalysts, respectively. The transesterification reactions yielded 59% for Zn/Al(2), 79% for Zn/Al(4), and 90% for KOH, depicting typical behavior, as in biodiesel production data from literature, where Zn-Al hydrotalcites or KOH were assayed. The caloric, density, viscosity values, and fatty acid methyl esters profile from reaction products were concordant to EN 14214, suggesting C. eriostachys as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oyster shell powder (OSP) and rice husk ash (RHA) on the pyrolysis of rice husk (RH) for bio-oil. The present study focuses on the effect of catalysts on pyrolysis of RH for bio-oil and the quantity of bio-oil produced. The results showed that both OSP and RHA could improve the yield and quality of bio-oil, and the catalytic effect of OSP was better than that of RHA. With the content of the two catalysts increased, the net increase range of bio-oil yield decreased gradually. With 3 wt.% of OSP or 2 wt.% of RHA, the yield of bio-oil achieved to 57.06% and 56.07% respectively, which increased by 6.03% and 4.20% compared to that of single pyrolysis of rice husk. Both OSP and RHA can increase the bio-oil heating value and decrease the acid value. With the presence of 1–5 wt.% of OSP or RHA in the RH pyrolysis process, the heating value of the bio-oil can be increased by 5.04–10.25% and 4.32–5.78%, the acid value of the bio-oil can be decreased by 5.30–13.54% and 9.81–33.01%, respectively. OSP was better than RHA on the heating value improvement, while RHA was superior to OSP in decreasing the acid value. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of bio-oil composition indicated that the formation of phenols, acids and ketones compounds were inhibited and alcohols and furan compounds were promoted with the addition of OSP and RHA catalysts. The study made the catalytic pyrolysis process more favorable for the production of high heating value fuel. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to study biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using a transesterification method. Optimization was achieved by changing process variables, including the oil:alcohol molar ratio and reaction temperature, to maximize biodiesel yield. Optimum variables were identified using Central Composite Face-Centered Design (CCFD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Furthermore, the synergistic and antagonistic effects among process parameters were analyzed. The optimum temperature for the production of biodiesel was identified at 62.8 °C, and the optimum oil:alcohol ratio was 4.3; the combination of these parameters resulted in the highest theoretical efficiency of 96.08% and desirability of 0.608. After evaluating the experimentally produced biodiesel, the study revealed that waste cooking oil can be used as a potential raw material for the production of biofuel. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation, bacteria should tolerate high concentrations of solvent products, which inhibit bacteria growth and limit further increase of solvents to more than 20 g/L. Moreover, this limited solvent concentration significantly increases the cost of solvent separation through traditional approaches. In this study, alginate adsorbent immobilization technique was successfully developed to assist in situ extraction using octanol which is effective in extracting butanol but presents strong toxic effect to bacteria. The adsorbent improved solvent tolerance of Clostridium acetobutylicum under extreme condition of high concentration of organic solvent. Using the developed technique, more than 42% of added bacteria can be adsorbed to the adsorbent. Surface area of the adsorbent was more than 10 times greater than sodium alginate. Scanning electron microscope image shows that an abundant amount of pore structure was successfully developed on adsorbents, promoting bacteria adsorption. In adsorbent assisted ABE fermentation, there was 21.64 g/L butanol in extracting layer compared to negligible butanol produced with only the extractant but without the adsorbent, for the reason that adsorbent can reduce damaging exposure of C. acetobutylicum to octanol. The strategy can improve total butanol production with respect to traditional culture approach by more than 2.5 fold and save energy for subsequent butanol recovery, which effects can potentially make the biobutanol production more economically practical. © 2018 Ye, Song, Zhu, Song, Chen and Hong.

AB  - Contaminants are increasing in the aquatic ecosystem due to the development of industrial and agricultural activities. Contaminants include organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds, which accumulate in the ecosystem’s primary producers and propagate through the food chain. The total lipid contents and fatty acid profiles in the marine macroalgae Pterocladia capillacea, Ulva lactuca and Sargassum hornschuchii proved to be a good bioindicator to assess contamination levels. The lowest value of the total lipid content was 1.90% obtained in S. hornschuchii under the bisphenol treatment, while the highest value was 4.66% obtained in U. lactuca under exposed to clofibric acid. The fatty acid methyl ester profiles were analysed by using gas chromatography. The total fatty acids varied from 5.85% (U. lactuca after exposure to bisphenol) to 28.38% (P. capillacea treated with clofibric acid). The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids was significantly higher in U. lactuca after exposure to acetyl salicylic acid than in the other macroalgae under different treatments. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - To quantitatively convert biomass into value-added chemicals or biofuels is still a great challenge. Herein, we develop an efficient electrochemical method to convert the biomass-derived valeric acid into ethers (butyl methyl ether and butyraldehyde dimethyl acetal) or esters (methyl valerate) on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode in methanol solution. The products distribution was well controlled by tuning the supporting electrolyte and the KOH amount. 98.7% selectivity and ca. 58% Faraday efficiency for ethers and 96% selectivity for esters were achieved by optimizing the supporting electrolytes, initial molar ratio of VA to KOH, VA feed concentration and anodic potential. Strong alkali as supporting electrolyte, high VA feed concentration and initial VA/KOH=1 (mol/mol) favoured the formation of ether products. Fatty acid methyl esters were high-selectively ( &gt; 96%) produced by using NaClO4 as the supporting electrolyte and/or adding excessive KOH (initial KOH/VA ratio beyond 2:1). Moreover, partially replacing methanol with ethanol, only one new diether (1,1-diethoxybutane) was formed. A rational mechanism of synthetic butyraldehyde dimethyl acetal via electrocatalytic decarboxylation, rearrangement of carbenium ion, Aldol reaction on BDD in alcohols solution was developed. This strategy may provide a new direction for renewable chemicals and fuels from biomass. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Continuous cultures in chemostats have proven their value in microbiology, microbial ecology, systems biology and bioprocess engineering, among others. In these systems, microbial growth and ecosystem performance can be quantified under stable and defined environmental conditions. This is essential when linking microbial diversity to ecosystem function. Here, a new system to test this link in anaerobic, methanogenic microbial communities is introduced. Rigorously replicated experiments or a suitable experimental design typically require operating several chemostats in parallel. However, this is labor intensive, especially when measuring biogas production. Commercial solutions for multiplying reactors performing continuous anaerobic digestion exist but are expensive and use comparably large reactor volumes, requiring the preparation of substantial amounts of media. Here, a flexible system of Lab-scale Automated and Multiplexed Anaerobic Chemostat system (LAMACs) with a working volume of 200 mL is introduced. Sterile feeding, biomass wasting and pressure monitoring are automated. One module containing six reactors fits the typical dimensions of a lab bench. Thanks to automation, time required for reactor operation and maintenance are reduced compared to traditional lab-scale systems. Several modules can be used together, and so far the parallel operation of 30 reactors was demonstrated. The chemostats are autoclavable. Parameters like reactor volume, flow rates and operating temperature can be freely set. The robustness of the system was tested in a two-month long experiment in which three inocula in four replicates, i.e., twelve continuous digesters were monitored. Statistically significant differences in the biogas production between inocula were observed. In anaerobic digestion, biogas production and consequently pressure development in a closed environment is a proxy for ecosystem performance. The precision of the pressure measurement is thus crucial. The measured maximum and minimum rates of gas production could be determined at the same precision. The LAMACs is a tool that enables us to put in practice the often-demanded need for replication and rigorous testing in microbial ecology as well as bioprocess engineering. © 2018 Plouchart et al.

AB  - Production of biodiesel from used oils as diesel substitute is particularly important because of the decreasing oil reserves and the environmental problems associated with the use of fossil fuels. In this study, Biodiesel was synthesized from high acid value Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) and Used Palm Oil (UPO) using synthesized nanoparticles of 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) catalyst. Under optimized conditions the biodiesel yield was 91% from WCO and 96.5% from UPO. The methyl esters obtained from WCO and UPO were found to be in accordance with the ASTM standards for biodiesel. Performance characteristics of biodiesel obtained from WCO and UPO were studied on a four stroke diesel engine under loaded conditions. The results show an increase in Brake Thermal Efficiency (18.6 & 8.1 %) and Mechanical Efficiency (23 & 16.5 %) for biodiesel obtained from WCO and UPO when compared with diesel. Nanoparticles of TPA successfully reduced the NOx emission by 42 % and 19 %, respectively in contrast to diesel. © EM International.

AB  - Antioxidants are an alternative to prevent or retard the degradation of biofuels. In this study was utilized biodiesel obtained from the soybean oil transesterification, by methylic route, using sodium methoxide as catalyst. The synthetic antioxidants, butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), terc-butylhidroquinone (TBHQ) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) were added separately and in misture to the biodiesel. The induction period and the relative protection factor (RPF) were evaluated by the Rancimat method at temperatures 110, 115, 120 and 125ºC. The results showed that the highest RPF was for the tests containing the antioxidant TBHQ. The multi-response optimization indicated that the mixture containing only TBHQ was the condition with better performance on the RPF, with the predicted value of 31.27 at a temperature of 110°C. A similar value was obtained experimentally, showing the efficiency of design used and the validity of the obtained models confirmed by statistical analysis of the obtained data. © 2019, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - In this paper, continuous hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of liquid phase pyrolysis (LPP) oil in lab-scale is discussed. Pyrolysis oil is derived from the bioCRACK pilot plant from BDI - BioEnergy International GmbH at the OMV refinery in Vienna/Schwechat. Three hydrodeoxygenation temperature set points at 350, 375, and 400°C were investigated. Liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) was 0.5 h-1. Hydrodeoxygenation was performed with an in situ sulfided metal oxide catalyst. During HDO, three product phases were collected. A gaseous phase, an aqueous phase and a hydrocarbon phase. Experiment duration was 36 h at 350 and 375°C and 27.5 h at 400°C in steady state operation mode. Water content of the hydrocarbon phase was reduced to below 0.05 wt.%. The water content of the aqueous phase was between 96.9 and 99.9 wt.%, indicating effective hydrodeoxygenation. The most promising results, concerning the rate of hydrodeoxygenation, were achieved at 400°C. After 36/27.5 h of experiment, catalyst deactivation was observed. © 2018 Treusch, Schwaiger, Schlackl, Nagl, Pucher and Siebenhofer.

AB  - Energy consumption is continuously growing world-wide. Due to tightening environmental regulations and to reduce dependency on fossil fuels the demand for alternative fuels is increasing in the EU. At the same time the use of first generation biofuels is limited because of their inappropriate properties and feedstocks. First generation biofuels are mainly produced from edible feedstocks. So this is important to investigate the utilisation of waste based sources and new methods to produce new, alternative fuel components with better properties. Waste fatty acids can be promising feedstocks for alternative fuel production, since hydrocarbons can be produced from them with oxygen removal reactions. There is little information about the hydrogenation of fatty acid mixtures in the literature; most of the studies are about the conversion of model compounds. Real waste fraction with high fatty acid content (&gt; 90 %) has high oxygen and olefinic double bond content (&gt; 78 %). These are heat and oxidation sensitive compounds. Hydrocarbon fraction with mainly normal-paraffins can be produced with the hydrogenation of these compounds. These paraffins are good blending components of engine fuels with favourable performance properties. The aim of our work was to study the production of high quality diesel fuels with alternative component content from the different mixtures of waste fatty acids and highsulphur, crude oil based light gas oil fractions. The quality improvement of mixtures of unrefined, winter grade gas oil fraction and fatty acids (10, 20 and 30 wt%) was carried out on a commercial, sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. Our goal was to achieve the most complete hydrogenation of the unstable fatty acids (saturation and oxygen removal) and to practically remove the sulphur content of the gas oil fraction, furthermore, to saturate the aromatics (especially the polycyclic ones) as much as possible.

AB  - As the result of the European Union (EU) directives, the amount of alternative components used in fuels is continuously growing in Europe. One of the most common used biofuel is biodiesel which is produced by base- or acid-catalysed transesterification of triglycerides with an alcohol (usually methanol). Biodiesel has lot of drawbacks such as low thermal and oxidation stability, unfavourable cold flow properties, lower energy content, etc. Due its disadvantages the EU diesel standard (EN 590:2013) limits its blending rate to 7 V/V %. Fatty acids are derived from renewable sources; bio-paraffins in gas oil boiling range can be produced from them by catalytic oxygen removal reactions. The obtained bio-paraffins can be promising alternative fuel blending components or valuable petrochemical feedstock. Thus during our experimental work we demonstrated the bio-paraffin purpose hydrotreating of waste fatty acid mixture from vegetable oil processing on sulphided NiMo/Al2O3-P catalyst. The effects of process parameters (temperature: 300 – 345 °C, pressure: 40 bar, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV): 0.75 – 3.0 h-1, H2/feedstock ratio: 450 – 600 Nm3/m3) on the quality and quantity of the main products were investigated. Based on the results we have determined the favourable process parameters for the production of bio-paraffins. The theoretical yields were approximated over 90%. Utilization ideas were proposed for the produced bio-paraffin mixture. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Due the environmental appeal, the demand of new processes and inputs has been increasing considerably in the last decade. Biodiesel is a biodegradable fuel obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats, including those discarded after use. The methyl and ethyl transesterification routes for biodiesel production were tested by using residual frying oil as raw material through the homogeneous basic catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide. In present work, it was evaluated the efficiency of the eugenol on the oxidation stability of the methyl and ethyl biodiesels synthesized from residual frying oil. The chromatographic analysis determined that the conversion of the yield to the methyl and ethylic esters (biodiesel) was 90.6% and 87.3% (m/m), respectively. For both biodiesel samples a rise of the eugenol concentration added resulted in an increase of the induction period (oxidation stability parameter evaluated by Rancimat method), with a consequent reduction of the acid number. Taking these results into account, it can be concluded that the samples obtained after eugenol addition can be used as biodiesel. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Departamento de Quimica.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable and non-toxic biofuel that can be produced by the esterification reaction. In this reaction, acid catalysts are used and, due to the numerous advantages, heterogeneous catalysts are gaining space. Polysulfone (PSF) and sulfonated polystyrene (PSS) membranes were prepared to catalyze the esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol, producing biodiesel. Several morphological types of membranes were obtained: dense, porous and electrospun. The reaction conditions were: temperature of 100 °C, molar ratio of 10:1 (methanol:oleic acid), 5% catalyst and time of 2 hours. By means of the BET and BJH methods it was possible to obtain the surface area of the membranes, volume and pore size. The consumption of oleic acid and the formation of the ester were confirmed by the analyzes of CGMS and the FTIR bands, respectively. For the membranes that presented the PSS, 2 hours of reaction were enough for almost total consumption of oleic acid, except for the dense membrane.

AB  - The prodigious growth of filamentous algae that has been occurring since 2011 in the littoral zone of Lake Baikal poses an acute ecological problem. Samples of algal biomass and aqueous vegetation were collected from the littoral zone of Lake Baikal and converted by hydrothermal treatment into biofuel in the presence of ammonium heptamolybdate. It was demonstrated that algal biomass from the Baikal littoral zone could be a potential source of feedstock for producing biofuel by thermocatalytic treatment. The addition of heavy-oil resids to algal and aquatic vegetation biomass increased the motor-fuel yield and modified its composition. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Second-generation biofuels are a complex mixture of organic compounds that can be further processed to hydrocarbon fuels and other valuable chemicals. One such chemical is levulinic acid (IUPAC name: 4-oxo pentanoic acid), which is a highly versatile ketoacid obtained from cellulose present in agricultural byproducts. For oxygen-containing compounds that decompose at elevated temperatures and pressures, determining the vapor-liquid equilibria data at high temperatures via the experimental route may be challenging. The molecular simulation approach is a cost-effective tool to obtain the necessary data while also allowing us to understand the microscopic origins of macroscopic observable properties. We have employed the transferable potential for phase equilibria-united atom force field to describe the interactions in this system with the parameters for a torsional interaction that are not reported in the literature (levulinic acid is a ketoacid) being determined from density functional theory calculations. We have verified our parameterization via density computations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble and by comparing our simulation results with the corresponding data from experiments reported in the literature. We have performed grand-canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulations in the temperature range from 580 to 690 K to estimate the vapor-liquid coexistence curves in the temperature-density plane and the Clapeyron plots. From this data, the critical point (TC = 755 K, ρC = 285.4 kg/m3, and PC = 30.57 bar) has been estimated, and this may be used as input to the equations of state employed in process simulation software for design of industrial separation processes including those for "biorefining". As levulinic acid is a "ketoacid", hydrogen bonding occurs, and the liquid phase structure has also been studied using radial distribution functions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This research aimed to determine the influence of process parameters on yields of biofuel production by hydrocracking of waste virgin coconut oil using HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst and to determine statistical relationship of yields of biofuels with the parameters by Pearson’s correlation. The various operating parameters in batch reactor were a reaction temperature (350-400°C), an initial hydrogen pressure (20-40 bar), and a reaction time (1-3 h). The highest yields of gasoline (6.79 wt%) and kerosene (31.38 wt%) were achieved under a temperature at 400°C, initial hydrogen pressure at 40 bar, and a reaction time of 3 h. The highest yield of diesel of 58.62 wt% was achieved at a reaction time of 1 h under temperature 400°C and initial hydrogen pressure 40 bar. Using Pearson’s correlation data analysis, the correlation coefficient between two variables (the yield of biofuel and the operating condition) showed strong dependence of reaction temperature and time on yields of hydrocarbon chains of various length. Yields of shorter hydrocarbon chains such as biogasoline and biokerosene required higher reaction temperature and longer reaction time and vice versa. However, pressure dependence on yields of biofuels was insignificant. © 2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.

AB  - The target of the Indonesian government in 2025 is increasing the use of renewable energy up to 23%, one part of potential renewable energy in Indonesia is biofuel. Biofuel requires raw materials of plant or animal oil with or without catalyst, it does not require the raw material of ethanol or methanol. The product is similar to gasoline and diesel that came from crude oil. Potential oil-producing plants in Indonesia are Palm Oil and Nyamplung (Calophyllum inophyllum L.). The process of making biofuel from this material is done by heating the reactor or furnace with temperature range of 350-500°C. To reach the stability of furnace temperature, it requires temperature control systems and one of them is PID. Arduino microcontroller is an open source and user friendly platform for hardware and software. The control system that designed by using arduino is capable to control the furnace temperature from 200°C to 400°C and it is using a 6000 watt heater. The best system response is achieved when Kp=15, Ki = 15 and Kd = 1. With these parameter values, the system has the lowest overshoot response of 16%, so it is safe for biofuel furnace, even though the rise time value is 146 s, settling time of 429 and steady state error is equal to 2.87%. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

AB  - Addressing the global energy needs and limited resources in the form of sustainable technologies should be ideally non-combustion based and have reduced net CO2 emissions. Microbial Fuel Cells or MFCs can be part of this sustainable development and in the process support the water infrastructure as well. MFC research is evolving rapidly as a promising alternative. In this study, an attempt has been made to produce low cost MFC without involving any costly membrane. The wastewater used in this MFC was biodiesel based, the intention being the feasibility to treat wastewater from biofuel processing. The total dissolved solids or TDS of the wastewater initially was 4420±30 ppm on the first day which decreased to 3360±20 ppm after nearly three weeks of operation. Open circuit voltage or OCV was recorded around 800±10 mV, and the electricity production using a 100 resistor produced around 0.0041±0.0003 mA, power density peaked at 0.15±0.03 mW/cm2. System architecture included graphene as a conductive anolyte, aluminum mesh as cathode and a commercially available earthen pot structure as membrane. XRD analysis of membrane showed feasibility of operation, which can be essential for future designs wherein low cost membranes can be integrated for sustainable power generation and wastewater treatment. © 2018 Technoscience Publications.

AB  - In this study, the evaluation of the catalytic behavior of several wild bacterial strains in the 1,3-selective ethanolysis of triglycerides with ethanol to produce a new type of biodiesel (Ecodiesel) that integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols was carried out. The Ecodiesel production not only avoids the elimination of glycerol, which is largely generated as a by-product in the biodiesel industry, but also results in an increase in the biofuel yield. The wild microbial strain samples were obtained from several lipophilic organisms. In addition to evaluate the enzymatic extracts, the minimum grade of purification of the strains, necessary to obtain similar results to those attained with commercial lipases was studied. This purification treatment included a dialysis followed by a lyophilization process. Such extracts were directly used as biocatalysts in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol, attaining much better results (yield close to 100%) than those obtained with strains which were not submitted to the purification process (yields lower than 10%). Furthermore, the results here obtained are similar to those obtained with commercial lipases but were achieved under mild conditions and lower reaction time (2 h). In addition, the stability of the enzymatic extracts was corroborated by subsequent reactions, showing no loss of activity. Thus, this study brings to light that enzymatic extracts obtained by a very simple purification process can be economically competitive with the conventional biodiesel production methods. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Viability for oxo pentanoate, pentanoate and butanediaoate production as potential biofuel produced from carboxylic acid by acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass has been identified. Carboxylic acids like butanedioic acid (BA), 4-oxo pentanoic acid (oPA) and pentanoic acid (PA) were reacted with alcohols like primary alcohol as Methanol (MeOH), Ethanol (EtOH) and secondary alcohol as 2-Propanol (2-PrOH) using Microwave Irradiation (MWI). H2SO4 as homogeneous catalyst and Hβ as solid acid catalyst were studied to establish efficient esterification reactions with variation in the operating conditions (reaction time, feed ratio, catalyst dosage, microwave power, reaction temperature, type of catalyst, etc.). The comparison was established with conventional as well as MWI process with the use parent zeolite Hβ and desilicated Hβ (D-Hβ) to produce respective esters. Further Hβ and D-Hβ have been analysed by different characteristics for the solid catalyst. Acidity of zeolite β by Ammonia temperature program desorption (NH3-TPD), average particle size by DLS, SEM &amp; TEM, framework confirmation by XRD &amp; FTIR, while surface area, pore size and pore volume were measured by BET method. This study was to establish efficient selectivity and conversion analysis of the desired biofuels' additives with use of MWI, a cleaner production technique. It has advantages of high selectivity, good conversion, short reaction time and less separation cost. Further to apply conversion &amp; selectivities' analysis and to scale up the reaction, batch reactor model equation is developed with MWI process based on the reaction constant and concentration of the stoichiometric reactants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With domestication of crops, have evolved methods to provide food. Population growth has caused increase in nutritional needs in addition to environmental pollution. Nowruzak (Salvia leriifolia) is a perennial plant from Lamiaceae family grown in the east of Asia. Nowruzak is grown wildly in arid and desert areas. The current study was conducted to measure fatty acid composition of seed oil, amino acids, chemical composition, carotene value, tocopherol and sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron of Nowruzak seed. Results showed that full seed of Nowruzak and its kernel contain approximately 27% and over 52% of edible oil with high quality, respectively. The amount of beta-carotene was 38.88 (mg/kg), alpha-tocopherol 316.75 (mg/kg), sodium (0.18%), potassium (1.24%), calcium (0.81%) and magnesium (0.28%). Protein, fat and crude fiber of full seed of Nowruzak were 19.31%, 28.51% and 3.12%, respectively. Results indicated that seed of Nowruzak could be used as a perfect alternative of chemical supplements to compensate lack of food requirements in food and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, it was examined as a raw source to produce biodiesel and its nutritional value showed higher priority, while its waste could be used in preparation of fuel. Nowruzak had the potential to produce 3348.8 L/ha of biodiesel. This study concludes that Nowruzak is a perfect plant in order to be used in both nutrition and industry. It is possible to use Nowruzak in edible oil extraction industry and its waste can be directly used in biofuel industry with oil content of 56% on average. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid climates, Balanites aegyptiaca (B. aegyptiaca) is a potential plant to produce oilseed-based biofuels. In this paper an optimization model for a wild biomass supply chain is presented. The model was developed to identify the optimal organization of the supply network that minimizes the cost of supplying the feedstock. It was applied to a case study on a B. aegyptiaca seed supply chain in Burkina Faso. Considering different means of transport and different pre-processing locations, the results show that in contexts such as Burkina Faso's, the most efficient option for the supply of B. aegyptiaca seeds is using animal drawn carts to transport the biomass from the harvest sites to the collection points. Feedstock pre-processing should take place before transport and an improvement in pre-processing operations by mechanical de-hulling could help reduce the cost price of the seeds. The results also show that more than 35% of the cost price of B. aegyptiaca seed is accounted for by transport costs. Pre-processing, handling, and storage costs account for about 50% of the cost of the seeds. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The search for a new and efficient transducer that can electrically connect enzyme active sites, like flavin adenine dinucleotide in glucose oxidase (GOx), with the electrode surface is a cutting-edge research area. Currently, Os(bpy)-complex pendent polyvinylpyridine/polyvinyl imidazole/pyridinium hydrogel based chemically modified electrodes have been widely used for this purpose (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine). Herein, we report, a [Mn2 III(phen)4(O)(Cl)2]2+ complex/Nafion-immobilized carboxylic acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE/f-MWCNT@Mn2(Phen)4O(Cl)2-Nf, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), prepared by an in-situ electrochemical method using the precursor, Mn(phen)2Cl2, as an efficient and low cost alternate to the Os-complex transducer, for the glucose oxidase enzyme (GOx) based bio-electro-catalytic system. The existence of the key active site, [Mn2 III(phen)4(O)(Cl)2]2+, on the modified electrode was confirmed by physicochemical characterizations using transmission electron microscope, Raman, infrared, and UV-vis spectroscopes and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry techniques. The Mn-complex modified electrode showed a redox peak at E°′ = 0.55 V vs Ag/AgCl in neutral solution with a surface excess (Î"Mn) value of 5.6 × 10-9 mol cm-2. The GOx enzyme bioanode prepared by adsorbing GOx on the Mn-complex modified electrode has shown an efficient bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose with a Tafel slope value of 111 mV dec-1. Amperometric i-t analysis of glucose showed a calibration plot in a linear range of 50-550 μM and with current sensitivity of 316.7 μA mM-1 cm-2. The current sensitivity value obtained here is about 2-80â€»000 times higher than that of the Os(bpy)-complex based transducers used for GOx based bio-electro-catalytic applications. Utilizing this new bioanode system along with a Pt-based oxygen reduction electrode, a new biofuel cell was constructed and achieved a power density value 7.5 μW cm-2 © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study aimed to improve the enzyme immobilization of electrodes to increase electrical power and lifespan using glucose oxidase in a bioanode, laccase in a biocathode, and glucose as a fuel. Both of these enzymes were immobilized on a carbon paper through covalent entrapment. Electrodes were characterized using electrochemical measurements (cyclic voltammetry) and enzymatic biofuel cells. For continuous 16 h, the maximum power density achieved for a hydrophobic electrode was approximately 80 μW/cm2 at 0.13 V. For a hydrophilic electrode, the yield was approximately 130 μW/cm2 at 0.25 V, which was significantly higher than that for the hydrophobic electrode. The measurements were performed at a working temperature of 37°C with phosphate buffer solution of pH 7 as an electrolyte, and 10 mM glucose was added to the anode as a fuel. The hydrophilic electrode was superior to the hydrophobic electrode because of the covalent entrapment immobilization of glucose oxidase and laccase enzymes in enzymatic biofuel cells. © 2018, © 2018 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.

AB  - This work evaluates the direct etherification of bio-sourced isobutylene with ethanol forming fully renewable ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). Challenge was the use of the fermentative produced substrate in a solvent-free catalysis using the acidic ion exchanger Amberlyst-15. CO2 impurities have a significant influence on the liquid phase process. The conversion at a ratio that is based on molarities of isobutylene to ethanol of 1:0.9 results in yields up to 97 mol% ETBE. Purities up to 99 wt.% could be achieved by subsequent water extraction in order to ensure qualities for technical application as high performance fuel additive. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Three difunctional ethyl esters (DFEEs), including ethyl 16-hydroxyhexadecanoate, ethyl (Z)-18-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoate, and diethyl (Z)-octadec-9-ene-1,18-dioate, were isolated as nearly pure compounds from sawdust-derived bio-oil. Their structures were tentatively identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Combination transesterification reaction of DFEEs to difunctional methyl esters (DFMEs) and determination of the GC/MS retention time differences of DFEEs and corresponding DFMEs is a simple method to determine the ester group number of unknown DFEEs. GC/MS results indicate that the fragment ions at mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 88 and 98 are typical ions for these DFEEs. The former ion is formed via well-known McLafferty rearrangement, whereas the formation pathway of the ion at m/z 98 is unreported before. HR-MS results show that the fragment ion at m/z 98 should be a cyclohexanone radical ion, which is possibly formed via a novel rearrangement initiated by remote hydrogen rearrangement. Besides long-chain DFEEs, long-chain difunctional carboxylic acids (including dicarboxylic acids, ω-hydroxy acids, diacid monomethyl ester, and diacid monoethyl ester) and DFMEs (including diacid dimethyl ester and ω-hydroxy methyl ester) are also typical of the fragment ion at m/z 98. Hence, it is a common characteristic to form the rearrangement ion at m/z 98 for long-chain difunctional carboxylic acids, DFEEs, and DFMEs, and this special mass spectral rearrangement could facilitate the identification of these classes of compounds. Using this rearrangement rule of DFEEs, three ω-hydroxy ethyl esters, including ethyl 22-hydroxydocosanoate, ethyl 24-hydroxytetracosanoate, and ethyl 26-hydroxyhexacosanoate, were tentatively identified by GC/MS. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, attention was directed at the interactions between Li-doped ZnO systems and rye cereal. The interaction of cereal grains and straws with the transition metal ions is of biochemical importance primarily due to the presence of those complexes in biological systems. Metal/cereal chemistry plays a crucial role in the cross-linking of various biomolecules, and formed systems seem to be promising for various applications, such as material for the production of carbonizate and gaseous substances, which allows for the preparation of second generation biofuels. In the study of cereal/metal complexes, thermogravimetric measurements were performed in order to explain the influence of ZnO and Li2xZn1−xO oxides on the thermal decomposition of rye grains in relation to their application for biofuel production. The possibility of generation of volatile products and carbonizate was considered. The characterization of carbonizate and volatile products was made. The catalytic properties of Li2xZn1−xO phases in the decomposition of cereal grains were confirmed through thermal analysis. The thermal degradation of rye grains was catalyzed by Li-doped ZnO systems. Superior degradation to volatile products depended upon both the botanical origin of the cereal and the catalyzing system. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - African countries are increasingly interested in biofuels to provide access to energy. The development of local technologies using local resources for biodiesel production can be a promising solution. This work is a first step towards the development of a simple process of transesterification of vegetable oil using local resources. The aim of this study is to explore new solid catalysts made of a potassium phase supported on char, for the production of biodiesel by transesterification of vegetable oil with ethanol. Catalysts were prepared by impregnating shea nut shells with four selected potassium precursors KCl, KOH, K2CO3, and KNO3, and then pyrolyzed. The thermal behaviour of the impregnated biomass as well as the potassium crystalline phase in the catalysts were investigated. The effects of the type of potassium precursor, pyrolysis temperature and the amount of catalyst on the conversion of oil to ethyl ester were analyzed. Results showed that increasing pyrolysis temperature enhanced the conversion of oil. Catalysts obtained from KOH and K2CO3 precursors displayed better activity than the other catalysts. The catalytic activity was found to be related to a K2CO3 crystalline phase. For conditions of transesterification at 10 wt% of catalyst, a reaction temperature of 70 °C and only 10 min reaction time, ethyl ester contents were 97.6 wt% for KOH and 99.1 wt% for K2CO3 based catalysts. Both catalysts allowed a good ethyl-ester yield in soft temperature and pressure conditions, and in a short time. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In this study, highly upgraded bio-oil was produced by microwave–metal interaction pyrolysis of water hyacinth biomass. A copper coil was used as a microwave receiver and heat generating antenna. The pyrolysis of biomass was carried out with and without using a cement catalyst. The fractional amounts of the as-produced bio-oil, biogas, and biochar were determined in terms of catalyst mass, reaction time, and the gauge of the copper coil antenna. In cement catalyzed pyrolysis, the water hyacinth was converted into 20% bio-oil and 31% combustible gases with overall conversion efficiency of 66%. In the case of uncatalyzed pyrolysis, the overall conversion efficiency remained below 60% with 10% bio-oil. The biomass to catalyst ratio of 5:1, 25 min of reaction time and 2.5 mm gauge of wire were predicted as optimum conditions for the pyrolysis process. The bio-oil was further analyzed through chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) while the gaseous products were analyzed through chemical testing and combustibility analysis. Significant difference in the chemical composition of the bio-oils, produced using catalytic and noncatalytic microwave–metal interaction pyrolysis, was noticed in these investigations. The oil product of the catalyzed and uncatalyzed pyrolysis contained 11.6% and 9.418% hydrocarbons, respectively. Similarly, oxygen content in the oil was measured about 14.73% and 16.66%, respectively. Also, unlike the thermal or thermo-catalytic pyrolysis, the bio-oil product of the microwave–metal interaction pyrolysis was found immiscible with water. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper investigates thermal conversion of pre-treated pulper reject waste using a Thermo-Catalytic Reforming process (TCR®) for production of biofuels. Approximately 40% of the original feedstock energy was transferred to the solid and liquid energy vectors. The bio-oil organic fraction accounts for approximately 35% of total liquid yield with a HHV of 40.17 MJ/kg. The two most abundant compounds were oleic acid methyl ester (18.90%; C18:1 FAME) and naphthalene (16.23%). The bio-oil exhibits characteristics well suited for blending with fossil fuels. The other products formed was a synthesis gas with hydrogen content of 29.33 vol% which is attractive for hydrogen separation for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, process heating and other high value applications. The gasification of char is also a promising valorisation opportunity. TCR technology was able to tolerate high plastic content in the feedstock and produced a liquid fuel analogue to the fossil fuels, therefore, this paper highlighted the advantages of the TCR technology as a promising route for pulper rejects valorisation to produce energy vectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, there has been a great interest in the conversion of lignocellulosic structures to furfural. There are many technologies available for this process. Nonetheless, the present work reports for the first time the use of pectin, a non-lignocellulosic structure, for furfural production. The pectin was extracted from food industry waste derived from cactuses, orange peels and mangoes peels. The extracted pectins were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR) in order to evaluate the degree of esterification (DE). The high DE influences in the hydrolysis reaction in the following stages: (1) hydration, it allows a fast glycosidic bond cleavage in the polysaccharide. (2) Dehydration, an intermediary step in the furfural production from galacturonic acid. The Maillard reaction herein reported not only is used in a novel way to produce furfural but also it has been modified to be performed in acidic conditions to increase the furfural production rate. From the evaluated reactions, it was found that the highest furfural production was obtained with manila mango pectin (82.6 g/L) with a DE of 51.2%. These findings demonstrate that pectins with DE below 75%, the minimum value to be considered for applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries, could be applied for the generation of furfural, a chemical platform for the production of chemicals and biofuels. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, water hyacinth was converted into highly flammable bio-oil via two-step catalytic pyrolysis. The upgradation of bio-oil was based on the pretreatment of biomass, second-step pyrolysis and use of clinkered material as a catalyst. This three-prong approach was found effective for improving the nature and yield of the oil by lowering the water and oxygen content in the product. The yield of oil was investigated as a function of pyrolysis temperature and weight of the catalyst in addition to pretreatment of biomass. Optimum time for the reaction was also investigated for all three types of biomass. In the preliminary pyrolysis, each of the sample was pyrolyzed into an aqueous liquid, gas, and solid residue fractions. The liquid fraction of each of the sample was separated into combustible and non-combustible liquids in addition to residue using fractional distillation. The residue of the fractional distillation for each of the fresh, putrefied, and microbe-treated biomass was re-pyrolyzed and the gas produced during 1st and 2nd steps of the pyrolysis was analyzed using chemical analysis. The upgraded oils were analyzed for their composition with GC-MS technique. The oil products of the tested samples were significantly differing from each other in terms of nature and number of the compounds. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1836–1844, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Cyclopentanone is an important platform chemical for various industrial syntheses. It has been recently reported as a major product in biomass cellulose-derived biofuels but has rarely been reported in geochemical research. We report here the abundant occurrence of cyclopentanone, 2-cyclopenten-1-one and their alkyl derivatives in pyrolysates of organic-rich shales. Closed system pyrolyses at temperatures from 290 °C to 350 °C have been carried out on thermally immature organic-rich shale samples of Ordovician and Devonian age from Canada. GC–MS analyses of the pyrolysates show that cyclopentanones, 2-cyclopenten-1-ones and phenols dominate over hydrocarbons in the low temperature hydrous pyrolysates, and their abundance relative to hydrocarbons decreases with increasing thermal maturation. However, these low molecular weight cyclic ketones are only minor components compared with hydrocarbons in anhydrous pyrolysates, indicating that water has played an important role in the formation of these oxygen-containing compounds. In addition, n-alkan-2-ones in the range of C6–C35 are also detected in the hydrous pyrolysates, but they are at much reduced concentrations compared with the cyclic ketones. The potential precursors in the shale and the likely chemical reaction mechanism for the formation of these cyclic ketones are discussed in detail in the paper. © 2018

AB  - Two new types of biodiesel were assessed, produced by transesterification of the oil from Annona muricata L. seeds, using basic catalysis with methanol or ethanol, obtaining yields of 91 and 83%, respectively. The values of esters showed that the conversion of the oil into biodiesel was quite high 95.5 and 95.2% for methyl and ethyl biodiesel, respectively, this shows that the transesterification reaction was efficient producing a quality biodiesel. Both types were analyzed according to the parameters set by Brazil’s National Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency (ANP), responsible for overseeing the quality and sale of fuels in the country. These analyses demonstrated that both new products can be used as fuels. No significant quality differences were observed between them. The new biofuels were also assessed when blended with petroleum diesel at different concentrations (up to 30%), presenting excellent results with respect to the parameters set by the ANP. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Pyrolysis is one of the most promising ways to utilize biomass efficiently and massively. This study focuses on the pyrolysis of woody biomass and the densification of the woody chars from different pyrolysis temperatures. The fuel properties of biochar are investigated and characteristics of the derived biochar pellets are explored. Results showed that the calorific value increases from 22.46 to 29.40 MJ/kg. And the organic functional groups of the char decrease gradually as the pyrolysis temperature increased. According to the analysis of the biochar pellets, it shows that the volume density and the compressive strength are all decreased initially and subsequently increase with the increasing temperature. And the energy density of pellets has an obvious improvement. At the pyrolysis temperature of 550 and 650℃, the pyrolytic chars have high heating value, alkali metal content, and the corresponding densified pellets show considerable fuel qualities and combustion properties, which demonstrates more desirable fuel properties as renewable biofuels. © 2018, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

AB  - Biodiesel is a mixture of esters of fatty acids (most often palmitic, stearic and oleic) and lower alcohols (in our work butanol) produced by transesterification. It is a renewable source of energy, prepared from triacylglycerides, which are contained in vegetable oils and animal fats. This work focuses on alkaline catalyzed transesterification of rapeseed oil with butanol and comparison of two catalysts (potassium hydroxide and potassium tert-butoxide). In industry is usually transesterification of rapeseed oil carried out like reaction catalyzed by potassium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide have high content of K2CO3, KHCO3 and water. Moreover water is formed by neutralization of potassium hydroxide with free fatty acids contained in oil. In cause of tert-butoxide catalyzed reaction, it is not possible because tert-butoxide have not a OH− aniont, which is needed for water forming. The influence of various conditions (addition of water, temperature of separation, intensity of stirring and type of catalyst) on butanolysis process was studied for both catalysts. For both catalysts dependence of conversions on time were plotted. When tert-butoxide was used, satisfactory phase separation was not achieved. The only way was separation of hot crude reaction mixture without adding water. Ester formed by this method had high content of free glycerol and soaps, but reached higher conversion. The best results were obtained with KOH and subsequent separation of cold crude reaction mixture with the addition of water and slow stirring. The difference between reactions catalyzed by potassium hydroxide and potassium tert-butoxide was described. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-situ hydrodeoxygenation of a mixture of oxygenated compounds from bio-oil with hydrogen donor over supported multi-metal catalysts was investigated. As most previous in-situ hydrodeoxygenation reports focused on phenols, guaiacol, furfural, and acetic acid, this paper extends the scope to a mixture of oxygenated compounds of not only phenols, guaiacol, furfural and acetic acid, but also of lesser reported hydroxyl -propanone, cyclopentanone aiming at obtaining more liquid fuels. The method of incipient wetness impregnation was used to load the three metals (Zr, Ni, Ir) and Pd on the support of ZSM-5 and C, respectively. The conversion of acetic acid, hydroxyl -propanone, cyclopentanone, guaiacol, furfural, and phenol reached 99.7%, 99.3%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, including the total deoxygenation ratio of 99.6%, the liquid yield (96.5%), and the hydrocarbon yield (86.7%), under the suitable conditions. The sulfur content, the octane number, and the H/C ratio of bio-oil through in-situ hydrodeoxygenation have been improved, and reached 0, 89 and 1.9, respectively. We also speculated reaction pathways of different oxides according to the product distribution over ZrNi/Ir-ZSM-5 and Pd/C. © 2018

AB  - Catalytic hydrothermal conversion of non-edible corn distillers oil (CDO), a low-value by-product of the ethanol industries, into high value fuel-grade hydrocarbons was investigated in near-supercritical water. The decarboxylation experiments were conducted using activated carbon in a 300 mL batch stirred tank reactor at reaction temperatures of 300–400 °C with pressure ranges from 2200–2500 psi (≈15–17 MPa), water/CDO (v/v) ratios of 2:1 to 5:1, and reaction times of 0.5 to 4 h at constant stirring speed (800 rpm). For the first time, complete removal of the −COO− group from CDO was achieved at 400 °C with 4 h of reaction time and a water/CDO (v/v) ratio of 4:1. The liquid products obtained were a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons, mainly C8–C16 (selectivity 49.7 %) and heptadecane (48.9 %) which have similar specific gravity, higher heating value (HHV), cloud points, and pour points to those of commercial fuels. 65 % liquid yield was obtained under optimal reaction conditions. The reaction mechanism was found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics with an activation energy 66.1±3 kJ mol−1, which is much lower than similar reported literature values for the decarboxylation process. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Molecular and biochemical characterization of lignocellulohydrolases cel12B, cel8C, β-glucosidase, and peh28 from Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc) expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) was reported in a previous work. The current preliminary study investigates the enzymes' catalytic performance on Rio-Red grapefruit processing waste (GPW) conversion which can lead to the development of low-cost and effective strategies with strain engineering and/or modified catalysts for production of biofuel precursors. The GPW utilized for the study is known for its low ash and lignin contents compared with corn stover, wheat straw, and sugar cane bagasse, while yielding soluble sugars and polysaccharide constituents proportionally comparable to wastes from other citrus sources. Pretreatment of GPW at 120 °C with 1% w/w NaOH for 15 min resulted in significant total solid losses due primarily to conversion of glucans and lignin. Subsequent enzymatic bioconversion using the recombinant E. coli lignocellulolytic system resulted in production of 24, 11, and 14 g/kg solid biomass for the respective glucose, cellobiose, and galacturonic acid products from GPW over 24 h at 45 °C and pH 5.4. Other sugar products (e.g., xylose, arabinose, galactose, mannose, and rhamnose) were also detectable throughout the catalysis but at lower concentrations compared with the main products. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Oil palm is the major crop grown and cultivated in various Asian countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The core of oil palm trunk (COPT) consists of high sugar content, hence suitable for synthesis of fine chemicals and biofuels. Increase of sugar content was reported previously during prolonged COPT storage. However, until now, there has been no report on protein profiles during storage. Therefore, in this study, protein expression of the COPT during the storage period of one to six weeks was investigated using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) coupled with optical density quantification and multivariate analyses for measuring differentially expressed proteins. Accordingly, protein bands were subjected to tryptic digestion followed by tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) protein identification. The results from SDS-PAGE showed consistent protein bands appearing across the biological replicates ranging from 10.455 to 202.92 kDa molecular weight (MW) regions. The findings from the principal component analysis (PCA) plot illustrated the separation pattern of the proteins at weeks 4 and 5 of storage, which was influenced mainly by the molecular weights of 14.283, 25.543, 29.757, 30.549, 31.511, 34.585 and 84.395 kDa, respectively. The majority of these proteins are identified as those involved in stress- and defense-related, disease resistance, as well as gene/protein expression processes. Indeed, these proteins were mostly upregulated during the later storage period suggesting that long-term storage may influence the molecular regulation of COPT sap. © 2018 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel obtained from different biomass sources and processes. Nowadays, this biofuel has gained importance due to environmental concerns and rising energy demand. In the biodiesel production chain, stability is a critical issue, as it is linked to the maintenance of its original properties. This work performed a study evaluating the influence of storage conditions on the quality aspects of biodiesel. Thus, different samples of biodiesel obtained from soybean and frying oils were produced and placed in containers made by plastic, glass and tin, and stored in presence or absence of an oxidative atmosphere, moisture and light. These samples were analyzed to evaluate the ester content, acidity, iodine value, kinematic viscosity and oxidative stability. The characterization with GC-MS and GC/FID were done aiming to determine the chemical composition. Blends with frying biodiesel into soybean biodiesel have also been produced in concentrations ranging from 1%, 5% and 10% (m/m) in order to evaluate the mixing effect. In the initial storage time, all tested parameters were in accordance to the legislation. Distinct behaviors were identified for each sample according to the container type, being the glass the most effective of them in maintenance of biodiesel characteristics. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Two-stroke petrol engines find wide applications in the areas like chain saws, weed cutters, and power sprayers because of their compactness and higher power to weight ratio. In the present study, the feasibility of using vegetable-based lubricant instead of ordinary mineral 2 T oil is investigated. M15 (85% petrol + 15% methanol) and E15 (85% petrol + 15% ethanol) blend with gasoline are used as the fuel. Experiments were carried out in a two-stroke air-cooled engine equipped with a rope brake dynamometer. It is observed that the vegetable-based lubricant (sunflower oil) is miscible with the tested fuels. The frictional power for the vegetable-based lubricant was found to be less than that of mineral 2 T oil. The brake thermal efficiency improved and the brake-specific fuel consumption decreased for the sunflower oil-based lubricant. The combination of E15 + sunflower oil lubricant exhibited the greatest benefits, raising the brake thermal efficiency by 3.4% and reducing the brake-specific fuel consumption by 1.4%. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were lower for the vegetable-based lubricant than the 2 T mineral oil. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The elemental composition, heating value and water content, are important properties to be characterized for pyrolysis bio-oils, providing information on their quality. These properties are mainly determined according to ASTM standards by using three different analytical techniques requiring time and cost. This research was focused on a simple method to determine the weight content of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and water as well as the heating value, by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) using models based on partial least squares regressions (PLS). Samples were classified into two sets according to Kennard-Stone algorithm. The first set of samples was used to develop the calibration models for each physical parameter, where the number of latent variables was determined by full cross validation procedure. The second set of samples was employed as an external prediction set, assessing the quality of the models. External predictions confirmed that robust models were developed since elemental analysis, heating value and water content of the upgraded biofuels obtained by the catalytic cracking of pyrolysis bio-oil vapors could be determined with good predictive ability with a root mean square error of prediction of carbon content = 0.963 wt.% (R2 = 0.836, range = 70.9–78.8 wt.%), hydrogen content = 0.101 wt.% (R2 = 0.815, range = 8.01-8.75 wt.%), oxygen content = 0.910 wt.% (R2 = 0.873, range = 12.3–20.9 wt.%), water content = 0.416 wt.% (R2 = 0.829, range = 2.79–7.24 wt.%) and heating value = 0.539 MJ kg−1(R2 = 0.874, range = 31.9–36.9 MJ kg−1) by chemometric tools joined to medium infrared spectrum. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The California Regional Multisector Air Quality Emissions (CA-REMARQUE) model is developed to predict changes to criteria pollutant emissions inventories in California in response to sophisticated emissions control programs implemented to achieve deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Two scenarios for the year 2050 act as the starting point for calculations: a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and an 80 % GHG reduction (GHG-Step) scenario. Each of these scenarios was developed with an energy economic model to optimize costs across the entire California economy and so they include changes in activity, fuels, and technology across economic sectors. Separate algorithms are developed to estimate emissions of criteria pollutants (or their precursors) that are consistent with the future GHG scenarios for the following economic sectors: (i) on-road, (ii) rail and off-road, (iii) marine and aviation, (iv) residential and commercial, (v) electricity generation, and (vi) biorefineries. Properly accounting for new technologies involving electrification, biofuels, and hydrogen plays a central role in these calculations. Critically, criteria pollutant emissions do not decrease uniformly across all sectors of the economy. Emissions of certain criteria pollutants (or their precursors) increase in some sectors as part of the overall optimization within each of the scenarios. This produces nonuniform changes to criteria pollutant emissions in close proximity to heavily populated regions when viewed at 4 km spatial resolution with implications for exposure to air pollution for those populations. As a further complication, changing fuels and technology also modify the composition of reactive organic gas emissions and the size and composition of particulate matter emissions. This is most notably apparent through a comparison of emissions reductions for different size fractions of primary particulate matter. Primary PM2.5 emissions decrease by 4 % in the GHG-Step scenario vs. the BAU scenario while corresponding primary PM0.1 emissions decrease by 36 %. Ultrafine particles (PM0.1) are an emerging pollutant of concern expected to impact public health in future scenarios. The complexity of this situation illustrates the need for realistic treatment of criteria pollutant emissions inventories linked to GHG emissions policies designed for fully developed countries and states with strict existing environmental regulations. © Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Palm kernel shell biochars (PKSB) ejected as residues from a gasifier have been used for solid fuel briquette production. With this approach, palm kernel shells can be used for energy production twice: first, by producing rich syngas during gasification; second, by compacting the leftover residues from gasification into high calorific value briquettes. Herein, the process parameters for the manufacture of PKSB biomass briquettes via compaction are optimized. Two possible optimum process scenarios are considered. In the first, the compaction speed is increased from 0.5 to 10 mm/s, the compaction pressure is decreased from 80 Pa to 40 MPa, the retention time is reduced from 10 s to zero, and the starch binder content of the briquette is halved from 0.1 to 0.05 kg/kg. With these adjustments, the briquette production rate increases by more than 20-fold; hence capital and operational costs can be reduced and the service life of compaction equipment can be increased. The resulting product satisfactorily passes tensile (compressive) crushing strength and impact resistance tests. The second scenario involves reducing the starch weight content to 0.03 kg/kg, while reducing the compaction pressure to a value no lower than 60 MPa. Overall, in both cases, the PKSB biomass briquettes show excellent potential as a solid fuel with calorific values on par with good-quality coal.

AB  - A novel and simple electroanalytical method for the determination of Cu2+ in biodiesel samples by stripping voltammetric analysis was developed. The method employs a carbon paste electrode (CPE) modified with Vulcan carbon, previouly functionalized with carbazone (CBZ). The CPE/Vulcan-CBZ sensor promoted a significant increase in the analytical signal obtained from copper as compared to unmodified CPE, and the CPE modified with Vulcan carbon (CPE/ Vulcan). Vulcan-CBZ, Vulcan and CBZ materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technique. The electrochemical behavior of the sensor was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square-wave anodic stripping voltammetric (SWASV) techniques. The CPE/Vulcan-CBZ modified electrode showed excellent response and was able to detect Cu2+ at nanomolar levels. The electrochemical method is based on preconcentration of Cu2+ ions on the CPE/Vulcan-CBZ at 0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl(sat) in 0.2 mol L-1 ammonium sulfate solution ((NH4)2SO4), pH 3.5, during 120 s, followed by subsequent chemical stripping. The analytical signal showed a linear response for Cu2+ concentrations in the range from 6 to 190 nmol L-1 (r = 0.998), with a detection limit of 1.2 nmol L-1. The sensor was successfully applied for the determination of Cu2+ in biodiesel and the average recovery varied between 97.0 and 102.8% for the soybean biodiesel samples and between 109.6 and 111.0% for the babassu biodiesel samples showing a good accuracy for the proposed method. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Environmental and economic concerns resulting from demand for fossil fuels corroborate the need for alternatives to reduce environmental and economic impacts arising from the increasing use of diesel-powered vehicles and machines. The diversification of raw materials used to produce biodiesel can allow the improvement of fuel quality and of emissions resulting from their use in engines. This study evaluated the emission of particulate matter (PM) using biodiesel from soybean and castor bean in diesel/biodiesel mixtures, as well as its viscosity and oxidation stability (prerequisites for quality). For this purpose, biodiesel with different proportions of soybean and castor bean (SyMx) were evaluated, where y and x represent soybean and castor bean biodiesel percentages, respectively: S100M0, S75M25, S50M50, S25M75 and S0M100, mixed with diesel (BX), in the following percentages: 7 (diesel B7), 25 (B25), 40 (B40), 50 (B50), 75 (B75) and 100% (B100). The smoke opacity, viscosity and oxidation stability were determined according to NBR 13037, NBR 10441 and EN 14112, respectively. Among the analyzed mixtures, the commercial diesel (B7) emitted higher amounts of PM, whereas other mixtures, which met the prerequisites for quality (B25 and B40), emitted smaller amounts of PM as increased castor bean biodiesel percentage in mixtures SyMx, as well as with the increase of biodiesel in the mixtures BX. They were also achieved gains in quality as a function of the different compositions SyMx. © 2018 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental.

AB  - The demand for higher output efficiencies, greater specific power output, increased reliability, and ever reduced emissions has been rising. Due to its availability one promising alternative is the use of butanol in internal combustion engines. In this study, the effects of n-butanol addition (5%, 15% and 25% by volume) to diesel fuel on the performance and exhaust emissions of a 6 cylinder four stroke turbocharged direct injection CI Diesel engine were investigated using GT-Power computational simulation tool. The simulations were performed by varying the engine speed between 1000 and 2000 rpm at four different loads of brake mean effective pressure (bmep) (4.5, 8.5, 10.5 and 12.75 bar). The performance and exhaust emissions of the engine when working with the three butanol-diesel blends were compared with neat diesel fuel. The results showed that the butanol-diesel blends reduced carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) by about 40% and 70% respectively, However carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions increased. It was also found that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) improved by more than 20% for butanol diesel blends when compared with the corresponding diesel fuel. Due to its optimum values in terms of emission and performance parameters 15% butanol-diesel blend was found to be the best choice. © 2018 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC).All Recived.

AB  - As a renewable energy, biofuel has greatly attracted worldwide attention due to the growing demands for cleaner sources of energy as an intervention to mitigate the serious environmental problems associated with fossil fuel consumption. As an important non-food biodiesel plant, Pistacia chinensis has a promising prospect for bioenergy development. Based on the principles of multifactor integrated assessment, this paper provides an operational method for comprehensively evaluating the marginal land resources suitable for developing the plantation of Pistacia chinensis in Shaanxi province, China. The results show that the areas of marginal land resources suitable and fairly suitable for growing Pistacia chinensis in Shaanxi province are 1.21 million hectares and 4.45 million hectares, respectively. The suitable land resources are mainly located in Hanzhong (0.44 million hectares), Ankang (0.30 million hectares), and Shangluo (0.31 million hectares), most of which are moderate dense grassland (accounting for 50.65%), dense grassland (accounting for 21.83%), shrub land (accounting for 8.62%), and sparse forest land (accounting for 15.32%). The comparison between the results and field work data suggests that the pixel size of spatial data and soil organic matter content have important impacts on the final results. The outcome of this research can be used to implement specific policies for developing Pistacia chinensis in China and other countries especially the countries along the Silk Road.

AB  - A non-thermal plasma synergistic catalytic system was established, which was used in bio-oil upgrading catalyzed by Zn/HZSM-5. Effects of three-way catalysis (including non-thermal plasma, HZSM-5 and a Zn modified component) on bio-oil quality and catalyst coking were analyzed. The results show that the three-way catalysis reduces the yield of refined bio-oil, but improves its physicochemical properties. Oxygen content, pH kinematic viscosity and gross caloric value are 16.45%, 5.00, 5.10 mm2·s-1 and 34.25 MJ·kg-1, respectively. The synergistic action of non-thermal plasma discharge enhances the deoxidization performance of Zn/HZSM-5. Both content and composition of alkane in refined bio-oil are improved. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are significantly reduced and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are increased. The coking resistance of Zn/HZSM-5 is enhanced, but low effective hydrogen to carbon ratio of reactants makes it difficult to have substantial improvement in catalytic stability. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate raw material to improve hydrogen contents, which can be effectively transferred and utilized in the process of catalytic upgrading. © 2018, Editorial Board of “Journal of Chemical Engineering of Chinese Universities”.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuel reserves and environmental issue have led to the development of biofuels. Plant derived oil, such as palm oil, has been claimed as one of the promising source of renewable energy. However, high oxygen content in palm oil makes it unsuitable to be directly used as fuel. In the present study, the performance of Ni/ZSM-5, Mo/ZSM-5 and NiMo/ZSM-5 catalysts was investigated in catalytic cracking of used vegetable oil (UVO) into green fuel. The catalytic cracking reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 4 hour-1(WHSV), continuously for 3 hours. Conversions of the two major fatty acids: palmitic acid (84.72%) and stearic acid (74.10%) were found highest at 350 °C with Mo/ZSM-5. The optimum palmitic acid and stearic acid conversion with Mo/ZSM-5 were found at 400 °C. Comparison study was also done with Pd/Al2O3 at 400 °C for its performance in catalytic cracking of UVO. Similar conversion for palmitic acid was obtained for Mo/ZSM-5 (84.72%) and Pd/Al2O3 (86.37%) at steady state. However, system with Mo/ZSM-5 as catalyst approached steady state earlier at 60 mins compared to that of Pd/Al2O3 at 120 minutes. © 2018, Malaysian Society of Analytical Sciences.

AB  - In this article an economical, efficient and eco-friendly method developed for the catalytic synthesis of biodiesel is presented. Honeycomb monoliths were coated with zirconia (ZrO2) and its modified forms such as Mo (VI)/ZrO2, Cr (VI)/ZrO2 Ca (II)/ZrO2 and Ba (II)/ZrO2 by using dip and dry method. These catalytic materials were characterized for their physico-chemical properties such as surface acidity, surface basicity, crystalinity, functionality, morphology and elemental analysis. ZrO2, Mo (VI)/ZrO2 and Cr (VI)/ZrO2 coated on honeycombs were used as solid acid catalysts for the esterification of Milletia pinnata oil with methanol to reduce the percentage of free fatty acids. ZrO2, Ca (II)/ZrO2 and Ba (II)/ZrO2 were used as solid base catalysts for the transesterification of esterified Milletia pinnata oil with methanol to synthesize biodiesel. The catalysts were also prepared in their powder forms and their catalytic activities were compared with that of their honeycomb coated forms. The effect of reactivation and reusability of catalytic materials on their catalytic activity is also discussed. It was observed that a two-fold increase in the catalytic activity of honeycomb coated forms was obtained when compared to the powder form of the catalysts. © 2018 Scientific Publishers.

AB  - In recent years, research on noncatalytic methods for biodiesel production has increased, mainly processes under supercritical conditions that allow the processing of waste vegetable oils (WVO) without the need to use catalysts, where the absence of catalyst simplifies the processes of purification of biodiesel. The high consumption of alcohol and energy to maintain the appropriate conditions of pressure and temperature of the reaction has turned the processes of supercritical conditions into an unfeasible method. However, the stages of biodiesel purification and methanol recovery are more straightforward, allowing the reduction of the total energy consumption by 25% compared to alkaline methods. Therefore, the present work describes a study through Aspen Plus® of the production of biodiesel by a process in supercritical conditions with WVO as raw material. Also, a solar collector arrangement was structured using the TRNSYS® simulator to supply energy to the process. To evaluate the economic feasibility of the proposed process, the installation of a pilot plant in Mexicali, Baja California, was considered. The internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) were determined for ten-year period. The planned system allows supplying solar energy, 69.5% of the energy required by the process, thus reducing the burning of fossil fuels and the operation cost. Despite the additional investment cost, for the solar collectors, the process manages to maintain a competitive production cost of USD 0.778/l of biodiesel. With an IRR of 31.7%, the investment is recovered before the fifth year of operation. The integration and implementation of clean technologies are vital in the development of the biofuels.

AB  - The energy recovery from sludge, taken from an industrial yeast production wastewater treatment plants, via the gasification process was investigated. The gasification potential of the yeast industry sludge due to its rich organic content was determined. The gasification process is a thermal conversion technology transforming the chemical energy contained in a solid fuel into thermal energy and electricity. The produced syngas as a mixture of CO, CH4, H2, and other gases can be used to generate electrical energy. A downdraft gasification reactor was used at pilot scale during the experimental studies. Results showed that approximately, 1 kWh electrical power was generated for 1 kg yeast sludge used. Experimental studies showed that the yeast industry sludge having rich organic content could be used for energy recovery purpose via gasification.

AB  - The drive to improve efficiency and to reduce emissions (including greenhouse gases) from internal-combustion engines has significant ramifications for fuel properties. Deployment of improved engines is aided by the wide availability of well-defined fuels, sometimes with more stringent specification of properties such as the sulphur content and the vaporisation and combustion characteristics (e.g. the octane rating). Fuel regulation has also led to the inclusion of low-carbon fuel components such as ethanol and biodiesel in mainstream road fuels. These trends will probably continue over the next few decades, and so it is important to understand their implications for commercial-scale fuel production and distribution. This paper provides a technical explanation of the linkages between the properties of commercial-scale fuels, the technologies used to make them and the ‘landscape’ of the fuels industry (e.g. the distribution systems and the interlinked markets for non-fuel products and energy). Industrially relevant examples are used to explain how the refining industry has adapted, and is still adapting, to the changes in the sulphur and volatility specifications, the mandated biocontent and the changes in engine technology. This paper is not intended to make a case for any specific type of fuel but does aim to explain the principles by which refined fuels can be adapted to meet future specifications or to work in conjunction with alternative fuel components. It covers current issues such as the lower sulphur content, the increased biocontent and the emerging theme of higher-octane-number gasoline as a route to a higher engine efficiency. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.

AB  - A novel ordered mesoporous catalyst was prepared from rice husk (MRH catalyst) through condensation–evaporation method in alkaline media. The process used cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a structure-directing agent (template) and sulfonated biochar obtained from partial rice husk carbonization (SBRH) as precursor. Various parameters such as temperature and CTAB/SBRH mass ratios were investigated to improve the mesoporous structure. The chosen catalyst was based on its degree of order of the mesoporous channels, and its activity was also tested in the methanolysis of linseed oil to methyl esters which was considered as a valuable blending composition for commercial jet fuels. The results showed that the temperature and CTAB/SBRH mass ratio should be of 70 °C and 0.3/1, respectively. The catalyst samples were characterized by many techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ammonia-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). The methyl ester composition of the as-synthesized biofuel was determined using gas chromatography supported by mass spectroscopy detector (GC–MS). The results of the characterizations showed that the catalyst possessed superacidic sites (NH3-TPD) caused by –SO3H groups (confirmed by FT-IR analysis) and ordered mesoporous structure (XRD). The mesoporous channel distribution was also observed by TEM images. The methanolysis yield reached 93.5% (calculated through GC–MS analysis) at mild conditions with high purity of methyl ester products strongly proving the catalyst activity and selectivity. © 2017, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Biomass and shale/natural gas will be two important alternative resources for fuel and chemical production for at least the next century. Bio-oil, deriving from the fast pyrolysis of lignin, is a key second generation biofuel, containing high oxygen content. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is typically employed to improve the quality of bio-oils, while the high cost of hydrogen prevents its commercialization. On the other hand, although it is the primary component of shale and natural gas, methane direct conversion to higher hydrocarbons has remained a challenge since the 1980s. Following our recent work, in the present study, methane is used to upgrade guaiacol, a well-known model compound of bio-oils, over Pt-Bi bimetallic catalysts supported on activated carbon (AC). Various characterization techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), H2 temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD), H2-O2 titration, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), were utilized to obtain catalyst structure and properties. It was found that as compared to the Pt catalyst, Pt-Bi bimetallic catalysts exhibited relatively stable (no significant deactivation) guaiacol upgrading performance for 8 h TOS (time on stream), generating partially deoxygenated products along with ethane. The addition of Bi suppresses coke formation, improving catalyst stability. The isotopic labeling tests demonstrate that ethane is produced either from coupling of two methane molecules (20-25%) or from a methane molecule combining with a methyl from guaiacol (75-80%). © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Grate firing is one of the main competing technologies in biomass combustion for steam and electricity generation. Ash generated in the furnace during combustion process would greatly reduce the boiler thermal performance and may lead to unscheduled shutdown. The focus of this study is to optimize the combustion characteristics of the mixture of palm kernel shell (PKS) and selected additives (Al2O3, MgO and CaO) to develop a fuel mixture of low ash yield and higher heating value (HHV). D-Optimal Design under Cross Methodology of Design Expert (6.08) was employed to mix the components alongside various particle sizes. The mixed samples were ashed in a muffle furnace (848 K) to a constant weight and their HHV were determined using Ballistic Bomb Calorimeter. Combustion test based on optimized PKS additive mixture was conducted with a 5 kW grate furnace from which the effects of varying the ratio of primary to secondary air flow rate on temperatures and flue gas compositions from the furnace were measured. The ash obtained after combustion process was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the purpose of identifying the mineral phase compounds that are present in PKS and PKS-additive ash. The optimum composition obtained for the process was 2.5, 0.0, 5.0, 92.5% and 5.50 mm for additives (Al2O3, MgO, CaO), PKS and particle size, respectively. The composition resulted in lowest ash yield (0.56%) and HHV (20.64 kJ/g). The coefficient of determination (R2) (0.7951 and 0.7344) and least-square errors (0.19 and 0.024) of the prediction model indicated a close fitness to the experiment results obtained for ash yield and HHV. Primary to secondary air ratio of (40:60) recorded maximum temperature (1058 K), minimum level of CO (285 ppm) and 6% oxygen. XRD results showed excellent interaction between PKS and additives. The appearance of potassium-alumino silicate (KAlSiO4) in the PKS-additive ash prevented the release of potassium chloride which has the ability to increase ash deposition and corrosion. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - A critical challenge for the bioenergy research community has been producing drop-in hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals at yields sufficient to compete with their petroleum-derived counterparts. Biological production of highly reduced compounds poses fundamental challenges. Conversely, glucose, xylose, and sucrose can be fermented to ethanol at near-theoretical yields. Just as olefin crackers are often considered a gateway for petrochemical complexes that produce an array of downstream products, catalytic ethanol upgrading can potentially enable an entire biorefining complex able to produce renewable, low-carbon fuels and chemicals. By doping the Ta2O5/SiO2 catalyst with different transition metals, we show that Ostromyslensky catalysts can be utilized for direct conversion of ethanol to varying ratios of 1,3-butadiene (1,3-BD), dietheylether (DEE), and ethylene. These results are integrated into the first comprehensive analysis of ethanol conversion to 1,3-BD, DEE, and ethylene that incorporates empirical data with chemical process modeling and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) assessment. We find that the suite of products can replace conventional rubber, plastics, and diesel, achieving as much as a 150% reduction in GHG-intensity relative to fossil pathways (net carbon sequestration). Selecting the route with the greatest ethylene and DEE output can maximize total potential emission reductions. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the crambe oil by using a commercial immobilized lipase Lipozyme RM IM was evaluated. The effect of the operational conditions, such as temperature, water/oil molar ratio, enzyme/substrate mass ratio and stirring speed were assessed based on the experimental designs. The experiments were performed in a closed and batch system with controlled temperature and stirring speed. In addition, the kinetics of the process was studied in the best operational conditions, wherein the experimental data were obtained and described by a mathematical model. The influence of the operational conditions was assessed based on the measured values of the free fatty acids (FFA) produced by the enzymatic hydrolysis. In 4 h of reaction, a yield of 42.6% was observed and the most significant operational conditions were the enzyme/substrate mass ratio and stirring speed. By the kinetic investigation, an initial reaction rate of 3.5 × 104 mol mL−1 h−1 and a maximum yield of 74% were observed after 40 h of reaction (in the equilibrium condition). The mathematical model was not only able to adequately describe the experimental data of FFA concentrations profiles but also showed predictive capacity to independents assays in different operational conditions. Therefore, based on the simulation analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the crambe oil, the model can be useful for process optimization and phenomenological studies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study investigated the biological conversion of crude glycerol generated from a commercial biodiesel production plant as a by-product to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD). Statistical analysis was employed to derive a statistical model for the individual and interactive effects of glycerol, (NH4)2SO4, trace elements, pH, and cultivation time on the four objectives: 1,3-PD concentration, yield, selectivity, and productivity. Optimum conditions for each objective with its maximum value were predicted by statistical optimization, and experiments under the optimum conditions verified the predictions. In addition, by systematic analysis of the values of four objectives, optimum conditions for 1,3-PD concentration (49.8 g/L initial glycerol, 4.0 g/L of (NH4)2SO4, 2.0 mL/L of trace element, pH 7.5, and 11.2 h of cultivation time) were determined to be the global optimum culture conditions for 1,3-PD production. Under these conditions, we could achieve high 1,3-PD yield (47.4%), 1,3-PD selectivity (88.8%), and 1,3-PD productivity (2.1/g/L/h) as well as high 1,3-PD concentration (23.6 g/L). © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The aging properties of phenol-formaldehyde resin modified by bio-oil (BPF) were analyzed using ultraviolet (UV) weathering. The variations on bonding strength of BPF were measured, and the changes on microstructure, atomic composition and chemical structure of BPF were characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), respectively. With the increase of aging time, the bonding strength decreased gradually, the resin surface became rougher and the O/C radio of resin surface increased. However, the loss rate of bonding strength of BPFs was 9.6-23.0% lower than that of phenol-formaldehyde resin (PF) after aging 960 h. The aging degree of BPF surfaces was smaller in comparison to PF at the same aging time. These results showed that the bio-oil had a positive effect on the anti-aging property. Analytical results revealed that with increasing the aging time, the XPS peak area of C-C/C-H decreased, while that of C=O and O-C=O increased. The intensity of methylene and ether bridges in NMR analysis decreased along with increasing the intensity of aldehydes, ketones, acids and esters. These results indicated that the aging mechanism of BPF was a process of the breakage of molecular chains and formation of oxygen-containing compounds. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Functional monoacylglycerols (MAG) synthesis is an attractive topic not only due to it transforms biofuel industry by-products into high value-added fine chemicals, but also because of abundant applications and large demands of MAG. With efforts for decades, triacylglycerols (TAG) transesterification with glycerol has been experimental studied at a wide temperature range from ambient temperature about 303 K to elevated temperature more than 500 K with various discrete temperatures or small temperature ranges. What's more, the temperature influences on thermodynamics mechanisms of TAG transesterification with glycerol is a crucial issue but regrettably a gap so far. Therefore, in this paper, a new thermodynamics model is proposed for MAG synthesis predictions. To verify its performances, it is compared with four available and reliable models from literatures and further validated by experimental data. As the most suitable and precise one, proposed new model was used for thermodynamics mechanism analysis. The bottleneck of MAG productivity improvement was found as the second step reaction transforming diacylglycerols (DAG) to MAG due to its non -spontaneity in forward direction. The boundary in 500 K was identified and proposed for the first time as potential restriction to increase MAG productivity. The influences of temperature are more pronounced and conducive for high MAG yield at reaction temperature greater than 500 K. Moreover, a series of kinetic experiments of glycerolysis with OFATG at 473 K–533 K achieved rapidly increase of MAG at about 500 K in a catalyst free system, which verified those conclusions from mechanism analysis in front. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aging performance of bio-oil phenol-formaldehyde (BPF) resin was investigated using artificial accelerated aging method. After the treatment, the variations on the mass and bonding strength of plywood with BPF resin were determined. The changes in the microstructure, functional groups, and chemical bonds of adhesive films with BPF resin were also analyzed by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The decrease of mass loss and bonding strength of BPF resin were smaller, the surface of BPF resin was smoother, and the amounts of CH2 groups and COC groups of BPF resin were larger than that of phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin at the same aged period. These results indicated that the bio-oil could be used to improve the aging performance of PF resin. POLYM. ENG.

AB  - This research work examined how biodiesel produced from frying oils affects the physicochemical properties of its mixtures with conventional heating oil. Through the characterization of biodiesel blends and heating oil, the purpose is to produce an improved heating oil that will meet the specifications of the existing legislation for heating oil, while positively contributing to reducing the production of pollutants. The percentage of biodiesel added to a conventional diesel fuel contributes to the reduction of the pollutants produced during combustion. The examined biodiesel is considered the residual product, which was produced at a factory in Cyprus, and was deemed unsuitable for export, because it does not meet the legal requirements. Using specific volumes of these mixtures, twelve parameters were determined in order to investigate the effect of the mixtures: kinematic viscosity, sulfur content, micro carbon residue (MCR), distillation curves, density, cloud point (CP), fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) content, heat of combustion, iodine value (IV), cetane index (CI) after distillation, oxidation stability, and cold filter plugging point (CFPP). A number of fuel properties including the kinematic viscosity, MCR, distillation temperature—up to 80% distillate—and density showed an increase as the percentage of FAMEs raised from 2.5 to 50%, while others showed a mixed behavior (e.g., IV, CP, CI, CFPP), and the rest an inverse trend (e.g., sulfur content, heat of combustion and oxidation stability). An efficient potential utilization of a residual domestic product is proposed, while the pollutants that accumulate on the urban atmospheres during the winter months, due to increased heating needs of homes and other public or private buildings, will be significantly reduced. © 2018 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The growing concerns over the environmental challenges emanating from the use of fossil fuels continue to generate interest in finding competitive and sustainable alternatives. This study presents physicochemical characteristics, thermal decomposition profile and kinetics of a new Botryococcus sp. of microalga isolated from Endau-Rompin, Malaysia. The proximate and ultimate analyses were carried out using standard analytical techniques. Thermogravimetric study was conducted in nitrogen atmosphere using a thermogravimetric analyser coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The result revealed that the feedstock has high volatile matter (86.74 wt%) and calorific value of 17.18 MJ/kg. The thermal decomposition of the alga sample proceeded via dehydration, decomposition of extractives, hemicellulose, other carbohydrates and lipid evaporation. The kinetics of the alga sample evaluated using a distributed activation energy model showed that the model sufficiently described the pyrolysis of the feedstock with activation energy of 52.72–159.16 kJ/mol. The chemical composition of the evolved gas revealed high content of hydrocarbons, products of carbohydrate and protein decomposition. This suggests that the alga sample is a good candidate for production of valuable precursors for biofuel processing and production of biochemicals. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Bio-jet fuel is increasingly attracting attention in attempts to reduce the environmental impacts of aviation fuels. Feedstocks like camelina, jatropha and algae have been extensively studied, and exhibit fair performance in producing low-density hydrocarbon biofuels, mainly from triglyceride lipids. Grindelia squarrosa is a promising feedstock since the primary diterpenoid, grindelic acid with the branched tricyclic structure, is the major component in its biocrude. Herein, a heterogeneous bi-functional catalyst, palladium with the reductive properties supported on tungstate zirconia with acidic properties and good stability in hydrothermal media, was used for the conversion of Grindelia squarrosa biocrude to potential bio-jet fuels. Different solid acid catalyst supports and a variety of reaction conditions, such as temperature, catalyst loading, hydrogen pressure, and reaction time, were systematically investigated. At the optimum conditions, the oxygen content deceased from 18.1 % in the Grindelia squarrosa biocrude feedstock to 5.6 % in the final product, and is ready for further industrial treatment. The upgrading method utilized in this work can produce jet fuel precursors for synthesizing high-density cyclic hydrocarbons. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The solubility and crystallisability of a range of binary mixtures of n-hexadecane (C16H34) and n-octadecane (C18H38), as the predominant alkanes present in hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), from three representative fuel solutions (dodecane, toluene and kerosene) is presented. The dissolution (saturation) and crystallisation (supersaturation) points of the solutions are measured using poly-thermal methods utilising turbidometric detection over four concentrations from (192 g/l to 400 g/l). The data reveals the existence of more soluble, less stable crystal structures that form from the alkane mixtures, when compared to the stable triclinic crystal structures formed from the single solute component solutions. An increased carbon chain length results in lower solubility for all three solvents and the solvent type is not found to have any significant effect on the solid forms produced from the mixtures. van't Hoff analysis reveals the solvent type to influence the solute solubility with the closest to ideal behaviour being dodecane followed by kerosene and toluene, respectively. This finding is further supported by the calculated dissolution enthalpies and activity coefficients, which are the lowest in dodecane followed by kerosene and toluene. Larger values of activity coefficients are observed for compositions with molar fraction (y) = 0.1, 0.5–0.7 C18H38 which reflect the complex multi-phase formation in the solutions when compared with the more simple binary melt crystallisation system. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - This study reports the synthesis, physicochemical characterization by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and solid-state MAS NMR (1H, 23Na, 29Si and 119Sn MAS NMR) of a metallo-stannosilicate and its application as a heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production via ethanolysis and methanolysis routes using edible, non-edible an waste oils as feedstocks. XRD characterization of the metallo-stannosilicate has revealed a typical structure of mixed octahedral-pentahedral-tetrahedral material with an orthorhombic unit cell (a = 14.522°C, b = 12.469°C, and c = 10.654°C). 119Sn single-pulse MAS NMR results presented two resonance lines, at δ1 =-683.8 ppm and δ2 =-690.9 ppm, which were assigned to the tin octahedrally coordinated in the metallo-stannosilicate structure. Heterogenous catalytic studies in the transesterification of refined edible, non-edible, and waste oils have resulted in high yields of FAMEs and FAEEs (fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters), nevertheless the highest FAMES (98.2%) and FAEEs (96.6%) yields were obtained for non-edible microalgae oil extracted from the genetically modified heterotrophic algal strain Prototheca moriformis. Catalytic studies also using non-edible macaw palm oil (Acrocomia aculeata) with a high content of free fatty acids (FFAs) demonstrated that the catalyst could simultaneously perform esterification and transesterification reactions. These findings indicate the potential application of this novel metallo-stannosilicate in the production of renewable and environmentally clean biofuels, like biodiesel, using different sources of lipids feedstocks, notably those that do not compete with food production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fatty acid esters (methyl and ethyl) prepared from babassu nut oil were blended with the respective esters from soybean oil. These binary blends (babassu:soybean) were made in proportions of 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, and 50:50 (vol%). The ester content of all the blends was higher than 96.5%, which is the minimum value required by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis, ANP). The thermal properties of the babassu, soybean and binary mixtures of esters were investigated by thermogravimetry-differential thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal stability of the blended biodiesels decreased as the total contents of the babassu esters increased. From the experiments it was found that babassu methanol biodiesel is stable up to 49.6 °C and the ethanol biodiesel is stable up to 53.7 °C in air. The methyl esters blends were thermally stable up to 83.2 and 56.8 °C, for 90:10 and 50:50 blends (soybean:babassu), respectively. The ethyl ester blends presented values of temperature ranges somewhat higher than the methyl esters, such as 85.2 and 64.5 °C for 90:10 and 50:50 blends, respectively. The esters from babassu oil have satisfactory performance at low temperatures with respect to the point of crystallization, which were below-9.8 °C for ethylic esters and-8.5 °C for methylic esters. A good correlation between the crystallization onset temperature and the increase in the concentration of the babassu oil esters was obtained in the mixtures analyses. In the 50:50 combination (babassu:soybean), the crystallization onset temperature were-6.73 and-9.12 °C for methyl and ethyl esters, respectively.

AB  - In this paper, various carbon materials such as activated carbons and mesoporous carbon material CMK-3 modified with nickel and copper, are investigated in the production of a potential biofuel 2-methylfuran with furfural hydrotreatment. Deep characterization of the prepared catalysts revealed differences in pore size, surface area, and metal particle size. Furthermore, the acidity of the catalysts varied significantly affecting the product distribution. Very high activity and selectivity towards 2-methylfuran was achieved with two steam activated carbons (Norit RB4C and Darco) and ordered mesoporous carbon material CMK-3 modified with copper and nickel. 2-Methylfuran yield as high as 60.2% was achieved with 5/5 wt% CuNi/RB4C in 2 h at 230 °C. The operation in slurry phase was observed to promote the reaction towards 2-methylfuran. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Unimolecular reactions of alkylperoxy(ROO•), hydroperoxyalkyl(•QOOH), and hydroperoxyalkylperoxy(•OOQOOH) radicals of 2-butanone, which is a potential biofuel molecule, have been studied computationally. These radicals are responsible for the chain branching at low temperature oxidation and play a significant role in modeling the autoignition. The composite CBS-QB3 method was used to study the thermochemistry and energetics of all the species involved. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were carried out for all the transition states along various reaction pathways. All the possible reactions like H-migration, •OH elimination, and HO• 2 elimination reactions were studied for these radicals. It was found that, the isomerization of •OOQOOH to HOOQOO• is the most favorable channel, which involves 8- and 9-membered cyclic transition states. However, the decomposition pathway involves the H-migration from carbon to oxygen. The mechanism for the decomposition of all •OOQOOH radicals with their potential energy level diagrams are reported. The temperature dependent rate coefficients were also studied using Canonical Variational Transition state theory (CVT) with small curvature tunneling (SCT) in the temperature range of 400-1500 K, which is relevant to the combustion. Thermodynamic parameters for all the reactions involved were calculated. The high barrier (1,3 H-migration) reactions were found to be exothermic and spontaneous, which is unexpected. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Abstract: Different amount of boron-modified Ni/Mo2C were synthesized, characterized and tested during the hydrogenation of alkali lignin, to evaluate the effect of boron on the Ni promoted behavior. xB–Ni/Mo2C (x = 0.5, 1, 3, 5) is found to enhance the lignin conversion and bio-oil yield at the same time, and the highest bio-oil yield was obtained with 1B–Ni/Mo2C (63.8%), under the optimum reaction condition (2 MPa H2, 290 °C and 2 h). Characteristic results of BET method, ICP-OES, XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM, XPS, H2-TPR and NH3/CO2/CO-TPD indicate the improved catalytic performance comes from strong interaction between boron and nickel species, which results in improved surace area, highly dispersed Ni particles, increased acidic sites, thus favors cleavage of the C–O and C–C bonds. A possible reaction mechanism was also present based on the catalytic system.

AB  - The utilization of renewable biomass resources play an important role in solving the energy crisis and reducing environmental pollution. Along this background, the production of furan-based chemicals from lignocellulose becomes one of the research focuses in biorefinery. Furfural is the key furan-based building block, which is manufactured from hemicellulose fraction directly, and offers a promising, rich platform for lignocellulosic biofuels and value-added chemicals. So it is of great practical significance to develop green technologies for the production of furfural and the conversion of furfural to primary furan-based chemicals. In this review, the formation routes and catalytic conversion of hemicellulose into furfural were summarized with special attentions on the heterogeneous acid-catalysts for the production of furfural in the liquid phase, including zeolites, metal oxides, ion-exchange resins, clays and carbon materials. The formation routes and technologies starting from furfural to various furan-based chemicals, including furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, furan, tetrahydrofuran, were reviewed. © 2018, Editorial Board of «Chemistry and Industry of Forest Products».

AB  - Biofuels are an alternative to fossil fuels and can be made from many different raw materials. The use of distinct catalyst and production processes, feedstocks, and types of alcohol results in biofuels with different physical and chemical properties. Even though these diverse options for biodiesel production are considered advantageous, they may pose a setback when quality specifications are considered, since different properties are subject to different reactions during usage, storage and handling. In this work, we present a systematic characterization of biodiesels to investigate how accelerated thermal degradation affects fuel properties. Two different types of biodiesel, commercially obtained from distinct feedstocks, were tested. The thermal degradation process was performed by maintaining the temperature of the sample at 140∘C under constant air flux for different times: 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h. Properties such as density, viscosity, activation energy, volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, gross caloric value, acid value, infrared absorption, and temperature coefficient of the refractive index were used to study the thermal degradation of the biodiesel samples. The results show a significant difference in fuel properties before and after the thermal degradation process suggesting the formation of undesirable compounds. All the properties mentioned above were found to be useful to determine whether a biodiesel sample underwent thermal degradation. Moreover, viscosity and acid value were found to be the most sensitive characteristics to detect the thermal degradation process. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A 3-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is presented to understand the influence of periodic operation in single phase packed bed reactors (PBRs). Unit cell approach is adopted to represent the packed bed with spherical particles having face centered cubic (FCC) and modified simple cubic (SC) packing arrangements. Three different on-off and min-max flow splits are analyzed and compared for single phase liquid flow operation. Comparison of results reveals the benefit of periodic mode in terms of homogeneous velocity distribution than that of the continuous mode operation. The effect is more pronounced at higher split ratios for FCC, and vice versa for modified SC arrangement. Moreover, on-off operation in both packing orientations exhibited a relatively better flow homogeneity as compared to min-max mode. Liquid distribution analysis indicates the improvement in flow homogeneity at the expense of a higher pressure drop in periodic operation. Single phase flow in packed beds finds several applications in heat transfer and reaction processes. This study essentially demonstrates the potential benefits of periodic operation to obtain homogeneous liquid distribution in packed beds with cubic close packing, which is of paramount importance in improving overall reactor performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Harnessing the metabolic potential of uncultured microbial communities is a compelling opportunity for the biotechnology industry, an approach that would vastly expand the portfolio of usable feedstocks. Methane is particularly promising because it is abundant and energy-rich, yet the most efficient methane-activating metabolic pathways involve mixed communities of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria. These communities oxidize methane at high catabolic efficiency and produce chemically reduced by-products at a comparable rate and in near-stoichiometric proportion to methane consumption. These reduced compounds can be used for feedstock and downstream chemical production, and at the production rates observed in situ they are an appealing, cost-effective prospect. Notably, the microbial constituents responsible for this bioconversion are most prominent in select deep-sea sediments, and while they can be kept active at surface pressures, they have not yet been cultured in the lab. In an industrial capacity, deep-sea sediments could be periodically recovered and replenished, but the associated technical challenges and substantial costs make this an untenable approach for full-scale operations. In this study, we present a novel method for incorporating methanotrophic communities into bioindustrial processes through abstraction onto low mass, easily transportable carbon cloth artificial substrates. Using Gulf of Mexico methane seep sediment as inoculum, optimal physicochemical parameters were established for methane-oxidizing, sulfide-generating mesocosm incubations. Metabolic activity required >∼40% seawater salinity, peaking at 100% salinity and 35 °C. Microbial communities were successfully transferred to a carbon cloth substrate, and rates of methane-dependent sulfide production increased more than threefold per unit volume. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that carbon cloth-based communities were substantially streamlined and were dominated by Desulfotomaculum geothermicum. Fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy with carbon cloth fibers revealed a novel spatial arrangement of anaerobic methanotrophs and sulfate reducing bacteria suggestive of an electronic coupling enabled by the artificial substrate. This system: 1) enables a more targeted manipulation of methane-activating microbial communities using a low-mass and sediment-free substrate; 2) holds promise for the simultaneous consumption of a strong greenhouse gas and the generation of usable downstream products; and 3) furthers the broader adoption of uncultured, mixed microbial communities for biotechnological use. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The endo-1,5-α-L-arabinanases (ABNases) belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH43) and hydrolyse α-1,5-arabinofuranosidic bonds in arabinose-containing polysaccharides by an inverting mechanism. ABNases are key enzymes involved in hemicellulose degradation with various applications in food technology, organic synthesis and biofuel production. Here, the reaction mechanism of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus GH43 ABNases has been investigated using density functional theory method. To probe the role of the pKa modulators (Ser164 and Tyr229) in the reaction, two different orientations of a catalytic acid (Glu201) with respect to the position of these residues are considered. The results show that the orientation involving a hydrogen bond network (Ser164•••Glu201•••Tyr229) is energetically more favourable, compared to the other one (Ser164•••Glu201), with a barrier of 13.6 kcal mol−1, consistent with the experimental data. Our calculations also give support to a single displacement mechanism proposed in the literature where the protonation of glycosidic bond and a nucleophilic attack by a catalytic water occur in a concerted but asynchronous manner. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The use of large pore size catalyst with high surface area is explored in this work by using KIT-6 silica-based mesoporous material for the conversion of glycerol to higher hydrocarbons. Palladium and alumina were incorporated into the KIT-6 for providing Lewis acid sites and removal of oxygen. A decrease in surface area and pore diameter was observed with the incorporation of alumina and palladium on KIT-6. Ethanol was used as diluent as glycerol is viscous in nature and has issues related to flow in the preheater. An increase in the conversion was observed from 78 to 93.7% with the increase in temperature from 400 to 700 °C; however, the liquid yield was observed to decrease above 600 °C. GC (FID) analysis showed that the maximum values (38.9%) for gasoline range hydrocarbons fraction were obtained at 550 °C. No significant effect was observed on the liquid-phase yield with the addition of palladium; however, it was observed that the liquid product obtained in the presence of palladium has higher H/C ratio, indicating the formation of paraffinic compounds and removal of oxygen. GC/MS analysis showed the presence of mostly oxygenated long-chain hydrocarbons. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Lewis acidic and/or basic sites are typically clarified to play a positive role in the cascade hydrogen transfer and lactonization process, while the influence of Brønsted acid species on the catalyst activity and stability is rarely studied. In this work, a new acid-base bifunctional hybrid BPhZr with augmented average pore diameter was prepared from the assembly of ([1, 1’-biphenyl]-4,4’-diylbis(methylene))diphosphonic acid with zirconium via a facile solvothermal method. The effects of reaction parameters, substrate scope, and metal ion type were investigated. Besides the promotional effect of moderate Lewis acid/base sites and improved texture properties, the presence of Brønsted acidic species (e. g., –OH) in BPhZr was demonstrated to positively promote the synthesis of γ-valerolactone (GVL; ca. 95% yield) from levulinates via cascade transfer hydrogenation and lactonization. In comparison with previously reported catalysts, the BPhZr hybrid exhibited a superior activity in terms of TOF (3.2 h−1) and activation energy (21 kJ/mol) for the reaction. Moreover, BPhZr was found to be highly stable and recyclable in five consecutive cycles, showing no significant decrease in GVL yield and selectivity. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Lignocellulosic plant biomass is the most abundant carbon source in the planet, which makes it a potential substrate for biorefinery. It consists of polysaccharides and other molecules with applications in pharmaceutical, food and feed, cosmetics, paper and textile industries. The exploitation of these resources requires the hydrolysis of the plant cell wall, which is a complex process. Aiming to discover novel fungal natural isolates with lignocellulolytic capacities, a screening for feruloyl esterase activity was performed in samples taken from different metal surfaces. An extracellular enzyme extract from the most promising candidate, the natural isolate Alternaria alternata PDA1, was analyzed. The feruloyl esterase activity of the enzyme extract was characterized, determining the pH and temperature optima (pH 5.0 and 55–60 °C, respectively), thermal stability and kinetic parameters, among others. Proteomic analyses derived from two-dimensional gels allowed the identification and classification of 97 protein spots from the extracellular proteome. Most of the identified proteins belonged to the carbohydrates metabolism group, particularly plant cell wall degradation. Enzymatic activities of the identified proteins (β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, β-xylosidase and xylanase) of the extract were also measured. These findings confirm A. alternata PDA1 as a promising lignocellulolytic enzyme producer. Significance: Although plant biomass is an abundant material that can be potentially utilized by several industries, the effective hydrolysis of the recalcitrant plant cell wall is not a straightforward process. As this hydrolysis occurs in nature relying almost solely on microbial enzymatic systems, it is reasonable to infer that further studies on lignocellulolytic enzymes will discover new sustainable industrial solutions. The results included in this paper provide a promising fungal candidate for biotechnological processes to obtain added value from plant byproducts and analogous substrates. Moreover, the proteomic analysis of the secretome of a natural isolate of Alternaria sp. grown in the presence of one of the most used vegetal substrates on the biofuels industry (sugar beet pulp) sheds light on the extracellular enzymatic machinery of this fungal plant pathogen, and can be potentially applied to developing new industrial enzymatic tools. This work is, to our knowledge, the first to analyze in depth the secreted enzyme extract of the plant pathogen Alternaria when grown on a lignocellulosic substrate, identifying its proteins by means of MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and characterizing its feruloyl esterase, cellulase and xylanolytic activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soybean is a major source of oil for food, feed, and biofuel production. Mutagenesis is a tool for creating unique traits useful in breeding programs. The aim of this study is to use nonhypothesis statistical testing methods to make decisions about a mutagenic population. To this end, a total of 1037 mutation lines and 28 wild-type lines were analyzed for fatty-acid composition and protein content. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the fatty acid profile, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to build a selection model for seed weight per plant and weight per 10 seeds, and clustering in conjunction with power analysis to determine the minimum number of individuals needed to create a MANOVA selection model for the oil to protein content. Five of the 35 possible entries were identified by PCA analysis for stearic acid and four of 16 possible entries for oleic acid. Interestingly, most of the selected mutants were validated genetically. In fact, selected mutants with high seed stearic acid or high seed oleic acid contents were verified to carry mutations on GmFAD2-1A, GmFAD2-1B, and GmSACPD-C genes. This shows a promising method of identifying smaller portion of the population to screen for desired mutations. © 2018 AOCS

AB  - Direct utilization of olive mill wastewater sludge (OMWS) bio-oil prepared via fast pyrolysis in a Direct-Biofuel Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (DB-SOFC) was investigated. A viable power densities (&gt;1,000 W m−2 at 650 °C) and 6 h operation under open circuit conditions were obtained despite crude bio-oil complex chemistry. When heated, bio-oil decomposes yielding gases, volatiles and solid residues (biochar). At 650 °C, polarization curve and impedance spectra of SOFC fed by bio-oil showed peculiar shapes related to complex kinetics and charge transfer mechanism within the anode. The carbon accumulation at 650 °C is managed through oxidations with oxide ions and chemical reaction with CO2 and H2O gases. Above 700 °C, performance degradation was noted related to biochar accumulation at the anode though the promotion of Boudouard reaction, the increase in O2− transfer and possible carbon electrochemical oxidations. The anode chemo-mechanical instability was observed explaining the rise in cell ohmic resistance and performance degradation after 6 operating hours. Globally, this work demonstrates that direct fed SOFCs with OMWS bio-oil is achievable using Ni-SDC anode but enhancement in fuel quality and in anode catalytic activity and stability are required to improve significantly the cell performance. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In our present investigation oil is extracted from the Cotton seeds with the help of Expeller machine. Obtained oil is transesterified with Methanol as reagent and Potassium Hydroxide as catalyst and biofuel solution has been formed. This biofuel is further treated to remove the glycerol content. This biofuel is blended with diesel in B5 B10 B20 B30 proportions and fuelled into single cylinder diesel engine and performance has been verified by taking D100(Diesel) as the base reference. We found B10 blend to the optimum and this blend is added with Dimethyl Carbonate and once again the performance has been verified. We identified a reasonable change in the parameters and the obtained results suggest that Cotton seed oil added with DMC can be used as an alternative fuel. © IAEME Publication

AB  - Advanced biofuels, when used as components in fuels, offer advantages over fossil-based hydrocarbons and conventional biofuels to realize highly efficient and clean propulsion systems. Among the several chemical routes to produce biofuels, special attention is given to gas-liquid heterogeneous catalyzed reactions to reduce carbohydrate derived platform building blocks. Supercritical reactors offer opportunities to enhance yield of these type of reactions. In this review, we present studies that take advantage of supercritical technologies to reduce platform biobased molecules. In addition, we discuss related high-pressure phase equilibrium experimental data and modeling tools available, as well as the gaps and needs, for engineering supercritical reactors to produce advanced biofuels. Due to the possibility of tuning solubility with density, opportunities arise in the use of supercritical fluids in combined reaction and separation processes. In this regard, the design of less energy intensive processes is needed to boost the production of advanced biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, methyl ester of Sisymbrium plant seed oil with the chemical formula of C18H34O2 is produced for the first time, with the aid of ultrasonic waves and in the presence of a nanocatalyst. After measuring its characteristics and comparing with ASTM standard, it is tested and evaluated with different ratios of diesel fuel in a single-cylinder diesel engine. The reactions are accomplished in a flask by an ultrasonic processor unit and in the presence of CaO-MgO nanocatalyst. The engine tests were conducted based on the engine short time experiment. The results showed that with the increment of biodiesel ratio in the fuel blend, pollutants level of CO, HC, and smoke opacity are decreased comparing diesel fuel due to the improvement of the combustion process, and the amount of NOx emission is increased owing to high pressure and temperature of the combustion chamber. Also, produced biodiesel fuel causes an increment in the fuel consumption and exhaust gasses temperature. Overall, with regard to its effects on the engine and also being a native and easy cultivation plant, it can be resulted that Sisymbrium oil biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel can be applied as an alternative fuel. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The aim of this work is to propose and to validate a dynamical model for an esterification reaction that was carried out in a relatively new configuration for biodiesel production process: a packed bed reactor with input, output, and recycle. More specifically, the reagents of the esterification process were free fatty acids (FFA) contained in canola oil and low cost methanol (LCM), whereas a commercial cation exchange resin (Purolite CT725) was used as a solid-acid catalyst. The effects of both the LCM volumetric inflow rate and the inflow FFA molar fraction were investigated. The dynamical model was built considering the following assumptions: 1) the reactor was modeled as a CSTR due to the high ratio of recycling volumetric flow to reactor volumetric inflow and 2) the kinetic expression in the model is written in terms of activity coefficients in the light of the non-ideal behavior of the esterification reaction. A satisfactory agreement between the experimental data and the proposed model was obtained. Thus, the resulting model may be advised as a valuable tool for the analysis, control, and optimization of continuous packed bed reactors where the esterification of FFA in the presence of solid acid catalyst is carried out to produce biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study reports the importance of physicochemical characteristics of the core-shell structured polymer-coated Fe3O4 cluster@SiO2 nanocomposite particles for designing the biocatalysts used for transesterification of soybean oil. To demonstrate this issue, two different types of polymer molecules such as polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) each with two different molecular weights are employed. The highest fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) synthesis yield values are achieved by the lipases immobilized onto the low- and high-molecular-weight PEI-coated particles as compared to those of the low- and high-molecular-weight PAA-coated particles (i.e., ∼64.8% and ∼73.1% versus ∼51.5% and ∼46.4%, respectively). The lipases immobilized onto the PEI-coated particles also exhibit excellent stabilities over five repeated uses. The solvent content assays of the particles immersed in water, methanol and soybean oil reveal that the PEI-coated particles have the highest tendency to absorb the oil and the least ones to absorb water and methanol. Thus, those particles increase the substrate molecules accessibility to the immobilized lipases in the reaction medium, leading to the superior transesterification efficiency. This study provides insight into the highly effective enzymatic production of biodiesel with considering the physicochemical properties of support particles used for enzymes immobilization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Various researches were being done all around the world to find an alternate fuel due to rising pollution in the environment which causes climatic change and harms the living beings. Preferences are given to biodiesel in a diesel engine and blending of nanoparticles with them reduces pollution, improves the performance characteristics of IC engines. Further improvement in the performance and emission reduction can be very well done by blending nano additives compared to other modifications in engine and exhaust system. Main pollutants coming from an engine are oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) and oxides of carbon (CO). This paper analyses the chances of employing biodiesel as an alternate for diesel by mixing them withnanoadditives. Relativestudy of diesel and biofuel emulsion fuel has been made in this paper. Using these types of fuel could enhance performance and reduce emission from an IC engine. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - The methyl ester production process from neutralized waste cooking oils was optimized by using alkali-catalyzed (KOH) single-phase reaction. The optimization process was performed depending on the parameters, such as catalyst concentration, methanol/oil ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time. The optimum methyl ester conversion efficiency was 90.1% at the optimum conditions of 0.7 wt.% of KOH, 25 wt.% methanol/oil ratio, 90 min reaction time and 60°C reaction temperature. After the fuel characteristics of the methyl ester obtained under optimum conditions were determined, the effect on engine performance, CO and NOx emissions of methyl ester was studied in a diesel engine with a single cylinder and direct injection. Compared to diesel fuel, engine power and torque decreased when using methyl ester, and specific fuel consumption increased. NOx emission increases at a rate of 18.4% on average through use of methyl ester.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a promising herbaceous energy crop, but further gains in biomass yield and quality must be achieved to enable a viable bioenergy industry. Developing DNA markers can contribute to such progress, but depiction of genetic bases should be reliable, involving simple additive marker effects and also interactions with genetic backgrounds (e.g., ecotypes) or synergies with other markers. We analyzed plant height, C content, N content, and mineral concentration in a diverse panel consisting of 512 genotypes of upland and lowland ecotypes. We performed association analyses based on exome capture sequencing and tested 439,170 markers for marginal effects, 83,290 markers for marker × ecotype interactions, and up to 311,445 marker pairs for pairwise interactions. Analyses of pairwise interactions focused on subsets of marker pairs preselected on the basis of marginal marker effects, gene ontology annotation, and pairwise marker associations. Our tests identified 12 significant effects. Homology and gene expression information corroborated seven effects and indicated plausible causal pathways: flowering time and lignin synthesis for plant height; plant growth and senescence for C content and mineral concentration. Four pairwise interactions were detected, including three interactions preselected on the basis of pairwise marker correlations. Furthermore, a marker × ecotype interaction and a pairwise interaction were confirmed in an independent switchgrass panel. Our analyses identified reliable candidate variants for important bioenergy traits. Moreover, they exemplified the importance of interactive effects for depicting genetic bases and illustrated the usefulness of preselecting marker pairs for identifying pairwise marker interactions in association studies. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Growing concern about replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, coupled with society's concerns about environmental preservation, are the main reasons why governments have sought strategies for increased production and consumption of renewable and sustainable fuels. Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) belongs to the group of oilseeds of the Brassicaceae family, being widely cultivated in the south and central-west regions of Brazil, with physical and chemical characteristics propitious to the production of biofuels. In this context, the objective of the present work was to evaluate three different methods of oil extraction: solvent extraction, cold pressing and swelling technique, to evaluate the potential of radish oil in biodiesel production using methanol, ethanol and a mixture of both containing 60% and 40% respectively, and to evaluate the composition of fatty acids. The methodology consists firstly in the extraction of the oil, followed by transesterification reaction using 10 mL of pretreated oil and sodium hydroxide in the proportion of 1% in mass, relative to the oil. The oil samples were used in the transesterification reactions with methanol, ethanol and a mixture of methanol (60%) and ethanol (40%) in different proportions and temperatures. The results indicated that, for the oil extraction processes, the seed swelling technique presented a high extraction yield (34%). The composition of fatty acids showed presence of approximately 30% of saturated compounds and around 50% of compounds with chain up to 18 carbons, also had presence of erucic acid (up to 41%), and a high percentage of oleic acid (up to 30%). Regarding the transesterification reactions, the highest yield occurred with the use of methanol, about 86%. Thus, in the light of the results, it can be concluded that radish oil has great potential for biodiesel production, but, other analyzes, such as acidity and flash point, should be performed to more specifically evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of biodiesel. © 2018 the Author(s).

AB  - Background: Biodiesel is a green fuel consisting of long chain fatty acid monoalkyl esters, which can be blended with diesel or used alone which is usually produced from vegetable oils/fats by either lipasecatalyzed transesterification. In this investigation, an enzyme (Novozym 435) catalyzed process was optimized to prepare methyl esters from crude Citrullus colocynthis oil (CCO) by transesterification of CCO with methanol. However, as per our knowledge, lipase-catalyzed transesterification have not been used for biodiesel production from Citrullus colocynthis. Objective: The purpose of this work was to transesterify the CCO in the presence of Candida antarctica lipase as catalyst and methanol. Additionally, the physicochemical parameters/fuel properties of the Citrullus colocynthis methyl ester (CCME) were assessed and compared. Methods: Lipase-catalyzed reactions were carried out in three necked flask (50 mL) attached with reflux condenser and thermometer, immersed in oil bath at constant stirring speed (400 rpm). The reaction mixture was consisted of CCO and varying the calculated amount of methanol, tert-butyl alcohol, and Novozym 435. The experimental parameters reaction time, methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, tert-butanol content, Novozym 435 content and water content were optimized for the transesterification reaction. The CCME yield was measured using gas chromatograph. The fuel properties of the produced CCME were determined as per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and European (EN) biodiesel standard methods. Results: In this study, an enzymatic catalyst was employed to synthesize the CCME from CCO via transesterification. Several variables affecting the CCME yield were optimized as lipase quantity (4%), water content (0.5%), methanol/oil molar ratio (5:1), reaction temperature (43 °C), reaction medium composition (80% tertbutanol/ oil), and reaction time (3.7 h). A CCME yield of 97.8% was achieved using enzyme catalyzed transesterification of CCO under optimal conditions. The significant biodiesel fuel properties of CCME, i.e. cloud point (0.70 °C); cetane number (49.07); kinematic viscosity (2.27 mm 2 /s); flash point (143 °C); sulfur content (2 ppm) density (880 kg/m 3 ) and acid value (0.076 mg KOH/g) were appraised. CCME also exhibited long-term storage stability (4.80 h) and all the biodiesel fuel properties were within the range of standards (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214). Conclusion: The lipase-catalyzed transesterification produced better conversion than the base-catalyzed reaction. The fuel properties of CCME were within the limits of the ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards. Furthermore, CCME showed good oxidative stability and a long shelf life due its high natural antioxidant content. CCME showed better fuel properties and long-term storage stability due to which it can be used as a potential alternative fuel. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Detrital soil contamination during wood harvesting cannot be avoided without a further cleaning step. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of Piedmont soil on pinewood pyrolysis products. Ash content was varied at 0.56%, 1.16%, 2.77%, 4.40%, 6.87%, 8.35%, and 15.52% by adding soil to woodchips to mimic the highly soilcontaminated biomass that can be found in biorefineries. This study found that bio-oil yield decreased from 47.1% to 26.3% with an increase in ash content from 0.56% to 15.52%. However, the oxygen content of the bio-oil decreased and the carbon content increased, which led to an increase in heating value from 22.5 to 24.9 MJ kg-1. Inorganics in the soil aided in the catalytic cracking and dehydration reactions for bio-oil formation. A slight increase in the total acid number (106 to 117 mg KOH g-1) and water content (20.72% to 24.99%) was observed with more soil inclusion in the pyrolysis. The effect of soil on biochar O/C and H/C ratios was minimal even though the heating value decreased with an increase in soil content. This study showed that soil (4%wt to 7%wt) in the biomass assisted in deoxygenating the bio-oil and lowered the total mass yield while keeping the total energy yield almost constant. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Cellulose has a complex structure that seriously hinders its processing. Ionic liquids (ILs) have the ability to dissolve cellulose, thus modifying its structure. A series of acetate-and formate-based ILs was synthesized from their chloride analogues and tested for dissolution of microcrystalline cellulose. Cellulose solubility in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [BMIm]Ac, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [EMIM]Ac, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [BMIm]Cl, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [EMIM]Cl and their mixtures was investigated. The optimal weight ratio of a chloride-based IL to an acetate-based IL was found to be 3:2. The solubilizing power of that mixture was maximal, while that of butyl-substituted ILs exceeds the solubilizing power of individual compounds. Despite having better solvent power, acetate-based ILs provide a lower decrease in cellulose crystallinity, as revealed by powder X-ray diffraction studies, in comparison with their chloride-based counterparts. The initial and pretreated cellulose substrates were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy; the micrographs confirmed that substrate morphology changed profoundly after the pretreatment with ILs. © 2018 Editura Academiei Romane.

AB  - Local average heat transfer characteristics along the axial direction in randomly packed beds are investigated experimentally by using a naphthalene sublimation technique and the heat-to-mass transfer analogy. Packed beds of three particle diameters of 12 mm, 10 mm, and 8 mm are investigated, respectively. The relationship between the Nusselt number along the axial direction and the axial porosity distribution is analyzed, and the influence of the entrance effect on the overall heat transfer is explored. In the present paper, the axial porosity distribution is obtained by numerical analysis of a randomly packed bed generated by a discrete element method (DEM). The results of pressure drop show that most experimental points lie within ± 20% deviations of the Ergun equation and that the pressure distribution along the axial direction decreases almost linearly. Furthermore, it is found that in the axial direction, the Nusselt number increases in the first three layers and stays almost constant after that, where the heat transfer is fully developed. The development of Nusselt number along the axial direction can be att ributed to the change of axial porosity distribution and to the alterative turbulence. Besides, the Nusselt number in the first layer is about 60-80% of the average Nusselt number in the bulk of the packed bed in the present Reynolds number range (373-2867). Finally, the entrance effect can have an influence on the overall Nusselt number when the packed bed is shorter than 8-16 particle diameters. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - In this paper, HZSM-5 catalysts were first combined with sub- and supercritical ethanol (scEtOH) in alkali lignin catalytic liquefaction to produce bio-oil, and the synergistic effect of different reaction parameters (temperature, catalytic content, and reaction time) on conversion as well as product yields (bio-oil, solid residue, and aromatic compounds) was systematically studied. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses were carried out to evaluate the composition of main products. Treatment of alkali lignin with 10%HZSM-5 catalyst in scEtOH at 360 °C for 90 min resulted in the highest bio-oil yield of 53.81 wt. %. It has also been confirmed that a combination of HZSM-5 catalyst in subcritical ethanol is beneficial for saving the reaction time and inhibitation of repolymerization reaction. On the basis of GC-MS analysis, the combination of HZSM-5 catalysts and scEtOH resulted in the highest relative content of total aromatic compounds, reaching 71.61% at 280 °C. The most abundant monomers produced in the identical liquefaction are phenols and aromatic hydrocarbons. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - Pyrolysis behaviors of decocting residues of Rhodiola rosea (RR) were studied by TGA and Py-GC/MS. Results indicated that with an increase of decocting time from 0 to 4 h, the contents of extractives and hemicellulose decreased from 29.15 and 5.35 wt.% to 28.18 and 3.47 wt.%, respectively, the contents of acid-insoluble lignin increased from 43.81 to 46.58 wt.%; the content change of cellulose was small. Pyrolysis processes of RR mainly occurred in seven stages and independent weight loss of lignin were found at 380–800 °C, which suggested that RR could be a perfect material to study the lignin structure. The effects of decocting time on the pyrolysis behaviors of RR were slight, mainly changing the pyrolysis progress of extractives and hemicellulose and enhancing the Activation Energy at stage3 from 96 to 110 kJ/mol. In RR pyrolysis, low pyrolysis temperature (for example 300 °C) was propitious to the formation of sugars and furans; high temperature (for example 500 °C) could be contributed to enhance the contents of linear ketones; however, moderate temperature (for example 400 °C) could be a better choice to product the linear acids and phenols. 15.44% content of 1, 6-anhydro-β-D-glucopyranose in the bio-oil at 300 °C suggested good pyrolysis selectivity of RR. Decocting treatment changed the product distributions in the bio-oil. The contents of linear ketones increased remarkably from 13.34 to 25.35% and the contents of sugars and furans decreased from 8.06 and 7.02% to 6.33 and 2.46%, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Metal objects spark in the microwaves, exposing metals to melting point temperatures. The resulting heat can be utilized for the pyrolysis of biomass into upgraded bio oil. In this work pyrolysis was carried out both in the presence and absence of catalyst and the upgradation of bio oil was found the combine action of microwave heating, microwave effects and the catalytic activity of cement. Catalytic pyrolysis of biomass was carried out by mixing powdered biomass with fine powder of cement and placing the resulting mixture in an aluminum coil located in the baked clay reactor followed by its exposure to the microwaves. In this process aluminum coil was used as microwave receiving and heat generating antenna. All these experiments were carried out in a modified domestic microwave oven. The amount of product fractions like bio-oil, biogas and biochar was determined in terms of the mass of catalyst, time of reaction and the gauge of aluminum wire used for the preparation of coil. The bio oil obtained under the optimum conditions was analyzed using Gas chromatography mass spectrometry and the gaseous product was analyzed using chemical tests. Significant difference was observed in the chemical composition of bio oils prepared by catalytic and non-catalytic processes. Further, the oxygen contents of both types of the bio oil were found less than those to be obtained by conventional pyrolysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The non-productive adsorption of cellulases onto lignin in biomass is a key issue for the biofuel process economy. It would be helpful to reduce the inhibitory effect of lignin on enzymatic hydrolysis by engineering weak lignin-binding cellulases. Cellulase linkers are highly divergent in their lengths, compositions, and glycosylations. Numerous studies have revealed that linkers can facilitate optimal interactions between structured domains. Recently, efforts have focused on the contributions and mechanisms of carbohydrate-binding modules and catalytic domains that affect lignin affinity and processivity of cellulases, but our understanding of the effects of the linker regions on lignin adsorption and processivity of GH5 processive endoglucanases is still limited. Results: Eight GH5 endoglucanase 1 variants of varying length, flexibility, and sequence in the linker region were constructed. Their characteristics were then compared to the wild-type enzyme (EG1). Remarkably, significant differences in the lignin adsorption profiles and processivities were observed for EG1 and other variants. Our studies suggest that either the length or the specific amino acid composition of the linker has a prominent influence on the lignin-binding affinity of the enzymes. Comparatively, the processivity may depend primarily on the length of the linker and less so on the specific amino acid composition. EG1-ApCel5A, a variant with better performance in enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of lignin, was obtained by replacing a longer, flexible linker. In total, up to between 28.2 and 30.1% more reducing sugars were generated from filter paper by EG1-ApCel5A in the presence of lignin compared to EG1. Conclusions: Our results highlight the relevance of the linker region in the lignin adsorption and processivity of a processive endoglucanase. Our findings suggest that the linker region may be used as a target for the design of more active and weaker lignin-binding cellulases. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The development of waste-to-energy technologies provides an integrated approach to waste management, climate protection, and sustainable devolvement. In this study, biofuels were produced from “olive cake” combined with used paper and scrap tire. A lab-scale facility was designed to carry out catalytic pyrolysis of a solid feedstock comprising 5 wt% used paper, 5 wt% scrap tire, and 90 wt% olive cake. Jordanian volcanic tuff was used as a catalyst during pyrolysis. The catalytic pyrolysis produced various proportions of gaseous, liquid, and solid biofuels. The use of catalyst influenced the composition, quality, and yield of products via cracking and reforming reactions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present experimental investigation aims at production of second-generation biofuels from straight vegetable oils (SVOs) and carrying out their performance assessment in a compression ignition (CI) engine. The intended second-generation biofuels, i.e., deoxygenated vegetable oils (DVOs), were produced through catalytic deoxygenation of palm and karanja SVOs over 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst under an inert (N2) atmosphere using a batch autoclave reactor. Fuel characterization and elemental analysis were carried out for the produced DVOs to evaluate various fuel properties. In order to evaluate the fuel composition and presence of diesel range aliphatic hydrocarbons, GC-MS and FT-NMR tests were carried out. The engine performance and emission characteristics with the DVOs were evaluated in a developed experimental diesel engine setup. Results showed that the DVOs exhibit better engine performance, lower emissions, and marginally higher NOx emissions compared to those with diesel fuel. In order to establish the DVOs as possible CI engine fuels, the performance and emission characteristics with the DVOs were compared against those with their corresponding established B20 biodiesel blends. The comparative assessment revealed that the engine performance and emission characteristics with the DVOs are superior compared to those with the corresponding B20 biodiesel blends. Especially, the NOx emissions with the DVOs are significantly lower as compared to their corresponding B20 biodiesel blends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Liquid hydrocarbon fuels obtained from the catalytic cracking animal fats and plant oils have become one kinds of the attractive fuels because of their possible environment benefits and the current concern over the depletion of fossil fuel sources. In this work, using the combined methods of one-pot synthesis and wetness-impregnation, some basic mesoporous molecular sieves K2O/MeO-SBA-15 (Me = Ca, Mg or Ba) were prepared, characterized and used in the catalytic cracking of rubber seed oil (RSO). The results indicated that the catalysts K2O/MeO-SBA-15 had better catalytic performances than MeO-SBA-15, assigning to their stronger basicity. The catalyst K2O/MgO-SBA-15 obtained with 15 wt% KNO3 impregnation concentration showed the excellent catalytic performance with about 93.2% conversion and 78.3% yield of liquid hydrocarbon biofuel. The obtained liquid biofuel had similar chemical composition to diesel-based fuels and showed good cold flow property, high calorific and low acid value. Importantly, the catalyst K2O/MgO-SBA-15 was of excellent reusability, and it was reused with negligible loss in its catalytic performance for five times, attributing to the MgO layer between silicon skeleton and potassium species which prevents the reaction between silicon in the framework and potassium species.

AB  - Etherification of furanic compounds such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) and 5-(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (5-HMF) to the corresponding ethers was successfully achieved over Zr-SBA-15 catalyst. For this purpose, various Zr-SBA-15 catalysts with different Zr/Si molar ratios in self-generated acidic environment were prepared by one-pot strategy in self-generated acidic environment. XRD analysis revealed the increase in the d-spacing from 9.021 nm for parent SBA-15 to 11.66 nm for Zr-SBA-15, confirming the incorporation of Zr into the framework without disturbing the mesoporous structure of SBA-15. For the lowest Zr concentration of 0.09 M, hexagonally ordered porous structure was found to be retained as confirmed by TEM while, increase in Zr/Si molar ratio to 0.14, resulted in loss of long range order mesoporosity. The presence of both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in Zr-SBA-15 catalyst as evidenced by py-IR, were due to the introduction of Zr in the frame work of SBA-15. The co-existence of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in Zr-SBA-15 was responsible to catalyze etherification of FA and esterification of levulinic acid producing 2-(Ethoxymethyl) furan and ethyl levulinate selectively, both of which are bio-derived fuel additives. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a simple, inexpensive and arguably safer method to recover high-value products from plants relative to solvent extraction processes. In order to optimize pyrolysis conditions to improve the separation of selected compounds, a novel reactor-condenser chain process was developed to isolate nicotine from tobacco leaf. Ground tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaf (<1 mm) was pyrolyzed at 10 °C/min from ambient to 275 °C using a two-dimensional (2-D) mechanically fluidized reactor (MFR). The gases formed in the reactor would either condense in the hot (180, 190, 200 or 240 °C) or the cold (4 °C) condenser based on the boiling point of the chemicals in the vapors produced. The 2-D MFR operating conditions were optimized by a two-step process: (1) vapors were generated between ambient to 275 °C and the hot condenser temperature was varied to determine which yielded the highest nicotine concentration and recovery; and (2) the hot condenser temperature was kept constant while the best reactor temperature cut was determined. Nicotine recovery was optimal with a condenser temperature of 190 °C. A 25% nicotine concentration in the bio-oil was obtained with a nicotine recovery of 92% as the reactor temperature was increased from ambient to 275 °C. Narrowing the reactor temperature range between 260 and 275 °C maximized the nicotine concentration, as the bio-oil had a 56% nicotine concentration, with a nicotine recovery of 21%. The 2-D pyrolysis process represents a significant improvement over solvent extraction and is potentially applicable for valuable chemical recovery from biomass. © 2018

AB  - The synthesis of biomass-derived ethers to be used as biofuels or biofuel additives has attracted much attention. Following the recently reported synthesis of etherified ester ethyl-4-ethoxy pentanoate (EEP) from γ-valerolactone (GVL) in ethanol catalyzed by H-beta zeolite, an alternative route to prepare EEP in high yield has been developed by reductive etherification of ethyl levulinate (EL) in ethanol at 140 °C under 0.5 MPa H2 with a silica-modified Pd/C catalyst. The ether production likely follows a tandem acetalization–hydrogenolysis process with ethyl-4,4-diethoxy pentanoate (EDEP) as the intermediate. The acetalization step can be favored by introducing acidic materials, such as SiO2–carbon or beta zeolite, as a cocatalyst. The combination of the Pd/SiO2-C and beta zeolite mixture leads to 100 % EL conversion and 93 % EEP selectivity under optimized reaction conditions. For the first time, the standard molar combustion enthalpy of as-prepared EEP is measured by using a static oxygen bomb, and the value of which is determined to be about −5658 kJ mol−1, which is much larger than that of GVL (−2650 kJ mol−1). © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Microalgae cultivation and its use is a promising approach for integrated CO2 biofixation and biodiesel production. Freshwater Neochloris oleoabundans was investigated for lipid content, biomass productivity, and lipid productivity under different temperatures, CO2 concentrations, and nitrogen-to-phosphorus (N/P) ratios in culture media. A rapid calorimetric method based on sulfo-phospho-vanillin was used for the quantification of the intracellular lipid content. The growth of N. oleoabundans was found to be highly temperature-sensitive. Lipid contents were found to be dependent on the CO2 concentration. Changing the N/P ratio also caused the biomass growth and lipid productivity to change. The results confirmed the potential of N. oleoabundans for CO2 biofixation and biodiesel production. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In this study, hydrothermal processing was employed to produce crude bio-oil and biochar from waste jujube stones by deploying metal carbonates as catalysts. The effects of metal carbonate catalysts (K2CO3, Na2CO3 and SrCO3) in different concentrations on the product yields and properties were tested for the conversion studies. The use of metal carbonates (K2CO3, Na2CO3 and SrCO3) increased the yield of bio-oil almost twofold, with the highest yield (18.66 wt%) obtained using K2CO3 at a concentration of 10 wt%. (E)- 9-octadecenoic acid (elaidic acid), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (syringol) and 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol) were some of the prominent compounds found in the crude bio-oils. The process also resulted in an efficient conversion of jujube stones to biochar with high content of oxygenated functional groups which makes it an effective precursor for various applications. The heating values of the bio-oils and biochars were significantly improved compared to those of the feedstock. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the production of biofuels from marine Nannochloropsis oculata without harvesting and dewatering over the single step sol-gel made alumina-silicate supported nickel catalysts at 80 °C and 1.0 atm. Sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid were used in the sol-gel to study the effect of acid type on catalyst activities. The catalyst made using sulfuric acid resulted in 74% microalgae conversion as compared to the catalysts made with other acids. Treatment of this catalyst with ~35 g of NaCl per kg of water at 80 °C and 1.0 atm for 24 h increased microalgae conversion to 91.5% under the same reaction condition and the bio-fuels ranging from mono/polysaccharides, polyols to esters and fatty acids were produced. This study showed that nickel and 25.1 μmol/g of total acidity and acidic strength having 130–380 °C of temperature range was necessary to achieve 91.5% conversion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract—: Four types of carbon fiber materials (CFMs) obtained by electrospinning polyacrylonitrile solutions are considered. The CFMs intertwine with cells of Gluconobacter oxydans or with their membrane fractions (MFs). Bioelectrochemical characteristics of the electrodes (chrono- and voltamperometric, as well as impedance spectra) are studied. Electrodes are considered a model of the anode of the microbial biofuel cell (MFC). Ethyl alcohol is the oxidized substrate. MALDI-TOF MS demonstrates that MFs retain the protein structure of whole cells and therefore can be used as analogues of whole cells. It is shown that the MFC based on carbon fiber material obtained after 30-min treatment at 1000°C has the highest power and stability. When MFs are used as a biocatalyst, nonmediated charge transfer is observed for all studied CFMs. These results can be successfully used for the design of biosensors and MFCs. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The use of non-food materials such as agro-residues as feedstock for renewable energy production continues to generate greater interests due to the environmental challenges from the utilisation of fossil-based fuels. This study gives the first report on thermochemical characteristics, pyrolysis kinetics and pyrolysis product distribution from adzuki bean waste (pod). The pyrolysis characteristic was evaluated under a non-isothermal condition at a different heating rate (10, 15 and 20 °C/min) and kinetic parameters determined using distributed activation energy model. The result indicates that the model adequately described the pyrolysis characteristics of the feedstock with high correlation coefficient (R2 &gt; 0.9) and apparent activation of 140.81 kJ/mol. The result of pyrolysis study revealed that adzuki bean pod could be valorised into solid, liquid (bio-oil) and gas products with maximum bio-oil yield of 46.57 wt% at 600 °C. The bio-oil collected contains high-value fuel precursors and value-added chemicals such as phenol and phenol derivatives, benzene and methyl ester. The gas product comprised of combustible gases, which can serve as an alternative energy source to the pyrolysis system. The solid bio-char product is predominately a porous carbon material with indicators of high stability. This material can also be utilised for energy application in addition to carbon sequestration. The presence of macronutrients suggests its suitability for bio-fertiliser application. This study shows that adzuki bean waste is a potential feedstock for production of alternative energy and valuable biomaterials. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In an age of ever-increasing biotechnological and industrial demand for new and specialized biocatalysts, rational protein engineering offers a direct approach to enzyme design and innovation. Heme peroxidases, as indispensable oxidative biocatalysts, provide a relatively mild alternative to the traditional harsh, and often toxic, chemical catalysts, and subsequently, have found widespread application throughout industry. However, the potential for these enzymes is far greater than their present use, as processes are currently restricted to the more stable, but less catalytically powerful, subset of peroxidases. Here we describe the structure-guided, rational engineering of a plant-fungal hybrid peroxidase built to overcome the application barrier of these high-reduction potential peroxidases. This engineered enzyme has the catalytic versatility and oxidative ability of a high-reduction potential versatile peroxidase, with enhanced temperature and pH tolerance similar to that of a highly stable plant peroxidase. Kohler et al. describe a rational engineering approach for the direct design of innovative, industrially tailored biocatalysts. They utilize this approach to address the current application barrier of high-reduction potential peroxidases as oxidative tools, building a catalytically versatile plant-fungal hybrid peroxidase capable of functioning under wider temperature and pH ranges. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass hydrolysis constitutes a bottleneck for the biotransformation of lignocellulosic residues into bioethanol and high-value products. The efficient deconstruction of polysaccharides to fermentable sugars requires multiple enzymes acting concertedly. GH43 β-xylosidases are among the most interesting enzymes involved in hemicellulose deconstruction into xylose. In this work, the structural and functional properties of β-xylosidase EcXyl43 from Enterobacter sp. were thoroughly characterized. Molecular modeling suggested a 3D structure formed by a conserved N-terminal catalytic domain linked to an ancillary C-terminal domain. Both domains resulted essential for enzymatic activity, and the role of critical residues, from the catalytic and the ancillary modules, was confirmed by mutagenesis. EcXyl43 presented β-xylosidase activity towards natural and artificial substrates while arabinofuranosidase activity was only detected on nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside (pNPA). It hydrolyzed xylobiose and purified xylooligosaccharides (XOS), up to degree of polymerization 6, with higher activity towards longer XOS. Low levels of activity on commercial xylan were also observed, mainly on the soluble fraction. The addition of EcXyl43 to GH10 and GH11 endoxylanases increased the release of xylose from xylan and pre-treated wheat straw. Additionally, EcXyl43 exhibited high efficiency and thermal stability under its optimal conditions (40 °C, pH 6.5), with a half-life of 58 h. Therefore, this enzyme could be a suitable additive for hemicellulases in long-term hydrolysis reactions. Because of its moderate inhibition by monomeric sugars but its high inhibition by ethanol, EcXyl43 could be particularly more useful in separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) than in simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) or consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The rape straw was chosen as experiment materials, and different concentrations of La/MCM-41 were prepared by the impregnation method, then online upgrading of rape straw pyrolysis vapors was performed over La/MCM-41. The modified catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM and Py-IR, respectively. The influence of the introduction of La on the physical and chemical characteristics of organic phase of bio-oil was analyzed. The results showed that La/MCM-41 had the standard MCM-41 structure and typically hexagonal ordered structure, the surface of La/MCM-41 had more acid of Bronsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites. The organic phase included a variety of organic compounds, such as acid, aldehyde, ketone, alcohols, hydrocarbons and others. The modified MCM-41 catalyst can effectively remove the acid, aldehyde and ketone contained in the bio-oil organic phase. At the same time, when the La was loaded up to 5%, the bio-oil organic phase achieved a high yield rate to 18.83% and better physciochemical properties. The heating value of organic phase was up to 33.69 MJ/kg and the content of hydrocarbon was increased significantly to 34.59% and mainly with monocylic aromatics hydrocarbons, which reduced the content of oxygen in oxygenated compounds. The research result would provide the reliable theoretical basis and experimental basis for the efficient utilization of biomass and the further modification of MCM-41 molecular seive. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - Hydrothermal (HT) conversion is a promising and suitable technology for the generation of biofuels from microalgae. Besides the fact that water is used as a “green” reactant and solvent and that no biomass drying is required, the technology offers a potential nutrient source for microalgae culture using an aqueous effluent very rich in essential inorganic nutrients. However, upon continuous and multiple recycling of this HT effluent, the recalcitrant organic fraction is likely to increase and may potentially attain toxic thresholds for microalgae use. In this work, we show the presence of recalcitrant N-containing organic compounds (NOC's) in the HT effluent. The most prominent NOC's in the extracts were carefully examined for their effect on microalgae, namely 2-pyrrolidinone and β-phenylethylamine (β-PEA). The first set of experiments consisted in testing these two substances at three different concentrations (10, 50 and 150 ppm) using three different microalgae strains: Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Chlorella sorokiniana and Scenedesmus vacuolatus. The confirmed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was approximately 75 ppm for all tested species. In the second set of experiments, P. tricornutum was grown using diluted HT effluent. Experimental conditions were set by adjusting the nitrogen concentration in the HT effluent to be equal to a known commercial medium. The concentrations of specific NOC's were lowered to concentrations of 8.5 mg/L 2-pyrrolidinone and 0.5 mg/L β-PEA after dilution. The growth of P. tricornutum using the diluted HT solution was kept constant with no evidence of inhibition or consumption of NOC's, as the concentration of the specific compounds remains the same before and after growth. Therefore, in order to avoid effects of accumulation of NOC's upon continuous recycling, the HT effluent was pumped through the existing hydrothermal gasification unit as a water clean-up step. The conversion of NOC's to ammonium was successfully achieved. © 2018

AB  - Co-form® products are typically used for personal hygiene care (cleansing wipes), household cleaning (pads and mops) and absorbent applications. Co-form® is a thermo-bonded multilayer nonwoven composite and Kimberly-Clark patented its process in 2008. Co-form® rejects are composed of 30% plastic polypropylene and 70% wood pulp fibre. It is difficult to recycle and to-date no research articles explore pyrolytic valorisation for its energy recovery. This paper investigated pyrolytic valorisation of co-form® rejects into energy vectors. Pelletised co-form® rejects obtained from a secondary fibre paper mill were processed using a laboratory scale 2 kg/h Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR®) reactor. The TCR® process combines intermediate pyrolysis, using an auger reactor to heat the material under moderate temperatures (350–450 °C) and moderate solid residence times (minutes) in the complete absence of Oxygen, with post catalytic reforming in a fixed bed reactor at 700 °C. Pelletised co-form® rejects were successfully converted into 12 wt% bio-oil, 9 wt% aqueous phase liquid, 8 wt% char and 71 wt% syngas products. The bio-oil higher heating value was found to be 39.36 MJ/kg, comparable to biodiesel. Naphthalene was found to be the most abundant aromatic compound within the oil, with a relative abundance of 15.22% measured by GC–MS. Oleic acid methyl ester (15.86%) was the most abundant long chain hydrocarbon detected. The higher heating value of produced gas was 11.02 MJ Nm3 and char 30.79 MJ/kg. TCR® conversion of co-form® rejects proved to be a feasible route for the valorisation of this waste stream into sustainable energy vectors. In previous works, gasification processes could not successfully convert organic waste streams with a high plastic content, without implications attributed to agglomeration and melting of plastics. The TCR® process overcome these issues with no evidence of agglomeration or melting of plastics present within the reactor. The success was believed to be through applying moderate heating rates (°C/min) and temperatures (max 700 °C), as well as the mechanical effect of continuous mixing of material within the reactor via the internal auger screw. Overall, TCR® is a promising future route for the valorisation of co-form® rejects to produce energy vectors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Cyanobacteria was catalytically pyrolyzed in methanol atmosphere using magnesium-aluminum layered double oxide/ZSM-5 composites (MgAl-LDO/ZSM-5) as a catalyst. The largest liquid yield of 67.68% was obtained in methanol atmosphere, which was much higher than that obtained without methanol under same reaction condition. The Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometer data proved that the organics phase contained less O-compounds and N-compounds and more aromatic compounds. And the ultimate analysis results showed that this bio-oil had much higher HHV values and lower O/C molar ratio. The co-processing methanol atmosphere and bifunctional catalyst would be a promising means for improving the quality of bio-oil. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present work investigates the energy consumption and yield of the esterification reaction of free fatty acids (waste oil pretreatment) under a simultaneous water removal by adsorption. The reaction was performed under methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol at the optimum reaction temperature of 100°C. The higher boiling point temperature of 1-propanol reduced the energy requirement of the reaction by 36.3 and 34.4% compared to methanol and ethanol, respectively. Moreover, despite the higher reactivity associated with alcohols having lower carbon chains, the reaction yield was approximately 16.4% higher under 1-propanol than the other two alcohols. This can be ascribed to the ability to use higher amounts of 1-propanol while maintaining lower energy consumption. The results also indicated that the reaction at 100°C under methanol and ethanol had a similar energy consumption and yield, favoring the use of the renewable ethanol over the widely used nonrenewable methanol. Finally, these findings highlight the importance of investigating the energy consumption of novel oil pretreatment processes and not solely focus on their ability to convert free fatty acids to biofuel. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Regulation of Bio-systems in a clean, simple, and efficient way is important for the design of smart bio-interfaces and bioelectronic devices. Light as a non-invasive mean to control the activity of a protein enables spatial and temporal control far superior to other chemical and physical methods. The ability to regulate the activity of a catalytic enzyme in a biofuel-cell reduces the waste of resources and energy and turns the fuel-cell into a smart and more efficient device for power generation. Here we present a microbial-fuel-cell based on a surface displayed, photo-switchable alcohol dehydrogenase. The enzyme was modified near the active site using non-canonical amino acids and a small photo-reactive molecule, which enables reversible control of enzymatic activity. Depending on the modification site, the enzyme exhibits reversible behavior upon irradiation with UV and visible light, in both biochemical, and electrochemical assays. The change observed in power output of a microbial fuel cell utilizing the modified enzyme was almost five-fold, between inactive and active states. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - PVT, saturated liquid density and two-phase (vapor-pressure) properties of one of the main component of the biofuel (methyl palmitate), produced from a soybean, have been measured. One-phase PVT measurements were made for ten liquid and four vapor isochores between (85.2 and 811.7) kg·m−3over the temperatures range from (300 to 443) K using a constant-volume piezometer technique. The vapor-pressures (PS,TS) of the methyl palmitate were measured in the temperature range from (300 to 501) K. The combined expanded uncertainty of the density, ρ pressure, P, and temperature, T, measurements at 95% confidence level with a coverage factor of k = 2 is estimated to be 0.1%, (0.15–0.5)% depending on temperature and pressure ranges, and 15 mK, respectively. We have critically assessed all of the reported density data at atmospheric pressure and at high-pressures and vapor-pressures together with the present results for their internal thermodynamic consistence to carefully select primary data to fit reference correlations for ρ0(T) and vapor-pressure PS(T). The measurements were concentrated in the two-phase region to accurately determine vapor-pressures and in the immediate vicinity of the phase-transition temperatures to precisely determine the phase boundary properties (PS,TS,ρS) on the liquid + gas equilibrium curve. The liquid-gas phase transition temperatures (TS) for seven liquid isochores of (711.9, 766.8, 774.5, 782.3, 795.00, 803.40, and 811.70) kg·m−3were accurately obtained using the isochoric (P-T) break point technique. The measured values of the vapor-pressures and saturated liquid densities were fitted to Wagner-type vapor-pressure equation and complete scaling model, respectively. The values of the critical parameters (PC,TC,ρC) were estimated using vapor-pressure and liquid-gas coexistence curve data. The correlation for the density at atmospheric pressure, ρ0(T), together with the present and reported high-pressure density measurements (ρ,P,T) were used to develop two-parametric (c and B) and theoretically based Tait-type equation of state. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The search for efficient routes for the production of fructose from biomass-derived glucose is of great interest and importance, as fructose is a highly attractive substrate in the conversion of cellulosic biomass into biofuels and chemicals. In this study, a one-pot, multistep procedure involving enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of glucose at C2 and Ni/C-catalyzed hydrogenation of d-glucosone at C1 selectively gives fructose in 77 % yield. Starting from upstream substrates such as α-cellulose and starch, fructose was also generated with similar efficiency and selectivity by the combination of enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis. This method constitutes a new means of preparing fructose from biomass-derived substrates in an efficient fashion. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Microalgae transform CO2 into a broad portfolio of biomolecules, and thus should be considered as a valuable biotechnological platform. Despite several research programs and global efforts to establish a sustainable microalgae-based industry, most applications have not transcended academic boundaries. This limitation raises from the high transformation costs when target products are biofuels or fertilizers. Microalgae biorefinery emerges as an alternative to improve economic competitiveness, as Under such a model scope, the process inputs come from industrial waste, while biomass exploitation prioritizes the highest value molecules followed by extraction of less valuable compounds. This review describes a wide range of microalgae exploitation schemes focused on new uses of its constituents, while discussing emerging technologies designed to improve production and efficiencies as well. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - The prominence of biofuel research is growing as the global energy policies focus on renewable energy technologies. Accurate process design and simulation is required when evaluating technological and market capabilities of large scale, novel, fuel production processes. Thermochemical decomposition, employed in various biofuel production routes (pyrolysis, liquefaction, and so on) yields complex liquid mixtures (bio-crudes) containing numerous compounds. The process simulation of such processes must accurately represent the physical, thermodynamic and chemical properties of bio-crudes, while reducing complexity to a point where it can be handled by a process simulator in a time effective manner. In this work, a software employing automated modelling of bio-crudes based on raw experimental data, has been developed. The program output is a ready-to-use reduced mixture, including all product phases and in mass balance with the Proximate and Ultimate analyses of the feedstock biomass material. As there are many approaches to bio-crude modelling, the novelty of this method lies in the combination of the minimization of the number of components needed and the minimization of the level of artificiality introduced in the system. The automation of the method allowed for fast reduction and optimization of seven experimental data sets which were then validated by process simulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sodium percarbonate (SP), a kind of alkaline strong oxidant, was applied to corncob pretreatment. The optimized pretreatment conditions were at 4% (w/v) SP concentration with solid-to-liquid (SLR) ratio of 1:10 treating for 4 hr at 60°C. This pretreatment resulted in 91.06% of cellulose and 84.08% of hemicellulose recoveries with 34.09% of lignin removal in corncob. The reducing sugar yield from SP-pretreated corncob was 0.56 g/g after 72 hr of enzymatic hydrolysis, 1.75-folds higher than that from raw corncob. 2,3-butanediol production by Enterobacer cloacae in simultaneous saccharification fermentation was 29.18 g/L using SP-pretreated corncob as a substrate, which was 11.12 times of that using raw corncob. Scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectra analysis indicated that physical characteristics, crystallinity, and structure of corncob had changed obviously after SP pretreatment. This simple and novel pretreatment method was effective for delignification and carbohydrate retention in microbial production of 2,3-butanediol from lignocellulose biomass. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Two-stage pyrolysis of corncob was performed to simultaneously produce acetic acid-rich and phenolic-rich bio-oils. The two-stage pyrolyzer consisted of an auger reactor and a fluidized bed reactor connected in series. The temperature of the auger reactor was varied between 320 and 400 °C, whereas that of the fluidized bed reactor was fixed at about 520 °C. The total bio-oil yield was over 50 wt %. The bio-oil produced from the auger reactor contained up to 48 wt % acetic acid based on the relative response factor method and low concentrations of lignin degradation products. In contrast, the bio-oil produced from the fluidized bed reactor was enriched with phenolic compounds with a maximum phenol concentration of about 19 wt %. Further, the acetic acid-rich bio-oil was used for the synthesis of calcium magnesium acetate (CMA), a nonchloride deicer, without any post-treatments for acetic acid separation or enrichment. CMA synthesized using bio-oil was chemically identical to the reference CMA. On the other hand, biochar, a byproduct, was activated using CO2 to produce microporous activated carbon with a BET surface area of about 580 m2/g. In summary, it was possible to produce value-added products (CMA and activated carbon) from the continuous two-stage pyrolysis of corncob. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Algae biomass is the most promising feedstock for biofuel production since it can provide a sustainable route to achieve independence from fossil fuel sources. Energy-positive biofuel production from algal biomass has been the major goal for many researchers in recent years. The search for efficient extraction and chemical conversion methods that produce high energy ratios has become an important endeavor in this field. In this regard, microwaves and ultrasound have been utilized as convenient mechanisms in algal biodiesel production. However, none of the studies reported on the energy analysis of the extraction and transesterification methods. Energy analysis of the extractive-transesterification processes using microwave (with ethanol and with ethanol and hexane as co-solvent) and ultrasound irradiations to produce biocrude from microalgae (Chlorella sp.) is presented in this paper. Power input and reaction volumes were varied to study the effects of power density and intensity on the biocrude yields. Results from this analysis show that a biocrude yield higher than 90% could be obtained with an energy input to output ratio of less than one when microwave irradiation is used as the heating mechanism. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Microalgae have higher lipid production conversion efficiency via photosynthesis among all bio-organisms and are therefore considered the most promising feedstock for biofuel production. This experimental study was conducted to investigate the effects of light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation at various wavelengths and the type of sea water used for culture on the biomass growth rate and lipid characteristics of Nannochloropsis oculata. Microalgae were cultured separately in deep and surface sea water and irradiated with LEDs. The experimental results indicated that among the various culture conditions, culture in deep sea water under red LED irradiation yielded the largest microalgae biomass quantity. However, microalgae cultured in deep sea water under blue LED irradiation appeared to have the highest elemental carbon content, heating value, and crude microalgae lipid formation and lowest carbon residue. Hence, the use of deep sea water as a culture medium, together with blue LED irradiation, would lead to the production of microalgae biodiesel with superior fuel properties compared to those produced under various other conditions. Moreover, microalgae grown in deep sea water possessed significantly superior lipid characteristics and biodiesel properties compared to those grown in surface sea water. Hence, deep sea water is more effective for microalgae cultivation. In addition, microalgae biodiesel contained higher levels of both saturated and long carbon-chain fatty acids (ranging between C20 and C22) than used cooking-oil biodiesel. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - The large demand for energy combined with ecological, economic, and social reasons encouraged the studies for alternative sources of fuel. The deoxygenation process of oils and fatty acids has emerged as a promising resource in obtaining fuels. This paper studied the deoxygenation process of oleic and stearic acids carried out in a distillation system, under the temperature of 450 °C over MCM-41, AlMCM-41-41, and HAlMCM-41 molecular sieves, which were synthesized by direct hydrothermal synthesis method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy in the infrared site (FTIR), adsorption and desorption of N2, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and acid-base titration. The results showed that stearic acid deoxygenates more than the oleic acid, and that the performance of HAlMCM-41 was superior to AlMCM-41, indicating that the total acidity positively influenced the process. Furthermore, from the stearic acid deoxygenation, it obtained mainly heptadecanes (C17:0) structures, while the oleic acid produces heptadecenes (C17:1). © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Enzymatic degradation of cellulosic waste to generate renewable biofuels has offered an attractive solution to the energy problem. Synergistic hydrolysis of cellulose residues requires the participation of three different types of cellulases – endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and β-glucosidases (Bgl). Our group has been interested in using Bgl of Cellulomonas biazotea in studies designed to investigate cooperative action among different cellulases. We previously have cloned bgl genes encoding Cba and Cba3, which are C. biazotea Bgl isozymes representing two different Bgl families, respectively; specifically, Glycoside Hydrolase Family 3 (GH3) and Glycoside Hydrolase Family 1 (GH1). To gain an understanding of the complexity of Bgl in C. biazotea, we analyzed E. coli clones containing plasmids into which C. biazotea DNA had been inserted; these clones could hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside (MUG) supplemented in solid agar media, suggesting they might contain bgl genes. Through restriction analysis and DNA sequencing, two novel bgl genes, designated cba4 and cba5 and encoding Cba4 (484 amino acids) and Cba5 (758 amino acids) were identified. Cba4 and Cba5 appear to be members of GH1 and GH3, respectively. Both Cba4 and Cba5 were concluded to be genuine cellobiases as each was found to enable their E. coli hosts to survive on media in which cellobiose was the sole carbon source. Despite lacking a typical secretory signal sequence, Cba4 and Cba5 are secretory proteins. Although they are isoenzymes, Cba, Cba3, Cba4, and Cba5 were shown to possess distinct substrate specificities. These four Bgl members may play important roles in hydrolyzing a wide variety of β-glucosides including cellobiose and non-cellulosic substrates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The transformation of waste oils and fats into biofuels attracts great interest due to the low cost of these materials. The thermal and/or catalytic cracking of oils and fats is an alternative route to the classic transesterification process of biodiesel production when the raw material has low quality. In this work, thermal cracking of sodium soaps of residual fatty materials from Brazilian restaurants (brown grease mainly composed of fatty acids of soybean oil) was tested to assess the feasibility of yielding a high quality diesel-like product. The reactions occurred in a single stirred steel reactor of 300 ml at high temperatures (723 °K) at atmospheric pressure for 1h45 min. The organic liquid product was analyzed for acid and saponification value, thermogravimetric characteristics. The chemical composition of the liquid product diesel-like fractions was determined by FT-IR, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR 1H and 13C) and GC–MS. The hydrocarbons obtained were very similar to diesel oil and suitable for use, in pure form or in mixtures, in diesel oil engines. Yields above 60% and very low acidity (0.5 mg KOH/g) were obtained, meeting the requirements of ANP (Brazilian National Petroleum Agency) Resolution No 51 de 25/11/15. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Efficient enzymatic conversion of recalcitrant crystalline cellulose is critical for enabling cost-effective industrial conversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuels and chemicals. Fully understanding enzyme digestion mechanism is paving a new way to design efficient process for biomass conversion. Accordingly, a continuing drive is inspiring to discover new routes to promote crystalline cellulose disruption. Results: Herein, a physico-chemical oxidative cleavage strategy of irradiation oxidation/post-reduction (IOPR) was employed to treat crystalline cellulose I to cleave glycosidic bonds association with some new oxidized and reduced chain ends, thus boosting downstream degradation by cellulases from Trichoderma reesei. The hydrolysis performance of treated crystalline cellulose was conducted with either T. reesei Cel7A (TrCel7A) alone, or a cellulase enzyme mixture (90% Celluclast 1.5 L, 10% β-glucosidase). 81.6 and/or 97% of conversion efficiency have been reached for 24-h and 48-h cellulase hydrolysis, respectively. The high efficient conversion of crystalline cellulose after IOPR is mainly attributed to generating some new chain ends, which are identified by MAIDI-TOF-MS and HPLC. Furthermore, the nanoscale architectures of crystalline cellulose before and after IOPR are systematically investigated by XRD, EPR, ATR- FTIR, GPC, and XPS techniques. Together with TEM images, the results reveal a fascinating digestion mechanism of "peel-off" and "cavity-formation" paradigms toward degrading crystalline cellulose by cellulase mixtures after IOPR treatment. Conclusions: This encouraging results show that the proposed IOPR approach will become a potential competitive alternative to current biomass pretreatment. It opens a new avenue toward the implementation of pretreatment and the design of enzyme cocktails in lignocellulosic biorefinery. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This experimental study was carried out on a CI engine using Mangifera indica biodiesel for performance optimization using the Taguchi method and grey relational analysis (GRA). This paper presents the combined effect of six input parameters, namely compression ratio, injection pressure, injection nozzle geometry, additive, fuel fraction and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), in controlling seven output variables, namely brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), CO, HC, CO2, NOx and smoke. Five levels were selected for each input parameter and unequal weightage assigned to each output variable. Taguchi's L25 orthogonal array has been applied for reducing the number of experiments. The data obtained from the experiments has been analyzed using S/N ratio and GRA to obtain the optimum combination of six input parameters. The results of the analysis were further confirmed through experiments. The tests were conducted on a CI engine at part load and full load to optimize the performance. Deviations in predicted values of grey relational grade (GRG) are 4.48 and 2.61% of the experimental values at part load and full load, respectively, justifying the application of the Taguchi GRA method for multi-objective optimization of CI engine performance. The GRG improvements with Mangifera indica biodiesel blend are 57.5% at part load and 68.3% at full load compared to GRG at initial settings of the diesel engine. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this study, SOD crystals, synthesised via a hydrothermal synthesis method, were used as solid catalyst to convert beef tallow oil (BTO) into biodiesel. Transesterification reaction was conducted at methanol-to-oil ratio of 7.5: 1 using 3 wt. % SOD catalyst. Reaction conditions were varied as: mixing intensity (700-1250 rpm); catalyst particle size (200–300 Å); reaction time (6–24 h); and reaction temperature (40–60°C). The physicochemical characterisation of the SOD catalyst was conducted using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption at 77 K (for textural property) and thermogravimetric analysis (for thermal stability). The FFA content of the BTO was 4.53%. Physicochemical characterisation shows that SOD crystals were synthesised. The reaction products analysed with a pre-calibrated gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) confirmed the influence of reaction process parameters on the yield of biodiesel leading to a highest FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) yield of 78.3% at agitation speed of 1000 rpm and catalyst particle size of 200 Å. The reaction temperature and reaction time at this condition were 60°C and 24 h, respectively. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In this work we present a viologen-modified electrode providing protection for hydrogenases against high potential inactivation. Hydrogenases, including O2-tolerant classes, suffer from reversible inactivation upon applying high potentials, which limits their use in biofuel cells to certain conditions. Our previously reported protection strategy based on the integration of hydrogenase into redox matrices enabled the use of these biocatalysts in biofuel cells even under anode limiting conditions. However, mediated catalysis required application of an overpotential to drive the reaction, and this translates into a power loss in a biofuel cell. In the present work, the enzyme is adsorbed on top of a covalently-attached viologen layer which leads to mixed, direct and mediated, electron transfer processes; at low overpotentials, the direct electron transfer process generates a catalytic current, while the mediated electron transfer through the viologens at higher potentials generates a redox buffer that prevents oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. Consequently, the enzyme starts the catalysis at no overpotential with viologen self-activated protection at high potentials. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The pulp and paper industry together with lignocellulosic biofuel production provides plentiful streams of lignin and lignin-derived molecules (LDMs) that currently remain underutilized. The heterogeneity and complexity of lignin along with the lack of convenient tools significantly hamper its utilization. Selective separation of these LDMs from streams using specific tools would allow the recovery of aromatic compounds, as well as facilitate biological processes aiming at lignin valorization. To this end, here we report the isolation and characterization of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies against ferulate, coumarate, and caffeate, which are the molecular representatives of LDMs. Binders for the target LDMs were enriched by interrogating a synthetic scFv library with the phage display technique. As a result, scFv binders specific against each of the target molecules were obtained with affinities in the micromolar range. The selectivity of scFvs towards specific LDMs was proved by recovering caffeate from simulated LDM solution, Kraft lignin, and rice straw hydrolysate samples. Further proof of concept studies with model compounds demonstrated the applicability of antibody-based binders as a detection tool for monitoring microbial LDM conversion. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of scFv binders as a specific toolset for lignin compound recovery and analysis. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Beef tallow is a major waste from slaughterhouses and the production rate is rising due to increasing human population. Conversion of waste beef tallow into potential hydrocarbons and biofuels is of great interest. This work focused on catalytic cracking of beef tallow using ZSM-5 to generate a light liquid fuel. A batch reactor was used to investigate the effect of operating conditions for generation of liquid hydrocarbons using a central composite design of experiment to determine the maximum conversion. The experimental variables included reaction temperature between 350 and 450°C, reaction time from 20 to 60 min, and catalyst loading between 1.0 and 10.0% w/w. The liquid products obtained were subsequently distilled at 350°C and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for their chemical composition. The optimum condition for the highest liquid product conversion of 73% w/w was found at 443°C, 60 min and catalyst loading of 6.3% w/w. For the final light liquid fuel, different short chain hydrocarbons between C7-C21 were identified. It contained mainly kerosene (36%), but with physical properties similar to diesel. © International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research, 2018.

AB  - Rice bran is a by-product of great production worldwide and its use for the synthesis of biodiesel does not affect the food chain and therefore it is an excellent alternative for the production of biofuels with low carbon footprint. In this work, the synthesis of biodiesel was carried out from the raw rice bran oil of a kernel variety called "Morelos rice." The stability and corrosivity characteristics of biodiesel were determined. Biodiesel stability was determined both under storage conditions and under accelerated oxidation conditions, and its corrosivity was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at 110°C under aerated conditions. The results showed that, due to the high instability of the rice bran, its raw oil had a high content of free fatty acids. The synthesized biodiesel showed excellent stability under storage conditions of up to five months, and its oxidative stability was much higher than that established in international standards. On the other hand, biodiesel showed low corrosivity and this was only significant once oxidative degradation began. © 2018 J. Zuñiga-Díaz et al.

AB  - This study explores an integrated biomass conversion system based on a common fast pyrolysis step and two subsequent bio-oil upgrading pathways. The two options are bio-oil thermochemical upgrading to drop-in transportation biofuels through hydrotreating and hydrocracking, and bio-oil electrochemical conversion for electrical power generation using a direct bio-oil fuel cell method. The technoeconomic performances of biomass-to-biofuels and biomass-to-electricity pathways are first examined individually, and then integrated for the analysis of a hybrid biomass conversion system. A biomass facility of 2000 tonnes per day is investigated as a baseline. The minimum fuel-selling price (MFSP) is estimated to be $ 2.48 per gallon, with biomass feedstock and other operating costs as major contributors. A very high minimum electricity-selling price (MESP) of $ 5.36 per kWh is projected based on the current laboratory-scale fuel cell configuration. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the effective reactant content in bio-oil, the degree of oxidation, and the fuel cell system efficiency play key roles in the MESP. The estimate can be reduced to $ 0.96 per kWh if target values of the three parameters are met. The results of the hybrid system suggest that the MESP can be reduced substantially from $ 0.96 to $ 0 per kWh when the hybrid system increases the bio-oil fraction for biofuel production from 0 to 75.8 %, given a biofuel MFSP of $ 3 per gallon. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF) are potential biofuel ethers and could replace conventional fossil fuels, or act as additives to aid combustion. Laser flash photolysis with laser-induced fluorescence detection of the OH radical has been used to measure the rate coefficients of the OH reaction with these ethers, from 298 K to approximately 740 K. The temperature dependence of the rate coefficients is parametrized as k OH+MTBE (298-680 K) = 9.8 × 10 -13 × (T/298) 2.7 × exp(2500/RT) cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 and k OH+TMOF (298-744 K) = 8.0 × 10 -13 × [(T/298) 2.6 + (T/298) -8.1 ] × exp[2650/RT] cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 . The room temperature (298 K) bimolecular rate coefficients were measured as k OH+MTBE = (2.81 ± 0.32) × 10 -12 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 and k OH+TMOF = (4.65 ± 0.50) × 10 -12 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 where the errors represent statistical uncertainties at the 2σ level in combination with an estimated 10% systematic error. Regeneration of OH radicals was observed for both reactions at higher temperatures in the presence of O 2 via biexponential OH decays, which were observed above 489 K and 568 K, for TMOF and MTBE respectively. The OH yield from MTBE/O 2 , between 620 and 700 K, was invariant with the concentration of oxygen (10 15 -10 18 molecules cm -3 ) at (36 ± 5)%. Mechanisms for OH regeneration from MTBE are briefly discussed and compared with those in the literature and from dimethyl and diethyl ether. The lower OH yield from MTBE, compared to these other ethers, is most likely due to competition with an HO 2 formation channel. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Previous research has shown that alkali addition has operational advantages in entrained flow biomass gasification and allows for capture of up to 90% of the biomass sulfur in the slag phase. The resultant low-sulfur content syngas can create new possibilities for syngas cleaning processes. The aim was to assess the techno-economic performance of biofuel production via gasification of alkali impregnated biomass using a novel gas cleaning system comprised of (i) entrained flow catalytic gasification with in situ sulfur removal, (ii) further sulfur removal using a zinc bed, (iii) tar removal using a carbon filter, and (iv) CO2 reduction with zeolite membranes, in comparison to the expensive acid gas removal system (Rectisol technology). The results show that alkali impregnation increases methanol production allowing for selling prices similar to biofuel production from non-impregnated biomass. It was concluded that the methanol production using the novel cleaning system is comparable to the Rectisol technology in terms of energy efficiency, while showing an economic advantage derived from a methanol selling price reduction of 2–6 €/MWh. The results showed a high level of robustness to changes related to prices and operation. Methanol selling prices could be further reduced by choosing low sulfur content feedstocks. © 2018

AB  - Zn–Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) of general formula Al 3+ x (OH) 2 ] x+ (CO 3 Zn–Al 2− ) x/2 · y H 2 O are promising solid base catalysts for the transesterification of lipids to biofuels. However, conventional synthetic routes employ alkali ydroxide/carbonate precipitants which may contaminate the final LDH catalyst and biofuel. The use of (NH3)2CO3 and NH3OH as precipitants affords alkali-free Zn–Al-LDHs spanning a wide composition range. The hydrothermal reconstruction of calcined Zn–Al-LDHs offers superior solid basicity and catalytic activity for the transesterification of C4–C18 triglycerides with methanol,compared with cold liquid phase or vapour phase reconstruction. Hydrothermally activated Zn3.3–Al-LDH was stable towards leaching during transesterification. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A protein-rich microalgae species Arthrospira platensis was pyrolyzed in a semi batch reactor using two clay catalysts kaolin and calcium bentonite to understand the effects of temperature and catalysts on the yield and composition of bio oil. The optimum temperature for a higher bio oil yield of 55.9 wt. % was 500°C. The bio-oil yield decreased in presence of both the clay catalysts. The effect was more pronounced with kaolin as compared to calcium bentonite. The energy recovery in kaolin catalyzed pyrolysis was lower than thermal and calcium bentonite catalyzed reactions. The FTIR and GC/MS results of the algal bio-oil conform the presence of nitrogenous compounds, alcohols, acids, esters, phenols, hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds and aromatic compounds. The aromatics fractions in the bio-oil increased significantly in presence of clay catalysts. The bio-oil was slightly alkaline with higher HHV, comparative specific gravity and viscosity as that of fossil fuel. © 2018 World Research Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of reaction temperature and catalyst loading on product yields and fuel properties of produced slurry during the alkali catalyzed hydrothermal treatment (HTT) of pine sawdust. The yield of the liquid fraction, or the aqueous product (AP), at process temperatures of 180–260 °C obtained after solid/liquid separation of the slurry ranged from 11.1 to 34.3 wt% on a dry, ash free basis. The fuel quality of the produced slurry, such as the elemental composition and the higher heating value (HHV), was mainly affected by the catalyst loading. An increase in the catalyst loading caused the ash content to increase. Although the increase in temperature leads to a higher liquid fraction in the slurry making it more homogeneous, its contribution to the elemental composition of the whole slurry was limited. HHV of the produced slurry ranged from 12.0 to 16.4 MJ/kg. These values are comparable to that of black liquor (BL), which has previously been shown to be a promising feedstock for gasification in a pilot scale entrained flow gasifier. These results imply the possibility of a fuel switch from BL to the HTT slurry for entrained flow gasification though its gasification reactivity and conversion characteristics must be investigated further. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The impact of engine operating cycle, Biodiesel blends and fuel impurities on soot production and soot properties are evaluated in the present work. To this end, soot were produced on engine test bench and then collected inside a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). Two engine cycles (a Natural Loading and an Accelerated Loading) were tested. A standard Euro VI fuel blended with 7% of Biodiesel (B7) and a pure Biofuel (B100 RME EN 14214) were used. This latter was additivated with potassium and phosphorus at a low (B100+) or at a high (B100++) concentration. Soot characterization through elemental analyses, nitrogen adsorption, Raman spectroscopy, TGA and TPO experiments show that the engine operating cycle impact the soot reactivity through modifications of their texture and structure. Test bench experiments also show that increasing Biodiesel blend from B7 to B100+ divides by five the soot production. Moreover, soot obtained with B100+ are more reactive because of higher oxygen and ash content. When the inorganic content of the fuel is increased, few effects on the soot production are observed but the soot reactivity is significantly increased. In fact, analyses highlight that impurities present in the fuel are retrieved inside the soot composition and then catalyze their oxidation. K has a beneficial effect on both passive and active regenerations. On the contrary, P inhibits the active regeneration but has a significant catalytic impact on the C–NO2–H2O reaction. Finally, a numerical simulation allows to extract the kinetic constants of real B7- and B100+-soot, whose values confirm the differences of the soot reactivity. © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - The consumption of plant seed oils and their derivatives is growing globally in order to protect the eco-system. The application of such plant-seed derived biofuels and lubricants are limited at lower temperatures by its high pour point and constrained at higher temperature due to its inadequate thermo-oxidative stability. Former studies have shown that the blending of natural additives with plant seed oil derivatives enhance their performance; therefore, in an attempt to enhance the properties of the canola biodiesel (CB) and its derivatives (epoxidized canola biodiesel and epoxidized canola biodiesel derived alkoxides) were blended at 2 wt% with natural additives viz. L-Ascorbic Acid 6-palmitate, caffeic acid and tannic acid. All the blends were evaluated for their thermo-oxidative stability, low-temperature properties, lubricity and rheological properties, and these properties were compared with those blended with synthetic additive tert-Butylhydroquinone as well as without any additives. The experimental outcomes of this study revealed that the additives have shown significant improvement in the performance of CB. Further, it was found that natural antioxidants enhances the thermal and oxidative stability, viscosity of the canola biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nearly 350 species of biodiesel feedstocks have been identified by many researchers for the past few decades. Unlike petroleum diesel, the biodiesel degrades rapidly and deterioration of its quality occurred while contacting with atmospheric oxygen. This main drawback of instability of fuel properties limited the commercial use of biodiesel in the global fuel market. To inhibit this oxidative degradation of biodiesel, the antioxidants are used. Comparing to other antioxidants, the synthetic antioxidants (phenolic) are more efficient. This study investigates the effects of commercially available and cheap synthetic antioxidants (TBHQ – tert-butylhydroxyquinone, PY – pyrogallol, PG – propyl gallate, BHT – butylated hydroxytoluene, and BHA – butylated hydroxyanisole) at 1000 ppm concentration on the fuel stability of Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel. The discrepancy in antioxidant activity has been characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy by analyzing the O–H and C–H molecular chains prevalence in the infrared spectrum region of 3000–3700 cm−1 and 2800–3000 cm−1. TBHQ at 1000 ppm dosed with C. inophyllum biodiesel improves the oxidation stability by 42.56%, storage stability by 36.57%, and thermal stability by 41.02% when compared to those of pure biodiesel (B100) without any antioxidant. The rank of antioxidants effectiveness with pure biodiesel is obtained as TBHQ &gt; PG &gt; PY &gt; BHT &gt; BHA. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - In this article, the effects of different biofuel–diesel blends on engine oil dilution and diesel oxidation catalyst performance during late post-injections were investigated. The engine tests were made with an off-road diesel engine under low load conditions at 1200 r/min engine speed. During the experiments, oil samples were periodically taken from the engine oil and later analyzed. Emissions and temperatures before and after the diesel oxidation catalyst were also measured. The fuels studied were fossil EN590:2013 diesel fuel, 30 vol.% biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) and 30 vol.% hydrotreated vegetable oil, which is a paraffinic diesel fuel fulfilling the EN15940 specification. The novelty of the study is based on two parts. First, similar late post-injection tests were run with blends of both hydrotreated vegetable oil and fatty acid methyl ester, giving a rare comparison with the fuels. Second, oil dilution and the fuel exit rates during normal mode without the late post-injections were measured. The results showed the oil dilution and the diesel oxidation catalyst performance to be very similar with regular diesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil blend. With the fatty acid methyl ester blend, increased oil dilution, smaller temperature rise in the diesel oxidation catalyst and higher emissions were measured. This indicates that during diesel particulate filter regeneration by late post-injections, fatty acid methyl ester blends increase fuel consumption and require shorter oil change intervals, while hydrotreated vegetable oil blends require no parameter changes. © IMechE 2017.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction(HTL) of empty fruit bunches(EFB) was performed with an autoclave reactor at various temperatures (240, 270, 300, and 330 °C) in the presence of transition metal chlorides(ZnCl2, CuCl2, and NiCl2) under high pressure(∼22 MPa) and N2 atmosphere. Main HTL products including hydrochar, gas, water-soluble fraction (WSF), and crude-like HTL oil were investigated. The yield of HTL oil gradually increased with increasing temperature, and the highest oil yield of 22.8 wt% was obtained at 300 °C. When transition metal chlorides (2.5–10.0% (w/w sample)) were added to the reaction, mass distributions of the four fractions were clearly modified based on the type of transition metal chloride as well as their concentration. In general, the yield of HTL oil decreased with an increase in transition metal concentration up to 10.0%, the water content increased and the chemical compounds decreased with an increase in the amount of metal. γ-Valerolactone (GVL) and levulinic acid (LA) were detected in the catalytic HTL oil, due to the presence of transition metal ion and high acidity. Unlike other metal chlorides, the presence of CuCl2 resulted in relatively low GVL and high LA concentration, which may inactivate the route from LA to GVL under acidic hydrothermal conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the most common biofuels, and its production yields a large amount of glycerol as a by-product. It is necessary to develop new technologies for the use of this by-product, adding value to the biodiesel production chain. In this work we investigated glycerol oxidation under mild reaction conditions (air as oxidizing agent and base-free medium) promoted by suitable catalysts. We prepared mono- and bimetallic catalysts of platinum, copper and nickel in the form of nanoparticles by conventional heating and by an alternative method using microwave heating. The nanoparticles were dispersed in activated carbon and tested in glycerol oxidation aiming its valorization into molecules with high added value. Copper and nickel monometallic materials were not active in glycerol oxidation. Platinum monometallic and platinum–copper and platinum–nickel bimetallic materials showed catalytic activity, with platinum–nickel prepared by microwave heating being the most active material in reactions tested. This catalyst presented glycerol conversion of approximately 20% with a turnover number of 9465 in a reaction time of 6 h and 58% of selectivity to glyceric acid, the main product obtained. The best performance of platinum–nickel prepared by microwave heating catalyst was attributed to the probable formation of a metallic alloy between Pt and Ni, as evidenced by the decrease in the lattice parameter for PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles. The results showed that it was possible to obtain an active catalyst in glycerol oxidation reaction under mild conditions via a simple methodology using microwave heating, which demands 94% less time in comparison with conventional heating. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A series of cerium-exchanged dodecatungstophosphates CexH3-3xPW12O40 (CexH3-3xPW, x = 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0) were designed and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), pyridine adsorption IR spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). The activity of these catalysts was evaluated for the generation of biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCO) with 27 wt% of free fatty acids (FFAs) and 1 wt% of water. Compared to theri parent H3PW12O40, CexH3-3xPW showed higher activity for esterification of FFAs and transesterification of triglyceride to mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids (FAMEs) in one-pot. The acidic properties of CexH3-3xPW depended on the amount of Ce3+ ions in the secondary structure of Keggin heteropolyacids, while conversion of triglycerides and FFAs depended on their increasing acid contents. Among CexH3-3xPW, Ce0.7H0.9PW showed significant activity due to its high Brønsted acidity and Lewis acidity with 98% conversion of WCO and almost 100% selectivity to FAME at the molar ratio of methanol to WCO = 21:1 and 65 °C for 12 h. The reaction adhered to first-order kinetics with the activation energy (Ea) of 71 kJ/mol and the frequency factor (A) of 1.8 × 108 min−1, while the reaction rates were not influenced by the internal mass transport. The catalyst behaved as a heterogeneous catalyst, which can achieve the regeneration and be used more than five runs but without obvious decrease in activity. The characteristics of the WCO methyl ester were found to be close to the engine requirement. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Second generation bioethanol, obtained by the fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass, which is not competitive with the food and feed field, is one of the most interesting promising biofuels, already available in semi-commercial amount. Steam reforming of bioethanol has been used here for sustainable hydrogen and syngas production. Differently purified second generation bioethanol feeds, directly supplied by an industrial plant, for the steam reforming process, assessing the influence of impurities and catalyst formulation. Ni/La2O3, Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/CaO–ZrO2 prepared by Flame Spray Pyrolysis were used as catalysts. Catalytic performance at high and low temperature was evaluated in order to investigate a broad range of temperature, which is one of the most critical condition in term of catalyst activity and deactivation, besides energy saving. The possible effect of impurities contained in less purified feedstocks is also discussed. Stable performance up to 100 h-on-stream was attained even under stressing reaction conditions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biomass catalytic pyrolysis vapor upgrading is an important way for converting biomass to high-value chemical products. Studies on pyrolysis behavior and products distribution of biomass are of great importance to the research on the interactions and catalytic conversion mechanism between model components of biomass and catalyst. At the same time, aromatic hydrocarbon compounds was the important chemical in nowadays, catalytic pyrolysis process produces a highly oxygenated bio-oil containing over 100 different compounds. The selectivity of fast pyrolysis can be greatly enhanced through the use of a catalyst, in particular with HZSM-5 zeolite which gives the highest selectivity toward mono-cyclic platform aromatics (such as benzene, toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene) essential to the chemical industry. Despite this high selectivity, a significant fraction of the freed-stock's renewable carbon is lost to coke and char, two undesired byproducts. Coke formation has been attributed to the polymerization of small oxygenates on the external surface of the zeolite and to the formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons through condensation reactions inside the micropores. So in order to improve selectivity toward desired products of aromatic and lower the formation of coke, the mesoporous HZSM-5 was synthesized by desilication method. In this paper, we used alkali treatment of commercial HZSM-5 zeolites using K 2 CO 3 solutions to introduce mesopores into microporous system, and to investigate the effects of alkali concentration (0.2-0.6 mol/L) on aromatics yield and selectivity, The pyrolysis of experimental sample (pine, cellulose and lignin) was conducted in a fixed bed reactor with the conditions of pyrolysis temperature of 450℃, and catalytic temperature of 550℃, the ratio of biomass to catalyst of 1:2. Materials and products characteristics were investigated with various testing approaches, such as elements analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area and pore size analyzer (BET), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), temperature programmed desorption (NH 3 -TPD) and gas chromatography mass spectrograph (GC-MS) to study the effect of desilication on the structure, acidity, pore size and performance of aluminum-rich ZSM-5 as well the product distribution of pyrolysis bio-oil. The results showed that alkali treatment of HZSM-5 can remove the extra-framework Si species to enhance the diffusion property, and at the same time, creation the mesopores, and the pore diameter of mesopores increased with the increase of K 2 CO 3 concentration however, the total acid amount decreased. Detailed characterization of the obtained zeolite catalysts indicated that mild desilication conditions significantly affect the elemental composition, crystallographic structure, microporosity, and distribution of aluminum atoms in framework and extra framework sites. The number of accessible Brønsted acid sites increased as a result of the enhanced mesoporosity. At the same time, the concentration of alkali solution, the corrosion degree, the degree of desilication and desilication, and the mesoporous degree increased, as such the hysteresis phenomenon became more and more obvious. Moreover, the hierarchical HZSM-5 catalyst produced more aromatic hydrocarbons and less coke formation in CFP of lignin and lignocelluloses' biomass that contained the lignin component than that of the control HZSM-5, which effectively improved the selectivity for naphthalene family products (methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene) in the bio-oil and decreased the content of aromatic hydrocarbons larger than C10. The highest aromatic yield (82.81%) and lowest coke yield (28.06%) were obtained in CFP of pine wood with mildly desilicated zeolite treated with 0.5mol/L K 2 CO 3 solution. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - This study investigates fine particulate matter (PM2.5) bound persistent organic pollutants (POPs) emitted from a diesel generator fueled with three waste cooking oil-based biodiesel (WCO-biodiesel) blends (W0 (pure diesel), W20 (WCO-biodiesel/diesel = 20%/80% (v/v)), and W40). These POPs are polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Experimental results indicate that the mass concentrations of PM2.5-bound PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs in the engine exhaust are 2.15–3.65, 16.7–35.4, 25.8–46.5 and 303–440 pg Nm–3, respectively, at 1.5–3.0 kW loads for using W0, while the corresponding toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations of the above PM2.5-bound pollutants are 0.282–0.527, 0.038–0.051 and 0.064–0.093 pg WHO2005-TEQ Nm–3, respectively (excluding PBDEs, which still have no toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for TEQ calculation). Using W20 and W40 reduced the mass and TEQ emission concentrations of PM2.5-bound PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs in comparison with W0. The reductions of mass concentrations in exhausted PM2.5 were in the order PBDEs &gt;&gt; PBDD/Fs &gt; PCBs &gt; PCDD/Fs, while the decrease in toxic concentration followed the order PCDD/Fs &gt; PBDD/Fs &gt; PCBs. Thus, adding WCO-biodiesel to the fuel mixture in generator engines lowers the adverse effects of PM2.5 emissions on the environment and human health. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - This paper investigated the effect of Na, Mg Ba and Na, K in the conversion of the metal soaps extracted from macauba pulp oils into bio-oil through fast pyrolysis (200 °C min−1). The influence of the acidity of the raw material (high and low acidity, 93 and 7 mg KOH/g respectively) through the thermal decomposition process was also studied. These parameters were evaluated according to the production of bio-oil checking yields and their potential as a renewable fuel and to produce chemicals for industrial propose. Based on the TGA results the metal soaps were submitted to fast pyrolysis at 550 °C producing three fractions, i.e. liquid (bio-oil + water), gas and solid, which presented different yields depending on the metal used. The yields were: bio-oil (35–54% w/w), water content (8–12% w/w), gas (25–35% w/w) and solid (10–30% w/w). The bio-oils are comprised mainly of a homologous series of hydrocarbons from carbon number C6 to C17 and also from some oxygenated compounds. The content of hydrocarbons (70–80% relative area) and oxygenated compounds (20–30% relative area) present in the bio-oils depend upon the metal soap. The bio-oils obtained from magnesium soaps yielded the highest content of diesel fraction hydrocarbons. The differences in the content and chemical composition of the bio-oils showed that the metal and the counter ion used have a catalytic effect of promoting changes in the cracking process. On the other hand, the acidity of the raw material did not cause changes in the thermal decomposition process. Furthermore, some physicochemical properties were obtained for bio-oils and compared with ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels, Brazil) specification for diesel fuel. The bio-oils obtained could be categorized as green diesel and could be used as blends. The solid fraction is comprised mainly of carbonates and oxides of the metal used and also by the remaining salts used in the saponification process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Two anhydrosugar model compounds (cellobiose and levoglucosan) and a mixture of anhydrosugars from the fast pyrolysis of birch wood were subjected to acid hydrolysis using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. The anhydrosugar mixture or bio-oil aqueous fraction was found to contain mainly levoglucosan with a concentration of 30 g L-1. Hydrolysis temperature, reaction time, and catalyst to substrate molar ratios (c/s) were varied to identify their influence for glucose production. At 120 °C, 60 min, and a 0.9 c/s ratio, glucose yields of 98.55% and 96.56%, and substrate conversions of 100% and ∼92%, were achieved when hydrolyzing cellobiose and levoglucosan, respectively. An increase in the temperature to 135 °C resulted in a decrease in both glucose yield and selectivity, whereas substrate conversions around 90% were maintained for both anhydrosugars. During the hydrolysis of the bio-oil fraction, a range of conditions to achieve glucose yields above 90% was depicted. It was found that c/s ratios between 0.17 and 0.90 and temperatures between 118 and 126 °C were suitable to achieve glucose yields around 100% (30 g L-1). Furthermore, glucose concentrations of ∼117% (35 g L-1) and levoglucosan conversions above 90% were attained at 135 °C, 20 min, and a 0.2 estimated c/s ratio.

AB  - To boost aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) activity in a Cupriavidus necator strain expressing a synthetic alkane pathway, the expression of two ferredoxin–ferredoxin reductase systems was tested. The genes of a native fd/FNR-like system were identified in C. necator and expressed in a previously engineered alka(e)ne producing strain. The improved production of alka(e)nes in this Re2061-pMAB1 strain confirmed the activity of the native Fd/FNR system in C. necator. Concomitantly, the expression of the heterologous system from Synechococcus elongatus was investigated identically, leading to a second strain, Re2061-pMAB2. In the bioreactor, the aldehyde production was strongly reduced compared with the original alka(e)ne producer, leading to alka(e)nes production up to 0.37 and 1.48 g/L (22 and 82 mg/gCDW), respectively. The alka(e)ne production yield of Re2061-pMAB2 accounted for 15% of the theoretical yield. We report here the highest level and yield of alka(e)nes production by an engineered bacterium to date. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Microfluidic microbial fuel cells (μMFC) combine the microfluidic technology and bio-catalysts anchored at the electrode, representing an emerging bio-power generator. However, a major challenge towards further development is their low bio-catalysts loading on the electrodes. Previous researches have revealed the bio-electrode structure and nutrient-feeding type play a significant role in the power generation of μMFC. In this study, we fabricate a membrane-free μMFC with a piece of graphene-decorated nickel mesh as bio-anode, which is fed in a flow-through manner. The scanning electron microscopy and pore-distribution variation analysis show the mixed bacteria grow densely on the surface of the electrode. Benefited from the enriched bacterial colonization and sufficient nutrient supply, the μMFC produces a remarkably high areal power density of 1.11 W m−2 at a current density of 2.15 A m−2. These values are substantially higher than those of conventional two-dimensional electrodes and flow-over architectures measured under the same condition. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In view of current technical problems of catalyst coking inactivation, poor equipment safety and large amount of hydrogen consumption, which are caused by high hydrogen pressure and operating temperature in bio-oil hydrogenation, an innovative gas-liquid two-phase discharge reaction system was constructed and applied to actualize the hydrogenation of bio-oil under catalyst-free, normal temperature and pressure conditions. Single-factor experiments were performed to explore the effects of working voltage, gas-flow rate and reaction time on the deoxygenation rate and high heating value of refined bio-oil. Furthermore, with the results of multi-factor orthogonal experiments, the operating parameters optimization model for the deoxidation rate of bio-oil was developed. The reasonable reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of various oxygenated compounds under gas-liquid two-phase discharge reaction conditions were well inferred. Under optimized operating parameters, the deoxidation rate of 65.26% with the high heating value of 35.15 MJ/kg of bio-oil were achieved. GC–MS analysis results demonstrated that aldehydes, ketones were completely diminished, and alcohols, esters, phenols and acids were decreased. A remarkable increase of hydrocarbons was revealed, which indicated the quality of bio-oil was significantly improved. As a result, this gas-liquid two-phase discharge reaction system can perform hydrogenation of bio-oil efficiently. © 2018

AB  - The microwave-metal interaction pyrolysis technique has great potential of producing highly upgraded bio-oils from the biomass. In this study, the heat of the sparking metals in a microwave oven was utilized to pyrolyze the biomass into bio-oil, biogas and char. Using this technique, highly upgraded preliminary bio-oil was produced from the water hyacinth biomass. The effect of the metal type and gauge size on the product quality and composition was investigated by using different heat generating antennas. The bio-oil, obtained with each metal coil, was analyzed with Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) technique. The gaseous products were characterized using spot test and combustibility analysis. Significant difference in the chemical composition of the bio-oils, produced with different metal coils, was noticed in these investigations. For all the tested metals, the oxygen and hydrocarbon content in the oil product was found significantly lower than those obtained through conventional pyrolysis. Also, unlike the thermal or thermo-catalytic pyrolysis, the bio-oil product of the microwave-metal interaction pyrolysis did not contain any water content. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glycerol, which is an inevitable by-product of biodiesel production, is an ideal carbon source for the production of carotenoids due to its low price, good availability and chemically reduced status, which results in a low requirement for additional reducing equivalents. In this study, an alternative carbon-utilization pathway was constructed in Escherichia coli to enable more efficient β-carotene production from glycerol. An aldehyde reductase gene (alrd) and an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldH) from Ralstonia eutropha H16 were integrated into the E. coli chromosome to form a novel glycerol-utilization pathway. The β-carotene specific production value was increased by 50% after the introduction of alrd and aldH. It was found that the glycerol kinase gene (garK), alrd and aldH were the bottleneck of the alternative glycerol metabolic pathway, and modulation of garK gene with an mRS library further increased the β-carotene specific production value by 13%. Finally, co-modulation of genes in the introduced aldH–alrd operon led to 86% more of β-carotene specific production value than that of the strain without the alternative glycerol-utilization pathway and the glycerol-utilization rate was also increased. In this work, β-carotene production of E. coli was significantly improved by constructing and optimizing an alternative glycerol-utilization pathway. This strategy can potentially be used to improve the production of other isoprenoids using glycerol as a cheap and abundant substrate, and therefore has industrial relevance. © 2018, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Sorbitol hydrogenolysis in aqueous medium was carried out over Pt based catalysts supported on SiO2-Al2O3 and modified by a second metal (Re, Ir, Rh and Pd). The catalysts were synthetized by two preparation methods, co-impregnation and successive impregnations. The metallic properties of these catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, H2 chemisorption, temperature programmed reduction and by the model reaction in gas phase of cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The acidic properties were characterized by ammonia thermodesorption and by the model reaction in gas phase of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene. The catalytic performances were compared to those of corresponding monometallic catalysts under hydrothermal conditions, in a batch reactor at 240 °C under 60 bar H2 pressure. The main products were poly- and mono‑oxygenated compounds in liquid phase and hydrocarbons in gaseous phase. Among the studied modifiers, Re allowed to promote the catalytic performances of Pt leading to a synergistic effect for the transformation of sorbitol into liquid fuels (hexane). The highest efficiency of the Re-Pt/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst prepared by co-impregnation was explained by an optimal balance between the acidic and metallic functions constituted of bimetallic particles of small size dispersed on the acidic support. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable energy resource consisting of the alkyl monoesters of fatty acids obtained from vegetable oils, waste cooking oils, or animal fats. Biodiesel has been noticed recently as an alternative to fossil fuels. Previous studies have shown that biodiesel produces less pollutants compared to diesel fuel. Biodiesel fuel increases the emission of NOx exceptionally. Recently, it has been found that antioxidant addition to biodiesel is a solution to solve the problem. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of antioxidants addition on the emissions of CO, HC, and NOx from biodiesel fuel. Exhaust emissions of an agriculture diesel engine were studied using biodiesel blend with a 500 ppm propyl gallate (PrG) (propyl-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate) and butylated hydroxy anisole (BhA) (2-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol) as two major antioxidants. Biodiesel used in this research was prepared through NaOH catalyzed transesterification of a waste cooking oil that originally was taken from sunflower oil, with the assistance of ultrasonic homogenizer. After biodiesel production, five blends including neat diesel, B10, B20, B20 + 500 ppm PrG, and B20+ 500 ppm BhA were used as fuel and the emitted gases were analyzed. The results of this work demonstrated that the addition of antioxidants has no significant effect on lowering CO emission, as well as lowering HC; but the addition of antioxidants results in more efficient reduction of NOx emission from diesel exhaust. In general, BhA showed better results compared to PrG. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study presents in-situ upgrading of pyrolysis vapour derived from Napier grass over microporous and mesoporous ZSM-5 catalysts. It evaluates effect of process variables such catalyst–biomass ratio and catalyst type in a vertical fixed bed pyrolysis system at 600 °C, 50 °C/min under 5 L/min nitrogen flow. Increasing catalyst–biomass ratio during the catalytic process with microporous structure reduced production of organic phase bio-oil by approximately 7.0 wt%. Using mesoporous catalyst promoted nearly 4.0 wt% higher organic yield relative to microporous catalyst, which translate to only about 3.0 wt% reduction in organic phase compared to the yield of organic phase from non-catalytic process. GC–MS analysis of bio-oil organic phase revealed maximum degree of deoxygenation of about 36.9% with microporous catalyst compared to the mesoporous catalysts, which had between 39 and 43%. Mesoporous catalysts promoted production olefins and alkanes, normal phenol, monoaromatic hydrocarbons while microporous catalyst favoured the production of alkenes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. There was no significant increase in the production of normal phenols over microporous catalyst due to its inability to transform the methoxyphenols and methoxy aromatics. This study demonstrated that upgrading of Napier grass pyrolysis vapour over mesoporous ZSM-5 produced bio-oil with improved physicochemical properties. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Several studies that have assessed the role of bioenergy in the energy system have primarily focused on electricity, heat, and road transport. However, sectors that have few alternatives to biomass, namely aviation and the chemical industry, are expected to become increasingly important. We have extended a bottom-up energy systems model with fossil-based and bio-based chemicals and with renewable jet fuels to assess the deployment of biomass conversion technologies in the Netherlands until 2030. The model comprises detailed cost-structures and mid-term developments for the energy system with detailed cost-supply curves for biomass, renewable energy technologies, and carbon capture and storage. The framework incorporates multi-output processes, such as biorefineries, to address cross-sectoral synergies. To capture the uncertainty in technical progress, technology development scenarios are used to assess cost-optimal biomass utilization pathways over time. Slow technical progress (LowTech) leads to biomass applications for heating, first-generation biofuels from hydrotreated oils, and bio-based chemicals based on first-generation fermentation systems. Enhanced technology development (HighTech) allows the production of second-generation biofuels, large volumes of diverse bio-based chemicals and renewable jet fuels. The required biomass may range from 230 PJ (LowTech) to 300 PJ (HighTech) in 2030, supplied primarily from imported resources. Both scenarios show that, under existing policies, CO2 emissions will only gradually be reduced to reach 1990 levels (140–145 Mt CO2). Further scenario analysis is recommended to assess model sensitivity and the necessary preconditions for future biomass conversion pathways and robust directions towards the required greenhouse-gas mitigation pathways. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - 78 million tons of residual seagrass deposits accumulate annually on shorelines worldwide. These represent an untapped feedstock for fermentative single-cell oil production, targeted at biofuel and oleochemical generation, without affecting the sensitive marine environment or compromising food security. Seven beach-cast samples of seagrass (related to Z. marina, Z. noltii, S. filiforme, P. australis, P. oceanic, and T. testudinum) were collected from marine ecosystems around the world. A combination of 18S rRNA phylogenetic, structural, and comprehensive biomass analyses of seagrass leaves were applied. The carbohydrate content ranged from 73 to 81 % (w/dwbiomass). Single-step enzymatic hydrolysis was developed to efficiently release the monomeric sugars contained in seagrasses biomass without any pretreatment. P. oceanica hydrolysate allowed for higher lipid yields (6.8 g L−1) compared to the synthetic minimal medium (5.1 g L−1) in shake flasks, and was subsequently utilized as the sole fermentation medium for oleaginous yeast T. oleaginosus at a technical scale using a fed-batch bioreactor, which provided 24.5 g L−1 lipids (0.35 g L−1 h−1). Moreover, the sugar/lipid conversion ratio was 0.41 (w/w). Cumulative data indicates that by exploiting only half of the global beach-cast seagrass, approximately 4 million tons of microbial oils could be generated. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Experimental investigation was conducted on the influence of the presence of alkali compounds such as K and Na present in biofuels on catalytic behaviors of a commercial diesel oxidation catalyst (Pt/Pd/Al2O3) in the monolith form. Doping of different alkali metal components on carrots of monolith was performed. These carrots were physicochemically characterized, and the catalytic tests consisted of series of temperature-programmed surface reactions with representative exhaust gas mixtures from diesel combustion. The aim of the present study is to reveal the effect of the alkali metal on overall catalytic activity of diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and more particularly to show their influence on the reactions involving CO, hydrocarbons, NO, and NO2. Potassium and sodium lead to different catalytic properties. A promotion effect was found in the presence of K, whereas an inhibiting effect was evidenced in the presence of Na or when both Na and K were doped onto the DOC. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Powering future generations of medical and health care devices mandates the transcutaneous transfer of energy or harvesting energy from the human body fluid. Glucose-driven bio fuel cells (bio-batteries) demonstrate promise as they produce electrical energy from glucose, which is a substrate presents in physiological fluids. Enzymatic biofuel cells can convert chemical energy into electrical energy using enzymes as catalysts. In this study, an air bio-battery was developed for healthcare and medical applications, consisting of a glucose-driven enzymatic biofuel cell using a direct gas-permeable membrane or a gas/liquid porous diaphragm. The power generation characteristics included a maximum current density of 285 μA/cm2 and maximum power density of 70.7 μW/cm2 in the presence of 5 mmol/L of glucose in solution. In addition, high-performance, long-term-stabilized power generation was achieved using the gas/liquid porous diaphragm for the reactions between oxygen and enzyme. This system can be powered using 5 mmol/L of glucose, the value of which is similar to that of the blood sugar range in humans. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process can be exploited for the generation of butanol as biofuel, however it does need to overcome its low volumetric solvent productivity before it can commercially compete with fossil fuel technologies. In this regard, mathematical modelling and simulation analysis are tools that can serve as the base for process engineering development of biological systems. In this work, a novel phenomenological kinetic model of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was considered as a benchmark system to evaluate the behaviour of an ABE fermentation under different process configurations using both free and immobilized cells: single stage batch operation, fed-batch, single stage Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) and multistage CSTRs with and without biomass recirculation. The proposed model achieved a linear correlation index r2 = 0.9952 and r2 = 0.9710 over experimental data for free and immobilized cells respectively. The predicted maximum butanol concentration and productivity obtained were 13.08 g·L− 1 and 1.9620 g·L− 1·h− 1 respectively, which represents an increase of 1.01% and 990% versus the currently developed industrial scale process reported currently into the literature. These results provide a reliable platform for the design and optimization of the ABE fermentation system and showcase the adequate predictive nature of the proposed model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ammonia is well suited to favor deprotonation process in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to increase the formation of [M – H] – . Nevertheless, NH 3 may react with carbonyl compounds (aldehyde, ketone) and bias the composition description of the investigated sample. This is of significant importance in the study of complex mixture such as oil or bio-oil. To assess the ability of primary amines to form imines with carbonyl compounds during the ESI-MS process, two aldehydes (vanillin and cinnamaldehyde) and two ketones (butyrophenone and trihydroxyacetophenone) have been infused in an ESI source with ammonia and two different amines (aniline and 3-chloronaniline). The (+) ESI-MS analyses have demonstrated the formation of imine whatever the considered carbonyl compound and the used primary amine, the structure of which was extensively studied by tandem mass spectrometry. Thus, it has been established that the addition of ammonia, in the solution infused in an ESI source, may alter the composition description of a complex mixture and leads to misinterpretations due to the formation of imines. Nevertheless, this experimental bias can be used to identify the carbonyl compounds in a pyrolysis bio-oil. As we demonstrated, infusion of the bio-oil with 3-chloroaniline in ESI source leads to specifically derivatized carbonyl compounds. Thanks to their chlorine isotopic pattern and the high mass measurement accuracy, (+) ESI Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) unambiguously highlighted them from the numerous C x H y O z bio-oil components. These results offer a new perspective into the detailed molecular structure of complex mixtures such as bio-oils.

AB  - In this contribution, one-pot tandem conversion of fructose into biofuel components, including 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), 2,5-(bis(ethoxymethyl)furan (BEMF) and ethyl levulinate (EL), was performed in an in-situ generated catalyst system through consecutive dehydration, etherification, and transfer hydrogenation. Specifically, ZrOCl2⋅8H2O was in-situ decomposed into HCl and ZrO(OH)2 in ethanol, which effectively catalyzed the dehydration/etherification of fructose to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) and subsequent reductive etherification of EMF using ethanol as H-donor, respectively. EMF, BEMF and EL were detected as the main products, and total yield of detectable products of up to 65.4% was obtained at 200 °C in only 2 h. © 2018 Science Press

AB  - In this study, catalytic and non-catalytic fast pyrolysis of dried olive husk and olive kernels was carried out. A bubbling fluidised bed reactor was used for the non-catalytic processing of the solid olive wastes. In-situ catalytic upgrading of biomass fast pyrolysis vapours was performed in a fixed bed bench-scale reactor at 500 °C, for catalyst screening purposes. A maximum bio-oil yield of 47.35 wt.% (on dry biomass) was obtained from non-catalytic fast pyrolysis at a reaction temperature of 450 °C, while the bio-oil yield was decreased at 37.14 wt.% when the temperature was increased to 500 °C. In the case of the fixed bed unit tests, the highest liquid (52.66 wt.%) and organics (30.99 wt.%) yield was achieved with the use of the non-catalytic silica sand. Depending on the catalytic material, the liquid yield ranged from 47.03 to 43.96 wt.% the organic yield from 21.15 to 16.34 wt.% on dry biomass. Solid products were increased from 28.23 wt.% for the non-catalytic run to 32.81 wt.% on dry biomass, when MgO (5% Co) was used. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Removal of oxygen from biomass (deoxygenation) is a significant challenge that needs to be overcome to effectively produce hydrocarbon-based biofuel. The present technology needs extraneous hydrogen (H2) to act as a proton donor, to effectively remove this oxygen. This work is geared toward finding an effective catalyst that accommodates the direct use of methane, instead of H2, for deoxygenation reactions. Here, we studied the impact of three oxides (Ga2O3, MoO3, Cr2O3) and two metals (Pt, Ni) impregnated (at 1, 2 and 5% loadings) on ZSM-5 support on furan conversion, benzene-toluene-ethylbenzene-xylenes (BTEX) selectivity, and coke formation when furan was catalytically pyrolyzed in methane and methane-free environments. The results indicate that Ga-, Pt- and Ni-based catalysts increase BTEX selectivity in a methane environment as opposed to methane-free conditions. The type of metal and the amount of loading had a significant impact on furan conversion as well. Ga/ZSM-5-based catalyst displayed the highest BTEX selectivity, while Ni/ZSM-5 resulted in the highest furan conversion. The results are significant since there is strong evidence of select catalysts’ ability to activate methane and in turn allow furan deoxygenation. This work paves the way to use methane (or natural gas) instead of H2 as a direct proton donor for deoxygenation reactions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this study, acidic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been studied as catalyst in transesterification of soybean oil with methanol to produce biodiesel. p-Toluenesulfonic acid-based deep eutectic solvent (P-DES), composed of p-toluenesulfonic acid and choline chloride (1:3, mol/mol), was found to be an efficient transesterification catalyst for biodiesel production. The optimum conditions for the transesterification process were as follows: 8% P-DES catalyst, 8:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction temperature of 110℃ and 2 h reaction time. The transesterification yield could reach 98.66±0.17%. And the P-DES exhibited as a heterogeneous catalyst after the reaction, which could be separated easily. And P-DES could remove the trace amount of by-product (glycerol) in the final biodiesel product, making this process more simple and cleaner. ©2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Catalytic activity of conducting polymers in biofuel cells has been studied in comparison with the performance of Pt-black (Pt-B). The cells were direct and passive type with structure of biofuel/anode catalyst/Nafion®/cathode catalyst/air. Conducting polymers of polyaniline, polypyrrole and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOTPSS) were examined for the anode and cathode catalysts. L-Ascorbic acid was used as the biofuel, and the Nafion® was served as a proton transfer membrane. In the standard Pt-B anode/Pt-B cathode cell, the typical Voc (open circuit voltage) = 0.52 V, ISC (short circuit current) = 8 mA/cm2 and the Pmax (maximum power density) of approximately 0.8 mW/cm2 were obtained. In a cell with catalysts of PEDOTPSS anode/Pt-B cathode, Voc = 0.55 V and the maximum power density of 1.2 mW/cm2 were obtained, which were larger than that of the standard Pt-B/Pt-B cell. Polyaniline and Polypyrrole were also found to be a potential candidate for catalysts in biofuel cells. © Materials Research Society 2018.

AB  - In this paper, the commercial 5%Pd/C and 5%Pt/C catalysts and synthesized 5%Pt/MN-270 and 5%Pd/MN-270 were used in the hydrogenolysis of lignocellulosic material (softwood sawdust) to obtain liquid fuels in the form of hydrocarbons. As lignin has a very complex structure, anisole was used as a model compound. It was found that the use Pt-containing catalysts based on hypercrosslinked polystyrene in both processes of anisole and lignin-containing feedstock conversion allowed obtaining the highest yield of oxygen-free hydrocarbons (up to 96 wt. %). Besides, the polymer based catalysts showed high stability in hydrogenolysis process in comparison with the commercial carbon based catalysts. Copyright © 2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuel from vegetable oil becomes one of the most suitable and logical alternatives to replace fossil fuel. The research focused on various metal ratio Zinc/Molybdenum/HZSM-5 (Zn-Mo/HZSM-5) catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbon via catalytic hydrocracking of Ceiba penandra oil. The catalytic hydro-cracking process has been applied in this study to crack Ceiba pentandra oil into a gasoil range hydro-carbon using Zn-Mo/HZSM-5 as a catalyst. The effect of various reaction temperature on the catalytic hydrocracking of Ceiba pentandra oil were studied. The Zn-Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst with metal ratio was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. This process used slurry pressure batch reactor with a mechanical stirrer. A series of experiments were carried out in the temperature range from 300-400 oC for 2 h at pressure between 10-15 bar. The conversion and selectivity were estimated. The liquid hydrocarbon product were identified to gasoline, kerosene, and gas oil. The results show that the use of Zn-Mo/HZSM-5 can produce gas oil as the most component in the product. Overall, the highest conver-sion and selectivity of gas oil range hydrocarbon was obtained when the ZnMo/HZSM-5 metal ratio was Zn(2.86 wt.%)-Mo(5.32 wt.%)/HZSM-5 and the name is Zn-Mo/HZSM-5-102. The highest conversion was obtained at 63.31 % and n-paraffin (gas oil range) selectivity was obtained at 90.75 % at a tem-perature of 400 oC. Ceiba pentandra oil can be recommended as the source of inedible vegetable oil to produce gasoil as an environmentally friendly transportation fuel. Copyright © 2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Karanja oil (KO) is widely used for synthesis of bio-fuel karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) due to its competitive price, good energy values and environmentally friendly combustion properties. Bio-lubricant is another value added product that can be synthesized from KO via chemical modification. In this work karanja oil trimethylolpropane ester (KOTMPE) bio-lubricant was synthesized and evaluated for its viscous flow behaviour. A comparison of viscous flow behaviours of natural KO and synthesized bio-fuel KOME and bio-lubricant KOTMPE was also made. The aim of this comparison was to validate the superiority of KOTMPE bio-lubricant over its precursors KO and KOME in terms of stable viscous flow at high temperature and high shear rate conditions usually encountered in engine operations and industrial processes. The free fatty acid (FFA) content of KO was 5.76%. KOME was synthesized from KO in a twostep, acid catalyzed esterification followed by base catalyzed transesterification, process at 65? for 5 hours with oil-methanol ratio 1:6, catalysts H2SO4 and KOH (1 and 1.25% w/w KO, respectively). In the final step, KOTMPE was prepared from KOME via transesterification with trimethylolpropane (TMP) at 150? for 3 hours with KOME-TMP ratio 4:1 and H2SO4 (2% w/w KOME) as catalyst. The viscosity versus temperature studies were made at 0-80? temperatures in shear rate ranges of 10-1000 s-1 using a Discovery Hybrid Rheometer, model HR-3 (TA instruments, USA). The study found that viscosities of all three samples decreased with increase in temperature, though KOTMPE was able to maintain a good enough viscosity at elevated temperatures due to chemical modifications in its molecular structure. The viscosity index (VI) value for KOTMPE was 206.72. The study confirmed that the synthesized bio-lubricant KOTMPE can be used at high temperatures as a good lubricant, though some additives may be required to improve properties other than viscosity. © 2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - To develop green and recyclable catalysts for biodiesel production, herein, a reusable, eco-friendly catalyst was designed by immobilizing an oligomeric ionic liquid inside a SiO2 mesoporous matrix. Then, it was used in transesterification of several natural oils with methanol to produce biodiesel. In this study, the effect of an ionic liquid on the reaction rate has been demonstrated and compared with that of KOH as a routine catalyst for this reaction. The catalyst was characterized by FTIR, XRD, BET, FESEM, TEM, and TGA techniques. The effect of different parameters, such as temperature, molar ratio of methanol/oil, and amount of catalyst, was investigated to optimize the reaction conditions. The results showed that after 8 h of reaction at 60 °C with a methanol/oil molar ratio of 8 : 1 and 50 mg of the catalyst, the yield of methyl ester reached 96%. The reaction was also conducted in an autoclave at 200 °C, and the conversion after 1 h was over 97%. More importantly, due the SiO2 coating, the catalyst could be successfully recovered, and the catalyst could be used repeatedly for at least 5 cycles without any significant loss of activity. In particular, we were able to heterogenize a water soluble basic catalyst that was not soluble in methanol and separate it from the reaction mixture very easily. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Distillate of upgraded palm biodiesel was blended in different volume percentages (5, 10, 15, and 20%) with jet A-1. The mixture can be used as a replacement for petroleum Jet fuel. Physical properties of blends were measured and compared with those of jet A-1. Empirical equations were developed to predict the properties of blended fuel, including density, kinematic viscosity, freezing point, H/C ratio, and acid value. The statistical analysis indicated that the proposed equations predictions agree well with the experimental data. The predicted model shows an (R2) between 0.99–0.98, indicating good fitting between the experimental data and proposed model. The distillate of upgraded palm biodiesel was miscible with the kerosene jet A-1 in all volume fractions under study 5–20%. The economic analysis shows that the production cost per unit of the produced bio jet fuel was much higher than the selling price of the petroleum jet fuel. This price difference is due to the raw materials cost; as the palm oil used is nearly three times that of crude oil. The economic evaluation study reveals that the operating cost of prepared bio jet equals to 2360 $/ton, which is a promising result. © 2017

AB  - Abstract: Catalytic cracking of vegetable oils is an alternative method for the production of biofuels. The use of catalysts such as MCM-41 with zirconium results in the presence of acid sites that favor the cracking reactions, where their catalytic activity can be evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis. The present work aimed to prepare and determine the physicochemical properties of a catalyst based on MCM-41 incorporated with different percentages of zirconium. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, adsorption and desorption of N2, energy-dispersive X-ray, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG). In addition, their catalytic behavior has been evaluated in the catalytic cracking of sunflower oil, through the TG/DTG/DSC thermal analysis techniques. The amount of the zirconium oxide incorporated into MCM-41 support has not destroyed the typical structure of MCM-41, and the insertion promoted a change to the pore diameter and pore volume, indicating the presence of oxide inside the pores and on the external area. All catalysts developed activity in sunflower oil cracking, even at low percentage of ZrO2, especially the Zr2-MCM-41 sample, which obtained more efficiency. Thus, all catalysts are promising for use in cracking, and thermogravimetric analysis has been proved effective for monitoring the catalytic activity. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Bleaching earth is used to remove colour, phospholipids, oxidized products, metals and residual gums in the palm oil process refinery. Once adsorption process end, the spent bleaching earth (SBE) which contains approximately 20-40 wt. % of the adsorbed oil was usually disposed to landfills. The oil content in SBE was recovered by catalytic cracking using transition metal (Cu, Zn, Cr, and Ni) doped HZSM-5 zeolite in a batch reactor (pyrolysis zone) and fixed bed reactor (catalyst bed). The 5 wt. % of each metallic was introduced in HZSM-5 zeolite using incipient wetness impregnation method. The main objective of this study was to investigate the performance of modified HZSM-5 zeolite for cracking of residual oil in SBE. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized using XRD, FTIR, Nitrogen adsorption, and TPD-NH3. Liquid biofuel obtained from cracking was analyzed by GC-MS. The incorporation of metallic loaded on HZSM-5 zeolite has reduced the surface area of the catalyst that gives a significant impact to the catalytic behavior. The Ni/HZSM-5 zeolite exhibited the highest yields of alkenes as compared to others but slightly decreases the yield of alkanes whereas in contrast with the Cr/HZSM-5, the obtained alkanes were found higher than that of alkenes. In addition, the Cr/HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5 favored the conversion of polycyclic aromatics to monoaromatics, whereas parent HZSM-5 catalyst favored the formation of poly-aromatics. These results indicated that the metal loaded on HZSM-5 can promote the cracking of heavy fractions to lighter hydrocarbon thus can be used for cracking oil in SBE. Copyright © 2018 BCREC Group.

AB  - The pyrolysis of almond shell as a biomass feedstock was performed in order to obtain a bio-based feedstock for bio-refineries in a fixed-bed reactor under inert atmosphere (occurred by N2 gas) at certain experimental conditions including 500 °C of temperature and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Then, the catalytic cracking of obtained pyrolytic liquid was conducted by using bentonite clay as a low-cost catalyst material at the conditions of 400 °C of temperature, a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and catalyst ratio of 30 wt%. The upgraded bio-oil revealed the properties of a basic fuel including 4.01 cSt of viscosity at the temperature of 40 °C; approximately 45.22% lower than that of non-upgraded bio-oil, low density of 1100.78 kg m−3 at 15.6 °C, H/C molar ratio of 1.413 and calorific value (HHV) of 26.92 MJ kg−1. The results of the chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis of the obtained bio-oils have revealed that the presence of bentonite clay led to a considerable increase in some organic compound groups such as phenolic, ketones, and oxygenated aromatics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Corncob degradation is an issue that needs to be address for it to be further utilized as bioenergy. We explored a new comprehensive degradation strategy for corncob. First, restaurant wastewater was used to improve the corncob biochemical characteristics and partly degrade the lignocelluloses. After the restaurant wastewater treatment, the residue was converted using black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), and the supernatant was utilized for biogas production by anaerobic fermentation. The highest product rates of glucose, xylose, and arabinose were obtained at the optimal corncob soaking condition at 75 °C, 5 h, and 60 g/L from lignocellulose. The soaking residue was converted using BSFL for 10 days, and 24.34% grease yield was extracted. The soaking residue can be utilized by BSFL and produce grease, which is similar to other wastes such as rice straw and pig manure. The corncob soaking supernatant was utilized for biogas production by anaerobic fermentation. The degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin reached about 27.34%, 45.14%, and 29.33%, respectively. A total of 500 mL supernatant mixed with 30% anaerobic sludge under 35 ± 2 °C produced about 7.52 L of biogas with about 3.22 L methane. In conclusion, the above comprehensive process can effectively degrade lignocellulose in corncob and obtain two bioenergy products, namely insect grease and biogas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To reduce the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change, scientific efforts have sought to develop biofuels and bio-based commodity chemicals as petrochemical replacements primarily for their environmental benefits. As the biological design space is far greater than chemical synthesis, there has been a drive to leverage this ability to create and replace fine and specialty chemicals. While polyketide synthases have traditionally been studied for their biosynthesis of pharmaceutical chemicals, the unique advantages of engineering polyketide synthases for the production of biofuels, commodity chemicals, and both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical fine and specialty chemicals are discussed. With our increased understanding of polyketide biosynthetic logic, new computational tools for prospective polyketide synthesis pathways for the creation of existing and novel biochemicals are also outlined. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 4201–4207, 2018. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Ru/TiO2 are promising heterogeneous catalysts in different key-reactions taking place in the catalytic conversion of biomass towards fuel additives, biofuels, or biochemicals. TiO2 supported highly dispersed nanometric-size metallic Ru catalysts were prepared at room temperature via a solar light induced photon-assisted one-step synthesis in liquid phase, far smaller Ru nanoparticles with sharper size distribution being synthesized when compared to the catalysts that were prepared by impregnation with thermal reduction in hydrogen. The underlying strategy is based on the redox photoactivity of the TiO2 semi-conductor support under solar light for allowing the reduction of metal ions pre-adsorbed at the host surface by photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of the semi-conductor in order to get a fine control in terms of size distribution and dispersion, with no need of chemical reductant, final thermal treatment, or external hydrogen. Whether acetylacetonate or chloride was used as precursor, 0.6 nm sub-nanometric metallic Ru particles were synthesized on TiO2 with a sharp size distribution at a low loading of 0.5 wt.%. Using the chloride precursor was necessary for preparing Ru/TiO2 catalysts with a 0.8 nm sub-nanometric mean particle size at 5 wt.% loading, achieved in basic conditions for benefitting from the enhanced adsorption between the positively-charged chloro-complexes and the negatively-charged TiO2 surface. Remarkably, within the 0.5-5 wt.% range, the Ru content had only a slight influence on the sub-nanometric particle size distribution, thanks to the implementation of suitable photo-assisted synthesis conditions. We demonstrated further that a fine control of the metal Ru nanoparticle size on the TiO2 support was possible via a controlled nanocluster growth under irradiation, while the nanoparticles revealed a good resistance to thermal sintering. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuels such as renewable alkanes and higher alcohols have drawn considerable interests for the use in internal combustion engines. Especially, higher alcohols could be used as a blending agent for diesel fuels. Herein, carbon supported phosphated ruthenium-molybdenum (RuMoP) catalysts were employed in continuous trickle-bed reactor for converting sorbitol into renewable alkanes and higher alcohols. The results showed that RuMoP on an active carbon (AC) support presented a complete sorbitol conversion and high yields of alkanes and alcohols in gasoline and diesel range. Subsequently, carbon nanotube (CNT) supported RuMoP was prepared and studied in detail for comparison. RuMoP/CNT presented a low C−C bond cracking property in sorbitol conversion and high selectivity of C6 products in gas-phase (C6 alkane, 74.7 %) and oil-phase (C6 alkane and alcohols, 87.8 %). Finally, detailed characterizations (N2-adsorption, XRD, HRTEM, XPS, NH3-TPD, Py-IR spectrums, etc.) were performed over relevant catalysts (RuMoP/C and RuMoP/CNT) for correlating their catalytic and physicochemical properties. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The concerns over the depletion of fossil fuel and security of energy supply have directed an increasing awareness about biomass or waste-derived energy. Fresh bleaching earth (BE) is used to remove colour, phospholipids, oxidised products, metals, and residual gums in the palm oil process refinery. Once the adsorption process ends, the spent bleaching earth (SBE) which contains approximately 20-40 wt% of the adsorbed oil, is usually disposed to landfills without any treatment. Thus, SBE as one of the major biomasses or wastes available in Malaysia is a potential source for hydrocarbon fuel production. Therefore, this study reported the employment of heterogeneous catalyst cracking of residual palm oil in SBE into liquid products by 15%Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst and the optimisation of the process. The experiments were designed using central composite design (CCD) approach via response surface methodology (RSM) to study the relationships of catalytic cracking temperature (400- 500°C), heating time (60-180 min), and nitrogen flow rate (60-100 mL/min) on the liquid products yield. The experimental results were thoroughly analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The optimum liquid products yield of catalytic cracking of residual palm oil in SBE was 12.91 wt% achieved at 452°C, 160 min of heating time, and 86 mL/min of nitrogen flow rate. On the basis of the obtained results, the heterogeneous catalyst of 15%Ni/HZSM-5 could be a potential catalyst for the conversion of residual palm oil in SBE into liquid products. © 2018 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.

AB  - This study reports the importance of polymerization reactions during the pyrolysis of acid-impregnated glucose at 60-150 °C. The experimental results demonstrate that polymerization reactions are the dominant reactions to produce oligosaccharides of various linkages and degrees of polymerization (DP) during acid-catalyzed glucose pyrolysis at low temperatures. The maximal DP of the oligosaccharide products depends on pyrolysis temperature, i.e., from ∼4 at 60 °C to ∼18 at 120 °C. As the major primary products, the disaccharides of various α and β linkages (including 1,6-, 1,4-, 1,3-, 1,2- and 1,1-glycosidic bond) have been successfully identified, indicating that mutarotation reactions also play important roles in acid-catalyzed glucose pyrolysis. Due to the high reactivity of the hydroxyl group on C6, disaccharides with 1,6-glycosidic bond (i.e., gentiobiose and isomaltose) are more favorably formed with high initial selectivities, i.e., ∼27 and ∼20% for gentiobiose and isomaltose at an acid loading of 0.5 mmol/g, respectively. The formation of α-linkage disaccharides follows an order of 1,6-glycosidic bond > 1,4-glycosidic bond > 1,3-glycosidic bond > 1,2-glycosidic bond > 1,1-glycosidic bond. An increase in acid loading enhances the formation of disaccharides, especially those with 1,6-glycosidic bond. The experimental results reported in the study provide new insights into acid-catalyzed glucose pyrolysis mechanism for the development of advanced pyrolysis technologies to produce biofuels and biochemicals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of biobased heterogeneous solid Brønsted acid catalysts with perfect spherical microstructures are successfully fabricated directly from waste Camellia oleifera shells by a simple hydrothermal carbonization-annealing-sulfonation process. 350 °C low temperature annealing process helps to increase the activity of the catalyst due to the simultaneous maintenance of the spherical microstructure and aromatic carbon framework. As a renewable catalyst with low cost, the as-prepared materials are successfully applied on the synthesis of green renewable liquid biofuel 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) directly from fructose. In the catalytic test, the influences of reaction time and temperature, fructose concentration, and adding amount of the catalyst on the yield of EMF are investigated systematically. As a result, the optimal reaction temperature is 100 °C, the EMF yield monotonically increases with prolonging the reaction time from 3 to 24 h, the optimal fructose concentration is 0.5 mmol, and the EMF yield gradually increases with increasing the adding amount of the catalyst from 50 to 150 mg. In addition, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit considerably high stability in the current EMF synthesis system, and they can maintain a similar level of reactivity after four catalytic cycles. © 2018 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - One of the problems with the use of enzymes as catalysts in biofuel cells is to achieve good contact between the enzyme and the electrode surface. One solution to this problem is the use of various nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene derivatives, gold nanoparticles, as well as mediators for the construction of electrodes. Acetosyringone and promazine adsorbed on glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) covered with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and laccase were used as biocathodes. These mediators showed very efficient adsorption on modified glassy carbon electrodes covered with MWCNTs and enabled efficient and stable adsorption of laccase, which acts as the bioelectrocatalyst. Very good electrical contact between the electrode surface and the laccase enzymatic active sites made it possible to increase the catalytic current density of oxygen-reduction by about 82% compared to electrodes without mediators. Application of acetosyringone and promazine used in the construction of biocathode also improved the current and power of the biobattery ca. twice comparing to the system without mediators. The device output reached the power that equaled approximately 2 mW/cm2 at 0.8 V and open circuit potential (OCP) was 1.6 V. The systems elaborated proved also useful in oxygen sensing and allowed to determine lower oxygen concentrations in solution compared to the GCE modified with MWCNTs and laccase alone. The electrode showed also better stability in long-timescale measurements. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - With an appropriate treatment, cellulose, as one of the main constituents of biomass, is a rich source of chemicals and fuels. Pyrolysis is a method whereby bio-oils can be formed at moderate temperatures and with the addition of a catalyst the composition of the bio-oil can be enhanced. Nanostructured ZnO is a mild catalyst for the pyrolysis of cellulose to bio-oils and with the addition of copper to the structure of ZnO the catalytic properties can be improved. The pyrolytic degradation of cellulose over ZnO/Cu doped nanocatalysts has been studied over the temperature range 400–800 °C with calculation of kinetic parameters. The results showed that with ZnO/2% Cu and ZnO/7% Cu, which had been heat-treated at 1000 °C, the yields significantly increased at 600 and 700 °C and the main components were aldehydes. In contrast, ZnO/Cu nanocatalysts prepared at 200 °C mostly generated ketones. The increasing amount of copper increased or decreased the content of some components at specific temperatures. The results demonstrated that ZnO/Cu nanocatalysts with different proportions of copper prepared and heat-treated at different temperatures affected the composition of the bio-oil. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This article analyses the integration of distributed biocrude production facilities using fast pyrolysis with solar photovoltaic (PV) for dispatchable electricity production. The strong growth of intermittent electricity generation from solar PV and wind is leading to a greater need for energy storage at grid scale and dynamic demand management. Various forms of energy storage, including electrochemical (e.g. batteries), mechanical (e.g. flywheels) and gravitational (e.g. pumped-hydro), are being developed. This work studies the issues of integrating fast pyrolysis of biomass to produce biocrude that can be readily stored in tanks and combusted to produce electricity when required to supplement the electricity generation from a solar PV unit to meet an arbitrary energy demand curve. The use of biomass pyrolysis in this application has a range of benefits, including the flexibility to augment intermittent renewables, the integration of more bioenergy into the electricity sector and the creation of commercial quantities of biocrudes that can be refined into renewable transport fuels such as jet fuel for which few other alternatives exist. Biocrudes, especially partially upgraded, can be stored and used when required in engines and gas turbines, making them a suitable fuel for augmenting the intermittent nature of solar and wind projects. The development of the distributed 100% renewable power stations using a mix of biomass/ biocrude and solar PV and/or wind would also increase the certainty of supply, knowledge of quality and price of raw biocrudes that can also be used to supply a centralized biorefinery, thereby substantially reducing the risk of investing in new biorefinery capacity. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Microalgae could be of importance for future biodiesel production as an alternative for a third generation of biofuels. To select the most appropriate strain for biodiesel production, three microalgae species, namely Isochrysis sp., Nannochloropsis maritima and Tetraselmis sp., isolated from Tunisian coast, were biochemically characterized. Initially, gas chromatography analysis showed that Isochrysis sp. and N. maritima contained 5- and 10-fold total fatty acids, respectively, more than Tetraselmis sp. Then, the two microalgae Isochrysis sp. and N. maritima were subject to random mutagenesis using ultraviolet-C radiation. Subsequently, a total of 18 mutants were obtained from both species. The neutral lipid evaluation on said 18 mutants allowed the retention of only 7 to further fatty acid characterization. Finally, gas chromatography revealed that the mutant 5c Isochrysis sp. was characterized by a high level of saturated fatty acids (52.3%), higher amount of monounsaturated fatty acids (29.3%), lower level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (18.4%) and a significant 1.3-fold increase in its C16–C18 content compared to the wild-type strain, which would make it an interesting candidate for biofuel production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Microalgae have a high potential as a feedstock for the production of biofuels, either indirectly, through the extraction of lipids, which can be transformed into biodiesel, or directly via whole cell conversion using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Both approaches have disadvantages, due to the high cost of cultivating microalgae with sufficient lipid content (>40%), while the whole cell conversion produces low quality oils, which require significant further upgrading. This work investigated the possibility of realising the benefits of both processes, by studying the liquefaction reaction of a lipid-extracted algae hydrolysate. Methods: In order to enhance oil yields, the reaction was conducted in the presence of varying loadings of iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) and applied two waste steel furnace residues as potential liquefaction catalysts. Results: Primarily, The lipid extraction process needs to be optimized to reduce the amount of acid contaminant within the liquefaction medium. For the HTL process, the addition of 50 vol% IPA resulted in remarkably high oil yields of up to 60.2 wt% on an organic basis, whereas the two furnace residues had no positive effect on the product distribution, and instead favoured the formation of solid reaction products. Nevertheless, the results suggested that the presence of iron potentially reduced the nitrogen and oxygen content of the bio-oil. Conclusions: As such, HTL is a suitable method for valorising lipid-extracted algal biomass, where the bio-oil yields can be enhanced substantially by using IPA in conjunction with the water. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract: This paper studied the effect of alcohols on simultaneous esterification and alkylation reactions designed for the upgrading of bio-oil, and the separation of upgraded oil. The upgrading of bio-oil was performed in an autoclave with Amberlyst-36 as the catalyst, and methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol as the alcoholic solvents. The separation of various chemical components, such as unreacted solvents, water phase, extraction phase, and high value-added chemicals, in the upgraded oil were realized via distillation, at 80–90 °C (at 0.01 MPa) vacuum distillation and an extraction process. The results showed that, the simultaneous esterification and alkylation reactions for the upgrading of bio-oil not only restrained the acetylation reaction of aldehydes, which increased the relative contents of stable ethers, but also enhanced the oil soluble components of the upgraded bio-oil. After separation, the high value-added chemical, namely methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside, was obtained with 5.39 wt.% yield and a relative content of 88.9% (sugar phase). The results from this work also showed that this novel method was quite a promising technique for upgrading bio-oil together with the separation of the high value-added chemical.

AB  - Biomass-derived fuels are emerging alternatives to fossil fuels because of their renewability and better carbon balance. Fuel researchers from Zhejiang University have developed and improved a catalytic method of converting rice husk to biofuels mainly composed of ethanol, ethyl acetate, and acetone. Optimization of the catalytic production process so that the final fuel has good combustion characteristics is something that requires detailed investigation. This study evaluates the laminar burning features of two fuels produced by the catalytic reaction. These two fuels are ETEAAC211 and ETEAAC121 (ETEAAC211, 50 vol % ethanol, 25 vol % ethyl acetate, and 25 vol % acetone; ETEAAC121, 25 vol % ethanol, 50 vol % ethyl acetate, and 25 vol % acetone). The experiment was conducted in outward propagating spherical flames at T0 of 358 K, P0 of 0.1 MPa, and equivalence ratios (φ) of 0.7-1.4. Moreover, the flame intrinsic hydrodynamic and thermal diffusion instabilities are assessed and discussed. It was noticed that the peak laminar burning velocity of the fuels occurred at φ of 1.1. The hydrodynamic instability reached its peak at φ of 1.1 as a result of the thin flame thickness and the high density ratio of burned/unburned mixtures. The Markstein length decreased with the equivalence ratio. However, the Markstein length decreased below zero at φ of 1.4 for ethyl acetate and ETEAAC121, showing the increased thermal diffusion instability as the equivalence ratio increases. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Conversion of the carboxylic acids in bio-oil into ketones via decarboxylation is a highly efficient approach for bio-oil upgrading. However, the char formation during decarboxylation is due to the existence of a considerable amount of pyrolytic sugars in bio-oil, which severely weakens the upgraded bio-oil yield and the energy efficiency. In this paper, two pretreatment approaches, hydrolysis and oxidative hydrolysis, were employed to solve this problem. The pyrolytic sugars in bio-oil were firstly enriched into the water-soluble fraction through water extraction, followed by hydrolysis or oxidative hydrolysis pretreatment before decarboxylation. With the aid of hydrolysis pretreatment, the upgraded bio-oil yield was increased from 27.55 to 30.74%, and the energy efficiency was increased from 77.59 to 88.67% after decarboxylation, whereas the char yield was decreased from 5.67 to 3.81% in comparison with the results without hydrolysis. In the case of oxidative hydrolysis pretreatment, the upgraded bio-oil yield and the energy efficiency were further enhanced to be 32.68% and 92.70% respectively, while the char yield was drastically decreased to only 1.15%. To clarify the effect of the pretreatment, two pentoses and four hexoses were used to investigate the reaction pathways for their conversion in the water-soluble fraction during hydrolysis or oxidative hydrolysis pretreatment. The experimental results showed that hydrolysis of the water-soluble fraction could effectively convert pyrolytic sugars to carboxylic acids. In contrast, oxidative hydrolysis could convert not only the pyrolytic sugars, but also most of the aldehydes and ketones in the water-soluble fraction into carboxylic acids. The reaction pathways for conversion of pentose and hexose into organic acids via oxidative hydrolysis were also investigated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In thisstudy, catalytic effect of intrinsic inorganics was evaluated by comparing pyrolysis end products obtained from pyrolysis of olive pomace (OP) in three different initial weights (30,100 and 200 g). Pyrolysis of OP with higher weights led to self-catalyzing pyrolysis resulting in approximately 20% bio-oil quantity increment when pyrolyzed OP weight increased from 30 g to 200 g. Additionally, both intrinsic inorganic percentages remained in pyrolysis chars and organic compounds in pyrolysis liquids altered with pyrolyzed OP weights. While the lowest inorganic percentage in chars was found at the pyrolysis of the highest OP weight, the highest belonged to 30 g OP pyrolysis. Moreover, while oxygenated compounds, namely aldehydes and ketones, in pyrolysis bio-oil decreased explicitly at 200 g OP pyrolysis, variety in alkane and alkene compounds enhanced at higher weights OP pyrolysis. Finally, the effects of temperature, heating rate and retention time on pyrolysis products were evaluated. Results showed that liquid products increased at 5 °C/min heating rate and decreased at 1 °C/min heating rate as pyrolysis temperature increased from 450 to 600 °C in the pyrolysis without retention time. However, reverse tendency was observed in liquid product quantities in the case of pyrolysis with retention time. Furthermore, while effect of temperature increment on pyrolysis gas and liquid was mostly opposite to each other in all pyrolysis conditions, bio-chars’ quantity irregularly altered as to pyrolysis conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Excessive amounts of oxy-functional groups in unprocessed bio-oil vitiate its quality as fuel; therefore, it has to be channelized to upgrading processes, and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation is one of the most suitable routes for the upgrading of crude bio-oil. In this computational work, catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol, which is an important phenolic compound of crude bio-oil, has been carried out using density functional theory (DFT) over a Pd(111) catalyst. The Pd(111) catalyst surface does not endorse direct eliminations of functional groups of guaiacol; however, it is found to perform excellently in stepwise dehydrogenation reactions of oxy-functionals of guaiacol according to present DFT results. The catechol product, formed through dehydrogenation of the methoxy group, followed by elimination of CH2 and association of the hydrogen atom, has been identified as one of the major products. The overall reaction rate is controlled by scission of CH2 from 2-methylene-oxy-phenol with an activation energy demand of 23.06 kcal mol–1. Further, the kinetic analysis of each reaction step involved in HDO of guaiacol over the Pd(111) catalyst surface has also been carried out at atmospheric pressure and at a wide range of temperatures from 473 to 673 K, with temperature intervals of 50 K. In the kinetic analysis part, various kinetic parameters, such as forward and reverse reaction rate constants, Arrhenius constants, and equilibrium rate constants, are reported. The kinetic modeling of the dominating reaction steps has revealed that even a lower temperature of 473 K provides a favorable reaction environment; and the temperature increment further improves the reaction favorability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Most of the commercially available pyrolysis plants use fluidized bed technologies where bio-oil is the major product and the biochar produced is combusted for process heat. However, auger-based technologies are now gaining importance because of their small to medium scale of operation and decentralized nature where biochar is obtained as a by-product. One of the factors which may greatly influence the techno-economic viability of such decentralized plants is making high-grade carbon from pyrolytic biochar. In the present study, Jatropha and Karanja oil seed cake-based biochar is obtained as a by-product in a pilot-scale (20 kg/h) direct gas-fired auger pyrolysis process at 500 °C under fast pyrolysis conditions that is originally aimed at maximizing the bio-oil yield. The biochar has low surface area and porosity. To value add to this carbon, downstream physical and chemical activation are carried out in an externally heated laboratory-scale reactor. CO2 activation resulted in the formation of activated carbon with BET surface area up to ~ 200 m2/g with marginal improvement in porosity, while K2CO3 activation enhanced the surface area to as high as 2400 m2/g along with substantial enhancement of porosity. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The combustion of biomass can be both CO2 neutral and economically beneficial. One major negative aspect are the gaseous and particle emissions that are formed by inorganic precursors in the biomass. These inorganic elements also cause slag formation. Short rotation coppice (SRC) willow wood contains a relatively large proportion of these precursors. This paper investigates the potential of low temperature Microwave Assisted Hydrothermal Carbonization (MAHC) for the reduction of emission precursors in SRC willow wood. Most of the respective elements were significantly reduced at the selected temperatures of 150 °C, 170 °C, and 185 °C. The most efficient combination of energy input, increasing heating value and decreasing mineral content was obtained at 170 °C. This shows the high potential of the MAHC treatment for utilizing low quality biomass as biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increasing concerns on environmental and economic issues linked to fossil fuel use has driven great interest in cyanobacteria as third-generation biofuel agents. In this study, the biodiesel potential of a model photosynthetic cyanobacterium, Fremyella diplosiphon, was identified by fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) via direct transesterification. Total lipids in wild type (Fd33) and halotolerant (HSF33-1 and HSF33-2) strains determined by gravimetric analysis yielded 19% cellular dry weight (CDW) for HSF33-1 and 20% CDW for HSF33-2, which were comparable to Fd33 (18% CDW). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry detected a high ratio of saturated to unsaturated FAMEs (2.48–2.61) in transesterified lipids, with methyl palmitate being the most abundant (C16:0). While theoretical biodiesel properties revealed high cetane number and oxidative stability, high cloud and pour point values indicated that fuel blending could be a viable approach. Significantly high FAME abundance in total transesterified lipids of HSF33-1 (40.2%) and HSF33-2 (69.9%) relative to Fd33 (25.4%) was identified using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry, indicating that robust salt stress response corresponds to higher levels of extractable FAME. Alkanes, a key component in conventional fuels, were present in F. diplosiphon transesterified lipids across all strains confirming that natural synthesis of these hydrocarbons is not inhibited during biodiesel production. While analysis of photosynthetic pigments and phycobiliproteins did not reveal significant differences, FAME abundance varied significantly in wild type and halotolerant strains indicating that photosynthetic pathways are not the sole factors that determine fatty acid production. We characterize the potential of F. diplosiphon for biofuel production with FAME yields in halotolerant strains higher than the wild type with no loss in photosynthetic pigmentation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass and downstream processing represents an attractive alternative in biomass-to-liquid fuels (BtL) production. There are several thermochemical conversion routes that not only can produce fossil-like fuels but also can simultaneously produce a wider range of fuels in terms of gasoline and diesel profiles. In this work, synthesis, evaluation, and integration of conversion of softwood biomass to liquid transportation fuels are investigated within a systematic framework. Five BtL conversion processes were presented by combining promising thermochemical conversion, upgrading, and separation technologies. Process flowsheet setups and simulations are performed with Aspen Plus version 8.8. The total production processes are evaluated with both products profiles and costs indicators for capital, energy, and total annual costs. Finally, opportunities for process integration to improve the process performance are explored for four integration scenarios. The base case processes with and without integrations were compared to quantify the effect of the integrations on the total annual cost (TAC) and emissions. It was obtained that energy and mass integration could reduce the TAC of the gasification-LTFT-fractional upgrading-fractionation process by 25% and liquid and gas emissions by 97% (wt) and 43% (wt), respectively. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is the major halogen source in municipal solid waste (MSW) and its recycling is problematic. PVC can not only cause various environmental problems by releasing halogens, but also negatively impact other MSW compositions during waste to energy conversion. For instance, co-pyrolysis of biomass with PVC increases solid residue and promotes the formation of CO and CO2 from cellulose. Herein, we report an approach to dehydrochlorinate PVC while simultaneously enhancing the production of valuable chemicals from cellulose. Specifically, cellulose and PVC were co-converted in tetrahydrofuran (THF). It was found that co-conversion of cellulose with PVC significantly increased liquid yield from cellulose and shortened the conversion time compared to converting cellulose alone. Levoglucosan was the major product from cellulose and its highest yield of 40% was achieved with 2.5 wt% of PVC at 335 °C after only 8 min of reaction. We have shown that the in-situ generated HCl derived from PVC decomposition serves as acid catalyst to enhance glycosidic bond cleavage in cellulose. Moreover, using a THF/water co-solvent could further enhance the conversion rate and increased liquid yield to a maximum of 92.55%. Pyrolysis of the solid residue did not release chlorinated organics, suggesting that PVC was fully dechlorinated in THF. The present study may be applied to convert PVC-containing, cellulose rich MSW for higher valued products in environmentally friendly approach. © 2018

AB  - In this study, solid coconut waste and CaO/PVA was used as raw material and catalyst respectively to produce biodiesel through in situ transesterification. Both, raw material and catalyst were packed in a packed bed reactor. The reaction was fixed for 3 h and the mixing was kept constant at 350 rpm. The highest biodiesel yield of 95% was obtained at reaction temperature of 61 °C with catalyst loading (CaO/PVA) of 2.29 wt% and methanol to solid ratio of 12:1. CaO-waste derived catalyst has been successfully proven to be utilized as heterogeneous base catalyst for the production of biodiesel from solid coconut waste. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new in-situ transesterification method was developed for wet biomass: K2CO3 was used as an alkaline catalyst and, Aurantiochytrium sp. KRS 101 as oleaginous DHA-producing microalgae. It was found that the presence of water greatly impaired the overall efficiency even with the powerful catalyst that had worked surpassingly well with dry biomass, and thus a mechanical aid like ultrasonication was needed to make advantage of full potential of the alkaline catalyst. The total fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) recovery yield of 94.6% was achieved with sonication at 100 g/L of biomass (40% moisture), 3% of K2CO3, 70 °C and 30 min. All these suggest that the ultrasound assisted in-situ transesterification can offer a feasible means for FAEE recovery and it was so by way of overcoming the physical limitation of mass transfer caused the presence of water and providing effective contacts between reactants. © 2018

AB  - Fast pyrolysis bio-oil was employed as a source of phenolic compounds in the production of a bio-based polymeric network. The bio-oil was reacted with epichlorohydrin in alkaline medium using benzyltriethylammonium chloride as a phase transfer catalyst. The amount of free phenolic hydroxyl groups before and after modification was quantified through 31P-NMR spectroscopy; and the epoxy content of the bio-oil upon the chemical functionalization was measured by means of a titration using HBr in acetic acid solution. Grafting of epoxy functions onto the monomer`s structure was studied by FTIR. Likewise, α-resorcylic acid was also modified with reactive epoxy moieties, and used as low molecular weight comonomer. The epoxidized derivatives of the bio-oil were cured in epoxy polymers with 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Thermo-mechanical characterization showed that the obtained materials behave as thermoset amorphous polymers, exhibiting modulus values ranging from approximately 1.5–3.4 GPa at room temperature and glass transition temperatures above 100°C.

AB  - Ferulic acid, representing phenolic fraction of bio-oil, is considered to be a model compound in this study for its decomposition into various end products such as ethylbenzene, eugenol, cis-isoeugenol, vanillin, 4-ethylguaiacol, guaiacol, and acetovanillone using density functional theory approach. Results of bond dissociation energies indicate that cleavage of methyl group from ferulic acid is the lowest energy-demanding bond scission amongst all 14 bond cleavages. Primary end product by decomposition of ferulic acid is found to be ethylbenzene and its production occurs through the formation of intermediate products such as 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, cinnamic acid and styrene. Demethoxylation of ferulic acid gives rise to the production of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid which further undergoes the formation of cinnamic acid by dehydroxylation reaction route. The formation of cinnamic acid in this study is carried out using three reaction schemes 1–3 and its further reduction to ethylbenzene is performed using two reaction possibilities. Finally, favourable pathway is found to be decarboxylation of cinnamic acid to produce vinylbenzene followed by the production of ethylbenzene using hydrogenation of C=C chain double bond. Furthermore, thermochemistry of each reaction scheme is performed at atmospheric pressure and at a wide range of temperature of 598–898 K. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Hydrogen is highly demanded in biorefinery, and hydrogen production from renewable sources is essential to produce truly green transportation fuels from biomass. The present work demonstrates experimentally the production of high pressure H2 with high purity by pressure swing sorption enhanced steam reforming (PS-SESR) of the byproducts from biorefinery. Pure hydrogen was produced by one-pot high pressure sorption enhanced reforming of a mixture of acetic acid (AA), glycolaldehyde (Gl) and hydroxyacetone (Hy), as model of the byproducts obtained from biomass fast-hydropyrolysis, which is integrated in the H2Bioil process, aimed at producing liquid transportations fuels. SESR was performed using Pd/Ni-Co derived from a hydrotalcite-like material as catalyst and dolomite as CO2 acceptor. Both thermodynamic analysis and experimental study revealed enhanced hydrogen purity but lower hydrogen yield at high pressure compared to atmospheric pressure. Moreover, a compromise between pressure and temperature is needed to get high purity and yield of hydrogen. A H2 purity as high as 99.6 vol% can be obtained at atmospheric pressure and 550 °C, while a H2 purity of 99.0 vol% can be reached at 5 bar and 600 °C. Under these conditions, the H2 yield is of 92.3% at 1 bar and 92.6% at 5 bar. These results show that the SESR of the biomass-derived compounds is an efficient method for the production of highly pure, hot and high pressure hydrogen, which is required for the overall process studied. According to the thermodynamic analysis, and given that the process is performed at high pressure, a pressure swing decarbonation process is suggested for the sorbent regeneration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Whereas the study of interfaces and thin films with the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is well established, biofilms have proven to be a difficult subject for the QCM. The main problem is that the shear wave emanating from the resonator surface does not usually reach to the top of the sample. This problem can be solved with torsional resonators. These have a resonance frequency in the range of tens of kHz, which is much below the frequency of the thickness-shear QCMs. The depth of penetration of the shear wave is correspondingly larger. Data acquisition and data analysis can proceed in analogy to the conventional thickness-shear QCM. Torsional resonators may also be operated as electrochemical QCMs (EQCMs), meaning that a DC electrical potential may be applied to the active electrode and that shifts of frequency and bandwidth may be acquired in parallel to the electrical current. Here we report on the formation of mixed-culture biofilms dominated by the microorganism Geobacter anodireducens. The viscoelastic analysis evidences an increase in rigidity as the films grows. Potential sweeps on electroactive biofilms reveal a softening under negative potentials, that is, under conditions, where the layer's metabolism was slowed down by insufficient oxidative activity of the substrate. For comparison, biofilms were monitored in parallel with a conventional thickness-shear QCM. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae are potential raw materials for biofuel applications. In this work, microbial lipids from Choricystis minor var. minor were extracted with conventional solvents in a Soxhlet apparatus and with compressed fluids with or without the use of a co-solvent (ethanol or hexane). Also, the total achievable yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was determined in both unextracted microalga, extraction residue and extracted lipids. Ethanol was the best solvent for conventional extraction but hexane was more selective for saponifiable lipids. Compressed propane was better than supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) for the extraction of microbial lipids and the use of ethanol as co-solvent improved both extraction rates and yields. The best FAME yield was achieved with scCO2 plus ethanol at 80 °C and 150 bar (FAME yield of 16.7 g 100 g−1 dry biomass for a mass extraction yield of 31.6%). Hexane was not advantageous as an extraction co-solvent. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A numerical study is performed by KIVA-CHEMKIN code to compare the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of neat biodiesel (B100) and biodiesel blend including a mixture of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel (B20) resulting from the PCCI combustion mode in a light-duty diesel engine. For the biodiesel reaction mechanism, multi-chemistry surrogate mechanism using methyl decanoate (MD) and methyl-9-decenoate (MD9D) is used in this study. The results show that PCCI combustion like high temperature conventional combustion cannot cover the lower ISFC of the biodiesel blend fuel compared to the diesel fuel. A detailed analysis of combustion and emissions, involving the role of formaldehyde (CH2O) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals as well as O and H radicals, was performed in the PCCI combustion stages and emissions formation for the B100 and B20 fuels. The results indicate that higher concentration of formaldehyde as well as lower concentration of hydroxyl radicals for the B20 case advances low temperature heat release (LTHR) and retards high temperature heat release (HTHR) respectively compared to the B100 case. In addition, O and OH radicals as well as cylinder temperature are effective parameters regarding higher NO and CO concentrations for the B20 case compared to the B100 case. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The coconut kernel-associated fungus, Lasiodiplodia theobromae VBE1, was grown on coconut cake with added coconut oil as lipase inducer under solid-state fermentation conditions. The extracellular-produced lipases were purified and resulted in two enzymes: lipase A (68,000 Da)—purified 25.41-fold, recovery of 47.1%—and lipase B (32,000 Da)—purified 18.47-fold, recovery of 8.2%. Both lipases showed optimal activity at pH 8.0 and 35 °C, were activated by Ca2+, exhibited highest specificity towards coconut oil and p-nitrophenyl palmitate, and were stable in iso-octane and hexane. Ethanol supported higher lipase activity than methanol, and n-butanol inactivated both lipases. Crude lipase immobilized by entrapment within 4% (w/v) calcium alginate beads was more stable than the crude-free lipase preparation within the range pH 2.5–10.0 and 20–80 °C. The immobilized lipase preparation was used to catalyze the transesterification/methanolysis of coconut oil to biodiesel (fatty acyl methyl esters (FAMEs)) and was quantified by gas chromatography. The principal FAMEs were laurate (46.1%), myristate (22.3%), palmitate (9.9%), and oleate (7.2%), with minor amounts of caprylate, caprate, and stearate also present. The FAME profile was comparatively similar to NaOH-mediated transesterified biodiesel from coconut oil, but distinctly different to petroleum-derived diesel. This study concluded that Lasiodiplodia theobromae VBE1 lipases have potential for biodiesel production from coconut oil. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Improving the hydrolytic performance of hemicellulases to degrade lignocellulosic biomass is of considerable importance for second-generation biorefinery. Xylanase, as the crucial hemicellulase, must be thermostable and have high activity for its potential use in the bioethanol industry. To obtain excellent xylanase candidates, it is necessary to understand the structure-function relationships to provide a meaningful reference to improve the enzyme properties. This study aimed to investigate the catalytic mechanism of a highly active hyperthermophilic xylanase variant, XYL10C-ΔN, for hemicellulose degradation. Results: By removing the N-terminal 66 amino acids, the variant XYL10C-ΔN showed a 1.8-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency and could hydrolyze corn stover more efficiently in hydrolysis of corn stover; however, it retained similar thermostability to the wild-type XYL10C. Based on the crystal structures of XYL10C-ΔN and its complex with xylobiose, Glu175 located on loop 3 was found to be specific to GH10 xylanases and probably accounts for the excellent enzyme properties by interacting with Lys135 and Met137 on loop 2. Site-saturation mutagenesis confirmed that XYL10C-ΔN with glutamate acid at position 175 had the highest catalytic efficiency, specific activity, and the broadest pH-activity profile. The functional roles of Glu175 were also verified in the mutants of another two GH10 xylanases, XylE and XynE2, which showed increased catalytic efficiencies and wider pH-activity profiles. Conclusions: XYL10C-ΔN, with excellent thermostability, high catalytic efficiency, and great lignocellulose-degrading capability, is a valuable candidate xylanase for the biofuel industry. The mechanism underlying improved activity of XYN10C-ΔN was thus investigated through structural analysis and functional verification, and Glu175 was identified to play the key role in the improved catalytic efficiency. This study revealed the importance of a key residue (Glu175) in XYN10C-ΔN and provides a reference to modify GH10 xylanases for improved catalytic performance. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In this work, the selective conversion of hexanoic acid to hydrocarbons using Cu/β-zeolite-EG prepared by the ethylene glycol (EG) assisted impregnation method was investigated. It was found that Cu/β-zeolite-EG shows higher selectivity towards benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTXs) as well as higher resistance to coke deposition when compared to Cu/β-zeolite prepared by a conventional impregnation method. This should be attributed to the better dispersion and stronger interaction between the active Cu species and the β-zeolite surface in the Cu/β-zeolite-EG solid. This catalytic system shows potential practical application in the upgrading of bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In light of advances in the simultaneous production of biobased fuels and chemicals, a prospective well-to-wheel lifecycle assessment (LCA) model of a two-step multistage torrefaction biorefinery is constructed to quantify both lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy return on primary fossil energy investment (EROIfossil) for a transportation-range biofuel product. Coproducts - including cyclopentanone (CPO), biochar, and a potential net electricity export - are handled via six coproduct scenarios, evaluated across both market-based allocation and displacement methods. Process-scale performance metrics and product distributions are compared across cases to evaluate trade-offs between process and environmental performance; carbon flows are visualized to better explain patterns of carbon yield and waste. LCA results include median GHG values spanning from -30.8 to +36.1 g CO2e/MJ-fuel and median EROIfossil values ranging from 1.6 to 12.8 MJ-fuel/MJ-PEfossil. Sensitivity results for the Market CPO case under market-based allocation display a large dependence on CPO yield, hydrogen consumption and fuel and CPO prices, while exhibiting minimal dependence on liquid fuel yield. Unrealistically low lifecycle GHG and high EROIfossil values are obtained under displacement for the maximum level of CPO production, prompting a discussion of methodological limitations, especially as they relate to the assignment of system expansion coproduct credit within existing EROI formulations. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Catalysts C600, C700, and C800 prepared from Ca(CH3COO)2 calcination at 600, 700, and 800 °C, respectively, were characterized with an X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, and specific surface area analyzer. Over the catalysts, bio-oils (BOs) were obtained by the supercritical ethanolysis (SCE) of wheat stalk powder (WSP). Their yields, ultimate analyses, chemical composition and some fuel properties were investigated. WSP and the residues from the SCE of WSP were analyzed with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The results show that C700 has a small particle size and large specific surface area, and can effectively catalyze the SCE of WSP. The BO yields from non-catalytic, C600–, C700–, and C800-catalyzed SCE of WSP are 30.1, 22.9, 70.7 and 34.4%, respectively. BO700 from C700-catalyzed SCE of WSP has relatively higher H/C and H/O ratios and calorific value but lower acidity, kinematic viscosity, and water content. The relative content of alcohols in the BO obviously increased, while the contents of carboxylic acids, ethyl esters, and anhydrides decreased over C700. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aviation alternative fuel originated from sustainable raw materials should meet a set of safety requirements and must show the same physicochemical properties to mineral kerosene. The production of a short-chain esters enriched biofuel using molecular distillation of FAME obtained from babassu oil was assessed. Operational conditions were assessed to obtain high mass yields and high ester content in the carbon chain length range of kerosene. A fuel with properties close to those of aviation biofuels was obtained at 140°C. At this temperature, more than 80% of the esters in the product composition were within the desired range and there was a mass recovery higher than 88%. The short-chain esters enriched biofuel was blended with fossil kerosene at different concentrations. The effects of the gradual addition of this biofuel stream to commercial aviation kerosene were considered. A mixture up to 6% g/g accomplished the specification limits established by ASTM D1655.

AB  - Lowering the oxygen content in biofuels is of vital importance, since high oxygen level content leads to low stability, low heat value, and corruption in engines. Here we report on the thermally activated decarboxylation of fatty acids, raw materials for biofuel production, on an anisotropic Au(110) surface. Due to the one-dimensional (1D) geometrical constraint of the surface reconstruction, linear fatty acid molecules (C30H60O2) are decarboxylated and polymerized at their terminal ends at mild temperatures, resulting in the formation of oxygen-free aliphatic hydrocarbons. Different reaction stages of the decarboxylation were monitored by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. On the basis of density functional theory calculations, a two-step process was proposed for the fatty acid decarboxylation. Our work demonstrates a novel strategy for deoxygenation of fatty acids on a 1D constrained surface as a model catalytic system for producing low oxygen content biofuels. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Extractive fermentation with the removal of carboxylic acid requires low pH conditions because acids are better partitioned into the solvent phase at low pH values. However, this requirement conflicts with the optimal near-neutral pH conditions for microbial growth. Results: CO2 pressurization was used, instead of the addition of chemicals, to decrease pH for the extraction of butyric acid, a fermentation product of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, and butyl butyrate was selected as an extractant. CO2 pressurization (50 bar) improved the extraction efficiency of butyric acid from a solution at pH 6, yielding a distribution coefficient (D) 0.42. In situ removal of butyric acid during fermentation increased the production of butyric acid by up to 4.10 g/L h, an almost twofold increase over control without the use of an extraction process. Conclusion: In situ extraction of butyric acid using temporal CO2 pressurization may be applied to an integrated downstream catalytic process for upgrading butyric acid to value-added chemicals in an organic solvent. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Over the next decades, with the growing concern of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, the importance of investigating new approaches for its reduction becomes crucial. Reclamation of CO2for conversion into biofuels represents an alternative and attractive production method that has been studied in recent years, now with enzymatic methods gaining more attention. Formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) are NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases that catalyze the conversion of formate into CO2and have been extensively used for cofactor recycling in chemoenzymatic processes. A new FDH from Clostridium ljungdahlii (ClFDH) has been recently shown to possess activity in the reverse reaction: the mineralization of CO2into formate. In this study, we show the successful homologous expression of ClFDH in Escherichia coli. Biochemical and kinetic characterization of the enzyme revealed that this homologue also demonstrates activity toward CO2reduction. Structural analysis of the enzyme through homology modeling is also presented. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper systematically reports the major organic acids produced during cellobiose decomposition in hot-compressed water (HCW) at 200–275 °C and a residence time of 8–66 s. Saccharinic, formic, lactic and glycolic acids are identified and quantified using high-performance anion exchange chromatography with conductivity detection and mass spectrometry (HPAEC-CD-MS). Among the identified organic acids, saccharinic acid, which is reported for the first time in the field under non-catalytic conditions, has the highest yield (i.e., ∼5.8% at 275 °C and ∼66 s) on a carbon basis, but formic acid has the highest contribution to total hydrogen ion in the liquid product due to its high molar concentration and high dissociation constant. The results also show that the hydrogen ion concentrations contributed by the identified organic acids agree well with those calculated from the measured pH of the solutions after the reaction, especially at cellobiose conversions <80%. The reaction pathways for the production of these organic acids during cellobiose decomposition in HCW are also summarised and discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulose, which accounts for more than half of the carbon content in plants, has become a popular feedstock for biofuel production. In this work, direct electricity generation from dissolved cellulosic biomass in an alkaline fuel cell is explored without energy-intensive process. The effect of different cellulose dissolution solvents on the electricity production is investigated. Results show dissolution treatment can remarkably affect the fuel cell performance. When NaOH/urea/thiourea is chosen as a solvent, the specific capacity of cellulose is about sixfold higher than that using only NaOH as solvent. The limiting current density and the maximum power density reach 0.85 mA cm−2 and 0.07 mW cm−2, respectively. This power density surpasses those of any existing biotic or abiotic designs. Electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the remarkable activity improvement towards the cellulose oxidation reaction in NaOH/urea/thiourea aqueous solution is due to the lower charger transfer resistance and higher energy transfer efficiency. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that has been used for partial or total substitution of diesel to reduce its environmental impacts. In Brazil, the main industrial technique used to produce biodiesel is via transesterification of soybean oil with methanol under sodium methoxide as a homogenous catalyst. Some studies on this topic have focused on improving the cold properties of biodiesel for use in cold climate countries. This research focused on the comparison of the cold properties of the biofuel produced from the transesterification of soybean oil with different alcohols. The alcohols used vary according to the size of the carbon chain and its nature: methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, isoamyl and benzyl alcohol. The chemical composition of the esters formed were studied by means of 1H NMR, HPLC, FTIR, sodium and sulphur content. The 1H NMR spectra showed that only the methyl and ethyl esters reached the minimum value of ester content established for the international specifications for biodiesel. Despite the greater difficulty in removing the excess of the reactant alcohol at the end of the reaction and having an ester content above requirements, the esters obtained from the alcohol isopropyl and isoamyl presented the best results in terms of their cold properties. However, the presence of the benzyl in the structure of the ester did not show any change in its CFPP, compared to the respective methyl ester. In addition to the cold properties, studies of some other physicochemical properties have also been made to show the maintenance of international specifications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Low-cost palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) feedstock to produce biodiesel is of interest. Single step esterification of PFAD is effective but requires large amounts of chemicals. Removal of water in a two-step process increases the effectiveness of FFA conversion with methanol, but ethanol has yet to be investigated and hence was proposed. Effects of parameters: ethanol to FFA molar ratio, temperature, time and catalyst amount, were investigated. In the first step, catalyst amount was kept constant; and for the second-step, the reaction temperature was fixed. RSM coupled with sensitivity analysis enabled parameters to be optimized. Optimal conditions for the first step were: 4:1 M ratio, 343 K and 15 min, resulting in 88% FFA conversion. In the second step, the conversion reached 86.8% under these conditions: 27:1 M ratio, 53 min and 35.3 wt% catalyst amount. Under these two sets of optimal conditions, the overall FFA conversion of 98.44% was comparable to other studies. The attempt on the use of ethanol to produce ethyl ester in a two-step process of PFAD is quite successful: ethanol, renewable and more environmental friendly, is a contending effective alternative. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study reports the effectiveness of bio-oil separation using several hydrophilic surfactants, including IGEPAL CO520, Tween 80, IGEPAL CO890, and sodium oleate, which have hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values of 10, 15, 17, and 18, respectively. The results show that hydrophobic groups of surfactants (rather than HLB value) and surfactant concentration play significant roles in bio-oil separation. Permanent separation can be achieved at high surfactant loading levels (e.g., 5%) whereas a low surfactant concentration (e.g., 0.5%) leads to temporary separation. At 5% addition, IGEPAL surfactants (CO520 and CO890) require shorter separation time than Tween 80 and sodium oleate. Except the case with sodium oleate, the separation results in two layers (a clear layer and a dark layer). Compared to the dark layer, the clear layer has a lower carbon content and a higher oxygen content, leading to a lower aromaticity and a higher polarity. Water is more distributed in the clear layer, while aromatic compounds with fused rings are more concentrated in the dark layer. It is interesting to note that separation of bio-oil by sodium oleate results in an additional clear layer with distinct characteristics from the normal clear layers. This additional layer contains extractives in bio-oil and is at least composed of fatty acid esters. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Nowadays the development and application of alternative fuels (including biofuels) are highly important for several reasons, e.g., protection of the environment and people's health and achievement of sustainable development, etc. Diesel fuels are important in road transportation in the European Union and all over the world. So, it is necessary to develop alternative (bio)fuels for diesel engines. During the development of these alternative fuels, it is necessary to take into account that it does not endanger the cultivation of food and feed crops. According to the above-mentioned reasons, we studied the catalytic hydrogenation of mixtures of the middle distillates derived from thermal cracking of waste polypropylene (WPPCF) (5-30%), waste cooking oil (WCO) (20-45%), and straight-run gas oil (GO) (50%), on a sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst to produce diesel fuel. We investigated the effects of feedstock compositions and process parameters (T = 300-360 °C, LHSV = 1.0-3.0 h-1, P = 40 bar, hydrogen/feedstock = 400 N m3/m3) on the main product's quality and yield. We concluded that good quality diesel fuel blending components with high alternative component content (approximately 50%) can be produced from feedstocks having 30/20% WPPCF, 20/30% WCO, and 50% GO at advantageous process parameters (T = 340-360 °C, LHSV = 1.0 h-1, P = 40 bar, hydrogen/feedstock = 400 N m3/m3). © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Abstract: Subcritical co-solvents of n-hexane/isopropanol were primarily utilized to extract lipid from wet microalgal pastes of Scenedesmus obliquus. The effects of key operational parameters were investigated, and the optimal parameters were obtained: solvent ratio of n-hexane to isopropanol was 3:2 (V:V), phase ratio of co-solvents to microalgal biomass was 35:1 (mL:g), reactor stirring speed was 900 rpm, extraction time was 60 min. Additional pretreatment with acid, ultrasonic and microwave as well as enhanced subcritical pressure/heating treatments were also applied to further study their effects on lipid extraction. The results showed that the lipid recovery rate with acid pretreatment was 8.6 and 6.2% higher than ultrasonic and microwave pretreatment; the optimum enhanced subcritical condition was 55 °C with atmospheric pressure. Under optimal operating conditions, the lipid and FAME yield were 13.5 and 7.2%, which was 82.6 and 135.1% higher than the traditional method. The results indicated that the subcritical n-hexane/isopropanol extraction process had promising application potential.

AB  - A bubbling fluidized bed pyrolyzer was integrated with an in-situ honeycomb as a catalytic upgrading zone for the conversion of biomass to liquid fuels. In the upgrading zone, zeolite coated ceramic honeycomb (ZCCH) catalysts consisting of ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) were stacked and N2 or recycled non-condensable gas was used as a carrier gas. Ground corncob particles were fast pyrolyzed in the bubbling bed using fine sand particles as a heat carrier and the resulting pyrolysis vapors were passed on-line over the catalytic upgrading zone. The influence of carrier gas, temperature, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of catalyst on the oil product properties, distribution and mass balance were studied. Using ZCCH effectively increased the hydrocarbon yield and the heating value of the dry oil, especially in the presence of the recycled noncondensable gas. Even a low usage of zeolite catalyst at WSHVof 180 h‒1 was effective in upgrading the pyrolysis oil and other light olefins. The highest hydrocarbon (⩾C2) and liquid aromatics yields reached to 14.23 and 4.17 wt-%, respectively. The undesirable products including light oxygenates, furans dramatically decreased in the presence of the ZCCH catalyst. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In-line hydro-treatment of bio-oil vapor from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (hydro-pyrolysis of biomass) is studied as a method of upgrading the liquefied bio-oil for a possible precursor to green fuels. The nobel metal (Pt) and non-noble metal catalysts (Mo2C and WC) were compared at 500 °C and atmospheric pressure which are same as the reaction conditions for fast pyrolysis of biomass. Results indicated that under the pyrolysis conditions, the major components, such as acids and carbonyls, of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil can be completely and partially hydrogenated to form hydrocarbons, an ideal fossil fuel blend, in the hydro-treated bio-oil. The carbide catalysts perform equally well as the Pt catalyst regarding to the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon formation (ca. 60%), showing the feasibility of using the cheap non-noble catalysts for hydro-pyrolysis of biomass. © 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The properties of biodiesel differ depending on feedstock fatty acid content. Moreover, biodiesel fatty acid composition influences the combustion process. For these reasons, noise emissions of a direct injection Perkins diesel engine fueled with olive pomace oil methyl ester (monounsaturated methyl esters) and palm oil methyl ester (saturated methyl esters) were studied under several steady-state engine operating conditions. In this work, different approaches for sound prediction of the engine based on Neural Network (NN) models, such as Product Unit NN (PUNN), Radial Basis Function NN (RBFNN) and response surface models have been proposed. Error was measured considering Mean Square Error (MSE) and Standard Error of Prediction (SEP). It can be concluded that the use of a hybrid model combining PU and RBF improves noise prediction accuracy, providing an acceptable value of both MSE and SEP when monounsaturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends are used. However, best results for saturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends were achieved by PUNN model. Whereas taking into account the simplicity of the model, PUNN model is the most appropriate for both monounsaturated and saturated methyl ester/diesel fuel blends. Response surface models have shown worse results based on the coefficient of correlation. Also, the effect of independent variables in the models has been studied and an inverse relationship between frequency and engine noise has been found. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work reports on the study of biofuel production from biooil obtained by cardoon pyrolysis (Cynara cardunculus L.). The main process was carried out at 700 °C and at 50 cm3 min−1 nitrogen flow rate for 1 h. The liquid yield in such pyrolysis process was 38.91% (wt/wt). Two solvents were used for biofuel extraction, namely ethyl ether and ethyl acetate, to achieve a 34.72% yield in biofuel. Subsequently, a distillation process in the range of kerosene (200–275 °C) was performed to finally obtain “biokerosene” which was used to feed both a self-manufactured jet engine and an internal combustion engine (ICE). In the jet engine, experimental tests were run for four kerosene/biofuel mixtures in the range 0–20% biofuel, in atmospheric conditions (20 °C and 1015 mbar) and setting the engine in a slightly sloped arrangement in order to prevent excessive displacements. Fuel pressure at maximum power was recorded as 6 bar, which yielded 0.00252 kg s−1 fuel flow rate. Results –even for the mixture with 20% biofuel content– were found to be similar to those for pure kerosene. The turbocharger yield was 74% with 200,000 rpm and 0.091 kg s−1 air flow rate for all conditions, which equates to an approximate power of 100 hp for the use of the turbocharger in self-propulsion. On another note, the ICE was operated using a 80–20% diesel-biokerosene mix and was observed to show a satisfactory behaviour in terms of torque and power yields. The use of such biofuels to feed jet and ICE engines represents an excellent alternative to fossil fuels, and therefore quality improvement is a key topic for further research in the area. © 2017

AB  - Medium chain-length linear α-olefins (mcl-LAO) are versatile precursors to commodity products such as synthetic lubricants and biodegradable detergents, and have been traditionally produced from ethylene oligomerization and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Medium chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (mcl-PHA) can be produced by some microorganisms as an energy storage. In this study, Pseudomonas putida biomass that contained mcl-PHA was used in HTL at 300 °C for 30 min, and up to 65 mol% of mcl-PHA was converted into mcl-LAO. The yield and quality of the bio-oil co-produced in the HTL was remarkably improved with the biomass rich in mcl-PHA. Experiments with extracted mcl-PHA revealed the degradation mechanism of mcl-PHA in HTL. Overall, this work demonstrates a novel process to co-produce mcl-LAO and bio-oil from renewable biomass. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - New completely green biofuels with rapeseed oil as the main component were formulated. They not only fulfil the principles of green chemistry and thus do not contain any environmentally harmful additives, but also match the currently valid standards for biodiesel regarding their physicochemical properties. Using a vegetable oil as a fuel component, its major drawbacks, high kinematic viscosity and high freezing point, had to be fixed. It could be shown that the properties of mixtures of rapeseed oil with and without its corresponding fatty acid methyl ester, so-called biodiesel, can be adjusted by several further components. For this purpose, different furan derivatives and terpenes could be used to fulfil the American and European viscosity standards for biodiesel. The furan derivatives stem from sugar and cellulose, whereas terpenes are mainly constituents of essential oils of trees and the peels of citrus plants as well as producible by the bio-transformation of sugarcane. With furan derivatives as further fuel components, the amount of necessary biodiesel could be drastically reduced, and cloud points below -20 °C were obtained. Using terpenes, these conditions could be matched without any biodiesel in the formulations, and cloud points even below -40 °C were achieved. To further characterise these biofuel formulations, ignition, combustion and emission tests were performed on an up-to-date 2.2 L diesel engine using a blend of rapeseed oil, rapeseed oil-based biodiesel and 2-methylfuran. The results showed that the properties of the formulated biofuel were similar to or even better than those of common diesel despite the high requirement profile of modern diesel formulations. Besides improving the relevant physicochemical parameters of the fuel, 2-methylfuran also increased its oxygen content. This enhanced the soot oxidation and therefore led to a complete inhibition of soot emissions. Nevertheless, the main drawback of biofuels in general, slightly higher NOx emissions than diesel, still remained, which requires a common exhaust gas aftertreatment of diesel engines. In the scope of this paper, the new formulations are discussed with regard to the concept of green and sustainable chemistry. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: The transesterification of high oleic palm oil methyl ester (HOPME) with neopentyl glycol (NPG) has been investigated. The present study revealed the application of low-pressure technology as a new synthesis method to produce NPG diesters. Single variable optimization and response surface methodology (RSM) were implemented to optimize the experimental conditions to achieve the maximum composition (wt%) of NPG diesters. Objective: The main objective of this study was to optimize the production of NPG diesters and to characterize the optimized esters with typical chemical, physical and electrical properties to study its potential as insulating oil. Methods: The transesterification reaction between HOPME and NPG was conducted in a 1L three-neck flask reactor at specified temperature, pressure, molar ratio and catalyst concentration. For the optimization, four factors have been studied and the diester product was characterized by using gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The synthesized esters were then characterized with typical properties of transformer oil such as flash point, pour point, viscosity and breakdown voltage and were compared with mineral insulating oil and commercial NPG dioleate. For formulation, different samples of NPG diesters with different concentration of pour point depressant were prepared and each sample was tested for its pour point measurement. Results: The optimum conditions inferred from the analyses were: molar ratio of HOPME to NPG of 2:1.3, temperature = 182°C, pressure = 0.6 mbar and catalyst concentration of 1.2%. The synthesized NPG diesters showed very important improvement in fire safety compared to mineral oil with flash point of 300°C and 155°C, respectively. NPG diesters also exhibit a relatively good viscosity of 21 cSt. The most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison with NPG diester was the breakdown voltage, which was higher than mineral oil and definitely in conformance to the IEC 61099 limit at 67.5 kV. The formulation of synthesized NPD diesters with VISCOPLEX® pour point depressant has successfully increased the pour point of NPG diester from -14°C to -48°C. Conclusion: The reaction time for the transesterification of HOPME with NPG to produce NPG diester was successfully reduced to 1 hour from the 14 hours required in the earlier synthesis method. The main highlight of this study was the excess reactant which is no longer methyl ester but the alcohol (NPG). The optimum reaction conditions for the synthesis were molar ratio of 2:1.13 for NPG:HOPME, 182°C, 0.6 mbar and catalyst concentration of 1.2 wt%. The maximum NPG diester yield of 87 wt% was consistent with the predicted yield of 87.7 wt% obtained from RSM. The synthesized diester exhibited better insulating properties than the commercial products especially with regards to the breakdown voltage, flash point and moisture content. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Biodiesel, one of the renewable energy sources has gained attention for decades as the alternative fuel due to its remarkable properties. However, there are several drawbacks from the industrial production of biodiesel such as the spike in the production cost, environmental issues related to the usage of homogeneous catalyst and profitability in long term. One of the solutions to eliminate the problem is by utilizing low cost starting material such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). PFAD is a byproduct from the refining of crude palm oil and abundantly available. Esterification of PFAD to biodiesel will be much easier with the presence of heterogeneous acid catalyst. Most of acid catalyst preparation involves series of heating process using conventional method. In this study, microwave was utilized in catalyst preparation, significantly reducing the reaction time from conventional heating method. The catalyst produced was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer Emmet and Teller (BET), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Temperature-Programmed Desorption - Ammonia (TPD-NH3) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) while percentage yield and conversion of the PFAD were analysed by gas chromatography - flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and acid-base titration, respectively. It has been demonstrated that the percentage yield of biodiesel from the PFAD by employing sulfonated glucose acid catalyst (SGAC) reached 98.23% under the following conditions: molar ratio of methanol to PFAD of 10:1, catalyst loading of 2.5% and reaction temperature of 70oC. The microwave-assisted SGAC showed its potential to replace the SGAC produced via conventional heating method.

AB  - Several research efforts across the globe have been concerned with addressing the technical barriers in the commercialization of algae-based sustainable biorefineries. Nutrients cost and management and in particular, phosphorus, have been highlighted as one of the most significant challenges in algae cultivation and downstream processing. In this study, 83 wt% of phosphorus present in Scenedesmus sp. microalgae was extracted as water-soluble phosphate in aqueous phase via flash hydrolysis process while preserving the algae lipids. Subsequently, the phosphate containing aqueous phase (algae hydrolysate) was used for producing dittmarite and hydroxyapatite by two different mineralization processes. In the first pathway, more than 97 wt% of the phosphate in the hydrolysate was recovered in the form of carbonate-hydroxyapatite, a valuable biomaterial, at 280 °C within one hour of residence time via hydrothermal mineralization process. Whitlockite as the secondary phase was also observed along with the hydroxyapatite. In the second pathway, 67 wt% of the phosphate and 6 wt% of nitrogen were recovered as dittmarite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), an effective slow-release fertilizer, at 20 °C via an atmospheric precipitation process. The effects of seeding, temperature, reaction time, and mineralizers to PO4 molar ratio on phosphate removal as well as product yield were studied. This is the first kind of study in which flash hydrolysis and mineralization processes were integrated to provide an energy efficient platform for phosphorus recovery from microalgae in forms of value added compounds that could be suitable for long-term storage and handling. Through this experimental study, we report the shortest residence time for hydroxyapatite precipitation from an algal hydrolysate. The short residence could substantially save in reactor size and processing time as well as provide an option for high throughput which could result in a significant cost reduction in algae to bioproducts and biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A catalytic performance study for biodiesel production by a novel catalytically active membrane from polyacrylic acid (PAAc) crosslinked with 4,4′-diamino-2,2′-biphenyl sulfonic acid (PAAc-BDSA) was performed. Evaluation of oil and methanol sorption capacity as well as heterogeneous acid catalyzed transesterification of soybean oil by PAAc-BDSA was compared to polyvinyl alcohol, PVA (88% and 99% hydrolysed) catalytically active membranes crosslinked with sulfosuccinic acid (PVA-88-SSA and PVA-99-SSA). PAAc-BDSA membranes with similar ion exchange capacity (IEC) presented at least twice the swelling degree (Q) for soybean oil and methanol than PVA-88-SSA and PVA-99-SSA membranes. Effective diffusion coefficients of PAAc-BDSA for methanol and a mixture of methanol-glycerol determined by sorption method show that in this membrane the diffusion was at least 4 to 6 times faster than in PVA-88-SSA and PVA-99-SSA. Soybean oil transesterification reaction rate fits pseudo-first order kinetics and methyl ester yield follows the order 90, 92 and 73% for PVA-88-SSA, PVA-99-SSA and PAAc-BDSA, respectively. Higher diffusion coefficients and sorption of methanol and glycerol by PAAc-BDSA membrane make it a candidate for application in membrane reactors for simultaneous biodiesel production and glycerol separation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A sustainable method was developed for the upgrade of biomass derived vanillin (a typical model compound of lignin) into the potential liquid biofuels over a layered double hydroxide supported Pd catalyst (abbreviated as CoAl–LDH/Pd). The CoAl–LDH/Pd catalyst showed high catalytic activity towards the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin into 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) under mild conditions in aqueous media. High MMP yield up to 86% was produced at 120 °C after 4 h. Kinetic studies revealed that the rate-determining step for the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin was the hydrogenolysis of vanillyl alcohol. More importantly, the CoAl–LDH/Pd catalyst was highly stable without the loss of activity. © 2018 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Catalytic reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), deemed as one of the key bio-based platform compounds, is a very promising pathway for the upgrading of biomass to biofuels and value-added chemicals. Conventional hydrogenation of HMF is mainly conducted over precious metal catalysts with high-pressure hydrogen. Here, a highly active, sustainable, and facile catalytic system composed of K 2 CO 3 , Ph 2 SiH 2 , and bio-based solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) was developed to be efficient for the reduction of HMF. At a low temperature of 25 ◦ C, HMF could be completely converted to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) in a good yield of 94% after 2 h. Moreover, a plausible reaction mechanism was speculated, where siloxane in situ formed via hydrosilylation was found to be the key species responsible for the high reactivity. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - An enhanced stability of enzymes in organic solvents is desirable under industrial conditions. The potential of lipases as biocatalysts is mainly limited by their denaturation in polar alcohols. In this study, we focused on selected solvent tunnels in lipase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T6 to improve its stability in methanol during biodiesel synthesis. Using rational mutagenesis, bulky aromatic residues were incorporated to occupy solvent channels and induce aromatic interactions leading to a better inner core packing. The chemical and structural characteristics of each solvent tunnel were systematically analyzed. Selected residues were replaced with Phe, Tyr, or Trp. Overall, 16 mutants were generated and screened in 60% methanol, from which 3 variants showed an enhanced stability up to 81-fold compared with that of the wild type. All stabilizing mutations were found in the longest tunnel detected in the "closed-lid" X-ray structure. The combination of Phe substitutions in an A187F/L360F double mutant resulted in an increase in unfolding temperature (T m ) of 7°C in methanol and a 3-fold increase in biodiesel synthesis yield from waste chicken oil. A kinetic analysis with p-nitrophenyl laurate revealed that all mutants displayed lower hydrolysis rates (k cat ), though their stability properties mostly determined the transesterification capability. Seven crystal structures of different variants were solved, disclosing new π-π or CH/π intramolecular interactions and emphasizing the significance of aromatic interactions for improved solvent stability. This rational approach could be implemented for the stabilization of other enzymes in organic solvents. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Global demand for alternative energy sources increases due to concerns regarding energy security and greenhouse gas emissions. However, little is known regarding the impacts of biofuels to the environment and human health even though the identification of such impacts is important to avoid biofuels leading to undesired effects. In this study mutagenicity and genotoxicity of the three biofuel candidates ethyl levulinate (EL), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) and 2-methylfuran (2-MF) were investigated in comparison to two petroleum-derived fuels and a biodiesel. None of the samples induced mutagenicity in the Ames fluctuation test. However, the Micronucleus assay revealed significant effects in Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) V79 cells caused by the potential biofuels. 2-MF revealed the highest toxic potential with significant induction of micronuclei below 20.0 mg/L. EL and 2-MTHF induced micronuclei only at very high concentrations (>1000.0 mg/L). In regard to the genotoxic potential of 2-MF, its usage as biofuel should be critically discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, we investigate the isolation of lignin from the unhydrolyzed solids (UHS) by-product stream of 2nd-generation biofuel production. Under reflux conditions, aqueous solutions of acetone, ethanol (EtOH), acetic acid (AcOH), and γ-valerolactone (GVL) displayed approximately 53, 51, 53, and 65% yields of extractable solids, respectively, from corn stover UHS after Ammonia Fiber Expansion pretreatment and then enzymatic hydrolysis. Detailed chemical characterization was done including nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, and thermogravimetric analysis. This characterization showed that material extracted from UHS using EtOH:H2O and acetone:H2O contained a lignin fraction that most resembled native lignin; although, the material extracted using acetone:H2O contained a significant carbohydrate component. Results suggest that solvent polarity, rather than other solvent properties (e.g., reflux temperature), are dominating factors determining the mass yields of extractable solids from UHS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Industrial production of biodiesel from microbial catalysts requires large volume of lowcost feedstock for lipid production. Vinasse, also known as distillery spent wash (DSW), is a liquid waste produced in large amounts by ethanol distilleries. This effluent is particularly rich in organic matter, and may be considered as a potential resource for the production of fungal lipids. The present study aimed at evaluating the potential of vinasse from a distillery located in Reunion Island for yeast and fungal growth, lipid production, and suitability for biodiesel requirements. Among the 28 different strains tested, we found that Aspergillus niger grown on pure vinasse allowed biomass production of up to 24.05 g/L (dry weight), whereas Aspergillus awamori produced the maximum amount of lipid, at 2.27 g/L. Nutrient removal and vinasse remediation were found to be the best for A. niger and Cryptococcus curvatus, reaching a maximum of 50% for nitrogen, and A. awamori showed 50% carbon removal. Lipids produced were principally composed of C16:0, C18:1 (n-9), and C18:2 (n-6), thus resembling the vegetal oil used in the biodiesel production. This work has shown that vinasse can support production of biomass and lipids from fungi and yeast suitable for energetic use and that its polluting charge can be significantly reduced through this process. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses in the presence of solid acid catalysts is of great importance as an entry process for the production of biofuels and chemicals. In this work, the effect of carbon surface chemistry on the catalyst conversion and selectivity in hydrolysis of cellobiose to glucose was studied. Solid catalysts based on carbon xerogels (CXs) containing various functionalities incorporating heteroatoms (S, P, N, O), as confirmed by XPS, TPD, ICP and EA analyses, were successfully prepared. CXs containing 3.4 wt % of phosphorus showed the best catalytic performance, reaching 90 % conversion of cellobiose with 72 % selectivity to glucose, under oxidative atmosphere and in a short reaction time of only 4 h. The presence of phosphonates (−P−C−) was found to increase the selectivity to glucose up to unprecedented 87 %. On the contrary, carbonyls, quinones, pyrydinic, pyrrolic and sulfonic groups were found to promote glucose degradation, leading to a final low yield of this product. Additionally, the increased concentration of oxygen in the reaction atmosphere was shown to significantly weaken the β (1–4)-glycosidic bond, increasing the final yield of glucose. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Alcoholysis was an efficient way for liquefying lignocellulosic biomass into valuable platform chemicals. In this study, the impact of feedstock types on the acid-catalyzed alcoholysis performance was systematically investigated by comparing the alcoholysis ratio, product distribution and production of main products. Component analysis showed that three major chemical components could be efficiently degraded, further, hemicellulose and lignin were prone to be decomposed than cellulose. The time dependent alcoholysis ratio evolution was highly related to the feedstock types with the variation in lignin content and cellulose crystallinity index (CrI). The alcoholysis product distributions also varied significantly with different feedstocks according to the GC–MS analysis results. Ethyl levulinate (EL), furfural and ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate were identified as the major components in the products. The high mass yield 12.4% of EL was obtained from corn stover, and it was highly correlated to the cellulose content and CrI. The maximum mass yield of furfural was produced from wheat straw while a considerable amount of ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate was typically produced from poplar wood. With the comprehensive understanding of the impact of feedstock variability on the alcoholysis performance, our study could give an empirical evidence for product-oriented feedstock selection in biofuels and chemicals production. © 2018

AB  - Microalgae oil can be converted into aviation fuel to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and decrease the carbon footprint. This could be a significant step toward sustainable energy resources that have the potential to produce ‘drop-in’ fuels. Algae-based fuels are potential substitutes for fossil fuels due to the quality of their crude oil. However, this is only possible if appropriate conversion processes are undertaken. Conversely, microalgae species have low lipid content and biomass harvesting is still an energy-demanding process. In this study, a conceptual design is developed for the conversion of microalgae oil to jet fuel. It is based on a process undertaken in the laboratory using a species named Nannochloropsis sp. Nutrients and CO2 were supplied to the growing culture for effective growth. Biomass harvesting was completed on the tenth day of the growth cycle. It was followed by physiological modification to improve lipid content. Finally, crude oil extraction was followed by bio-oil hydrocracking at 350 °C, and fractionation of cracked bio-oil between 70 and 300 °C to separate light-, middle-, and heavy-end hydrocarbons for use in the production of jet fuel. During simulation, reforming and upgrading processes were added to the design to enhance the quality of the jet fuel to be produced on large scale in the future. The study, including the results, suggests that it is technically feasible to convert microalgae oil into jet fuel because of the similarity between algae bio-oil and petroleum crude oil. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Olive tree pruning is a widely available and low cost lignocellulosic residue generated every year, being a potential source for bioproducts and renewable fuels production. In this context, this work has as main objective to propose an efficient scheme for the production of second generation ethanol from olive tree pruning biomass, focusing on the evaluation of different detoxification strategies (activated carbon, ammonium hydroxide and overliming) of the liquid fraction obtained after pretreatment, as well as different configurations of enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation (including hydrolysis and sequential or simultaneous fermentation, pre-saccharification or co-fermentation) of the pretreated olive tree pruning solid. The best results of each fraction were tested in slurry, at varying initial solid loadings and aeration levels. The use of NH4OH 5N as a detoxification method and the pre-saccharification and co-fermentation configuration without aeration are proposed, resulting in 13.86 g ethanol/100 g raw material after 46 h of process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethanolysis of biomass derived furfuryl alcohol (FA) produces ethyl levulinate (EL), a biofuel additive and precursor for γ-valerolactone synthesis. The present study is devoted to develop an efficient and an environmentally benign catalytic system for one-pot conversion of FA to EL biofuel, by revealing an insight of the catalytic mechanism. The catalytic activity of H-ZSM-5, Meso-HZ-5 (desilicated H-ZSM-5) and different percentage H3PW12O40(HPW) anchored to Meso-HZ-5 catalysts have been evaluated for the FA ethanolysis. As per our knowledge, this is the first research reporting the application of HPW anchored to Meso-HZ-5 catalysts for the conversion of FA into EL in biomass utilization. These catalysts were synthesized and characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption and temperature programmed NH3 desorption (TPAD). Products of FA ethanolysis viz., 4,5,5-triethoxypentan-2-one (TEP), ethoxy-methyl- furan (EMF), diethyl ether (DEE), EL were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) and quantified by flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The physicochemical properties of catalysts were found to correlate to the product distribution matrix. Moreover, influences of several process parameters such as catalyst amount, reactant molar ratio, temperature and time on the extent of FA ethanolysis were systematically investigated. Under optimized conditions, 15% (w/w) HPW/Meso-HZ-5 exhibited a remarkable catalytic performance with complete FA conversion (100%) along with 97% yield of EL, these activity values are superior than the previously reported studies. The present study provides an insight of the catalytic mechanism along with a potential environmental benign and the economic catalyst for the efficient synthesis of EL biofuel from the biomass-derived FA. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1736–1742, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - A new approach to pyrolysis is demonstrated that uses microwave heating combined with an external liquid media at atmospheric pressure. The liquid acts as the inerting medium instead of the traditional inert gas, and also acts as a heat-sink to maintain the external temperature at the normal boiling point of the liquid. The ability to regulate the external temperature using a liquid offers significant advantages over established pyrolysis technologies and is only possible due to the selective and volumetric heating that occurs with microwaves. The new concept overcomes many of the challenges encountered in traditional and gas-based microwave pyrolysis processes, producing a bio-oil that naturally partitions into a sugar-rich aqueous phase and a phenol-rich organic phase. Energy requirements are as low as 2 kJ/g for 50% volatilisation, comparable to microwave pyrolysis using inert gases. It is shown that the new concept works effectively with both microwave-transparent and microwave-absorbent solvents. The liquid media also acts to eliminate arcing and prevent carbonaceous residues from forming, phenomena which have so far proved challenging for the scale-up of microwave pyrolysis processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pre-treatment is the key to unlock renewable lignocellulosic biomass for the production of valuable polysaccharides and biochemicals. Mentha arvensis represent an essential oil crop widely cultivated in world for producing high value flavour constituent like menthol (75.8%). After extraction of essential oil (0.93%), the remaining biomass is generally treated as distilled lignocellulosic biomass. Present study aimed to report the potential of newly developed chemical process for the isolation of major biopolymers from distilled M. arvensis biomass and saccharification of isolated cellulose to glucose. The terpene free distilled biomass was used for the isolation of cellulose (38%), hemicellulose (20%) and lignin (8%). The physical and chemical characteristics of fresh and distilled biomass were carried out using bomb calorimeter, XRD, TGA, ICP-MS, FT-IR and CHNS. Isolated cellulose was further enzymatically hydrolysed using Cellic CTec2 (114 FPU/ml) and Trichoderma reesei enzymes (68 FPU/ml) for the maximum glucose production in shake flask method. Our studies showed that Cellic CTec2 is more suitable enzyme for the production of glucose from distilled M. arvensis biomass with the enzyme loading of 10 FPU/g isolated cellulose in 48 h at 50 °C and 4.8 pH. The maximum glucose concentration obtained experimentally was 615 mg/g of isolated cellulose. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The paper introduces an alternative optical-based methodology allowing to investigate a liquid spreading process inside packed beds. In particular it allows determining the boundary between the wetted and the dry region inside the packing section. Due to optical nature of the approach it can be applied only when both column and its internals are made of transparent materials. The proposed experimental procedure has been used to investigate the liquid distribution inside the packed bed composed of 6 mm Raschig rings made of glass. Distilled water was adopted as a flowing medium and was injected into the column from a source point. The obtained results allowed performing qualitative assessment of the process and allowed determining both the contact distance (required for the liquid to reach the column wall) and the wetted volume of the column as a function of the liquid Reynolds number. The experiment has been also supplemented with measurements of a liquid holdup performed with the use of two different methods. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOx) has seen large-scale technological applications, and the determinations of its activity that is directly related to the enzymatic functions are extremely important. However, conventional methods to analyze the enzymatic activity involving high oxygen dependency and indirect redox reactions are usually tedious and restricted in complicated environments. For analyzing enzymatic activity by direct detection of the electron signals from the active centers, mediators are often used for facilitating the electron transfer. Differing from common methods of preparing electron mediators-contained GOx composites, a strategy aiming at remolding of the enzyme itself has been proposed in this work. Cofactor-like molecule 2′-diallyamino-ethyl flavin (DAA-flavin) derived from riboflavin is synthesized and incorporated as cross-linker into the polyacrylamide (PAAm) network around GOx surface by in situ polymerization to obtain enzyme nanocapsules termed as GOx@Fla-c-PAAm. The peripheral polymer shell confines the orientation of GOx and prevents it from denaturing, whereas incorporated DAA-flavin can replace the oxygen as an alternative electron acceptor to interact with the active centers of GOx in the presence of the substrate, thus giving the nanocapsules oxygen-independent characteristics. The introduced unlimited cofactor-like molecules endow the nanocapsules redox-related fluorescence, and the intensity variation is closely correlated with the enzymatic activity. There is a high goodness of fitting (R2 ∼ 0.990) between the slope of linear fluorescence-time plots and enzymatic activity, thereby making the nanocapsules a reliable activity-reporting enzymatic nanosystem with oxygen-independent fluorescence variation for further extended potential application in biofuel cells and biosensors. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The performance of catalytic tri-reforming under industrially relevant situations (e.g., pellet catalysts, pressurized reactor) was investigated using surrogate biogas as the feedstock. Tri-reforming using Ni/Mg/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2/Al2O3 pellet catalysts was studied in a bench scale fixed-bed reactor. The feed molar ratio for CH4:CO2:air was fixed as 1.0:0.70:0.95. The effects of temperature (800–860°C), pressure (1–6 bar), and H2O/CH4 molar feed ratio (0.23–0.65) were examined. Pressure has substantial impact on the reaction and transport rates and equilibrium conversions, making it a key variable. At 860°C, CO2 conversion increased from 4 to 61% and H2/CO molar ratio decreased from 2.0 to 1.1 as the pressure changed from 1 to 6 bar. CO2 conversion and H2/CO molar ratio were also influenced by the temperature and H2O/CH4 molar ratio. At 3 bar, CO2 conversion varied between 4 and 43% and the H2/CO molar ratio varied between 1.2 and 1.9 as the temperature changed from 800 to 860°C. At 3 bar and 860°C, CO2 conversion decreased from 35 to 8% and H2/CO molar ratio increased from 1.7 to 2.4 when the H2O/CH4 molar ratio was increased from 0.23 to 0.65. This work demonstrates that the tri-reforming technology is feasible for converting biogas under scaled-up conditions in a fixed-bed reactor. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Combustion tests and gaseous emissions of olive mill solid wastes pellets (olive pomace (OP), and olive pits (OPi)) were carried out in an updraft counter-current fixed bed reactor. Along the combustion chamber axis and under a constant primary air flow rate, the bed temperatures and the mass loss rate were measured as functions of time. Moreover, the gas mixture components such as O2, organic carbon (Corg), CO, CO2, H2O, H2, SO2, and NOx (NO + NO2) were analyzed and measured. The reaction front positions were determined as well as the ignition rate and the reaction front velocity. We have found that the exhaust gases are emitted in acceptable concentrations compared to the combustion of standard wood pellets reported in the literature (EN 303-5). It is shown that the bed temperature increased from the ambient value to a maximum value ranging from 750 to 1000◦C as previously reported in the literature. The results demonstrate the promise of using olive mill solid waste pellets as an alternative biofuel for heat and/or electricity production. © 2018 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - A two-stage hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process was developed for sweet sorghum biomass to improve carbon conversion, to avoid repolymerization reactions between hemicellulose and lignin derivatives that impair the yield of HTL biocrude oil, and to improve the quality of upgraded biocrude oil while producing sugar mixtures as coproducts. In this paper, the first-stage HTL experiment was carried out using sweet sorghum bagasse at various temperature and time conditions to produce sugar mixtures. Under the optimum conditions of 170 °C and 60 min, 94.1% of hemicellulose and 49.2% cellulose, respectively, were hydrolyzed into C5 and C6 sugars with the maximum sugar yield of 28.14% at the concentration of 28.52 g/L. The sugar stream can be used as a stand-alone or blended with sorghum juices to produce either biofuels or value-added chemicals and products. The remaining solids fraction mainly consisted of lignin, cellulose, and a trace amount of hemicellulose that can be further converted for use as a high-quality biocrude oil. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Furfural is a key biomass-derived chemical to produce important biofuels, such as 2-methylfuran. The furfural conversion over Cu(1 1 1)/ZnO catalyst has been investigated by the catalytic evaluation experiments. In order to elucidate the reaction temperature-oriented selectivity, density functional theory calculations were used to study the furfural conversion over Cu(1 1 1) surface. Furfural alcohol forms via F-CHO + 2H → F-CH2O + H → F-CH2OH, and 2-methylfuran forms via dehydration of furfuryl alcohol (F-CH2OH + 2H → F-CH2 + OH + 2H → F-CH3 + OH + H → F-CH3 + H2O). Furthermore, the reaction rates at different temperature (403, 453 and 503 K) have been calculated. As a result, high temperature plays a significant role in enhancing the reaction rate and prompting the reaction selectivity towards 2-methylfuran. © 2018

AB  - The additional costs required for the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic bio-mass prior to enzymatic hydrolysis have limited the commercial implementation of lignocellulosic bio-chemical production. The use of acidic mine drainage (AMD) water as an acid source for lignocellulosic pre-treatment has recently been investigated. Large quantities of AMD in South Africa suggest that AMD can be obtained cheaply, thus reducing the cost and increasing the potential of lignocellulosic bio-chemicals. Acidic mine drainage could undergo further remediation using sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) so that the water is suitable for release. The feasibility of such a system could be greatly improved if this process were to be incorporated within a bio-refinery, such that all fractions of the bio-mass are used to produce multiple products. This paper investigates such a bio-refinery system, and evaluates the different options based on the bio-refinery complexity profile (BCP). Due to the abundance of grass in the regions where AMD is generated, this was found to be the most suitable feedstock. The most feasible bio-refinery option was found to produce ethanol through fermentation of C6 sugars, although it is recommended that further investigation be conducted into additional high-value bio-chemicals from the C6 sugar platform. C5 sugars released in pre-treatment could be used as a substrate by SRB for AMD remediation. Gasification and direct combustion of lignin had similar BCPs and thus further investigation is required to determine the preferred path. Similarly, further investigation is required for the best processing route for distillery silage. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The conversion of phenolics over metal catalysts is an important process for upgrading biofuels. With density functional calculations, hydrogenation of o-cresol on the hydrogen-covered Pt(111) surface was investigated. The results show that the coverage of hydrogen plays a significant role in the reaction rate while it does not affect the reaction selectivity. The reaction barriers of the hydrogenation process leading to the formation of both 2-methyl-cyclohexanone (the intermediate product) and 2-methyl-cyclohexanol (the final product) at high H coverages (∼1 ML) are found to be smaller by 0.14–0.69 eV than those at lower H coverages (∼1/25 ML). After both hydrogen and cresol are adsorbed on Pt(111) from their initial gas phase state, the reaction energy of each hydrogenation step on the surface is also dependent on the hydrogen coverage. On the H-covered Pt(111) surface, most steps of hydrogenation involve exothermic reactions when the hydrogen coverage is high while they are endothermic reactions at low hydrogen coverages. The differences in reaction rate and reaction energy between high and low H coverages can be understood with the coverage-dependent bonding strength and configurations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jet and diesel fuels are typically composed of C9-C14 and C12-C20 hydrocarbons, respectively, but the carbon-chain length of sugar-derived aldehydes and furanic compounds is no longer than C6. Here, a cascade catalytic process involving alkylation and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) with different aldehydes is conducted to directly produce long-chain alkanes with exclusive carbon number of C11-C17 in overall yields of 50–84 %. Preliminary investigations on the alkylation of 2-MF and formalin show that the relative density of Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites of zeolitic materials remarkably affect their catalytic activity and selectivity. Sn-beta(12.5) with pronounced Lewis acidity (including the acid density and strength) exhibits higher catalytic performance in the alkylation than other zeolites, producing long-chain oxygenates in 58–92 % yields. Even in aqueous solution, the Sn-beta(12.5) catalyst can be reused for at least six reaction cycles with almost constant reactivity. More importantly, the co-addition of Hf(OTf)4 with Pd/C greatly promotes C−O bond cleavage of the furan-ring during the HDO process under mild reaction conditions, producing long-chain alkanes in high yields of 84–94 %. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Heteroatom-doping of pristine graphene is an effective route for tailoring new characteristics in terms of catalytic performance which opens up potentials for new applications in energy conversion and storage devices. Nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene), for instance, has shown excellent performance in many electrochemical systems involving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and more recently glucose oxidation. Owing to the excellent H2O2 sensitivity of N-graphene, the development of highly sensitive and fast-response enzymatic biosensors is made possible. However, a question that needs to be addressed is whether or not improving the anodic response to glucose detection leads to a higher overall performance of enzymatic biofuel cell (eBFC). Thus, here we first synthesized N-graphene via a catalyst-free single-step thermal process, and made use of it as the biocatalyst support in a membraneless eBFC to identify its role in altering the performance characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that the electron accepting nitrogen sites in the graphene structure enhances the electron transfer efficiency between the mediator (redox polymer), redox active site of the enzymes, and electrode surface. Moreover, the best performance in terms of power output and current density of eBFCs was observed when the bioanode was modified with highly doped N-graphene. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Conversion of vegetable-derived triglycerides to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) is a popular approach to the generation of biodiesel fuels and the basis of a growing industry. Drawbacks of the strategy are that (a) the glycerol backbone of the triglyceride is discarded as waste, and (2) most available natural triglycerides in the U.S. are multiunsaturated or fully saturated, giving inferior fuel performance and causing engine problems. Here we show that catalysis by iridium complex 1 can address both of these problems through selective reduction of triglycerides high in polyunsaturation. This is realized using hydrogen from methanol or those imbedded in the triglyceride backbone, concurrently generating lactate as a value-added C3 product. Additional methanol or glycerol as a hydrogen source enables reduction of corn and soybean oils to >80% oleate. The cost of the iridium catalyst is mitigated by its recovery through aqueous extraction. The process can be further driven with a supporting iron-based catalyst for the complete saturation of all olefins. Preparative procedures are established for synthesis and separation of methyl esters of the hydrogenated fatty acids, enabling instant access to upgraded biofuels. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Novel carbon-based solid acid catalysts were synthesized through a sustainable route from lipid-extracted microalgal residue of Dunaliella tertiolecta, for biodiesel production. Two carbon-based solid acid catalysts were prepared by surface modification of bio-char with sulfuric acid (H2 SO4) and sulfuryl chloride (SO2 Cl2), respectively. The treated catalysts were characterized and their catalytic activities were evaluated by esterification of oleic acid. The esterification catalytic activity of the SO2 Cl2-treated bio-char was higher (11.5 mmol Prod.∙h-1∙g Cat.-1) than that of commercial catalyst silica-supported Nafion SAC-13 (2.3 mmol Prod.∙h-1∙g Cat.-1) and H2 SO4-treated bio-char (5.7 mmol Prod.∙h-1∙g Cat.-1). Reusability of the catalysts was examined. The catalytic activity of the SO2 Cl2-modified catalyst was sustained from the second run after the initial activity dropped after the first run and kept the same activity until the fifth run. It was higher than that of first-used Nafion. These experimental results demonstrate that catalysts from lipid-extracted algae have great potential for the economic and environment-friendly production of biodiesel. © 2018 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Castor seed, as non-edible energy oilseed, was used to obtain several products, such as biodiesel, ricinine, and non-toxic castor seed meal through ultrasonic-assisted two-phase extraction (UATPE), alkaline transesterification, and recrystallization. The products with higher quality could be obtained by UATPE in shorter extraction time. The optimum conditions for UATPE were as follows: the extraction time of 60 min, the corresponding temperature of 55 °C, the ratio of castor seed meal, petroleum ether and deionized water was 1:4:6 (mg/mL/mL). Castor oil which was obtained by UATPE was used to produce the biodiesel. And the yield of biodiesel could come up to 95.7% with the temperature of 60 °C, the molar ratio of methanol to oil of 7:1, the amount of the catalyst of 0.7%, and the reaction time of 60 min. Meanwhile, with the trichrolomethanol as re-extraction agent, and ethanol as the recrystallization agent, the purity and recovery of the ricinine could be got to 97.7% and 93.8%, respectively. In addition, the structural characterizations of the obtained ricinine and biodiesel were carried out by UV, FITR, ESI-MS and other analytical methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass-derived furfural (FAL) is the platform chemical for synthesis of various value-added chemicals and fuels. One of the FAL-derived chemicals, i.e., 2-methylfuran (2-MF), is the potential biofuel due to its attractive chemical and physical properties. Various methods are reported for conversion of FAL to 2-MF which are operated at high temperature and high H2 pressure. In present work, one pot catalytic method was developed in batch mode process for conversion of FAL to 2-MF. Reactions are carried out in the presence of PtCo/C bimetallic catalyst under 0.5–1 MPa H2 pressure. Monometallic and bimetallic catalysts with different Pt and Co loading were prepared by wet impregnation method, and catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, BET surface area, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy techniques. 59% 2-MF yield was achieved at 180 °C and lower (0.5 MPa) H2 pressure. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - A new nano-sized barium coordination polymer, {(bipyH)[Ba2(pydc)2(Hpydc)(H2O)2]}n·nH2O (1), (bipy = 4,4′-bipyridine and H2pydc = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid), has been sonochemically synthesized and fully characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), FT-IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analyses. Compound 1 was structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and it was shown that this compound consists of 1D anionic coordination polymers and bipyH+ cationic species that construct a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture via non-covalent interactions i.e. ion-pairing and hydrogen bonding. The role of compound 1 as a heterogeneous catalyst in the production of biodiesel was also investigated. A full conversion of soybean oil to biodiesel was accomplished in an exceptionally short timeframe through an ultrasonic-assisted transesterification process in the presence of compound 1. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A bifunctional catalyst, Pt-ReOx supported on zirconium phosphate (Pt-ReOx/Zr-P), was prepared and tested for aqueous-phase hydrodeoxygenation (APHDO) of waste biomass-derived carbohydrate (e.g., sorbitol) to produce C4–C6 monoalcohols such as butanol, pentanol, and hexanol in a high-pressure continuous flow reactor. For steady-state operation, the reaction parameters were optimized to achieve the highest yield of C4–C6 monoalcohols from APHDO of sorbitol. Approximately 30% yield of C4–C6 monoalcohols was reached at optimal reaction conditions (temperature: 453 K, pressure: 6.21 MPa, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV): 0.16 h−1) for APHDO of sorbitol over the Pt-ReOx/Zr-P catalyst. The effect of catalyst support for monoalcohol production was also evaluated by comparison between the Pt-ReOx/Zr-P and carbon supported Pt-ReOx (Pt-ReOx/C) catalysts. The Zr-P supported catalyst exhibited a four times higher yield of C4–C6 monoalcohols than the carbon supported catalyst, suggesting that acid sites atomically separated from metal sites play a crucial role in producing monoalcohols via C–O bond cleavage of chemical intermediates produced during APHDO of sorbitol. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The bioconversion of lignocellulose in various industrial processes, such as biofuel production, requires the degradation of cellulose. Actinomadura amylolytica YIM 77502T is an aerobic, Gram-positive actinomycete that can efficiently degrade crystalline cellulose by extracellular cellulases. Genomic analysis of A. amylolytica identified 9 cellulase and 11 β-glucosidase genes that could potentially encode proteins that digest cellulose. Extracellular proteome characterization of A. amylolytica cell-free culture supernatant by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 4 of these cellulases and 2 of these β-glucosidases functioned during cellulose hydrolysis. Thin-layer chromatography analysis revealed extracellular β-glucosidases play a major role in carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) degradation of products in culture supernatants. In this study, 2 of the identified secreted β-glucosidases, AaBGL1 and AaBGL2, were functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and found to have β-glucosidase activity with wide substrate specificities, including for p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside (pNPC), and cellobiose. Moreover, AaBGL1 and AaBGL2 had high tolerances for glucose. After adding these β-glucosidases to commercial cellulases, the degradation rates of CMC, Avicel, birch sawdust, and corncob powder increased by 37, 42, 33, and 9%, respectively. Overall, this work identifies an alternative potential source of β-glucosidases with potential applications in commercial cellulose utilization and the bioenergy industry. © Copyright © 2018 Yin, Sang, Xian, Li, Jiao, Liu, Hozzein, Xiao and Li.

AB  - In this work, high-performance non-enzymatic catalysts based on 3D hierarchical hollow porous Co3O4 nanododecahedras in situ decorated on carbon nanotubes (3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs) were successfully prepared via direct carbonizing metal-organic framework-67 in situ grown on carbon nanotubes. The morphology, microstructure, and composite of 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, micropore and chemisorption analyzer, and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical characterizations indicated that 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs present considerably catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation and could be promising for constructing high-performance electrochemical non-enzymatic glucose sensors and glucose/O2 biofuel cell. When used for non-enzymatic glucose detection, the 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs modified glassy carbon electrode (3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs/GCE) exhibited excellent analytical performance with high sensitivity (22.21 mA mM−1 cm−2), low detection limit of 0.35 μM (S/N = 3), fast response (less than 5 s) and good stability. On the other hand, when the 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs/GCE worked as an anode of a biofuel cell, a maximum power density of 210 μW cm−2 at 0.15 V could be obtained, and the open circuit potential was 0.68 V. The attractive 3D hierarchical porous structural features, the large surface area, and the excellent conductivity based on the continuous and effective electron transport network in 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs endow 3D Co3O4-HPND/CNTs with the enhanced electrochemical performance and promising applications in electrochemical sensing, biofuel cell, and other energy storage and conversion devices such as supercapacitor.

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of beech wood chips was undertaken in a laboratory-scale fixed bed reactor equipped with a biomass semi-continuous dispenser. During pyrolysis, chars are retained on a quartz frit and the pyrolytic vapors are entrained through a fixed-bed catalyst to be converted. Several acidic catalysts such as zeolites H-Beta, zeolite HMFI and 5% Ni supported on HMFI were screened in this equipment. The Ni/HMFI catalyst was also tested in the presence of 1 vol.% of hydrogen in the feed stream. Mass and carbon balances were carefully checked and the gas, liquids and solids fractions were analyzed in-depth to evaluate the impact of the catalyst compared to thermal conversion. In the presence of a catalyst, with a low catalyst-to-biomass ratio of 0.1, a lower amount of bio-oil was formed but it contained less oxygen. The bio-oils were characterized by bi-dimensional GC (GCxGC) coupled with MS and FID detectors. The amount of gaseous products also increased in the presence of all catalysts. In addition of the deoxygenation, gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) showed a decrease of the highest molecular masses in the bio-oil after catalytic treatment, which confirms the conversion of some oligomers. The presence of Ni enhanced the deoxygenation reactions while the addition of H2 is also beneficial to the bio-oil composition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acid catalyzed hydrothermal conversion of levulinic acid (LA) from various herbaceous materials including rice straw (RS), corn stover (CS), sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB), and Miscanthus (MS) was evaluated. With 1 M HCl, 150◦C, 5 h, 20 g/L solid loading, the yields of LA from untreated RS, CS, SSB and MS based on the glucan content were 60.2, 75.1, 78.5 and 61.7 wt %, respectively. It was also found that the particle size had no significant effect on LA conversion yield with &gt;3 h reaction time. With delignification using simulated green liquor (Na2CO3-Na2S, 20 wt % total titratable alkali (TTA), 40 wt % sulfidity) at 200◦C for 15 min, lignin removal was in the range of 64.8-91.2 wt %. Removal of both lignin and xylan during delignification increased the glucan contents from 33.0-44.3 of untreated biomass to 61.7-68.4 wt % of treated biomass. Delignified biomass resulted in much lower conversion yield (50.4-56.0 wt %) compared to 60.2-78.5 wt % of untreated biomass. Nonetheless, the concentration of LA in the product was enhanced by a factor of ~1.5 with delignification. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this study a novel modeling approach for describing fermentative hydrogen production in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was developed, using the Aquasim modeling platform. This model accounts for the key metabolic reactions taking place in a fermentative hydrogen producing reactor, using fixed stoichiometry but different reaction rates. Biomass yields are determined based on bioenergetics. The model is capable of describing very well the variation in the distribution of metabolic products for a wide range of hydraulic retention times (HRT). The modeling approach is demonstrated using the experimental data obtained from a CSTR, fed with food industry waste (FIW), operating at different HRTs. The kinetic parameters were estimated through fitting to the experimental results. Hydrogen and total biogas production rates were predicted very well by the model, validating the basic assumptions regarding the implicated stoichiometric biochemical reactions and their kinetic rates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, human feces were hydrothermal liquefied and converted into biocrude over Ni-Tm/TiO2 catalyst. The influence of catalysts, reaction temperature, and holding time on the distribution of products and element content of biocrude was assessed. The biocrude yield increased to 53.16% with a reaction temperature of 330 °C, a holding time of 30 min, and adding Ni-Tm/TiO2 catalyst while the liquefaction conversion peaked at 89.61%. The biocrude had an HHV of 36.64 MJ/kg and was similar to heavy crude oil. The biocrude is rich in fatty acid amides, esters, and oxygen-containing-only heteroatom-ring compounds as well as some nitrogen-containing heteroatom-ring compounds. The main gaseous products were CO2, CH4, and C2H6. Hydrothermal liquefaction over Ni-Tm/TiO2 catalyst could be a potential method to handle human excrement treatment and produce biofuel. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - In the present study, sodium phosphate was synthesized through glycerol purification. The as-synthesized sodium phosphate was characterized and effectively utilized as a heterogeneous base catalyst for biodiesel production from dairy waste scum oil. In addition, sodium phosphate was synthesized from crude glycerol and the same can be used for biodiesel production, which is economically beneficial. Further, the maximum dairy scum oil methyl ester (DSOME/biodiesel) yield of 97.7% was achieved under optimum conditions of 11:1 molar ratio, 4 wt% catalyst loading, 65 °C temperature and 60 min reaction time with stirring at 700 rpm.

AB  - Macroalgae (or seaweeds) are considered potential biomass feedstocks for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. Their sugar composition is different from that of lignocellulosic biomasses, and in green species, including Ulva lactuca, the major sugars are L-rhamnose and D-glucose. C. beijerinckii DSM 6423 utilized these sugars in a U. lactuca hydrolysate to produce acetic acid, butyric acid, isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol (IBE), and 1,2-propanediol. D-Glucose was almost completely consumed in diluted hydrolysates, while L-rhamnose or D-xylose was only partially utilized. In this study, the metabolism of L-rhamnose by C. beijerinckii DSM 6423 was investigated to improve its utilization from natural resources. Fermentations on D-glucose, L-rhamnose, and a mixture of D-glucose and L-rhamnose were performed. On L-rhamnose, the cultures showed low growth and sugar consumption and produced 1,2-propanediol, propionic acid, and n-propanol in addition to acetic and butyric acids, whereas on D-glucose, IBE was the major product. On a D-glucose- L-rhamnose mixture, both sugars were converted simultaneously and L-rhamnose consumption was higher, leading to high levels of 1,2-propanediol (78.4 mM), in addition to 59.4 mM butanol and 31.9 mM isopropanol. Genome and transcriptomics analysis of D-glucose- and L-rhamnose-grown cells revealed the presence and transcription of genes involved in L-rhamnose utilization and in bacterial microcompartment (BMC) formation. These data provide useful insights into the metabolic pathways involved in L-rhamnose utilization and the effects on the general metabolism (glycolysis, early sporulation, and stress response) induced by growth on L-rhamnose. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - A great diversity of fruits is used in the food industry to obtain different products such as juices, sauces and foods. However, the food industry produces high amounts of residues. Passion fruit and guava are worldwide known fruits and very used by the food industry and generate tons of seed as residue. This work aims to study the extraction of oils from passion fruit and guava juice industries residues, their characterization and potential application as raw materials to obtain biodiesel and bio-oil. The passion fruit and guava seed oils content were 25 and 9%, respectively. In both oils, polyunsaturated fatty acids are predominant. Biodiesel obtained by esterification/ transesterification of both seed oils match most of the parameters specified for biodiesel in Brazil. Bio-oils obtained by thermal cracking of the seed oils were mainly composed by hydrocarbons similar to those observed in petroleum diesel. © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Química

AB  - We report the preparation of mono and bi-enzymatic bioanodes immobilizing dehydrogenase enzymes at the surface of a carbon support aiming to follow the 2 and 4 electron transfer of ethanol oxidation by HPLC. Enzymatic immobilization of ADH and AlDH enzymes at the bioanodes was performed using Nafion membranes modified with tetrabutylammonium salt. The monoenzymatic film with immobilized alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) provided, at pH 8.50, power densities of 29.5 ± 3.4 μW cm−2; however, addition of the second enzyme (AlDH) aiming to transfer 4 electrons furnished values as high as 186.0 ± 19.4 μW cm−2. These results indicate that as the product of the first oxidation is consumed by the second enzyme it inhibits the first enzyme less thus, furnishing better performance for the bienzymatic electrodes. Long-term electrolysis (12 hours) of ethanol followed by HPLC-UV/RID system confirms our electrochemical finding demonstrating formation of 2 and 4 electrons products, e.g., acetaldehyde (6.6 mmol L−1) and acetate (0.72 mmol L−1) when a two dehydrogenase enzyme system was employed. The faradaic efficiency was above 60% for the bi-enzymatic system. We demonstrate that simultaneous product identification and mass balance analysis is an important tool to follow the synergy between the enzymes within the enzymatic cascade. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Aerobic photosynthesis in green plants, cyanobacteria, and micro-algae has two important sites in the integral-membrane photoactive complexes, photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII). These systems are assembled into thylakoid membranes. Thylakoid membranes with oxygen-evolution activity owing to PSII can be used in visible-light driven water photolytic materials. In this work, a new visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel-based cell consisting of the thylakoid membrane of microalgae Spirulina platensis immobilized on a nanocrystalline TiO2 layer electrode as a photoanode, a formate dehydrogenase (FDH)/viologen co-immobilized electrode as a cathode, and a CO2-saturated buffer solution as the redox electrolyte, was developed. The actual short-circuit photocurrent of this cell was estimated to be ca. 50 μA cm-2. Formic acid and oxygen were produced in this biofuel cell, while generating electricity from irradiated visible light. The ratio of formic acid to oxygen produced in the biofuel cell after continuous irradiation was estimated to be ∼2. Thus, formic acid and oxygen were produced stoichiometrically in this visible-light driven electrochemical biofuel cell. Thus, a new biofuel cell system with the functions of a solar cell and the ability of CO2 conversion was developed. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - The transition from the use of fossil fuels to alternative and innovative fuels is a complex process involving two main points: the research of a new generation of raw materials and the development of the related technology. Regarding to raw materials, vegetable oils have the capacity to storage large a+mounts of energy, a capacity directly related to their chemical structure, which have similar carbon chains to the common fuels such as gasoil or diesel. However, vegetable oils, which are mostly constituted by triglycerides, cannot be easily used as such. Additionally, they contain significant amounts of oxygen atoms incorporated in the form of carboxyl groups. Consequently, they need to be treated through a deoxygenation process to be converted into useful fuels. Selective deoxygenation can be obtained by promoting the reactions of decarboxylation and decarbonylation in limited presence of hydrogen or even in absence of this gas. Selective decarboxylation of fatty acids results in the elimination of carboxylic groups producing CO2 and a paraffin hydrocarbon (n-alkane with one less carbon atom than the starting fatty acid) while selective decarbonylation leads to the formation of CO, H2O and an olefinic hydrocarbon (the corresponding alkene). When realized over triglycerides these reactions imply also the cracking of the glycerol moiety producing light hydrocarbons. Additionally, ketonization occurs producing high molecular weight ketones that can later be cracked to lighter methyl-ketones. Such pyrolytic processes may bring different benefits, such as the production of high-cetane-number linear hydrocarbons within the diesel range coming from biological sources, which are fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Also, by-products as CO2 could be recovered and used in an integrated biorefinery. Previously, we studied the deoxygenation of oil a non-edible oil (Jatropha curcas oil) and waste cooking vegetable oil in a hydrogen free atmosphere using ?-Al2O3, CaO and Mg-Al mixed oxides (obtained from treated hydrotalcite) as catalysts. Mg-Al mixed oxides (calcined hydrothalcite) revealed interesting catalytic activity. This communication reports on the analysis of the chemical composition of the products obtained during the catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha curcas oil, at different temperatures and reaction times, using the same catalyst. In the experiments, it was evidenced that the liquid biofuel recovered at 400 °C was composed mainly by hydrocarbons (66 mol % including n-paraffins and aliphatics), this amount increased for the product recovered at 425 °C (77 mol % including n-paraffins and aliphatics). Those compositions are not very different from that of commercial Diesel B7 (91 mol % of hydrocarbons including n-paraffins and aliphatics). It is suggested that Jatropha curcas oil deoxygenation proceeds mainly through the reactions of decarboxylation and ketonization (also involving a decarboxylation). While, ketonization reaction was favored at the lowest temperature tested, it was evident that decarboxylation reaction was predominantly by increasing the temperature.

AB  - Converting biomass to a useful fuel commonly incorporates the pyrolysis of the biomass feed stock. The base liquid fraction usually contains high concentrations of ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, of which each can cause detrimental issues related to the storage and upgrading process. Knowing the carbonyl species and the concentration of each will provide value information to the pyrolysis researchers, specifically as that community branches into more targeted end-products such as jet fuel or biogenic-derived oxygenate-containing fuel products. The analysis of aldehydes, ketones and small alkyl carboxylic acids using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivation method has been well documented and the method is commonly used the analytical community. By using liquid chromatograph coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, biomass sample analysis can be complete with identification of most carbonyl species. The issue of identifying isobaric ketone and aldehyde compounds can be resolved by utilizing differences in retention time or characteristic fragment ions of ketones and aldehydes. One issue which could not resolved using published methods was identifying aromatic or large non-aromatic carboxylic acids from their corresponding hydroxyl aldehyde or ketone analogs. By modifying the current method for determining carbonyls in biomass samples, carboxylic and hydroxyl-carbonyl can be determined. A careful adjustment of the pH during the extraction procedure and extended heating time of the DNPH solution allowed for the successful derivation of aromatic carboxylic acids. Like other dinitrophenylhydrazones, carboxylic acid derivatives also produce a unique secondary ion pattern, which was useful to distinguish these species from the non-acid analogs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Presently, very few strategies are available for directly converting glucose-like compounds to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), a remarkable biofuel candidate. We report here on this conversion effectively using aluminum-based mixed-acid catalyst in co-solvent medium. The combination of aluminum triflate and Amberlyst-15 exhibited an admirable synergistic catalytic effect for the one-pot cascade conversion of glucose. Importantly, the interfusion of dimethyl sulfoxide into ethanol as co-solvent medium can significantly promote the formation of EMF reducing the extent of side reactions. Based on this protocol, the effects of key process variables on the conversion of glucose were investigated via response surface methodology, leading to EMF in up to a 48.1% yield. The catalytic system can be separated with the reaction products and demonstrates reusability. Also, the generality of developed catalytic strategy can extended to synthesize EMF directly from glucose-based polysaccharides, such as sucrose and starch. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Insensitive Munition (IM) formulations contain 3-nitro-1,2,4-trizole-5-one (NTO), an energetic compound with the highest aqueous solubility (16 g L−1) among all IM explosives, including 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) and 1-nitroguanidine (NQ); as a result wastewater streams from IM processing facilities can be highly contaminated and potentially toxic. The removal of energetic compounds from wastewater streams prior to their discharge in the environment is imperative, and new technology must be developed to efficiently treat high levels of NTO and other IM compounds in these streams. In this study, the treatment of NTO wastewater by a UV/H2O2 oxidation process under acidic conditions (pH = 3.0 ± 0.1) and a hydrogen peroxide concentration of at least 1500 mg L−1 resulted in successful removal of the energetic compound. The organic carbon from the NTO ring was completely converted to inorganic carbon (CO2), as confirmed through TOC measurements and GC–MS analysis on the reactor headspace. Nitrate and ammonium ions were the major nitrogen by-products, as indicated by mass spectrometry. The results obtained in this work demonstrate that the UV/H2O2 oxidation process can effectively mineralize high concentrations of NTO in wastewater streams leading to recovery of valuable nutrients that can be used for supporting algal biomass growth for biofuel/biogas generation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Organic acids produced during ensiled wet storage are beneficial during the storage process, both for biomass preservation, and to aid in mild in-situ pretreatment. However, there is concern these acids could later have negative impacts on downstream processes, especially microbial fermentation. Organic acids can inhibit microbial metabolism or growth, which in turn could affect biofuel productivity or yield. This study investigated the interaction of organic acids produced during ensiled storage with subsequent pretreatment of the resulting corn stover silage, as well as the potential for interference with downstream ethanol fermentation. Interaction with pretreatment was observed by measuring xylan and glucan removal and the formation of inhibitors. The results indicated that organic acids generally do not impede downstream processes and in fact can be beneficial. The levels of organic acids produced during 220 days of storage jar tests at 23°C or 37°C, and their transformation during pretreatment, remained below inhibitory levels. Concentrations of individual acids did not exceed 6 g per liter of the pretreated volume, and < 5% on a dry matter basis. Whereas, unensiled corn stover required 15 min of 190°C pretreatment to optimize sugar release, ensiled corn stover could be treated equally effectively at a lower pretreatment duration of 10 min. Furthermore, the different organic acid profiles that accumulate at various storage moisture levels (35-65%) do not differ significantly in their impact on downstream ethanol fermentation. These results indicate biorefineries using ensiled corn stover feedstock at 35-65% moisture levels can expect as good or better biofuel yields as with unensiled stover, while reducing pretreatment costs. © 2018 Essien and Richard.

AB  - Enzymatic biodiesel, as an alternative biodiesel obtained by chemical route and alternative to petroleum fuel, becomes attractive by using low-cost raw materials such as abdominal chicken fat and low-cost free enzyme as catalyst. In this sense, the main goal of this work was to optimize enzymatic biodiesel synthesis to obtain high methyl esters content from abdominal chicken fat by using free NS 40116 lipase as a catalyst in a solvent-free system. Kinetics studies were carried out to investigate the influence of enzyme in relation to water content (0.0–2.0 wt%), NS 40116 concentration (0.1–0.7%), temperature (30–45 °C), molar ratio oil to ethanol (1:3–1:6) and different additions of methanol (1–6 shots). Under optimized conditions of reaction, 77% of conversion was obtained using 0.3 wt% NS 40116, 2 wt% water, 1:4.5 molar ratio oil to methanol (3 shots), 30 °C and 250 rpm in 24 h. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of hydrocarbons contained in product gas from medium-temperature biomass gasification into syngas is a crucial step to improve the overall process energy efficiency of biofuel production. Catalytic steam reforming is an attractive option; however, deactivation by tar and carbon deposition is one of the main challenges of steam reforming catalysts. In this paper, we propose the implementation of robust, mineral-based, ice-templated materials for partial conversion of heavy tars. Ice-templation is an innovative process which produces mechanically resistant beads with radial porosity. We have studied the performance of ice-templated beads under relevant biomass gasification conditions. To investigate separately the impact of porosity and chemical composition, we compare dense alpha alumina beads with ice-templated alpha-alumina and ice-templated olivine beads. Impact was quantified in terms of gas composition, tar content and composition, as well as characterization of spent materials. The results show that thermal cracking (leading to severe carbon deposition) is the main process for dense beads, whereas ice-templated beads show tar conversion via reforming, especially when external steam is added, as well as WGS activity. Post-mortem analysis confirmed the stability of the pore structure, thus showing that ice-templated materials are an attractive option for the partial conversion of tars contained in product gas, particularly as guard bed for (expensive) tar reforming catalysts, thus improving the reliability of catalytic tar conversion routes. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Valeric esters are a promising energy source and used in different industries ranging from biofuels, perfumes, food, flavors to pharmaceuticals. Ethyl valerate is one of the esters possessing all these attributes as an industrial chemical. In the current work an enzymatic route was examined using valeric acid and ethanol with commercially available lipases, namely, Lipozyme RM IM, Lipozyme TL IM and Novozyme 435 (Candida antarctica lipase B) under solvent fee condition and microwave irradiation. Novozym 435 could lead to 69.2% conversion of valeric acid at 50 °C using equimolar ratio of valeric acid and ethanol at enzyme loading of 10.06 g L−1 in 40 min under microwave irradiation. Lineweaver-Burk plot shows ternary complex mechanism with inhibition by ethanol. A reaction mechanism is proposed and kinetic rate equation derived. The enzyme is reusable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Feedstock cost is one of the main considerations in biodiesel production and researchers intensively searching for a low cost feedstock in order to make the process viable. This study reports the use of Aglaia korthalsii seed oil as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production using waste marine barnacle as a solid catalyst. A. korthalsii with oil content of 16.2 ± 0.18 wt.% was subjected to transesterification using barnacle (a source of CaO) as a solid base catalyst. The catalyst was characterized using TGA, XRD and FESEM; upon calcination CaCO3 turned into CaO, the species that catalyze the transesterification reaction. Parametric optimization under Central Composite Design revealed that the optimal reaction conditions are as follow: 12.2:1 MeOH:oil molar ratio and 4.7 wt.% catalyst at 65 °C, 3 h reaction duration, under which A. korthalsii oil was successfully converted into methyl ester (ME) with highest conversion of 97.12 ± 0.49%. The catalyst could be reused for four times, maintaining methyl ester content at 95.83% and the product meets the key specifications for biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article reports the preparation of cost-effective bio-hydroxyapatite (ram bone derived) supported mesoporous Cr heterogeneous catalysts and its performance in biodiesel production from used frying mustard oil (UFMO). The optimal catalyst (98.45 m2/g BET area; pore volume 0.0586 cc/g; modal pore diameter 19.3 nm and 0.78 mmol NH3/g catalyst acid-site concentration) demonstrated remarkable efficacy in sustainable synthesis of biodiesel from UFMO achieving maximum FAME content (96.85%) at optimal (predicted through D-optimal method) conditions: 4 wt% catalyst concentration, 8.0 methanol/UFMO molar ratio and 200 °C calcination temperature for catalyst preparation. Biodiesel production through concurrent transesterification-esterification (CTE) of UFMO could be augmented from 40.22% (conductive heating system) to 96.85% FAME yield using energy-proficient infrared radiation. Promising engine operation was recorded in terms of lower exhaust temperature at various blends of petrodiesel-product biodiesel in comparison with unaided petro-diesel. Assessment of exhaust emissions implied a significantly low CO (0.05%) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions (&lt;0.00002) for product biodiesel conforming to Euro-VI emission standards. Thus, the article demonstrates an inexpensive and efficient avenue for utilisation of waste resources to generate and utilise clean and renewable energy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study optimized biodiesel production by Monoraphidium sp. in terms of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield by varying four variables (volume of methanol, reaction temperature, reaction time, and ultrasound power) using a Box-Behnken design (BBD). Within the experimental range, the volume of methanol was found to be the most important factor, having a positive influence on the FAME yield. The test variables affected the FAME yield, and the optimal condition varied between alkali- and acid-catalyzed transesterification. Both types of transesterification reaction occurred at their optimal catalyst concentrations, 0.5% NaOH and 2% H2SO4, respectively, for both dry and wet microalgal biomass. The FAME yield with the acid-catalyzed reaction was better than that with the alkali-catalyzed reaction. The combined alkali-and-acid-catalyzed transesterification reactions enhanced the FAME yield. The microalgae produced fatty acids, comprising mainly palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), and linolenic acid (C18:3), with palmitic acid (C16:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2) being the most abundant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the behavior of two types of modified biochar (functional and iron composite biochars) as a catalyst regarding their surface chemistry and morphological properties and their effects on bio-product derived from pyrolysis of Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) macroalagae. Two catalytic pyrolysis experiments were conducted in 25 mL slow pyrolysis reactor in the presence of biochar-based catalysts at the temperature of 500 °C. For functional biochar, no clear effect on biogas production was observed, whereas iron composite biochar increased the hydrogen content by 7.99 mml/g algae. Iron composite biochar with a 3D network structure demonstrated remarkable catalytic behaviors (especially toward hydrogen production) due to its wonderful surface area, high dispersion of iron particles and particular structures and compositions. The biochar derived marine biomass and treatment process developed here could provide a promising path for the low-cost, efficient, renewable and environmental friendly catalysts. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - MoO3 catalyst supported on synthesized mesoporous SBA-15 matrix was employed in the hydrothermolysis of Kraft lignin in a basic-subcritical water system. Experiments were carried out in a batch reactor at 350 °C for 1 h under N2 atmosphere using two different solvent systems of sub-H2O and 0.5% NaOH. At 10% (w/w) of synthesized MoO3/SBA-15 catalyst with lignin, the highest total crude bio-oil yield (∼56.40 wt %) and lowest char formation (∼8.60 wt %) were observed in basic medium, in comparison to the subcritical water system. The GC-MS analysis of the produced bio-oil indicated that the major products in the crude bio-oil were phenol-rich monomers such as guaiacols (19.50%), alkyl-guaiacols (24.83%), catechol (26.76%), and alkyl-catechols (17.82%) under subcritical water condition. Alternatively, catechols (42.07%) and alkyl-catechols (34.59%) were the primary products in the basic solvent system with the presence of MoO3/SBA-15 catalyst. Additionally, monophenols (5.0%) were also produced as a result of the demethoxylation of guaiacol or hydrodeoxygenation of catechol. MoO3/SBA-15 catalyst significantly reduced the oxygen-carbon ratio (O/C) from 0.72 (in original Kraft lignin) to 0.29 (in basic-subcritical water system). Decreased oxygen and increased carbon and hydrogen contents enhanced the calorific value of the produced bio-oil, whereby a higher heating value (HHV) of 32.00 MJ/kg was achieved. The synthesized catalysts were characterized through BET, XPS, ICP-OES, and HR-TEM analyses. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the present work, catalytic wet air oxidation (WAO) technique was applied to biomethanated spent wash from a local sugar factory. This wash water exhibited high biological oxygen demand (BOD5 = 8100 mg/L) and chemical oxygen demand (COD = 40,000 mg/L). The objectives of oxidative pre-treatment were two-fold, viz. efficient treatment of wash water and enhanced biogas recovery. For the catalytic oxidation process, two iron-based heterogeneous catalysts were employed, viz. Fe2O3 and Fe/C. To synthesize the Fe/C catalyst, activated carbon (AC) support was modified either by thermal treatment or chemical treatment with nitric acid; accordingly, the catalyst was named as Fe/AC-T or Fe/AC-N. In a batch slurry reactor, catalyst performance was investigated at T = 175 °C, PO2 = 0.69 MPa and ω = 33 mg/L (here, T, PO2 and ω denote temperature, oxygen partial pressure and catalyst loading) for 1 h. Based on the conversions of COD and total organic carbon (TOC) and the improvement in biodegradability index (BI), it was found that the activity of the catalysts reduced in the order: Fe/AC-N &gt; Fe/AC-T &gt; Fe2O3. The results were more encouraging (COD conversion = 87%, color reduction = 88% and BI value = 0.71) when carbon adsorption (5% w/v) followed WAO over Fe/AC-N. Clearly, our novel hybrid process for pre-treatment, viz. wet oxidation-carbon adsorption showed potential. Post biomethanation, around 1.2 Nm3 biogas (CH4 72%) was formed per cubic meter of the wastewater; without pre-treatment by catalytic WAO and carbon adsorption, the yield of biogas (CH4 11%) was just 1 Nm3 for every cubic meter of wastewater. After a last aerobic treatment step, 97% COD was removed and BI value was 0.84. Finally, a kinetic model was proposed to describe kinetics of COD reduction. In this way, a promising method was suggested for treating a complex wastewater. © 2018

AB  - Due to its widely green and sustainable properties, cellulose is identified as a green and sustainable alternative for the preparation of valuable biofuels and chemicals. In this study, Poly-Pickering HIPEs (PHs) was synthesized as the precursor by using Pickering high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) as templates and PHs-SO3H was prepared after sulfonation treatment. We chemically grafted UiO-66(Hf)-type MOFs onto PHs-SO3H in order to synthesize a novel catalyst for the transformation of cellulose into 5-HMF, which made clear that HMF yield was improved in the presence of the catalyst. What's more, the 5-HMF yield of 49.6% was obtained under the optimal conditions of 50 mg cellulose, 30 mg catalyst, 60 min of reaction time and 120 °C of reaction temperature. The catalyst is recyclable four cycles without crucial loss of catalytic activity. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In this present investigation, lipid extraction was performed in marine macro algae Ulva fasciata using soxhlet and super critical fluid extraction apparatus. The ultrasonic pretreatment was done for the algal biomass. Extraction parameters for High extraction yield of algal oil were obtained at 5% moisture content, 0.25 mm particle size, 90 °C, 180 min time, 5:1 solvent-to-solid ratio and solvent flow rate 1 l/hr. After the optimization process 9.85% of oil extraction was obtained from Ulva fasicata algal biomass. The aromatic groups, indicating the presence of 12-Hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid was confirmed by FT-IR analysis. Thus the algal oil obtained from Ulva fasicata biomass can be used for the biodiesel production. The saturated fatty acid (SFAs) was found to be 75.43% in the produced algal oil. The properties like Acid value, Iodine number, specific gravity, Saponification value, calorific value, Flash point, Fire point and kinematic viscosity was also characterized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels mitigate and offset greenhouse gases. A long-term levelized cost of energy (LCOE) estimation for biofuels in China was carried out, using a novel probabilistic model to analyze the likelihood of biofuels economically outrunning fossil fuels. This model calculated LCOE based on five uncertain input parameters fed into a Monte Carlo simulation, namely, discount rate, firm size, feedstock price, product yield and catalyst/enzyme cost, while key assumptions were used to determine their probability distributions. Model results show that the mean levelized costs of most biofuel technologies will fall below 9500 Chinese Yuan per ton by 2030 and below 9000 Chinese Yuan per ton by 2050; it is highly possible for most biofuel technologies to gain economic feasibility and competitiveness by around 2025–2030 in China. The LCOE reduction of 1.5-generation (1.5G) biofuels is feedstock-driven, while that of 2nd-generation (2G) biofuels is technology-driven. Meanwhile, 1.5G biofuels are more sensitive to crude oil price changes than 2G biofuels, with a drop in crude oil price having a greater effect on 2G biofuels than a rise. On average, every 10% rise in crude oil price accelerates their economic feasibility by 2–3 years, while every 10% drop delays this feasibility by 3–5 years. © 2018

AB  - Process design and techno-economic analysis of a pilot bio-jet fuel production facility were investigated using Aspen plus software and net present value method (NPV). This process include two-step hydrothermal decomposition of corncob to furfural (steam stripping of hemicellulose) and Levulinic acid (LA, acidic hydrolysis of cellulose), oxygenated precursor production via aldol condensation reaction of furfural and LA, and the subsequent hydro-processing for oxygen removal. Lab experiments on the major area of the process were carried out. The yields of furfural, LA, oxygenated precursor and bio-jet fuel-range hydrocarbons (C8–C15) were 59.5% (based on hemicellulose), 34.4% (based on cellulose), 75% (based on furfural and LA input) and 51 wt% (based on precursor) respectively. These values were used as the input information for the process simulation of a first-of-a-kind pilot facility for 1.3 ML/a bio-jet fuel production using this pioneering technology. The mass and energy analysis from Aspen plus model shows that the bio-jet fuel yield was 0.125 tonne/tonne dried corncob. 31.0% of carbon atoms and 47.6% of potential energy from carbohydrate compounds of corncob leave as bio-jet fuel. The estimated consumption of water, steam and electricity is relatively high of 12.3 kg, 63.7 kg and 1.22 KW h respectively due to small simulation scale and lack of process optimization. The total capital cost was ca. $3.96 MM for the 1.3 ML/a facility, of which 28% of equipment investment is spent for oxygenated precursor production. The total operation expense (OPEX) is $1.18/L bio-jet fuel, including variable and fixed costs. Expenses on corncob, catalytic catalyst and H2 contribute 23%, 19% and 16% respectively. Single point sensitivity analysis of the major breakdown of OPEX shows that catalyst lifetime is the priority factor. Economy of scale of minimum selling price of bio-jet fuel (MSPB) for different capacity facilities (1.3 ML/a, 6.5 ML/a and 13 ML/a) was investigated using different discount and tax rates, of which the lowest MSPB was $0.74/L with a subsidy of $0.31/L at 10% discount rate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We investigated the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on the bio-oil yield and heating value in the low-temperature hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae. HTL is one of the thermochemical processes for bio-oil production. However, the high pressure of the process is one of the main challenges for commercialization. On the other hand, a decrease in the HTL pressure, and consequently a decrease in the temperature, results in a decrease in the bio-oil yield. In this work, we investigated a new method to increase the bio-oil yield at low pressures and temperatures. The microalgae (Nannochloropsis sp.) were first pretreated by ultrasonic waves for 30, 60, and 90 s at 100 W. After then, the bio-oil was produced using HTL at 210, 230, and 250 °C. According to the results, using ultrasonic-assisted HTL increased the bio-oil yield up to the maximum of 28.9% (90-s sonication time at 250 °C). Moreover, applying ultrasonic pretreatment resulted in a decrease in oxygen content of the bio-oil and consequently an increase in its heating value. However, the average nitrogen content did not change dramatically by using ultrasonic-assisted hydrothermal liquefaction. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proper management of the huge amount of waste activated sludge generated during the conventional treatment of wastewater is nowadays a major environmental issue. Proper treatment of sludge needs huge investment and proper handling. To address this issue, the immobilized photocatalyst (TiO2) mediated exocellular fractionation of bacterial pretreatment for anaerobic digestion was utilized as a sludge treatment technique. RESULT: Ti was deposited on glass substrate by a DC spluttering technique, and a TiO2 layer was formed by annealing in oxygen atmosphere. This immobilized TiO2 efficiently extricated the extracellular components after 45 min by removing 99% of the total extractable extracellular polymeric substances. The exocellular fractionated bacterial pretreatment induced 20% of COD solubilization with methane generation of about 0.0217 g COD g-1 COD d-1, which was higher than the sludge without any treatment and sludge with bacterial pretreatment only. CONCLUSION: An 8% increase in COD solubilization was achieved, which generated high quantities of methane. With the advantage of methane generation, the maximum profitable sludge reduction was obtained. Thin film deposition of TiO2 enables easy recovery of TiO2. The cost, energy, and solid balance analysis confirmed that this treatment method is field applicable. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Rapeseed plantation biodiesel production systems require the transportation of goods, like raw materials, machines and tools, and products between various conversion stages of agricultural as well as industrial subsystems. Each transportation step requires the consumption of some energy. This consumption decreases the net amount of energy delivered out of the biofuel production system, and consequently decreases the energetic efficiency of the system. The majority of studies on biofuel sustainability are done by means of the LCA method with the use of a data average for some region and period of time. Such analyses do not reveal the possible causes of the conclusions determined. The present work deals with computer modelling of the influence of the energy consumed on those transport routes on the energetic efficiency of the production system. The model enables determination of the effects caused by changes introduced to technological parameters. The effects caused by variation of fuel consumption, the load capacity of transportation means, size of plantation, distribution and sizes of individual fields, distances between fields, plantation yield, and finally the distance between the plantation and the industrial facility are studied using the numerical model developed earlier. This approach is aimed towards identifying the reasons for the behavior of a system controlled by many somewhat coupled variables. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Compared to other inedible agricultural based feedstocks such as corn stover, rice husk, wheat straw and sugarcane bagasse, sorghum biomass (stalks and leaves) possess elevated credentials towards biofuel production which is highly tolerant against heat and drought conditions. Therefore, a novel sorghum phenotype was generated through genetic mutations called "brown midrib" which possesses low lignin content with enriched palatability. In the present study, the chemical composition of fourteen genetically modified sorghum biomass traits were analyzed which constitute, 52.7-60% of structural carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose) and 11.6-17.7% of lignin. Due to the presence of low lignin content, pretreatment was performed using low energy input system to achieve maximum hemicellulose hydrolysis with minimized levels of sugar decomposition products. As a result, 88-92% of hemicellulose hydrolysis was attained with low amount of furfural (0.34-0.49 g/L) and 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (0.38-0.56 g/L). Furthermore, fermentation was also performed without detoxification of pretreatment derived hemicellulosic hydrolyzate to evaluate the effect of fermentative inhibitors on ethanol-producing yeast. As a result, 88.8-92.5% ethanol conversion efficiency and 0.45-0.47 (gp/gs) ethanol yield were achieved within 15 h of fermentation time period. © 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Real geometric structures of randomly packed beds are modeled using the discrete element software LIGGGHTS. The wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model and the EBU-Arrhenius combustion model are used to simulate the propane-air premixed combustion process in the randomly packed beds, and the calculated results are compared with experimental data. The results reveal that the turbulence model and combustion model used in this paper are reasonable. Next, propagation velocity, area, mean vorticity and fractal dimension of a flame surface are calculated at various time points with different inlet velocities to investigate the changes in flame characteristics during the combustion process and the effect of increasing the inlet velocity. According to our results, the flame propagation velocity changes do not exhibit a clear trend over time. However, the variation trends of the two curves under the different inlet velocities are similar. In addition, the fractal dimension exhibits no obvious rule of increasing or decreasing during the combustion process. The area and mean vorticity of the flame surface increase with time. However, the rules of increase are not exactly the same. In addition, the flame regimes at various time points are identified. The results reveal that the turbulent premixed flames in a packed bed under two inlet velocities are concentrated in the thin reaction zone. © 2018

AB  - The catalytic upgrading of bio-based platformmolecules is a promising approach for biomass valorization. However, most solid catalysts are not thermally or chemically stable, and are difficult to prepare. In this study, a stable organic phosphonate–hafnium solid catalyst (PPOA–Hf) was synthesized, and acid–base bifunctional sites were found to play a cooperative role in the cascade transfer hydrogenation and cyclization of ethyl levulinate (EL) to γ-valerolactone (GVL). Under relatively mild reaction conditions of 160 °C for 6 h, EL was completely converted to GVL with a good yield of 85%. The apparent activation energy was calculated to be 53 kJ/mol, which was lower than other solid catalysts for the same reaction. In addition, the PPOA-Hf solid catalyst did not significantly decrease its activity after five recycles, and no evident leaching of Hf was observed, indicating its high stability and potential practical application. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Potential energy feedstocks from conventional agriculture usually include pure vegetable oil (PVO) and agricultural/forest residues. Their uses can represent a starting point for the development of short agro-energy chains in the south areas of the Mediterranean region. This paper focused on testing and awareness raising of biofuel production for the cogeneration of electricity and heat from PVO of two Brassica oilseed crops in Sicily (Italy). The main aims of this study were: i) to evaluate the agronomic performance of rapeseed (Brassica napus L. var. oleifera D.C.) and Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun) in semi-arid climate condition; ii) to analyze the quality of PVO and the chemical-physical characteristics of pure vegetable oils, defatted seed meals and crop residues of the two species; iii) to define the economic viability of a pilot combined heat and power (CHP) plant operating on PVO. In this study, seed and crop residue yields were determined at the harvesting stage on a harvest area of 10 m2. For each species, chemical-physical characterizations were carried out using specific protocols. The cogeneration of heat and electricity was carried out using a CHP system with a nominal power of 75 kWh. The final stage of the study focused on the economic viability analysis of the CHP system. Seed yields of rapeseed and Ethiopian mustard were 2.10 and 1.16 t ha−1 on average, respectively. Ethiopian mustard obtained the highest performance of aboveground biomass yield (5.31 t ha−1). The fatty acid profiles of the PVO resulted different for the two oilseed crops. Ethiopian mustard had, on average, the highest glucosinolate content in the seeds. The cogenerator showed a consumption of 14.4 kg PVO h−1 on average. Cash-flow trend analysis showed good economic benefit for farmers. These results make the two species as promising energy crops for suitable short agro-energy chains in the south Mediterranean areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel and efficient method for the use of non-edible cassava to synthesize biofuel precursors with long carbon chains in two steps was proposed. The finally produced precursors were based on the decomposition of cassava and condensation between furans and levulinates. The reaction parameters for levulinate production from cassava were optimized, and the results showed that the highest carbon mole yield of levulinates was up to 51.3% at 473 K, 4.0 MPa N2, and 6.0 h. After that, precursors with yields of 88.0 and 90.5% could be obtained when the mole ratios between furans and levulinates were 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. Characterization of precursors using elemental analysis, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that different and intersecting routes of condensation resulted in the complex components of precursors. Moreover, the mechanism of condensation was proven to excessively depend upon the mole ratio between furans and levulinates in this investigation. This technical route indicates a simple and feasible method to produce renewable biofuel with long carbon chains from cassava directly. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Studying the interaction of functional proteins such as enzymes and nanoparticles (NPs) includes the important topic of investigating any possible changes in stability and function of enzymes in nanostructured environments. The effects of NPs on the enzyme activity and stability are governed by their physical and chemical properties such as structure, shape, size, surface chemistry and their surface charges. In this study, the influence of negatively and positively charged AuNPs are investigated on the activity of immobilized Myriococcum thermophilum cellobiose dehydrogenase (MtCDH) and its electron transfer rate with graphite electrodes modified with positively and negatively AuNPs. The MtCDH modified graphite electrode premodified with positively charged AuNPs showed an alkaline shift in the pH of maximum activity from pH 5.5 to 8. No change in the pH of maximum activity was observed when MtCDH graphite electrodes were premodified with negatively charged AuNPs. The results clearly demonstrated the effect of surface charge of AuNPs on the activity of the enzyme. The catalytic current density and the KM app value for MtCDH graphite electrode premodified with positively charged AuNPs were enhanced with up to 66 and 8 times, respectively. Two spectroscopic assays were also performed in solution to investigate the influence of the presence of positively or negatively charged AuNPs on the activity of MtCDH in homogeneous solution. The results clearly demonstrated that not only the rate of the heterogeneous electron transfer between the immobilized MtCDH and the electrode but also the rate of the homogeneous electron transfer between soluble MtCDH and the acceptor was highly dependent on the type of surface charge of the AuNPs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mixed metal oxides are promising heterogeneous catalysts for biofuel production from lipids via alcoholysis, however, the impact of solid acidity and/or basicity on reactivity is comparatively poorly understood. Two systematically related families of MgO–ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were therefore prepared by different synthetic routes to elucidate the impact of surface acid-base properties on catalytic performance in the transesterification of tributyrin with methanol. The resulting materials were characterized by TGA-MS, ICP-OES, N2 porosimetry, XRD, TEM, XPS, DRIFTS, and CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). MgO–ZrO2 catalysts prepared by both non-aqueous impregnation and citric acid-mediated sol–gel routes exhibit excellent activity and stability. The citrate routes favor highly dispersed MgO and concomitant Lewis acid-base pair formation at the interface with zirconia. However, for both the citrate and impregnation routes, tributyrin transesterification occurs over a common, strongly basic MgO active site. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Soybean is an important oil and protein source for human and animal food, as well as being used in the production of biofuel. Brazilian soybean is known for its quality, especially with regard to its high protein content. This work aimed to present a screening of Brazilian soybean cropped at different locations, to assess the composition of seed with regard to the protein, oil and fatty acid contents. We screened 46 cultivars, which represent more than 50% of the soybean cultivars produced in the South-Center region of Brazil in recent years, analyzed under six environments. In order to conduct the analysis, a grain sample was used to determine seed protein, oil and fatty acid contents, which was accomplished using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR). All the characters presented a genotype x environment interaction (GEI) (p < 0.01). A mean oil content of 20.35% was identified for all the evaluated cultivars. This was superior to that obtained in other countries. The mean protein content was 40.20%, which was expected for the Brazilian soybean. This higher oil content is doubly favorable in Brazilian soybean: firstly, for its use as cooking oil and biofuel; secondly, for the production of high protein soybean meal, once all the oil is removed. The cultivars which presented the highest oil contents were also stable across the evaluated environments. On the other hand, the genotypes with the highest protein content presented low stability across the environments. Regarding the fatty acid composition, Brazilian soybean stands out for its low linoleic acid content, which gives a high oxidative stability to the resulting oil and biofuel. Character associations were dependent on the location, thus breeders can select plants for specific traits at different locations. Brazilian cultivars present interesting characteristics for use in human and animal food products, and for biofuel production. © 2007-2018 Southern Cross Publishing-Australia.

AB  - The pretreatment of empty fruit bunch (EFB) was conducted using an integrated system of IL and cellulases (IL-E), with simultaneous fermentation in one vessel. The cellulase mixture (PKC-Cel) was derived from Trichoderma reesei by solid-state fermentation. Choline acetate [Cho]OAc was utilized for the pretreatment due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. The treated EFB and its hydrolysate were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and chemical analysis. The results showed that there were significant structural changes in EFB after the treatment in IL-E system. The sugar yield after enzymatic hydrolysis by the PKC-Cel was increased from 0.058 g/g of EFB in the crude sample (untreated) to 0.283 and 0.62 ± 06 g/g in IL-E system after 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively. The EFB hydrolysate showed the eligibility for ethanol production without any supplements where ethanol yield was 0.275 g ethanol/g EFB in the presence of the IL, while lower yield obtained without IL-pretreatment. Moreover, it was demonstrated that furfural and phenolic compounds were not at the level of suppressing the fermentation process. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pyrolytic lignin can be transformed to liquid transportation fuels by hydrotreatment, which requires hydrogen (H2). Bio-oil is a suitable renewable feedstock for H2 production. Here, n-butanol was chosen as a model compound representing alcohols in the bio-oil aqueous fraction. H2 production from steam reforming of n-butanol was investigated in a fixed-bed reactor using a commercial Ni/hydrotalcite catalyst. A plausible reaction pathway in the presence of Ni was discussed. An increase in reforming temperature, space time, and steam/carbon ratio in the feed enhanced the n-butanol conversion and H2 yield. Reaction kinetics was studied in the defined chemical control regime. The reaction order with respect to n-butanol (one) and the activation energy were determined. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass plays a vital role in the conversion of cellulosic biomass to bioethanol, especially for softwoods and hardwoods. Although many pretreatment technologies have been reported so far, only a few pretreatment methods can handle large woodchips directly. To improve the efficiency of pretreatment, existing technologies require the grinding of the wood into small particles, which is an energy-consuming process. Herein, for the first time, we report a simple, effective, and low-temperature (≈100 °C) process for the pretreatment of hardwood (HW) and softwood (SW) chips directly by using a catalytic system of FeCl3/NaNO3 (FCSNRC). The pretreatment experiments were conducted systematically, and a conversion of 71.53 and 70.66 % of cellulose to sugar could be obtained for the direct use of large HW and SW chips. The new method reported here overcomes one of the critical barriers in biomass-to-biofuel conversion, and both grinding and thermal energies can be reduced significantly. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Generation of coproducts from nutrients is purported to improve the sustainability of algae-derived transportation fuels by minimizing life cycle impacts and improving economic sustainability. Although algae cultivation produces lipids that is upgraded to drop-in transportation fuel products, life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis have shown that without coproducts, energy/economic returns are diminishing regardless of processing methods. This study utilizes a combined flash hydrolysis (FH), hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and coproduct conversion technology (atmospheric precipitation/AP; hydrothermal mineralization/HTM) to conserve the most recyclable nutrients for coproduct marketability. Six biofuel pathways were developed and compared in terms of "well-to-pump" energy, life cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions, and economic profitability: renewable diesel II (RDII), renewable gasoline (RG), and hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel, each were modeled for AP and HTM coproduct conversion. A functional unit of 1 MJ usable energy was employed. RG showed a promising energy-return-on-investment (EROI) due to multiple coproducts. All models demonstrated favorable EROI (EROI > 1). LC-GHG emissions tie in with EROI such that RG produced the least emissions. HRJ-HTM was determined to be the most profitable model with a profitability index (PI) of 0.75. Sensitivity analyses revealed that dewatering affects EROI and PI significantly. To achieve break-even, gasoline must sell at $4.10/gal, diesel at $5.64/gal, and jet fuel at $3.43/gal. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Oil meal is a by-product of the oil industry (peanut meal, sesame meal, and camellia meal). Oil is extracted from seeds, and the leftover meal is then pelletized, and this process generates a large amount of waste oil meal in Taiwan. In this study, peanut meal, sesame meal, and camellia meal derived fuels were prepared from the waste oil meal with waste cooking oil. The combustion behaviors of the oil meal derived fuels were also investigated. The characteristics of the derived fuel made from oil meal with waste cooking oil showed that the ash content is less than 10% and its calorific value reached 5000 kcal/kg. Additionally, the activation energy of the oil meal and waste cooking oil was analyzed by the Kissinger method. The results show that the fuel prepared in this work from the oil meal mixed with waste cooking oil is suitable for use as an alternative fuel and also avoids food safety issues. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biodiesel is currently produced from a catalytic transesterification reaction of edible and nonedible oils with methanol. New policies are encouraging the development of advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic feedstocks or industrial waste as animal fat. This material is less expensive than current oils but usually has high content of free fatty acids and a pre-esterification reaction becomes necessary, increasing the cost of the catalytic process. The production of biodiesel using supercritical alcohols is appropriate for materials with high acidity and water content; therefore, the use of this method for animal fat is a promising alternative. Two different processes have been studied: a single-step direct transesterification using supercritical ethanol and a two-step process of hydrolysis and esterification. Ethanol, instead of methanol, has been used as the reagent because it can be produced from biomass via fermentation, resulting in a complete renewable biofuel. The final conversion and degradation of unsaturated fatty acid esters, which is the main drawback of these high temperature and pressure processes, have been studied through the change of several parameters such as temperature, ethanol:animal fat molar ratio, and reaction time. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The scarcity of enzymes having an optimal activity in lignocellulose deconstruction is an obstacle for industrial-scale conversion of cellulosic biomass into biofuels. With the aim of mining novel lignocellulolytic enzymes, a ~9 Gb metagenome of bacteria in Vietnamese native goats’ rumen was sequenced by Illumina platform. From the data, 821 ORFs encoding carbohydrate esterases (CEs) and polysaccharide lyases (PLs) serving for lignocellulose pre-treatment, 816 ORFs encoding 11 glycoside hydrolase families (GHs) of cellulases, and 2252 ORFs encoding 22 GHs of hemicellulases, were mined. The carbohydrate binding module (CBM) was also abundant with 763 ORFs, of which 480 ORFs are located with lignocellulolytic enzymes. The enzyme modularity analysis showed that CBMs are usually present in endoglucanase, endo 1,3-beta-D-glucosidase, and endoxylanase, whereas fibronectin 3-like module (FN3) mainly represents in GH3 and immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig) was located in GH9 only. Every domain located in each ORF was analyzed in detail to contribute enzymes’ modularity which is valuable for modelling, to study the structure, and for recombinant production. With the aim of confirming the annotated results, a mined ORF encoding CBM63 was highly expressed in E. coli in soluble form. The purified recombinant CBM63 exhibited no cellulase activity, but enhanced a commercial cellulase activity in the destruction of a paper filter. © 2018 Applied Microbiology, Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Research Foundation.

AB  - A sample of cottonseed oil dregs was obtained by the alkali pretreatment of the oil to remove free fatty acids and other impurities before an industrial biodiesel production process. The alkali dregs was characterized and submitted to non-catalytic, catalytic, and reactive hydrogen atmosphere micropyrolysis experiments to assess the capacities for type SPK–HEFA biokerosene production. Non-catalytic and catalytic micropyrolyses were performed at 500 and 550 °C. In the catalytic experiments, catalysts based on Mo or W oxides supported on Zr or Ti oxides were tested for the first time for this purpose. The moisture content of the cottonseed oil dregs was 23.4% (wt%) and the other major components were triacylglycerols + free fatty acids (65.0%) and inorganic material (9.8%). The products of the micropyrolysis experiments were characterized by GC–MS and quantified by GC-FID. The presence of moisture in the initial feedstock provided better results in the thermal conversion to liquid biofuel (16%), compared to dry biomass (6%), considering the n-alkanes and n-alkenes produced in the range C9–C16. The mass conversion performed in the presence of catalysts at 550 °C resulted in an average yield of around 32%, compared to a value of 19% for a non-catalytic process under a nitrogen atmosphere, with the same values for the yields under a reactive hydrogen atmosphere. The reactive atmosphere and the catalysts did not have any substantial influence on the ratio between n-alkanes and n-alkenes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biodiesel fuel ethyl oleate (fatty acid ethyl ester, FAEE) was produced using Novozym® 435 (immobilized lipase) by transesterification of a mixture of ethanol and triolein in a fixed-bed reactor operated in circulating batch mode. The miscibility of the mixtures during transesterification was predicted thermodynamically and the conversion ratio of triolein was studied as a function of reaction time. The yield of ethyl oleate increased when the feed molar composition of ethanol was increased. The glycerin by-product could be removed from the enzyme particles by the circulating feed mixture. The inactivation of Novozym® 435 by glycerin was also examined in the circulating batch mode experiments, and an effective reaction model was proposed to describe the inactivation of Novozym® 435 and ethanol effect during the transesterification reaction by using the modified Michaelis-Menten equation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis followed by catalytic hydroconversion is a value chain aimed to transform lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel or chemicals. During hydroconversion, desired catalytic deoxygenation reactions are in competition with thermal side reactions like condensation or oligomerization. These undesired pathways lead to high molecular weight compounds (i.e. macromolecules) that are responsible for catalyst deactivation and severe plugging of the reactor. We investigate here the impact of a phenolic compound on the formation of these macromolecules. Catalytic hydroconversion of a fast pyrolysis bio-oil and a bio-oil/guaiacol (50/50 wt%) mixture were carried out in a batch reactor using a NiMo/alumina catalyst. An extended analytical strategy has been developed involving size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and liquid state 13C NMR dedicated to the in depth characterization of effluents as well as physicochemical analysis of the fresh and used catalyst (XRD, Hg porosimetry, N2 physisorption, STEM). This strategy allowed bringing new insights on aromatic structures larger than 1000 g.mol−1 and their formation mechanism. This formation can be chemically inhibited by the introduction of organic component such as guaiacol. This stabilization was mainly observed and explained at low temperature and short reaction time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An economic analysis was performed to determine the economic potential and commercialization barriers of producing renewable gasoline and diesel (RGD) fuel blendstocks via formate-assisted pyrolysis (FAsP) followed by hydrodeoxygenation processes. A process model was simulated using Aspen Plus® to estimate material and energy balances for the conversion of 2000 dry MT per day of pine sawdust. Scenarios were considered for the regeneration of formate salts from either -biomass-derived and natural-gas-derived carbon monoxide. The material and energy balances were used to calculate capital and operating costs of RGD fuel production. An economic model was built using capital and operating costs to estimate the minimum selling price (MSP) of RGD fuel. The MSP of RGD fuels were estimated at $4.58 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) and $4.80 per GGE for natural gas and biomass-derived CO scenarios, respectively. The total capital investments of these plants were $448 million and $497 million. The feedstock cost was found to be the major cost contributor to the MSP of RGD fuel. Improving FAsP process yields will significantly reduce the production cost of RGD fuel. It has been learned that an increase in deoxygenation of bio-oil in pyrolysis reactor decreases the capital and operating costs of bio-oil upgrading to RGD fuel. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The search for acid-base bifunctional catalysts has become a hot topic in the preparation of biofuels from renewable resources. In the present work, a series of novel acid-base bifunctional metal-boron catalysts were successfully prepared by a sol-gel method and characterized by XRD, IR, SEM, TEM, TGA, BET, and TPD. Among those bifunctional solid materials, the Ca-B(700) catalyst had the highest density of both acid and base sites and showed excellent catalytic performance in the production of biodiesel from nonedible oils with high acid value. Under the optimal reaction conditions of 20/1 methanol/oil mole ratio and 4 wt % catalyst dosage at 105 °C for 2 h, a high biodiesel yield of 96.0% could be obtained from Jatropha curcas oil in one-pot. In addition, Ca-B(700) was also applicable to producing biodiesel from Firmiana platanifolia L.f. oil in a relatively low acid value, with an almost quantitative yield (98.5%) at 65 °C after 2 h. The Ca-B(700) catalyst had good stability and reusability, which is a promising acid-base bifunctional catalytic material for the preparation of biodiesel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In the present work, we report a greener and efficient process of hydrothermal conversion of rice straw (Cd low accumulated crop) and Elsholtzia splendens (Cu accumulated plant) to recover the metals and simultaneously produce biofuel for harmless treatment and resource reuse. The impacts of different types of additives, raw materials/solvent ratios, reaction times, and temperatures are investigated, and the composition of solid phase left is also studied for future efficient use. As the results suggest, almost all enriched metals (95 ± 2% of Cu in E. splendens and almost all Cd in rice straw) are concentrated in solid phase after hydrothermal conversion with a considerable amount of carbohydrates contained, making the solid residue an excellent material for producing metal carbide catalysts. During the hydrothermal conversion, the additives have little impact on the metals recovery, and higher raw material/solvent ratios have higher yields of Cu/Cd. Finally, 22.0-25.0% yields of bio-oils without any metals are achieved with a high heating value (≥35.2 MJ/kg) for both types of plants. This work creates new opportunities for the full utilization of heavy metal accumulated plants to remediate heavy metal contaminated land without any waste and pollution.

AB  - In order to reach the limits of CO2 emissions set by Kyoto protocol, the use of biofuels is gaining momentum. However, the biofuels contains alkali and alkaline earth metals (Na, K and Ca) and phosphorus (P) species, which could decrease the efficiency of the after-treatment system. The main aim of this study is to increase the knowledge of the effect of impurities contain on biofuel on the catalytic activity of the diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs). Both reference (PtPd/CeZrO2/La-Al2O3) and modified catalysts were synthesized, characterized by several techniques and tested, concerning their physico-chemical, redox and catalytic properties. Based on the characterization results, the catalyst crystalline structure did not change after the impurities incorporation, however, the specific surface area was decreased in all cases. NO adsorption strength was increased due to the low electronegativity of Na, K and Ca species, according to H2-TPR and NO-TPD analyses. XPS analysis confirmed the formation of cerium phosphate, which can stabilize the Ce3+ oxidation state related to its higher Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, diminishing the catalytic redox activity. The physico-chemical and redox properties modifications after Na, K and Ca impurities addition diminished the CO and NO removal, however, the C3H6 conversion was improved. Besides, both CO and C3H6 oxidation were enhanced, while the NO to NO2 conversion decreased in presence of P species. © 2018

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) is a platform molecule, and its valorization toward biofuel additives like γ-valerolactone or tetrahydrofuran is considered as an important step in planning future biorefinery schemes. In this study, various Ni based catalysts were studied for the LA hydrogenation with formic acid (FA) used as a hydrogen source. Two different ways of catalytic activity improvement are discussed (nickel loading vs addition of dopants). The influence of Ni doping by small amount of noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh) showed that Ni-Pd is the most active catalyst. Its high catalytic performance is attributed to the synergic effect between two metals and interaction with chlorine. The effect of chlorine on catalytic performance and properties of the catalysts was evaluated by variety of surface and bulk-sensitive characterization methods. It was shown that addition of chlorine is one of the key factors required for high catalytic performance. Chlorine influences distribution of metals on the surface of the catalyst, their interaction with support and facilitates the formation of small crystallites, which is beneficial for reaching high catalytic activity.

AB  - Abstract: Biofuels are a promising alternative to fossil fuels that addresses the associated environmental concerns and satisfies growing global energy demand. In this study, safflower seeds were used to produce multiple biofuels with an integrated biorefinery perspective. The safflower oil was used for biodiesel production while the resultant seed cake was employed in subsequent ethanol production. Pretreatment of the residual solid is necessary in order to improve the ethanol production yield. Contrasting costly chemical pretreatments, the seed cake was instead pretreated using incomplete anaerobic digestion to remove hemicellulose, increase cellulose accessibility for fermentation, and produce methane. The seed cake produced 124.8 ml/g-VS of methane after 20 days of anaerobic digestion. The digestate (biologically pretreated seed cake) produced 92 g ethanol/kg solid, in stark contrast to 42 g ethanol/kg solid from untreated seed cake. This ethanol was later utilized in biodiesel production. The safflower oil produced 85.9% biodiesel via ethanolic transesterification at optimum conditions. From the integrated biorefinery perspective, the seed cake from 1 kg of safflower seeds produced 70 l of methane at NTP and 51.0 g of ethanol—surpassing the 47.6 g of ethanol stoichiometrically necessary to complete transesterification of safflower oil. Thus, this ethanol could be recycled, largely decreasing the need for an external stream of ethanol for biodiesel production. The incomplete anaerobic digestion is an effective and environmentally friendly way to improve the ethanol production from the safflower seed cake with biomethane as an additional valuable byproduct.

AB  - Although many types of heterogeneous catalysts have been applied to the transesterification reaction, some of them are unsuitable for industrial applications due to their high price and the extra preparation required to synthesize them. Calcium methoxide is a low cost, strong base with high catalytic activity and is thus commonly used in the biofuels synthesis process during the transesterification reaction. The objective of this study was to determine the optimized conversion in the transesterification reaction of waste cooking oil (WCO) for biodiesel production by using a homogenizer with a calcium methoxide catalyst. It was shown that the optimal reaction conditions are a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1, 4 wt % Ca(OCH3)2, a reaction temperature of 65°C, a rotation speed of 7000 rpm, and a reaction time of 90 min. The conversion rate under these conditions reached 90.2%. Ca(OCH3)2 thus has potential as a catalyst for industrial use. In addition, with a homogenizer system, the reaction time for synthesizing calcium methoxide catalyst can be reduced by half compared to that for conventional water-bath heating. In addition, the large amount of waste water required in the oil-water separation step can be reduced by using calcium methoxide instead of a homogeneous catalyst, significantly reducing manufacturing costs. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The use of biomass as feedstock to produce chemicals or biofuels is increasing. This renewable, biodegradable, and ecofriendly feedstock could present some new risks that should be taken into account. In this context, a thermal risk assessment of levulinic acid (LA) hydrogenation to γ-valerolactone (GVL), which is a platform molecule produced from the lignocellulosic biomass process, catalyzed by Ru/C in water was performed. A kinetic model including an energy balance under near-adiabatic conditions was built. For that, different experiments at different operating conditions (levulinic acid concentration and catalyst loading) were performed by using an Advanced Reactive System Screening Tool (ARSST) to estimate the kinetic constants of this reaction system. To make a thermal risk assessment of a chemical reaction system, two safety parameters should be defined: Time-to-Maximum Rate under adiabatic conditions (TMRad) and adiabatic temperature rise (ΔTad). The parameter TMRad defines the time to reach the maximum temperature rate and characterizes the probability of risk. The parameter ΔTad is the difference between the maximum and initial reaction temperature and characterizes the severity of risk. Based on this kinetic model, these two parameters were determined at different operating conditions. With the aid of a risk matrix, it was possible to determine the safe operating conditions (temperature, levulinic acid concentration, hydrogen pressure, and catalyst loading). © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, fermentable sugars and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were co-produced from endoglucanase treatment of wood pulp, followed by acid hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis was performed using two endoglucanases differentiated by the presence or absence of a cellulose-binding domain (CBD). The enzymewith an intact CBD gave the higher glucan conversion (up to 14.1±1.2wt%) and improved the degree of crystallinity of the recovered wood pulp fiber (up to 83.0 ± 1.0%). Thus, this endoglucanase-assisted treatment successfully removed amorphous content from the original cellulosic feedstock. CNC recovery (16.9 ± 0.7 wt %) from the feedstock going into the acid hydrolysis was improved relative to untreated pulp (13.2 ± 0.6 wt %). The mass loss from enzymatic treatment did not cause a decrease in the CNC yield from the starting material. The characteristics of CNCs obtained through acid hydrolysis (with or without enzyme treatment of pulp) were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry as characterization techniques. The CNCs generated through acid hydrolysis of endoglucanase-treated wood pulp displayed comparable properties relative to those generated using untreated pulp. Thus, endoglucanase treatment can enable co-production of CNCs and sugars for biofuel fermentation. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - A sustainable chitosan (CS)-derived magnetic solid acid catalyst (CS-Fe3O4@SO3H) incorporated by Lewis and Bronsted acid sites was synthesized in an eco-friendly manner through the preloading of iron on CS and one-pot low-temperature carbonization/sulfonation. The carbonization/sulfonation of CS-Fe3O4 using p-Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) at 140 oC resulted in the loss of ammonia in some extent and provided bifunctional sites on the catalyst. This heterogeneous catalyst was found to be highly selective for the conversion of xylose and arabinose to furfural (FF) and subsequent tri(furyl)methane (TFM) formation by the condensation with furan in the same reaction vessel without any purification. The outcome of optimization under different reaction parameters showed that only 20 wt.% of CS-Fe3O4@SO3H catalyst resulted in 81% TFM yield from xylose while arabinose gave a 70% TFM yield in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO):water with high selectivity. This green protocol provides an easy isolation of products and minimizes the formation of polymerized by-products. The catalyst can be readily recovered and efficiently reused for three consecutive catalytic cycles without any significant loss on product yields. © 2018, Green Wave Publishing of Canada.

AB  - In this work, we present mixed integer linear programming methods for the synthesis of processes that involve complex reaction networks. Specifically, we consider the modeling of reactors and interconnecting streams in systems where the composition of the reactor inlet streams can vary substantially, thereby making the determination of the limiting component as well as the calculation of the stream heating/cooling and power requirements challenging. First, towards the modeling of reactors, we develop an extent-based method which detects the limiting reactant of each reaction occurring in parallel with others, based on the inlet flows of the reactants. Second, we develop a computationally tractable method for the calculation of the work and heating/cooling duty needed to condition any stream of a process based on simple calculations that can be performed offline. Finally, we present how the two aforementioned components can be integrated in an optimization model generated based on a process superstructure. We demonstrate the application of the developed methods for the synthesis of a biorefinery. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Supercritical water reforming (SCWR) of four main constituents of bio-oil aqueous phase (acetic acid, acetol, 1-butanol and glucose) to produce hydrogen was studied in a tubular fixed-bed reactor using commercial Ni/Al2O3-SiO2 catalyst. The process was carried out under different operating conditions at 240 bar (500-800 °C, 5.0-22.5 wt.% of organic compounds and values of weight-hourly space velocity (WSHV) of 2.5-22.5 gorg-comp h−1 gcat −1). The data were reported as reaction rates, expressed as turnover frequencies (TOF), and the Arrhenius parameters (pre-exponential factor and apparent activation energy) were obtained. The process performance was compared to that without using any catalyst and that regarding equilibrium condition. Hydrogen yields were very close to those values predicted by equilibrium within the operating window tested in this study. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to reduce the harmful effect on the environment, using the oxygenated fuels such as biofuel blends as fuel has been on the spotlights for the internal combustion engines. For this rationale; the diesel engine operated with blends of sunflower biodiesel and diesel fuel (blending of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 100% biodiesel fuel with conventional diesel fuel). In this study, an experimental and numerical model for Heat release rate (HRR) and the characteristic performance of diesel engine such as cylinder pressure and emission characteristics (NOx, CO, and HC) in internal combustion engines is presented. To ensure the integrity of modeling, the results were compared with the experimental results. This comparison indicated a good agreement between the two. A Gaussian and Fourier series of second order was used to define a function relating the pressure and emission characteristics. Presented numerical model, implemented in proprietary software AVL FIRE, is able to capture chemical phenomena and to predict pollutant emission concentration trends. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1540–1550, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - In the present study, wild type and three mutants of pyranose 2-oxidase (PyOx-WT, PyOx-MT1, PyOx-MT2, PyOx-MT3), which showed improved properties for D-galactose oxidation, were investigated for their oxidising ability when immobilised on graphite electrodes. Four different flexible Os polymers with formal potentials ranging between −0.140 and 0.270 V vs. Ag|AgCl0.1 M KCl were applied together with the various forms of PyOx to wire graphite electrodes using polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether as crosslinking reagent. The pH profiles for the electrodes modified with wild type and all PyOx mutants in combination with the Os polymers were investigated with both glucose and galactose, respectively, since the PyOx variants showed an improved catalytic activity for galactose. All modified electrodes showed highest response in the pH range between 8.5–10 and KM, Imax values for both glucose and galactose were determined. To prove the catalytic activity, the biosensors were also characterized with cyclic voltammetry. A protein amount 0.26 U was found optimum for PyOx-WT, 0.36 U for PyOx-MT1, 0.41 U for PyOx-MT2 and 0.28 U for PyOx-MT3 and the analytical characterization of the enzyme electrodes was performed for glucose and galactose under optimized conditions. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to sugars and derivatives is a key step in production of biofuels and commodity chemicals in a biorefinery. In this study, catalytic hydrolysis of eucalyptus chips with solid sulfonated carbon-based catalysts prepared from three different carbon precursors (sucrose, glucose, and xylose) was studied under hot-compressed water at 150–250 °C with reaction time of 1–10 min. Increasing temperature up to 200 °C led to higher sugar yields from cellulose and hemicellulose while further increase in temperature caused higher formation of sugar degradation by-products. Sulfonated-sucrose (SO3H-Suc) showed the greatest performance on sugar production compared to other catalysts with less formation of furans and anhydroglucose; its high catalytic activity was related to its high acid site density as proven by NH3-TPD measurement. Size reduction and chemical pretreatment of the biomass were found to enhance the hydrolysis yield and reaction selectivity. The highest sugar yield of 40.7% comprising glucose, fructose, and xylose was achieved using 5% (w/w) SO3H-Suc at 200 °C for 5 min with milled biomass (60–100 μm) pretreated by alkaline oxidation. The work provides an alternative catalytic process for hydrolysis of lignocellulose in biomass industry. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Buckypapers have emerged as an important material for the construction of enzyme-based electrodes and biofuel cells for energy harvesting. In this work, commercial and lab-made buckypapers have been compared to establish their properties for future use as advanced bioelectrodes. The physical properties of the paper-like carbon nanotube films were characterised by electron microscopy, four-point probe conductivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties were investigated by voltammetry in the absence and presence of redox probes. Bioelectrocatalytic oxygen reduction was evaluated with iron-protoporphyrin modified buckypapers after immobilisation of bilirubin oxidase. Lab-made buckypaper exhibited a wider potential window, lower background capacitance, and cleaner voltammetry compared to commercial buckypaper. The catalytic current of lab-made buckypaper was 10-fold larger due to factors which include the 10-fold larger BET surface area, higher enzyme loading, more defective structure, and the smaller nanotube diameters. The presence of porphyrin groups enhanced the catalytic current in O2-saturated solution up to 0.5 mA cm−2 and 1.3 mA cm−2 for commercial and lab-made buckypaper, respectively. This work sheds new light on the effects of various physicochemical properties on the electrochemical and DET-type bioelectrocatalytic activity of buckypapers, and promises to be important for the development of bioelectronics devices. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Membraneless nanofluidic fuel cells are devices that utilize fluid flow through nanoporous media which serve as three-dimensional electrodes. In the case of hybrid fuel cells (HFC) an enzymatic and an abiotic catalyst are incorporated on the electrodes. Here we compared two different HFC. In the first one (HFC-1), glucose oxidase- and Pt-based electrodes were used as bioanode and cathode respectively. This cell reached an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.55 V and a maximum power density of 5.7 mWcm−2. In the second one (HFC-2), AuAg- and laccase-based electrodes were used as anode and biocathode respectively. This cell exhibited an OCV of 0.91 V and a maximum power density of 17 mWcm−2. Finally, enzymatic electrodes were used to develop a high performance biofuel cell (3.2 mWcm−2) that exhibited high stability over 4 days. These preliminary results indicate that the incorporation of enzymes into the 3D carbon structures is an efficient alternative for miniaturized nanofluidic power sources. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The highly unbalanced nature of bio-oil composition poses a serious threat in terms of storage and utilization of bio-oil as a viable fuel in engines. So it becomes inevitable to study the variations in physicochemical properties of the bio-oil during storage to value its chemical instability, for designing stabilization methodologies. The present study aims to investigate the effects of storage stability of bio-oil extracted from pyrolyzing Calophyllum inophyllum (CI) deoiled seed cake on the engine operating characteristics. The bio-oil is produced in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C under the constant heating rate of 30 °C/min. All the stability analysis methods involve an accelerated aging procedure based on standards established by ASTM (D5304 and E2009) and European standard (EN 14112). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to analytically characterize the unaged and aged bio-oil samples. The results clearly depict that stabilizing Calophyllum inophyllum bio-oil with 10% (w/w) methanol improved its stability than that of the unstabilized sample thereby reducing the aging rate of bio-oil to 0.04 and 0.13 cst/h for thermal and oxidative aging respectively. Engine testing of the bio-oil sample revealed that aged bio-oil samples deteriorated engine performance and increased emission levels at the exhaust. The oxidatively aged sample showed the lowest BTE (24.41%), the highest BSEC (20.14 MJ/kWh), CO (1.51%), HC (132 ppm), NOx (1098 ppm) and smoke opacity (34.8%). © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Seamless co-processing of pyrolysis bio-oil within existing petroleum refineries is the most synergistic and economic way to improve biorefinery output. Coprocessing bio-oil with vacuum gas oil (VGO) is one logical pathway. Bio-oil has a viscosity and molecular weight range similar to that of VGO, and the hydrogen-rich nature of VGO can chemically complement the bio-oil hydrogen deficiency. Distillation of biomass pyrolysis oils produces solid residues with a significant fraction of fixed carbon and heavy volatiles. Maximization of yields of light compounds like olefins and gasoline-range aromatics are crucial for both attainment of desired product output levels as well as to follow methods that mimic petroleum-based methods and chemistries. Herein we discuss a systematic study on the additive coprocessing of specific bio-oil distillation bottoms with VGO. Tail-gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP) bio-oils from spirulina, switchgrass, and guayule biomasses were distilled, and their bottoms were subject to analytical experiments in mixtures with VGO over different zeolite catalysts (no catalyst, HZSM-5, Y-zeolite). Switchgrass-based bottoms exhibit greater hydrogen deficiency and higher oxygen content compared with that of spirulina or guayule. Switchgrass-based bottoms, with or without VGO, produced more aromatics and less olefins and alkanes, compared with spirulina or guayule bottoms. When compared across different mixing ratios, thermal cracking of a 10:1 guayule/VGO mixture resulted in higher aromatics yields than even the VGO by itself. Addition of more VGO up to a 1:1 ratio of VGO/switchgrass bottoms nearly tripled the production of BTEX compounds. For hydrogen-rich bottoms spirulina and guayule, LPG-range olefins yields increased nearly 50% for 1:1 VGO/bottoms blends, compared with theoretical yields. © 2018

AB  - An inexpensive carbocatalyst containing Brønsted acidic sulfonic acid group and Lewis acidic Ti4+ is found to be effective for cascade conversion of C6 sugar to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) via sequential dehydration, and etherification reactions. HMF and fructose conversions at mild conditions achieved 91% and 64% EMF yields, respectively. The results indicate that the two acid sites interplay synergistically for high EMF yield and minimal ring-opened product ethyl levulinate (EL), another promising biofuel additive. Etherification of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) with alcohols of varying carbon lengths formed alkoxymethylfurans (AMF) with high yields. The catalyst retained good activity upon recycling. The nature and strength of the acid sites are elucidated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hundreds of catalytic routes to upgrade biomass-derived platform chemicals have been proposed. In this study, we developed process selection and development heuristics for these catalytic transformations from techno-economic analysis of catalytically upgrading furfural (a potential platform chemical) to eight derivatives that vary in chemical functionality and process complexity. These heuristics included simple cost equations based on catalyst performance as well as process complexity to predict the minimum selling price of platform chemical derivatives. Additionally, design rules were developed to guide the development of catalytic technologies for upgrading platform chemicals. The conversion of platform chemicals to hydrocarbons must be avoided. For commercial relevance, attaining catalyst yield of 60% and weight hourly space velocity of at least on the order of 0.1 h-1 are necessary. Precious metal catalysts, such as Pt, cannot be used if the desired platform chemical derivative is priced below 1.00 (US$/kg). Finally, it has been learned that the feasible plant size of platform chemical production is comparable to that of a lignocellulosic-based biofuel production. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Due to fluctuation in fuel prices in recent times the Indian economy is facing a heavy burden on the economic front to meet the energy supply demand. Due to large gap between the supply and demand of petroleum products. The government of India in its National Biofuel Policy is moving towards the development of biofuel as alternative source of energy by increasing its blends to 20 % by year 2017. In this path of development Karanja oil is being identified as second most important source of biodiesel production in India after Jatropha. But the poor stability and cold flow property associated with the Karanja biodiesel make it difficult for using it as alternative fuel to diesel. The storage of biodiesel is the major issue area for its long term utilization. The aim of present investigation is to optimize the storage period of Karanja biodiesel using various metals and antioxidants for a period of 6 months. The optimum result for OS of KB with same time and same amount of antioxidant for iron (Fe), aluminium (Al) and zinc (Zn) are 8.34, 8.40 and 8.20 h respectively with metal concentration level of 1.10, 0.85 and 1.45 ppm. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The improvement of syngas production and reduction of tar contaminants from biomass gasification was achieved by altering feedstock age and the presence/absence of bark in combination with adjusting the amount of bed material within the bubbling fluidized bed reactor. Eucalyptus benthamii is a promising biomass source for the gasification process, and can be grown as a short rotation bioenergy crop allowing for selective growth cycles. Three E. benthamii samples harvested at two years with bark (2EWB), two years without bark (2EWoB), and seven years without bark (7EWoB) were used for this work. Upon gasification, the highest CH4 gas concentration was obtained from 7EWoB sample, which led to the highest syngas heating value of 3.8 MJ m−3. Alternatively, the highest H2 gas yield was obtained from 2EWB sample. The presence of bark also significantly affected CO and CH4 gas yields. Major tar compounds in the syngas were benzene, naphthalene, toluene and indene. Almost twice the amount of naphthalene and indene was obtained with older samples (7EWoB) compared to young samples (2EWoB and 2EWB). It was established that the presence of bark (2EWB) led to higher char yields and lower gas yields, which ultimately led to a lower syngas heating value (3.08 MJ m−3). Utilizing different amounts of non-catalytic silicon sand as bed material during gasification of 2EWB allowed for improved syngas heating value by producing more CH4. Higher amounts of bed material also lead to a higher conversion of char and improved syngas yields; however, tar yields also increased. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A fast pyrolysis of crop residues of Vitis vinifera has been realized using a multimode microwave (MW) oven using various MW absorbers. The combination of absorber/reactor arrangement address the process towards a high formation of bio-oil (34.9%) and gas (45.7%) or the production of large amount of bio-char (up to 71.4%). Bio-oils were collected as dark brown liquids with low viscosity and density. They were characterized through analytical and spectroscopic methods and the compounds present were identified and quantified. Large amount of acetic acid (up to 172.5 g/L) and appreciable amount of aromatics (up to 39.5 g/L) were formed in all experiments. Bio-oil obtained using carbon as MW absorber and set-up B showed the lower water concentration (39.5 wt%). Bio-chars formed in all tests showed almost the same calorific values, close to that of commercial pellets. The MAP of vine residues is a sound way to reduce environmental risks for their disposal and gave usefully chemicals, mainly acetic acid, aromatics and fuels through a fast pyrolysis process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glycerol acetals/ketals and their esters, produced from renewable raw materials, are highly valuable compounds, being used as oxygenated fuel additives and ecological solvents. A new method for obtaining glycerol acetal/ketal esters, difficult to synthesize using classical techniques, was developed. This method is based on the reversible reaction of 1,2-O-isopropylidene-glycerol esters (IPGEs) obtained from glycerin, by-product from biodiesel production, with low volatility aldehydes/ketones (e.g. furfural and ethyl levulinate, both obtained from lignocellulosic biomass), in the presence of a heterogeneous acid catalyst. To circumvent reaching equilibrium, the continuous removal of acetone (Ac) from the reaction mixture was done, the former being reused in the synthesis of IPGEs. The method viability was assessed by synthesis and characterization of eight new compounds from two classes: furfurylideneglycerol esters (FGEs) and ethyl levulinate glycerol ketal esters (ELGKEs). A detailed kinetic study was done throughout an experimental program, first developed in Asia 330, a modular range flow chemistry system, then in a continuous-flow process at micropilot scale. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapours is a potential method for the production of hydrocarbon fuel intermediates. This work attempts to study the catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapours in a pilot scale FCC riser in terms of hydrodynamics, residence time distribution (RTD) and chemical reactions by CFD simulation. NREL's Davison Circulating Riser (DCR) reactor was used for this investigation. CFD simulation was performed using 2-D Eulerian–Eulerian method which is computationally less demanding than the alternative Euler-Lagrangian method. First, the hydrodynamic model of the riser reactor was validated with the experimental results. A single study of time-averaged solid volume fraction and pressure drop data was used for the validation. The validated hydrodynamic model was extended to simulate hydrodynamic behaviours and catalyst RTD in the Davison Circulating Riser (DCR) reactor. Furthermore, the effects on catalyst RTD were investigated for optimising catalyst performance by varying gas and catalyst flow rates. Finally, the catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapours in the DCR riser was attempted for the first time by coupling CFD model with kinetics. A kinetic model for pyrolysis vapours upgrading using a lumping kinetic approach was implemented to quantify the yields of products. Five lumping components, including aromatic hydrocarbons, coke, non–condensable gas, aqueous fraction, and non–volatile heavy compounds (residue) were considered. It was found that the yield of lumping components obtained from the present kinetic model is very low. Thus, the further research needs to be carried out in the area of the kinetic model development to improve the yield prediction. © 2017

AB  - In the present work, usage of the carbonized mistalea (viscum album L.) as an eco-friendly, cheap and easy prepeared heterogeneous catalyst is proposed for partial hydrogenation reaction of biodiesel. The catalyst produced by carbonization process was carefully characterized by FTIR, SEM and BET methods and also elemental analysis. Effectiveness of the obtained catalyst was investigated by using for the partial hydrogenation of corn-oil biodiesel. The biodiesel product after partial hydrogenation has been investigated by means of Fatty acid methyl esters, oxidation stability, pour point and cloud point. Even if a small amount of the catalyst was used, it showed high catalytic activity for the partial hydrogenation reaction. As a result it can be reccomended as a potential catalyst for the similar studies in this area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrogen production via steam reforming of bio-oil is a potential method to reduce the dependence on the conventional fossil fuels. To investigate the reactivity of bio-oil and its difference with gasification tar and conventional fossil fuels, the steam reforming of various compounds (benzene, toluene, m-xylene, m-cresol, n-hexane, cyclohexane, 1-propanol, and acetic acid) was conducted in a fixed-bed flow reactor at various temperatures over a high-performance RuNi/BaOAl2O3 catalyst. As a whole, the reactivities of these compounds in steam reforming decrease in the following trend: n-hexane &gt; cyclohexane &gt; benzene &gt; toluene &gt; m-xylene &gt;1-propanol &gt; m-cresol &gt; acetic acid. For the C6 hydrocarbons, benzene showed a lower reactivity than n-hexane and cyclohexane, due to the stable benzene ring. The reactivities of aromatic hydrocarbons decrease with the addition of methyl groups to the benzene ring due to electronic and steric effects. m-Cresol showed a lower reactivity than benzene, toluene, and m-xylene, suggesting that the incorporation of a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring hindered the steam reforming reaction. Besides the steam reforming reactions, the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, demethylation, decomposition, and methanation of CO and CO2 also occurred. A benzene ring can be formed by the dehydroaromatization of n-hexane or cyclohexane, while the reverse reaction cannot occur due to the thermodynamic limit. The largely containing acetic acid in bio-oil needs a higher reforming temperature than the other compounds and is easy to be thermally decomposed into coke at low temperatures, which increases the difficulty of bio-oil steam reforming. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel has become a very promising alternative to fossil diesel fuel, regarding environmental concerns and fuel resource depletion. Biodiesel is usually produced through homogeneous or heterogeneous transesterification of different fatty raw materials. Although main research has been carried out with homogenous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts may be of interest due to ease of recovery and recycling, as well as readiness for continuous processing. In this work, calcined Mg-Al hydrotalcite (HT) was used for the heterogeneous transesterification of waste cooking oil. Three reaction parameters, namely, reaction time, amount of catalyst, and methanol-to-oil molar ratio, were optimized by means of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) at constant temperature (65 °C), using a Box-Behnken design. Optimal fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content (86.23% w/w FAME/sample) was predicted by the model with an R-squared value of 98.45%, using 3.39 g of HT (8.5% w/w oil) and an 8:1 methanol-oil molar ratio, for a duration of 3.12 h. It was observed that calcination of HT, while avoiding the previous washing step, allowed the presence of chemical species that enhanced the effect of the catalyst. It can be concluded from this field trial that calcined and nonwashed Mg-Al hydrotalcite may be considered an effective basic catalyst for the production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. Also, RSM proved to be a useful tool for predicting biodiesel yield. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Hexarates are platform chemicals. Methods to produce d-glucarate and d-mannarate are desirable because these hexarates can be gained by oxidation of the corresponding hexuronates, which are abundantly found in algae and plants as the units of polyuronates. Oxidative production of the hexarates can be combined with a reductive reaction to coproduce electricity. An enzymatic biofuel cell is a device that enables this coproduction. To construct the cell, it is necessary to find enzymes that catalyze platform chemical production and are also suitable as anode catalysts. Here, we show the production of d-glucarate and d-mannarate from d-glucuronate and d-mannuronate, with both reactions catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase, in addition to the production of d-glucarate from l-guluronate by the PQQ domain of pyranose dehydrogenase from Coprinopsis cinerea. The enzymes are suitable as anode catalysts in biofuel cells that coproduce these hexarates and electricity. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - BACKGROUND: Using renewable feedstock sources for biodiesel production seems to be a promising strategy and even more so when enzymatic catalysis with lipases are used. However, it is well known that these enzymes could be inactivated by reaction conditions such as temperature or alcohol concentration. In this work, the effect of temperature and initial water activity (aw) value on immobilised recombinant Rhizopus oryzae lipase (rROL) were studied. Methanolysis and ethanolysis reactions using alperujo oil with three different stepwise addition strategies were employed. RESULTS: Recombinant 1,3-positional selective rROL covalently immobilised on polymethacrylate amino-epoxy activated support showed maximum initial reaction rate at low aw value (0.093). It was found that 30 °C was the optimal temperature in terms of biocatalyst stability during transesterification reactions. Adding alcohol at once, ethanol was clearly a better acyl-acceptor in terms of stability than methanol. Productivity was found to be 2-fold higher when five pulses of ethanol were used instead of methanol. CONCLUSIONS: Alperujo oil has great potential as a low cost feedstock for biodiesel production through enzymatic catalysis using a nearly semi-continuous alcohol addition strategy. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The present work submits an investigation about the effect of urea injection parameters on NOx emissions from a four-stroke four-cylinder diesel engine fueled with B20 blended biodiesel. An L9(34) Taguchi orthogonal array was used to design the test plan. The results reveal that increasing urea concentration leads to lower NOx emissions. Urea flow rate increment has the same influence on NOx emission. The same result is obtained by an increase in spray angle. Also, according to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), urea concentration and then urea flow rate are the most effective design parameters on NOx emissions, while spray angle and mixing length have less influence on this pollutant emission. Finally, since the result of confirmation test is in good agreement with the predicted value based on the Taguchi technique, the predictive capability of this method in the present study could be deduced. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The microwave-assisted liquefaction of Ulva prolifera under atmospheric pressure conditions was investigated for an Fe species-modified HY catalyst. The characterization of Fe/HY confirmed that the Fe species existed in the form of Fe2O3 and that the framework of HY remained intact. It was also found that the doped Fe2O3 distinctly enhanced the total acid sites of the catalyst and thus increased the bio-oil yield from 40.6 to 52.6%. The GC-MS results demonstrated that the application of the Fe2O3/HY solid catalysts facilitated the production of long-chain compounds (octadecanoic acid methyl ester and hexadecyl ester), thus leading to a distinct decrease in the oxygen content of the bio-fuel. Therefore, the obtained Fe2O3-modified HY exhibits the potential for bio-fuel production from Ulva prolifera. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - A novel in situ tribocatalytic esterification reaction has been developed driven by frictional processes, to alleviate the corrosion wear induced by the high content of organic acid in bio-oil. Solid superacid (SO42−/γ-Al2O3) was formulated and prepared as the catalyst. Acetic acid was as the base for the bio-oil, and glycerol was used as a modifying agent. The tribological properties of the bio-oil with varying amounts of solid superacid were evaluated on a HDM-20 end-face tribometer. Scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to measure the micro-morphologies and elemental contents on the worn surfaces after sliding. The effect of tribocatalysis on the composition of the bio-oil was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry. The results show that when lubricated by pure bio-oil the worn surfaces showed severe furrows and bulk exfoliation of the surface material. With the solid superacid added to the bio-oil, abrasive wear and material exfoliation were alleviated. The reason for the improved tribological properties is that the solid superacid not only could roll on the friction surface and act as lubricating particles, but also catalyzed esterification between acetic acid and glycerol, which simultaneously improved the tribological properties of bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, we report our investigation into a two-step method of transformation of algae to bio-oil. Elemental analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to analyze bio-oil. First, organic solvent Soxhlet extraction and reflux extraction were used in the algal extraction step. Ethanol was proven to be the best solvent, and the addition of MgSO4 could transform acids to esters. In MgSO4 extraction oil, the yield of hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester was as high as 48.40%. Then, the residual algae powders through the catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction process were converted to bio-oil. Commercialized noble metal catalysts Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C and Rh/C combined with Pd/HZSM-5 were used in the second step. Rh/C performed the best in the catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction process, and the highest bio-oil yield of 50.98% and HHV of 30.67 MJ kg-1 were achieved. The oil yield through two steps was higher than that by a direct decomposition step. Also, the two-step method could achieve a higher energy conversion ratio of 85.61% and total energy of 81.09 kJ. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae is a promising crude bio-oil (biocrude) production technology, which can convert wet algae into water-insoluble biocrude and other coproducts. In this work, algae HTL at 350°C and 20 min was conducted to obtain water-insoluble biocrude (B1), which was then hydrothermally upgraded at 450°C, 60 min, or with added H2 and/or homemade catalyst (i.e., Ni-Ru/CeO2 or Ni/CeO2) for the first time. The characteristics (e.g., yield, elemental component, energy recovery, and molecular and functional group compositions) of upgraded water-insoluble biocrude (B2) as well as light biocrude thereof were analyzed comprehensively. The results show that Ni-Ru/CeO2+H2 led to the highest yield and HHV (higher heating value), the best elemental compositions quality of B2, and the largest fraction and the best light of light biocrude in B2. Ni-Ru/CeO2+H2 had good catalytic desulfurization effect and could transform high-molecular-weight compounds into low-molecular-weight compounds in B1 upgrading. At the condition above, 46.2% of chemical energy in the initial algae could be recovered by B2, while average 54.9% of chemical energy in B2 was distributed in its light biocrude (hexane-soluble) portion. On the whole, Ni-Ru/CeO2+H2 can be considered as the optimal additive in all tested cases. © 2018 Donghai Xu et al.

AB  - Throughout the world, the fossil fuel has supplied around the 80% of the energetic requirements, in Colombia alone 95.1% of energetic demand is made by the transportation sector solely, supplied by oil, kerosene, gasoline and diesel, this sector has an extremely small participation with biofuel of 3%, which is represented only by biodiesel. Microalgae had been proposed as biofactories with a remarkable third generation biofuels production. The culture of the microorganism comprehends interesting characteristics as countless environments where its natural growth could be replicated in fresh, salty and even sewage waters, with a higher growth rate and a higher oil production. The implementation of enzymes in the transesterification process have generated a good curiosity in the field, due to its mild reactions conditions, lesser energetic requirements, a high standard in the selection of the enzymes with the objective of avoiding the formation of soaps, creating in this way cleaner products and sub-products, in which the separation of the phases biodiesel/glycerol, give the possibility to recuperate the bio catalyzer and high output of reactions. However, the high volume of medium required to obtain lipids is one of the major drawbacks to test the viability of these enzymes. The present study aims to design an enzymatic transesterification process for the production of biodiesel form synthetic Chlorella oil. The synthetic oil was designed according to the lipid profile of C 16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 from Chlorella spp CHL2 cultured on Bold Basal media under limited concentrations of NaNO3. The enzymatic transesterification efficiency was evaluated by the implementation of a 22 experimental factorial design (temperature and lipase concentration) under a 3: 1 molar ratio of alcohol:oil and a fixed reaction time of 6 hours. The obtained results show that, in order to obtain superior yields of biodiesel (&gt;91%) the transesterification process must be carried out under temperature conditions close to 38°C and lipase concentrations of 5%.

AB  - Bioelectrochemistry can be defined as a branch of Chemical Science concerned with electron-proton transfer and transport involving biomolecules, as well as electrode reactions of redox enzymes. The bioelectrochemical reactions and system have direct impact in biotechnological development, in medical devices designing, in the behavior of DNA-protein complexes, in green-energy and bioenergy concepts, and make it possible an understanding of metabolism of all living organisms (e.g. humans) where biomolecules are integral to health and proper functioning. In the last years, many researchers have dedicated itself to study different redox enzymes by using electrochemistry, aiming to understand their mechanisms and to develop promising bioanodes and biocathodes for biofuel cells as well as to develop biosensors and implantable bioelectronics devices. Inside this scope, this review try to introduce and contemplate some relevant topics for enzyme bioelectrochemistry, such as the immobilization of the enzymes at electrode surfaces, the electron transfer, the bioelectrocatalysis, and new techniques conjugated with electrochemistry vising understand the kinetics and thermodynamics of redox proteins. Furthermore, examples of recent approaches in designing biosensors and biofuel developed are presented. © 2018, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.

AB  - A highly active and selective cobalt catalyst was developed for the hydrogenation of biomass-derived ethyl levulinate (EL) to γ-valerolactone (GVL), ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate (EHP), 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), which are considered to be value-added chemicals and important biofuels. The effects of reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst amount and solvent on its catalytic performance were investigated. In addition, the reaction pathway was studied as well. It was found that the selectivity of GVL, 1,4-PDO and 2-MTHF on Co/ZrO2 can be easily tuned by changing reaction conditions, and can reach as high as 94%, 78% and 77%, respectively. The product selectivity is also significantly affected by the catalyst support. With SBA-15 as the support, the selectivity of EHP can reach 90%. Moreover, Co/ZrO2 gave an extraordinarily high GVL productivity of 1.50 mol gmetal-1 h-1 and displayed excellent stability and reusability. Interestingly, coke has a positive effect on the enhancement of GVL yield. AL dimers and trimers were identified as the coke species in the hydrogenation of EL. As far as we know, this is the first work conducting the flexible transformation of EL on cobalt catalysts. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The physiochemical properties of biodiesel are significantly influenced by its fatty acid composition (FAC). This research investigates FAC of Jatropha biodiesel (JB) synthesized using feedstocks originated from the east (JBEM) and west (JBWM) Malaysian regions together with biofuel properties. The critical properties of pure biodiesels and blends were analysed according to ASTM D6751/EN 14214 standards. The JB properties were precisely regulated by its FAC features such as saturated fatty acids (SFAs), unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs), degree of unsaturation, and long chain saturated factor. The influence of SFA and USFA was inversely associated over biodiesel properties. The presence of higher SFA greatly affects biodiesel properties like the cetane number, cold filter plugging point, kinematic viscosity, density, cloud point, and pour point; conversely, the fuel properties such as oxidation stability, iodine value, acid value, water content, and flash point were improving with USFA contents. Blending of biofuels with petro diesels considerably improved their fuel properties. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - We report here that the Re/SiO2 catalyst can be a suitable low-cost catalyst for processing polyols into acetals in solvent-free conditions with a high conversion rate and selectivity up to 100% in mild conditions. During a complex investigation, we broadly tested the blending potential of the acetals that were formed by measuring properties such as density, viscosity, isentropic compressibility, isobaric thermal expansion, cetane number and other parameters of both the crude additives and the blends that were prepared with petroleum diesel oil. The results indicate that the investigated acetals can generally be used for blending with petroleum diesel oil in order to obtain the valuable biofuels that are in great demand in the contemporary transportation industry due to the regulatory restrictions that have been introduced in order to protect the environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The interesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) and ethyl acetate (ETA) are investigated in homogeneous catalyst system using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and acetic acid (CH3COOH). Later on, the subsequent biofuel has been investigated for the combustion characteristics, gaseous and particulate matter related emissions in a single-cylinder agricultural diesel engine. In the reaction, fatty acid ethyl esters were the main product whereas triacetin by-product was formulated in a single phase biofuel. The parameters affected the free fatty acid (FFA) conversion were studied such as catalyst system, molar ratio of ETA:WCO, molar ratio of catalyst:WCO, reaction time, and temperature. The experimental results revealed that NaOH was more favorable than the acid catalyst counterpart. The 92% biofuel yield was reached from the optimization at the NaOH:WCO of 0.015:1 M ratio and the ETA:WCO of 30:1 M ratio at 80 °C in 3 h. In the engine validation at 3.4 and 6.6 bar IMEP loads, 1700 rpm speed, the results from the combustion analysis using an indicating system reveal that the WCO biofuel initiates the combustion faster with pronounce premixed combustion regime than that of diesel fuel. The specific fuel consumption of WCO biofuel was greater, leading to a slight reduction in brake thermal efficiency by 4% and 10% at 3.4 and 6.6 bar IMEP loads, respectively compared with diesel fuel. The nano-particle emissions was characterized by an electrical mobility spectrometer and analyzed in terms of particle number. The total particle number increased with smaller size when fueling with WCO biofuel. In comparison over the loads tested, the total particle number concentrations were in the ranges of 8.1 × 1011 to 1.1 × 1012 m−3 for WCO biofuel and 4.8 × 1011 to 5.7 × 1011 m−3 for diesel fuel. Meanwhile, the particle sizes were in the ranges of 182–251 nm for WCO biofuel and 279–402 nm for diesel fuel. Summarily, for the biofuel production, this homogeneous process is beneficial in terms of low-cost feedstock, glycerol-free and mild reaction condition. © 2018

AB  - Malaysian Dolomite has shown potential deoxygenation catalyst due to high capacity in removing oxygen compound and produce high quality of biofuel with desirable lighter hydrocarbon (C8-C24). The performance of this catalyst was compared with several commercial catalysts in catalytic pyrolysis of Waste Cooking Oil. Calcination at 900 °C in N2 produced catalyst with very high activity due to decomposition of CaMg(CO3)2 phase and formation of MgO-CaO phase. The liquid product showed similar chemical composition of biofuel in the range of gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel. Furthermore, Malaysian Dolomite showed high reactivity with 76.51 % in total liquid hydrocarbon and the ability to convert the oxygenated compounds into CO2, CO, CH4, H2, hydrocarbon fuel gas, and H2O. Moreover, low acid value (33 mg KOH/g) and low aromatic hydrocarbon content were obtained in the biofuel. Thus, local calcined carbonated material has a potential to act as catalyst in converting waste cooking oil into biofuel. Copyright © 2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work presents the development and characterization of a new and environmentally friendly wood bio-adhesive using cassava starch and bio-oil that was from the fast pyrolysis of larch sawdust. Bio-oil contains large amounts of chemicals and is cheap and renewable compared to the traditional modification methods for starch-based adhesives. It will bring great benefits if bio-oil can be used as the chemical additive to improve the quality of the regular starch-based wood adhesive. This study prepared the bio-oil-starch (BOS) adhesive and examined its properties. The structure and thermal decomposition stability were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Results showed that, compared with a regular starch-based wood adhesive, the BOS adhesive displayed better liquidity, longer storage period (extended from 13 days to 55 days) and higher shear strength (the bonding strength of starch-based wood adhesive with 25% of bio-oil increased 17.4% in the dry state and 50.9% in the wet state, and its water resistance increased by 10.0%). Characterization showed that the improved performance of the BOS adhesive was supported by its strengthened molecular structure and enhanced thermal stability. The introduction of bio-oil significantly improved the properties and modified the structure of the regular starch-based wood adhesive. © 2018

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to comprehensively investigate a biodiesel production system by transesterification of mutton tallow. To this end, an exergo-environmental life cycle assessment was applied. Exergetic investigation identifies the location, magnitude and sources of the thermodynamic inefficiencies in the biodiesel production process (the highest priority components for process improvement from the thermodynamic point of view). In contrast, environmental life cycle assessment identifies the environmental hot spot subsystems of the entire mutton tallow-to-biodiesel system (the highest priority life cycle steps for environmental improvement). The results obtained show that approximately 83.3% of the exergy fed to the process is recovered in the useful product (biodiesel). The transesterification reactor should have the highest priority for process improvement from the thermodynamic point of view. However, the environmental improvements of the entire biodiesel production system should be focused on minimizing methanol consumption. The net energy ratio of the system is approximately 2.3. Therefore, the biodiesel system presents a net energy gain. Using economic allocation instead of the mass-based approach leads to an increase in the life cycle indicators by approximately 11%. However, this difference is only 6.7% when considering energy allocation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In present study, biodiesel was produced from landfill waste-derived oil by chemical transesterification process, to evaluate its potential as a renewable energy source for the first time. The free fatty acid percentage (FFA) in landfill waste oil is considered to be high, which was reduced by treating it with two different acids as catalyst, muriatic acid and phosphoric acid, in order to build a comparison between fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) contents. Further, it was treated with a base catalyst potassium hydroxide (KOH) to produce the final product. The FAME value of landfill oil when treated with muriatic acid was found to be 92.59%. The quality of biodiesel produced was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), which indicated above 25.7% of conversion of oil into biodiesel when muriatic acid was used as a catalyst. The properties of the produced biodiesel were found to be in good agreement with ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 standards. Various test fuels were prepared for the engine test by blending 10%, 20%, and 100% of landfill waste biodiesel in diesel on volumetric basis and designated as B10, B20, and B100, respectively. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the engine was more while the exhaust emission was less except NOx with biodiesel and its blend (B10 and B20). Thus, landfill waste is a potential source of biodiesel, and blends of landfill waste up to 20% can be used for realizing better performance from the engine. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A catalysis process enhanced by pre-plasma for bio-fuel preparation was proposed. Three aspects were included: (i) the process was analyzed and optimized aiming at comprehensive evaluation index, (ii) the Ti/HZSM-5 was introduced under optimal conditions and mechanism was explored, and (iii) the catalytic stability was evaluated. The results showed catalytic temperature, catalytic height and discharge power had significant effects on the index and interactions were exist. Optimal conditions were catalytic temperature of 455 °C, catalytic height of 26 mm and discharge power of 30 W. The energy consumption of pre-plasma occupied 12.35% of the total. Ti modification decreased the bio-fuel yield from 15.05% to 13.77%, and the oxygen content and calorific value reached 10.95% and 35.50 MJ/kg. The total hydrocarbon content was 52.90% and desired monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons occupied 64.22%, and 82.84% of hydrocarbons were concentrated in the C10-C13 range. The main oxygenates after upgrading were hydroxyl containing compounds, which were difficult to eliminate due to the high hydrophilicity. The upgrading processed in series, involving reactant activation, catalytic reactions and multiple interactions. The coking rate of spent catalysts decreased from 6.85% to 3.15% after Ti modification, even in the case of that the effective hydrogen to carbon ratio of reactants was lower. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Synthesis of X zeolite with hierarchical porosity was studied. Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), an anionic surfactant, was employed as templating agent to introduce mesoporosity in the framework of the zeolite. Synthesis variables as SDBS concentration, dissolution time of SDBS (tSDBS) and aging time (taging) were studied. High SDBS concentration (3 times the Critical Micellar Concentration) and long dissolution (tSDBS, 24 h) and aging (taging, 48 h) times were necessary to develop noteworthy mesoporosity in the X zeolite. This X zeolite showed good catalytic activity in the of benzyl acetate deoxygenation. The X zeolite prepared without SDBS was clearly deactivated with the time on stream whereas the mesoporous X zeolite maintained high conversion (above 70%) after 4 h, yielding as deoxygenation products: toluene (total deoxygenation) and benzyl alcohol (partial deoxygenation). Therefore, this zeolite has shown a significant potential as catalyst for deoxygenation reactions, and so it can be used in the catalytic upgrading of biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this investigation, the effect of operating parameters on product distribution for the conversion of water hyacinth into most valuable product bio oil as well as char and gases are investigated. To observe the parametric effect on product distribution, the temperature was varied 300–600 °C, heating rate 10–50 °C/min, particle size of the feed &lt;0.5–2.5 mm and carrier gas nitrogen flow rate 0–12 lpm. The highest bio-oil yield of 44.9 wt% was obtained at 350 °C, 30 °C/min, particle feed size less than 0.5 mm and 6 lpm. The results show that the product yield is strongly influenced by the temperature variation whereas weakly affected by the heating rate. The biomass and the products were characterized by ultimate, proximate, DTG, FTIR, 1H NMR, and GC–MS. Syngas evolution increase with the increase of temperature except CO2. The quality of bio-oil is perspective as a source of value-added chemicals and char is a promising source for the production of carbonaceous materials as well as solid fuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solar pyrolysis offers potential solution for harnessing the energy of the sun by the conversion of biomass energy into transportable and storable fuel. However, a number of undesirable components can be formed and an upgrade of bio-oil is necessary before it can be utilized as a fuel. In this work, a pyrolysis process using solar energy was studied for the production of bio-oil from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalgae. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the effects of biomass loading rate, reaction time, and percentage of hydrotalcite catalyst on the product distribution and liquid composition. Equations were proposed for predicting products yields as a function of the studied variables. Optimum conditions for maximum liquid yield (57%) were identified using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The optimal conditions for the liquid yield were 1.98 g, 9.9 min, and 22.88% for the biomass loading rate, reaction time and catalyst percentage, respectively. The mixed oxides derived from hydrotalcite, used as a catalyst, shown a good performance and acted to decrease the quantity of nitrogen compounds and increase the relative percentage of hydrocarbons. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The many simultaneous processes occurring within in a diesel engine make difficult a thorough understanding of the mechanisms responsible for reduction of soot and/or NOX when an oxygenated compound is added to diesel fuel. Thus, in order to explore the use of oxygenated compounds as biofuels/additives, it is interesting to study their conversion under well-controlled laboratory conditions, together with kinetic studies that help to interpret and understand the reaction schemes that occur during such processes. The aim of this work has been to contribute to the knowledge of the dimethoxymethane (DMM) pyrolysis, one of the oxygenated compounds proposed in literature as alternative fuel. In this way, the influence of pyrolysis temperature (1075–1475 K) and inlet fuel concentration (33,333 and 50,000 ppm DMM) on the sooting propensity of DMM, soot reactivity and its properties is analyzed. Therefore, this work includes pyrolysis experiments under different experimental conditions, focusing on the gas-phase analysis and the soot formation, together with a gas-phase model. Additionally, the interaction of soot with O2 and with NO has been studied, and since soot properties are important on the oxidation rate, selected soot samples have been characterized by different instrumental techniques (elemental analysis, physical adsorption with N2, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy). © 2018

AB  - One of the major challenges in the production of biodiesel is the immiscibility of oil and methanol. The extent of dispersion between the two phases controls the mass and heat transfer rates and consequently the rate of the transesterification reaction. In this study, we report a novel design of a batch agitated vessel used for the production of biodiesel from palm oil. The new reactor is provided with static stainless steel mesh screen baffles to promote dispersion between the two immiscible reactants. The effect of the key parameters was investigated. The reaction yield was expressed in terms of FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) concentration. The optimum transesterification reaction conditions that yielded the highest biodiesel yield (97%) were as follows: methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, a reaction temperature of 60 °C, a one percent (wt.%) NaOH solution, a mesh screen size of 12″ and an agitation speed of 250 rpm. In order to test whether the produced biodiesel can replace diesel oil in combustion engines we evaluated the biodiesel quality, the engine performance and the emission characteristics of a B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel) blend. A reduction in carbon monoxide and a marginal increase in nitrogen oxides emissions was observed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Unlocking the potential and value of lignocellulosic residues is an important step in making biorefineries economically and environmentally promising. This calls for a holistic and systematic approach in designing sustainable industrial systems. In this work, biorefinery systems via biochemical route (acetone–butanol–ethanol or ABE system) and thermochemical route (gasification and mixed alcohols or GMA system) for converting corn stover into biofuels have been designed using a Sustainable Engineering Framework. The framework involves eight main steps: (1) design problem definition, (2) data collection, (3) process synthesis and simulation, (4) process integration, (5) resource recovery from residues, (6) utility system design, (7) economic and environmental modelling and (8) economic value and environmental impact margin analysis for decision making. Consideration of resource recovery from biorefinery waste streams has proven to be the key in making biorefineries self-sustaining and with low environmental impacts. Simultaneous economic and environmental feasibility assessment at the early stage of process design is highly envisaged. The cost of biofuel production in the ABE system has been found to be 49.2 US$/GJ and 69.9 US$/GJ in the GMA system. The greenhouse gas emissions are 46.2 g CO2-eq/GJ for ABE and 19.0 g CO2-eq/GJ for GMA, lower than gasoline (85 g CO2-eq/GJ). The GMA system is not economically compelling though with high environmental benefit, while the ABE system has shown to be both economically and environmentally feasible. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study is based on three essential considerations concerning biodiesel obtained from waste cooking oil: diesel engine emissions of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil, its potential in Turkey, and policies of the Turkish government about environmentally friendly alternative fuels. Emission tests have been realized with 35.8 kW, four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection diesel tractor engine. Test results are compared with Euro non-road emission standards for diesel fuel and five different blends of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. The results of the experimental study show that the best blends are B10 and B20 as they show the lowest emission level. The other dimensions of the study include potential analysis of waste cooking oil as diesel fuels, referring to fuel price policies applied in the past, and proposed future policies about the same issues. It was also outlined some conclusions and recommendations in connection with recycling of waste oils as alternative fuels. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Lignin-derived pyrolysis bio-oils are a rich source of alkylphenols that could find application if a feasible separation method could be developed. In this work, bio-oil model compounds and lignin-derived bio-oil were used to evaluate commercially available silica gel and normal phase amine-functionalized silica, as well as three different amine-functionalized mesoporous silicas, as adsorbents. The adsorption capacities of all materials at maximum retention of 12 bio-oil model compounds were compared. Catechol showed maximum retention (193.3 mg/g, 1.75 mmol/g) in the presence of the best mesoporous absorbent, while bulkier guaiacol and benzophenone did not show any retention. The best adsorbent was also applied for the separation of three groups of phenolic compounds present in the lignin-derived bio-oil, as determined by GC/MS analysis, namely, (i) methoxyphenols and alkylmethoxyphenols, (ii) phenol, alkylphenols, and hydroxyacids, and (iii) catechol. Adsorption studies showed that grafted triamine-functionalized mesoporous silica exhibited the best performance in separation of phenol-based compounds from bio-oils. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A robust method is needed to achieve high yield all-catalytic conversion of recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass to transportation fuels while maximizing carbon utilization from raw substrates. To accomplish this, we developed an integrated strategy that combines homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions with a treatment-extraction step to coproduce 2-methylfuran (MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) directly from hardwood poplar while maintaining high catalyst activity. In the first step, poplar wood chips were treated with dilute FeCl3 in THF-water at subpyrolytic temperature to yield 93.5% furfural (FF) from xylan and 66.0% 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from glucan. Concurrently, a highly pure lignin powder was obtained from the liquor by precipitation upon room temperature vacuum recovery of THF from the water. Afterward, FF and HMF were extracted from water into an organic phase consisting of toluene and 1,4-dioxane treated with Ca(OH)2. A second hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalyst yielded 87.8% MF from FF and 85.6% DMF from HMF. Characterization of the lignin product showed its molecular weight to be reduced by an order of magnitude from its native state as well as complete removal of its native β-aryl ether linkages without hydrogen input or further heterogeneous catalytic processing. A 60% cumulative yield of MF, DMF, and lignin products from the available carbon (xylan+glucan+lignin) in poplar was achieved, rivaling more mature cellulosic ethanol strategies.

AB  - In this paper, glycerol esterification with acetic acid (AA) was studied on several solid acid catalysts: Al2O3, Al-MCM-41, HPA/SiO2, HBEA, Amberlyst 15 and Amberlyst 36 with the aim of determining the reaction conditions and the nature of the surface acid sites required to produce selectively triacetylglycerol (triacetin). The acidity of the catalysts (nature, density and strength of acid sites) was characterized by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and FTIR of adsorbed pyridine. Al2O3 (Lewis acidity) did not show any activity in the reaction. In contrast, highest activity and selectivity to the triacetylated product (triacetin) were obtained on catalysts with Brønsted acidity: Amberlyst 15 and Amberlyst 36. The effect of temperature and molar ratio of AA to glycerol was studied, and the results showed that both parameters have a significant impact on the production of the desired product. Glycerol conversion rate and selectivity to triacetin increased when temperature or AA to glycerol molar ratio were increased, reaching a triacetin yield on Amberlyst 36 of 44% at 393 K and AA to glycerol molar ratio of 6. Deactivation and reusability of Amberlyst 36 were evaluated by performing consecutive catalytic tests. The presence of some irreversible deactivation due to sulfur loss was observed. In addition, the feasibility of using crude glycerol from biodiesel production as reactant was also investigated. Conversion of crude pretreated glycerol yielded values of triacetin and diacetin similar to those obtained with the commercial pure glycerol although at a lower rate. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The influences of equivalence ratio (ER), oxygen concentration (OC) and fluidization velocity (FV) on the gasification performance in a pilot-scale fluidized bed with capacity of 1 ton biomass (the mixture of agricultural residue) per day were investigated using oxygen-enriched air as gasification agent and high-alumina bauxite as bed material. The characteristics of syngas (lower heating value (LHV), gas yield (Y), carbon conversion (CC) and cold gas efficiency (CGE)), bio-char (LHV and Proximate analysis) and tar (tar yield and LHV) were used to evaluate the gasification performance in this study. The results showed that 0.161 was the optimal ER due to the high quality of syngas produced and relatively lower tar generation with ER changing from 0.115 to 0.243 at OC ≈ 40% and FV ≈ 1.20.29.7% was the optimal OC due to the highest Y and CC and relatively low tar generation when OC varied from 21% to 44.7% at ER ≈ 1.40 and FV ≈ 1.15. Although higher FV could improve syngas quality, it also resulted in the higher tar yield and heavier wear, therefore, the optimal gasification performance was achieved at moderate FV (FV = 1.13). This study proved that oxygen-enriched gasification in a large-scale fluidized bed was an effective option to produce gaseous biofuels with high quality. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Waste utilization is essential and challenging. Utilization of wastes gives environmental, economic, and social benefits. In this study, inexpensive, sulfonated solid acid catalysts were successfully prepared from palm empty fruit bunch (PEFB), coconut meal residue (CMR), and coconut coir husk (CH) waste by a simple protocol. It was found that prepared PEFB–BCS–SO3H, CMR–BCS–SO3H, and CH–BCS–SO3H catalysts have 4.79, 3.75, and 2.80 mmol g-1 acid density and 739.0, 89.77, and 61.49 m2 g-1 surface areas, respectively. Further, the presence of active functional groups on the surface of the catalysts was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thermal stability of the catalysts was found below 150°C. Results show that biodiesel yield increases with increasing reaction time and methanol loading, when using microwave heating for biodiesel production from waste palm oil (WPO) and prepared catalysts. A maximum biodiesel yield of 95.5% was obtained by PEFB–BCS–SO3H in 60 minutes using 20:1 methanol:oil (molar ratio) at 70°C. CMR–BCS–SO3H and CH–BCS–SO3H obtained 88.7 and 88.5% biodiesel yields in 60 minutes, using 20:1 and 16:1 methanol:oil (molar ratio), at 70 and 110°C, respectively. Even though, the activity of the catalysts decreased during reuse, these are still of interest as the waste biomass of PEFB, CMR, and CH can be used for catalyst preparation and microwave-assisted biodiesel production from WPO. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Because of the growing world energy demand, biofuels obtained from the hydrotreatment of vegetable oils represent a renewable alternative to replace fossil fuels. The development of mathematical models is an accurate tool to design and simulate the performance of the reactor to predict product yields during the hydrotreatment of these oils. Better understanding of the different phenomena occurring during the hydrotreatment of vegetable oils and parameters influencing on this process by means of kinetic and reactor modeling is required. This was the motivation to develop an exhaustive review on different aspects of reaction kinetics, catalytic deactivation, and reactor modeling. Kinetics of model compounds and real feedstocks (oils) used to produce biofuels are analyzed and different assumptions for developing of reaction rate equations are discussed. It has been recognized that catalyst deactivation and reactor modeling must be deeply studied and supported with experimental data. There are few reported models that consider the mass transfer and temperature inside the catalytic particle. However, there are no models that consider the phase distribution and dispersion in the transient state, nor correlations to calculate the solubility of hydrogen in this type of system. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microalgae is identified as a promising feedstock for producing renewable liquid transportation fuels; however, lipids extraction from microalgae for downstream processing to biofuels is one of the important challenges for algal based biorefineries. This work aims at evaluating the potential of applying flash hydrolysis (FH) as a chemical-free technique to increase the lipids extractability of algal biomass as well as its integration with the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae to enhance the biocrude yields and characteristics for fuel production. To this aim, the FH process was performed on three different algal species (Scenedesmus sp., Nannochloropsis sp., and Chlorella vulgaris) at 280 °C and 10 s of residence time. Following FH, in addition to the nutrients rich hydrolysate, approximately, 40 wt% of solids containing almost all (>90 wt%) the lipids termed as biofuels intermediates (BI), were recovered. Kinetics study on lipids extractability from the BI and their lipid profile analyses were conducted for each algal species. The results showed that the FH process had significantly enhanced the lipids extractability. For all three algae species, lipid yields from BI were higher than that of the raw algae. Lipid yields of Chlorella vulgaris in the first 15 min were more than five times higher (52.3 ± 0.8 vs. 10.7 ± 0.9 wt%) than that of raw algae during n-hexane based solvent extraction. The kinetics of lipids extractability followed a zero-order reaction rate for all wet raw microalgae and the BI of Scenedesmus sp., while the BI recovered from the other two algal species were determined as a second-order reaction. Comparison of fatty acids profiles indicated the contribution of the FH process in saturating fatty acids. Subsequent to lipids extraction, a conventional hydrothermal liquefaction was performed at 350 °C and 1 h to compare the biocrude yields from raw versus BI of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae. The results showed that the biocrude yields from the BI and its quality was significantly enhanced post FH than that of raw algae. The FH process was proven to be a viable option for lipid extraction by increasing the extent of recovery and decreasing the extraction time. Its integration with HTL notably impact the biocrude yields and characteristics for fuel production. © 2018

AB  - The catalytic upgrading pyrolysis of pine sawdust was performed at 500 °C with various metal oxides to improve the quality of the bio-oil. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the metal oxides instead of traditional zeolites for catalytic upgrading pyrolysis with the analysis of Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer. In this study, the used catalysts were Calcium-oxide, Magnesium oxide, Titanium dioxide, and Zeolite (Si/Al = 80). The influence of catalysts on products yields and compositions were investigated. Most metal oxides can enhance the bio-gas with the bio-oil yields decreased. The metal oxides led to a decrease of Acids, Aldehydes, Ketones and an increase of Furfural, Cresols, Catechols in Furans and Phenolics. Among the catalysts, the MgO catalysts was the most effective to convert the high molecular into lights ones (6.65% Cresols) with yield of 20.48% for Furfural. The deoxygenation reaction in bio-oil was suggested to convert oxygenated compounds into the low molecular weight of the materials (6.39% Guaiacols). Thus, the used metal oxides can improve the quality of bio-oil by decreasing undesirable compounds as well as increasing the desirable compounds with low oxygen contents via deoxygenation reaction. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Butanol is frequently discussed as a potential biofuel as it can be produced via acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Like ethanol, it can be added to conventional petrochemical fuels in order to reduce the use of fossil fuels. However, such blending of butanol is only possible if the effects upon mixing are understood. This study makes an important step towards developing detailed knowledge of the influences butanol may exert on a hydrocarbon based fuel. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is employed to analyze the molecular interactions in the fuel blends. In a first step, binary mixtures of butanol and n-decane, which is utilized as a single-component fuel surrogate, are studied. In the second step, blends of butanol with commercial B5 diesel fuel are analyzed. The presence of n-decane weakens the hydrogen bonding interactions between the butanol molecules. When butanol is added to diesel, strong interactions with the biodiesel components containing ester groups are found. Moreover, the potential of using IR spectroscopy for the quantitative analysis of the blends is evaluated. It is shown that the spectra allow a very accurate measurement of the butanol content. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to produce jet biofuel from lipids derived from microalgal biomass, lower-viscosity and smaller-molecular microalgal biodiesel was converted into jet range hydrocarbons over four mesoporous zeolite-based catalysts decorated with nickel. Ni/Meso-Y catalyst exhibited a high selectivity (44.5%) of jet range alkane (C8-C16) from light microalgal biodiesel. The conversion pathway of light microalgal biodiesel to jet range hydrocarbons was proposed that majority of fatty acids first deoxygenated to C15-C16 through decarbonylation and then long chain alkane cracked into short chain alkane. The other fatty acids first cracked into short chain acids and then further deoxygenated through decarbonylation to jet range alkane, in which a part of alkane converted to aromatic hydrocarbons through aromatization. Meso-Y catalyst was suitable for conversion of heavy microalgal biodiesel to jet range hydrocarbons with low selectivity (4.47%) of aromatic hydrocarbons, but the other three catalysts (Meso-HZSM-5, Meso-Hbeta and SAPO-34) gave high aromatic hydrocarbons selectivity. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is one of the well-known causes of global warming. Photoconversion of CO2 to useful chemical compounds using solar energy is an attractive approach as it reduces the major greenhouse gas and promises a sustainable energy source. This method involves radical-chain reactions that form cation and anion radicals generated as a result of the reaction with photogenerated electrons (e-) and holes (h+) between metal oxide photocatalyst and the reactants. Therefore, the product distribution of a modified photocatalyst even under specific reaction conditions is difficult to predict. The CO2 photocatalytic reduction process is controlled by several conditions such as reactor configuration, photocatalyst type, and nature of the reducing agents. Here, we review the parameters such as temperature, pH, CO2 pressure, type of reductant, role of co-catalysts, dopants, and type of photocatalysts that influence the end products of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. In this review, the different modifications recommended for the photocatalysts to improve CO2 reduction and receive maximum valuable end product (methane, ethanol, methanol, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide) have been listed. The discussion also includes specific behaviors of photocatalysts which lead to different product distribution. It has been noted that different metal and nonmetal dopants improve the activity of a photocatalyst and influence the end product distribution by altering the active species. Similarly, the key factors, i.e. size, morphology and doping, which have been ruling the photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction under UV or visible light irradiation have been identified. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for the production of biocrude oil from microalgae. Although this catalyst-free technology is efficient under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, the biocrude yield and quality can be further improved by using heterogeneous catalysts. The design of robust catalysts that preserve their performance under hydrothermal conditions will be therefore very important in the development of biorefinery technologies. In this work, we describe two different synthetic routes (i.e., impregnation and cyclodextrin-assisted one-pot colloidal approach), for the preparation in aqueous phase of six high surface area CoMo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Catalytic tests performed on the HTL of Nannochloropsis gaditana microalga indicate that solids prepared by the one-pot colloidal approach show higher hydrothermal stability and enhanced biocrude yield with respect to the catalyst-free test. The positive effect of the substitution of the block copolymer Tetronic T90R4 for Pluronic F127 in the preparation procedure was evidenced by diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, N2-adsorption-desorption, and H2-temperature-programmed reduction measurements and confirmed by the higher quality of the obtained biocrude, which exhibited lower oxygen content and higher-energy recovery equal to 62.5% of the initial biomass. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microalgal biofuel has the potential to address two major global issues; 1) fulfill the rising energy demand of the world and 2) mitigate the increasing global warming by CO2 sequestration. Botryococcus braunii is a unique alga producing high hydrocarbon contents which can be hydrocracked into high quality fuel. However, there is a lack of interest on the use of B. braunii for biofuel production due to its slow growth rate, an influencing parameter in determining the economics of conventional algal fuel production process. Non-destructive extraction (milking) of B. braunii hydrocarbons is a process which enables the alga to reproduce the hydrocarbons reducing the requirement of fast growth of this alga for biofuel production. This study targets to establish a techno-economics of B. braunii milking to analyze its potential for the renewable hydrocarbon production. The minimum sales price (MSP) to achieve a 10% rate of return was estimated to be US$3.20 L−1 of B. braunii hydrocarbons for the base case scenario. The extraction efficiency and the hydrocarbon contents were found to be the major economy drivers of the process as a result of the additional sensitivity analysis performed to identify the most economic influencing parameters. The MSP has the potential of significant reduction (down to US$1.45 L−1) if a B. braunii with higher hydrocarbon contents is identified as long as the selected strain is suitable for milking and the higher non-destructive extraction efficiency is achieved. A resource assessment comparison was also made to evaluate the significance of the repetitive extraction versus the single extraction. The milking has the clear advantage over the conventional single extraction regarding resource consumption and the cost of the process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we investigated the fractional distillation on bench scale of four organic liquid products (OLPs) obtained by thermal-catalytic cracking of crude palm oil using 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (w/w) sodium carbonate as the catalyst. The main objective of this work was to obtain biofuels similar to fuels derived from petroleum such as jet fuel and diesel fuel. Thus, the fractionation experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure and in two distillation temperature ranges, 160–245 °C and 245–340 °C, obtaining two distilled fractions denominated green jet fuel and green diesel, respectively. The distilled fractions (biofuels) have been physical-chemical characterized by Officials AOCS and ASTM Methods regarding specific gravity at 20 °C, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, corrosiveness to copper, acid value, saponification value, refractive index, and distillation curve. The chemical composition of distilled fractions has been determined by GC–MS. The results of the fractionation of the OLPs show that sodium carbonate is an excellent catalyst regarding yield and selectivity for the production, firstly of green diesel and secondly of green jet fuel. Most physical-chemical properties of green jet fuel and green diesel fractions are within limits established by ANP No. 37 for conventional jet fuel [aviation kerosene (QAV-1/JET A-1)] and ANP No. 65 for commercial diesel (diesel S10), respectively. The experimental distillation curve of the green jet and green diesel fractions are similar to the standard distillation curve of aviation kerosene and diesel S10, respectively. Results from GC–MS analysis revealed that the size of the hydrocarbon chains constituting the green jet fuel (C10-C15) and green diesel (C14-C17) fractions obtained in the present study are in agreement with the length of the chains of hydrocarbons established for aviation kerosene and diesel S10, respectively. In parallel, the increase of catalyst in the thermal-catalytic cracking process improved the yield, selectivity, physical-chemical properties and chemical composition of both biofuels. Therefore, the results presented in this paper indicate that green jet fuel and green diesel fractions can be used as a partial or total substitute for aviation kerosene and diesel S10, respectively. © 2017

AB  - Thermal cracking of waste cooking oil (WCO) for production of liquid fuel has gained special interest due to the growing demand of renewable fuel, depleting fossil fuel reserves and environmental issues. In the present work, thermal cracking of WCO to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels without any preprocessing has been studied. Moreover, non-isothermal kinetics of WCO using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been studied under an inert atmosphere at various heating rates. According to TGA result, active thermal decomposition of WCO was found to be between 318 and 500 °C. Furthermore, the temperature at which the maximum mass loss rate attained was shifted to higher values as the heating rates increased from 10 to 50 °C min−1 and the values were found to be approximately similar to that of R50. Besides, model-free iso-conversion kinetic methods such as Friedman (FM), Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) were used to determine the activation energies of WCO degradation. The average activation energy for the thermal degradation of WCO was found to be 243.7, 211.23 and 222 kJ mol−1 for FM, KAS and FWO kinetic methods, respectively. Additionally, the cracking of WCO was studied in a semi-batch reactor under an inert atmosphere and the influences of cracking temperature, time and heating rates on product distribution were investigated. From the reaction, an optimum yield of 72 mass% was obtained at a temperature of 475 °C, time of 180 min and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The physicochemical properties studied were in accordance with ASTM standards. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Considering the importance of immobilizing dehydrogenase enzymes for bioelectronics, the focus of this paper is to obtain an enzymes cascade for ethanol bioelectrooxidation onto a carbon paper support using a hydrophobically-modified linear polymer of ethyleneimine (LPEI) as the immobilization matrix along with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDGE) as the cross-linking agent. In the first stage of ethanol bioelectrooxidation, the biofuel cell tests show that the amount of the cross-linking agent employed in bioanode preparation directly affects their overall bioelectrocatalytic performance. In fact, much higher performance is observed for the bioanode prepared with an intermediate amount of cross-linking agent, reaching maximum current and power densities of respectively 12.5 ± 1.4 μW cm− 2 and 150 ± 17 μA cm− 2. In both the second and third steps of the ethanol oxidation cascade, several optimizations had to be performed in order to obtain a stable and functioning bioanode, but this work shows that the optimal crosslinking conditions are enzyme dependent. Although immobilization methodologies such as hydrogels have a wide application range in bioelectronics, the proportion between LPEI, EGDGE, and the enzymes being immobilized is quite important to obtain a functioning bioanode, particularly when a cascade of enzymes needs to be immobilized into this matrix. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microfluidic electrochemical energy systems precisely manipulate the fluid flow pattern in microfluidic channel to generate electrical energy without the need to use physical barriers such as proton-exchange membranes that other fuel cells normally do. Among various microfluidic devices, microfluidic biofuel cells combine the microfluidic technology with biocatalysts (e.g., enzyme and bacteria), representing an emerging membrane-free power generator. In this work, we first present an overview of the recent progress made for microfluidic biofuel cells, including the understanding of fundamental working principles, the designs of state-of-the-art devices, and the solutions to substantial challenges in further refining the technique. Key factors to improve power output, the scaling-up process, and the design of novel-architecture electrodes are thoroughly discussed. At last, we propose potential opportunities and discuss their advantages associated with microfluidic biofuel cells as power sources for miniature electronics, in vivo sensors, and total bioanalysis systems. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In present study, engine exhaust was sampled for measurement and analysis of unregulated emissions from a four cylinder transportation diesel engine using a state-of-the-art FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) emission analyzer. Test fuels used were Karanja biodiesel blend (B20) and baseline mineral diesel. Real-time emission measurements were performed for raw exhaust as well as exhaust sampled downstream of the two in-house prepared non-noble metal based diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) and a baseline commercial DOC based on noble metals. Two prepared non-noble metal based DOCs were based on Co-Ce mixed oxide and Lanthanum based perovskite catalysts. Perovskite based DOC performed superior compared to Co-Ce mixed oxide catalyst based DOC. Commercial noble metal based DOC was found to be the most effective in reducing unregulated hydrocarbon emissions in the engine exhaust, followed by the two in-house prepared non-noble metal based DOCs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, we show that the fluorous alcohol hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can act as a superior solvent for the in situ extraction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from an aqueous reaction system. HFIP has a far higher partition coefficient for HMF than common extraction solvents such as methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and n-butanol and has a significantly lower boiling point of 58–59 °C. In a system containing fructose, HCl as the catalyst, and HFIP as the extraction solvent, a high HMF yield of 89 % is achieved, which is far better than the HMF yields in common MIBK/butanol extraction systems. HFIP extracts HMF from the reaction phase without extraction of the fructose educt. In addition, the aqueous catalyst phase can be reused. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Carbon nanotube (CNT) was synthesized during combustion in a diesel engine by using biodiesel, fatty-acid methyl ester (FAME), as main fuel. Ethanol which is also known as biomass-derived material was blended with main fuel. These mixed fuel acted as a carbon and heat source. Ferrocene as a catalyst source for CNT growth and molybdenum/sulfur as a promoter were added into mixed fuel. CNTs produced in each experimental condition were assessed mainly by scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope whether CNT was really synthesized or not. Gas compositions of an exhaust from an engine were examined by two types of gas chromatograph, thermal conductivity detector for O2 CO, CO2 and flame ionization detector for C1–C3 low molecular hydrocarbons. As a comparative study, experiments using 1-decanol and n-dodecane as main fuel were carried out. The former is an emerging material which has been applied for a diesel engine operation in recent years. The latter has been utilized as surrogate fuel of commercial transport fuel in order to mimic several properties of real fuel. Obtained results indicated that FAME and 1-decanol had a propensity to produce larger CO amount which led to CNT formation than that produced from n-dodecane based fuel even at a low ethanol fraction in fuel. We believe that our outcomes will provide fruitful information that high-valued material like CNT can be produced from biomass-derived materials through a diesel engine which generates electrical power in addition to CNT production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes catalytic hydrogenation liquefaction of rice straw over metal (Ni, Co, and Cu)-modified CeO2 catalysts for bio-oil production. The results show that the highest rice straw conversion (89.08%) and bio-oil yield (66.7%) were obtained over Ni/CeO2 catalyst. The bio-oil contains mainly phenols, high-value-added, and widely used chemicals. Furthermore, metal-modified CeO2 catalysts can significantly influence the components of bio-oil with the highest percentage of C7-C10 compounds. This work thus demonstrates that metal/CeO2 catalysts can be effective in improving the bio-oil yield and selectivity in hydro-liquefaction of rice straw into bio-oil. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biomass residues from agriculture and agroindustry are suitable sources for the production of energy because they don't compete with the food chain and they are produced cheaply. Their transformation into heat and power or energy vectors depends on morphology and composition. Shells of almonds and hazelnuts can be easily gasified in fixed beds because of their low fines content and high gas permeation. In this work we investigated the overall process performances and syngas composition, especially the H2/CO ratio, by changing the air and steam supply. The tests were carried out in a pilot updraft gasifier having a capacity of treating up to 20-30 kg/h of biomass. Experimental data were worked out by surface response analysis as function of the equivalence ratios (ER) in relation to the complete combustion and water reaction. By using only air at ER(O2) 0.24 the ratio H2/CO in the syngas was 0.33 while adding steam at ER(H2O) 0.28 the ratio reached a value of 1.0. The energy conversion efficiency from solid to gas and oils reached maximum values of 76% and 28%, respectively. As anticipated by TGA, hazelnut shells produced less organic volatiles and gas efficiency was generally higher than for almond shells. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Candlenut oil (CNO) is a potentially new feedstock for biodiesel (BDF) production. In this paper, a two-step co-solvent method for BDF production from CNO was examined. Firstly, esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) (7 wt%) present in CNO was carried out using a co-solvent of acetonitrile (30 wt%) and H2SO4 as a catalyst. The content of FFAs was reduced to 0.8 wt% in 1 h at 65℃. Subsequent transesterification of the crude oil produced was carried out using a co-solvent of acetone (20 wt%) and 1 wt% potassium hydroxide (KOH). Ester content of 99.3% was obtained at 40℃ in 45 min. The water content in BDF was 0.023% upon purification using vacuum distillation at 5 kPa. The components of CNO BDF were characterized using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry and gas chromatography-flame ionization detector. The physicochemical properties of BDF satisfied the ASTM D6751-02 standard. The gaseous exhaust emissions from the diesel engine upon combustion of the BDF blends (B0–B100) with petrodiesel were examined. The emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were clearly lower, but that of nitrogen oxides was higher in comparison to those from petro-diesel. © 2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Copper (II) containing phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) catalysts were synthesized by ion exchange method and characterization using various physico-chemical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric (TG) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characterization results showed that the Keggin ions were retained in the catalysts and possessed well thermal stability. The catalytic esterification of lauric acid with methanol could be easily achieved about 78.7% conversion under optimum condition, the catalyst also contributed to the stability of the catalyst in which it can be reused for a certain time. This study demonstrated an alternative approach to biodiesel production with high efficiency by Cu (II) ion exchanged phosphomolybdic acid catalyst in the esterification catalytic. © 2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Secondary sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plant is proposed as a promising alternative lipid feedstock for biodiesel production. A deep study combining different type of raw materials (sludge coming from the oxic, anoxic and anaerobic steps of the biological treatment) with different technologies (liquid–liquid and solid–liquid extractions followed by acid catalysed transesterification and in situ extraction-transesterification procedure) allows a complete comparison of available technologies. Different parameters – contact time, catalyst concentration, pretreatments – were considered, obtaining more than 17% FAMEs yield after 50 min of sonication with the in situ procedure and 5% of H2SO4. This result corresponds to an increment of more than 65% respect to the best results reported at typical conditions. Experimental data were used to propose a mathematical model for this process, demonstrating that the mass transfer of lipids from the sludge to the liquid is the limiting step. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae have been recommended as superior candidate for fuel production because of their advantages of higher photosynthetic efficiency, biomass & lipid productivity, and faster growth rate as compared to other energy crops. To meet up all these criteria, we have developed a continuous outdoor micro-algal raceway pond reactor (RPR) and a lab scale indoor tubular photo bioreactor (PBR) for biofuel production. An attempt to utilise indigenous sources of nutrients to improve the economics also revealed that micro-algal culturing can also be used as a mode of nutrient removal and water treatment. The photosynthetic rate and lipid production were enhanced by arresting daytime cell division and promoting night-time cell division. A 50% lipid improvement was observed for the particular algal consortia. Microscopic studies revealed that temporal phase separation could be achieved by adjusting nutrient distribution pattern. To monitor temporal phase separation, it is required to know DNA multiplication model. Quantification of gDNA in RPR confirmed that cell division happens during the night which positively affects the photosynthetic efficiency and lipid productivity of microalgae. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - MWCNT-COOH, TEMPO-modified linear poly(ethylenimine), and alcohol (ADH) and aldehyde (AldDH) dehydrogenase immobilization on electrode surfaces yields a hybrid, tri-catalytic architecture that can catalyze complete ethanol electro-oxidation. The chromatographic results obtained for the tri-catalytic hybrid electrode system show that ethanol is totally oxidized to CO2 after 12 h of electrolysis, confirming that organic oxidation catalysts combined with enzymatic catalysts enable collection of up to 12 electrons from ethanol. The Faradaic efficiency lies above 60% for all of the electrode systems investigated herein. Overall, this study illustrates that surface-immobilized, polymer hydrogel-based hybrid multi-catalytic systems exhibit high oxidation rates and constitute a simple methodology with useful application in the development of enzymatic biofuel cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The laminar burning velocity of 2-methylfuran was investigated using the constant volume method (CVM) at high initial pressure and temperature conditions. The so-called, linear x(p) approximation and a non-linear analytical x(p) relation were used to study the laminar burning velocities of 2-methylfuran fuel. The CVM results were compared to the constant pressure method (CPM) data and numerical results. The CVM and CPM results showed a consistent trend. A percentage deviation of between −8.9% and 8.2% as well as −6% and 8% were observed at initial pressures of 1 and 2 bar when the CVM results were compared to the CPM data while the difference was between −12% and 6% at 4 bar. The numerical results predicted higher laminar burning velocities at all initial conditions when compared to the CVM results. Laminar burning velocity correlations have been obtained from the combined experimental data as a function of the various unburned mixture pressures and temperatures at equivalence ratios of 0.7–1.4. Laminar burning velocities at high unburned mixture temperature and pressure measurement up to 421 K and 8 bar can be obtained from the few experimental data using the correlation in this study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgrading is a critical step for producing hydrocarbon biofuels. Recently, upgrading algae lipids had attracted a lot of attention, but the attention to aviation biofuel was not enough. Meanwhile, the research of upgrading wet algae lipids was very limited. The hydrogenation characteristics were investigated for lipids derived from extraction of dry and wet algae. Hydrotreating parameters including temperature (270–350 °C) and catalyst loading (10–30%) were investigated and two-stage hydrogenation was conducted at the optimal reaction condition. Two-stage biofuels resulted in lower heteroatoms including O and N both for dry and wet algae lipids. The elemental contents of N were below 0.007% and the O contents were below 0.3%. The heating values were about 46.2 MJ/kg. Both of dry and wet algae lipids can be hydrotreated to aviation biofuel by the two-stage hydrogenation, even though the wet algae lipids contained more carboxylic acid, sterol, and vitamin E than dry algae lipids, which contains more alcohols and esters. The compound of 5-Methyl-3-phenylcyclopent-2-en-1-one is difficult to be upgraded. The content of aromatics and cyclo-paraffins shows a rising trend and some of the aromatics could be upgraded to cyclo-paraffins in the hydrogenation process. In addition, the yield of high-quality biofuel from dry algae lipids is 73.02%, and that is 76.47% for wet algae lipids, which indicated that the wet route hydrogenation might have an advantage over the dry route. The hydrotreating results of model compound cholesterol indicated that much amounts of aromatics was generated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Valuable biomass conversion processes are highly dependent on the use of effective pretreatments for lignocellulose degradation and enzymes for saccharification. Among the nowadays available treatments, chemical delignification represents a promising alternative to physical-mechanical treatments. Banana is one of the most important fruit crops around the world. After harvesting, it generates large amounts of rachis, a lignocellulosic residue, that could be used for second generation ethanol production, via saccharification and fermentation. In the present study, eight chemical pretreatments for lignin degradation (organosolv based on organic solvents, sodium hypochlorite, hypochlorous acid, hydrogen peroxide, alkaline hydrogen peroxide, and some combinations thereof) have been tested on banana rachis and the effects evaluated in terms of lignin removal, material losses, and chemical composition of pretreated material. Pretreatment based on lignin oxidation have demonstrated to reach the highest delignification yield, also in terms of monosaccharides recovery. In fact, all the delignified samples were then saccharified with enzymes (cellulase and beta-glucosidase) and hydrolysis efficiency was evaluated in terms of final sugars recovery before fermentation. Analysis of Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) has been carried out on treated samples, in order to better understand the structural effects of delignification on lignocellulose. Active chlorine oxidations, hypochlorous acid in particular, were the best effective for lignin removal obtaining in the meanwhile the most promising cellulose-to-glucose conversion. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Microbial electrolysis of an aqueous phase generated from catalytic pyrolysis of pine sawdust was investigated for renewable hydrogen production. The microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) performance was investigated at an organic loading rate ranging from 2 to 50 g/L-day. A maximum hydrogen productivity of 5.8 ± 0.18 L/L-day was obtained, however, the productivity increased linearly only up to a loading rate of 10 g/L-day. The highest current density achieved was 6.8 ± 0.1 A/m2. The efficiency of conversion of the substrate to current in the anode decreased with increasing loading, but the initial maximum Coulombic efficiency was 98 ± 0.04%. The cathode efficiency, on the other hand, increased with loading up to a maximum of 89 ± 1.4%. Total hydrogen recovery was relatively constant for most runs at 30%, which is equivalent to an yield of 0.6 moL H2/mole COD, except at the highest loading rate. The operation of the MEC under batch mode, however, resulted in a higher hydrogen recovery of 63 ± 4%. The conversion of a wide range of compounds, including carboxylic acids, anhydrosugars, furanic and phenolic compounds present in the aqueous phase is reported. The results demonstrate potential for hydrogen production from a waste stream which can improve the total biofuel or energy yield of the biorefinery. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rubber seed shell (RSS), comprises of 96.67 wt% organic content and 38.6% crystallinity index, was used for the production of biofuel and value-added chemicals through semi-batch pyrolysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of RSS at heating rate of 20 °C/min showed R50 value as 12.72%/min at 376.5 °C. The gaseous product evolved during the decomposition of RSS were analyzed through inline Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) coupled with TGA instrument. The effects of pyrolysis temperatures (350°C-600 °C) and heating rates (10°C/min–40 °C/min) on the product distribution (liquid, gas and bio-char) were investigated. The maximum yield of liquid product (46.14 wt%) and the carbon-rich bio-char (31.92 wt%) were obtained at 550 °C temperature for heating rate of 30 °C/min. The fuel characteristics of produced bio-char such as higher calorific value (34.5 MJ/kg), higher fixed carbon (79.74 wt%), lower ash (1.87 wt%) and lower moisture content (2.11 wt%) suggested its potential to be used as solid fuel. Value-added organic compounds such as acetic acid, phenolic compounds, creosol, pilocarpine, benzene and levoglucosan were identified in the liquid product using gas chromatography. The pH values of liquid products (2.55–3.0) support the presence of organic acids and phenolic fraction. The presence of various functional groups was also identified using FT-IR spectroscopy. In depth analysis of physico-chemical-thermal properties of RSS and obtained products (liquid and bio-char) suggested that RSS can be considered as a suitable feedstock for the production of value added chemicals including fuel. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - A robust approach to access liquid residence time distribution (RTD) adapted to multiphase flow in porous media is presented. It is tailored to meet specific requirements of small scale systems (centimeter, millimeter or less) with Taylor segmented flow feed. The method involves direct visualization using fluorescence microscopy close to both extremities of a porous packing. Critical image treatment steps and optimization of a versatile discrete model with 4 parameters are detailed and discussed. They allow the precise and rapid determination of RTD curves and their 1st- and 2nd-order moments. The application of the method is successfully illustrated with dense micro-packed beds of sub-millimeter particles and highly porous media like open cell solid foams undergoing a preformed G-L segmented (Taylor) flow. Original results regarding the effect of fluid flowrates and different confined porous media are discussed and lead to a single two-parameter liquid hold up correlation, which is valid for both packings. As usual, RTD broadening is treated as a combination of convective dispersion and mass transfer to a fraction of immobile liquid. The predominant role of mass transfer is underlined with an analysis of characteristic times. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biogas and biomethane (=purified biogas) are major renewable fuels that play a pivotal role in the evolving global energy economy. Here, we measure ultrafine particle (UFP; Dp (particle diameter) &lt; 100 nm) emissions from the combustion of biomethane and biogas produced from five different representative sources: two food waste digesters, two dairy waste digesters, and one landfill. Combustion exhaust for each of these sources is measured from one or more representative sectors including electricity generation, motor vehicles, and household use. Results show that UFP emissions are similar when using biomethane and natural gas with similar sulfur and siloxane content. Approximately 70% of UFPs emitted from water heaters and cooking stoves were semivolatile, but 30% of the UFPs were nonvolatile and did not evaporate even under extremely high dilution conditions. Photochemical aging of biomethane combustion exhaust and natural gas combustion exhaust produced similar amounts of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. The results of the current study suggest that widespread adoption of biogas and biomethane as a substitute for natural gas will not significantly increase ambient concentrations of primary and secondary UFPs if advanced combustion technology is used and the sulfur and siloxane content is similar for biogas/biomethane and natural gas. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: 2-Phenylethanol (2-PE) is a higher aromatic alcohol that is widely used in the perfumery, cosmetics, and food industries and is also a potentially valuable next-generation biofuel. In our previous study, a new strain Enterobacter sp. CGMCC 5087 was isolated to produce 2-PE from glucose through the phenylpyruvate pathway. Results: In this study, candidate genes for 2-PE biosynthesis were identified from Enterobacter sp. CGMCC 5087 by draft whole-genome sequence, metabolic engineering, and shake flask fermentation. Subsequently, the identified genes encoding the 2-keto acid decarboxylase (Kdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) enzymes from Enterobacter sp. CGMCC 5087 were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) to construct a high-efficiency microbial cell factory for 2-PE production using the prokaryotic phenylpyruvate pathway. The enzymes Kdc4427 and Adh4428 from Enterobacter sp. CGMCC 5087 showed higher performances than did the corresponding enzymes ARO10 and ADH2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. The E. coli cell factory was further improved by overexpressing two upstream shikimate pathway genes, aroF/aroG/aroH and pheA, to enhance the metabolic flux of the phenylpyruvate pathway, which resulted in 2-PE production of 260 mg/L. The combined overexpression of tktA and ppsA increased the precursor supply of erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, which resulted in 2-PE production of 320 mg/L, with a productivity of 13.3 mg/L/h. Conclusions: The present study achieved the highest titer of de novo 2-PE production of in a recombinant E. coli system. This study describes a new, efficient 2-PE producer that lays foundation for the industrial-scale production of 2-PE and its derivatives in the future. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The effect of support nature, SiO2 and γ-Al2O3, on physicochemical and catalytic properties of nickel phosphide catalysts in methyl palmitate hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been considered. Firstly, alumina-supported nickel phosphide catalysts prepared by temperature-programmed reduction method starting from different precursors (phosphate–Ni(NO3)2 and (NH4)2 HPO4 or phosphite–Ni(OH)2 and H3 PO3) were compared using elemental analysis, N2 physisorption, H2-TPR, XRD, TEM, NH3-TPD,27 Al and31P MAS NMR techniques and catalytic experiments. The mixture of nickel phosphide phases was produced from phosphate precursor on alumina while using of phosphite precursor provides Ni2P formation with the higher activity in methyl palmitate HDO. Besides, the comparative study of the performances of Ni2 P/SiO2 and Ni2P/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrates the apparent superiority of alumina-supported Ni2P in the methyl palmitate hydrodeoxygenation. Considering the tentative scheme of methyl palmitate transformation, we proposed that cooperation of Ni2P and acid sites on the surface of alumina provides the enhanced activity of alumina-supported Ni2P through the acceleration of acid-catalysed hydrolysis. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Cell wall disruption is a critical challenge for algal biofuel. Here, we reported Hydrothermal treatment (HTT) of high solid content (20% w/w) Nannochloropsis sp. and its influence on extraction of lipid. Various process variables were specifically studied including reaction temperature (120–200 °C) and retention time (0–60 min). SEM and TEM images revealed the cell morphology before and after HTT. A high extraction yield (84%) of lipid was obtained at 180 °C with a retention time of 60 min, without the use of any catalysts. GC–MS revealed that the main compounds in the extracts were fatty acids, hydrocarbons and esters. UPLC-MS/MS uncovered the detailed varieties of glyceride, phospholipid and glycolipid, and demonstrated that (16:0/16:0/16:1) triglyceride (TAG) was the most abundant TAG. HTT might be a promising method to break microalgae cell wall for lipid extraction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present experimental work focuses on the influence injection pressure and toroidal re-entrant combustion chamber in a single cylinder diesel engine fuelled with ternary fuel (diesel-biodiesel-ethanol) blend. Ternary fuel (TF) is prepared by blending 70% diesel, 20% biodiesel, and 10% ethanol blends and its fuel properties were investigated and compared with diesel fuel. Since the physic-chemical properties of TF are well behind the diesel fuel, it is proposed to be blended with 20 ppm alumina nano additives which act as an ignition enhancer and catalytic oxidizer. The resulting fuel mixture (TF + 20 ppm alumina additive) is named as high performance fuel (HPF). Experimentations were conducted on HPF subjected to various injection pressures of 18 MPa, 20 MPa, 22 MPa, and 24 MPa respectively and are operated in toroidal re-entrant chamber geometry (TG) at an injection timing of 22 o bTDC. From experimentation, it was identified that, for TG-HPF, higher injection pressure of 22 MPa ensued highest BTE (Brake Thermal Efficiency) of 35.5% and lowest BSEC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) of 10.13 MJ/kWh owing to the pooled effect of higher swirl formation, improved atomization enhanced evaporation rate, and better air-fuel mixing. Emission wise TG-HPF operated at 22 MPa lowered the HC (hydrocarbon), CO (carbon monoxide), and smoke emissions by 18.88%, 7.19%, and 5.02%, but with marginally improved NOx (oxides of nitrogen) and CO 2 (carbon dioxide) emissions by 3.92% and 3.89% respectively. In combustion point of view, it is observed that injection pressure increased the cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR), and cumulative heat release rate (CHRR) by 5.35%, 5.08%, and 3.38% respectively indicating improved combustion rate as a result of enhanced atomization, evaporation, and high turbulence inducement. Overall, it is concluded that operating the ternary fuel at 22 MPa injection pressure at toroidal re-entrant combustion chamber results in improved performance and minimized emissions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Synergic effect of greenhouse vegetable wastes (GVWs) and lignite coal was investigated with different feedstock particle sizes and pyrolysis temperatures by using natural catalysts (calcite, dolomite, and zeolite) in a laboratory scale fast pyrolysis experimental system. The yields of co-pyrolysis products (biochar, bio-oil, and gases) and bio-oil composition were used in revealing the synergic effects. The study results showed that a positive synergic effect in biochar yield but negative synergic effects in bio-oil and gas yields were observed. The mean respective yields of biochar, bio-oil, and gas of GVWs as wt% were 41.67, 40.05, 38.96 for calcite; 29.55, 30.79, 30.88 for dolomite; and 28.79, 29.16, 30.16 for zeolite. The mean respective yields of biochar, bio-oil, and gas of GVWs-coal blend as wt% were 55.93, 54.16, 53.87 for calcite; 21.73, 22.93, 23.24 for dolomite; and 22.34, 22.92, 22.90 for zeolite. Catalysts had no significant influences on the pyrolysis products yields of GVWs and GVWs-coal blend compared to the control. Similarly, no significant effects of catalysts on bio-oil composition were also observed. Feedstock particle size and pyrolysis temperature had little effect on the yields of products bio-oil compositions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate hydrothermal liquefaction of Mulberry bark in sub-critical ethanol-water co-solvents (S-C-E-W) (50:50, v/v) and sub-critical water (S-C-W) with K2CO3 as catalyst at fixed condition (300 °C and 60 min). The derived bio-oil was analyzed by FTIR and GC-MS, FTIR and XRD were used to characterize Mulberry bark and the solid residues. The results showed that liquefaction efficiency of Mulberry bark was higher in S-C-E-W (95.72 wt %) than that in S-C-W (87.5 wt%), and the bio-oil yield was a little more in S-C-E-W (30.32 wt %) than that in S-C-W (28.81 wt%), although the yield of the heavy oil (HO) varied little (26.16% in S-C-E-W, 26.25% in S-C-W), and the yield of the light oil (LO) was very low (4.16% in S-C-E-W and 2.56% in S-C-W). There was small difference between the higher heating values. The bio-oil components were complex, mainly contained phenols, aromatic, alkanes, ketone, esters, furans, nitrogen compounds, etc. The content of phenols in the bio-oil derived in S-C-W was more than that derived in S-C-E-W, and HO derived in S-C-E-W contained higher content of ester components. The liquefaction of Mulberry bark can be enhanced by ethanol. © 2018

AB  - This work assessed the economics and carbon footprint of alcohol (ethanol vs. n-butanol)-to-jet fuel production using eucalyptus for feedstock. Considering a risk-mitigating strategy of investing first in the alcohol plant (organosolv pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation) and waiting five years until the second investment (alcohol-to-jet plant), the minimum jet fuel selling price was similar in both ethanol and butanol cases (2.10 and 2.08 US$/l for 20% Internal Rate of Return, IRR). In contrast, according to a stochastic decision-making framework that had carbon footprint as one of the criteria, the ethanol pathway is more promising. Nevertheless, even optimistic assumptions (regarding e.g. lignin price, and the interval between project phases) were ineffective to prevent eucalyptus jet fuel from depending on price premium (>1.00 US$/l), which is needed for better returns than those from eucalyptus ethanol plants. Therefore, the feasibility of alcohol-to-jet fuel production in eucalyptus pulp mills depends on long-term, stable premium and subsidy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The economical production of lipids is considered as an appropriate renewable alternative feedstock for biodiesel production because of the contemporary concerns on fuel crisis, climate change and food security. In this study, lipid accumulation potential of a novel oleaginous yeast isolate Naganishia liquefaciens NITTS2 by utilizing pre-digested municipal waste activated sludge (PWAS) was explored. Optimization of culture conditions was performed using response surface methodology coupled with genetic algorithm and maximum lipid content of 55.7% was obtained. The presence of lipid was visually confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and its characteristic profile was determined by GC-MS. The yeast lipid was recovered and converted into biodiesel by garbage lipase with the efficiency of 88.34 ± 1.2%, which was further analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hence, the results of this study strongly suggest the possibility of using PWAS as an efficient and low-cost resource for the production of biodiesel from the oleaginous yeast. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Sustainable production of renewable fuels has become an imperative goal but also remains a huge challenge faced by the chemical industry. A variety of low-value, renewable sources of carbon such as wastes and by-products must be evaluated for their potential as feedstock to achieve this goal. Hydrogenation of blends comprising waste animal fat (≤70 wt%) and low-value fluid catalytic cracking light cycle oil (≥30 wt%), with a total aromatic content of 87.2 wt%, was studied on a commercial sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The fuel fraction in the diesel boiling range was separated by fractional distillation from the organic liquid product obtained from the catalytic conversion of the blend of 70 wt% waste animal fat and 30 wt% light cycle oil. Diesel fuel of the best quality was obtained under the following reaction conditions: T = 615–635 K, P = 6 MPa, LHSV = 1.0 h−1, H2/feedstock ratio = 600 Nm3/m3. The presence of fat in the feedstock was found to promote the conversion of light cycle oil to a paraffinic blending component for diesel fuel. Thus, a value-added alternative fuel with high biocontent can be obtained from low-value refinery stream and waste animal fat. The resultant disposal of waste animal fat, and the use of fuel containing less fossil carbon for combustion helps reduce the emission of pollutants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of pretreated bamboo sawdust and soapstock was conducted. The pretreatment process was carried out under microwave irradiation. The effects of microwave irradiation temperature, irradiation time, and concentration of hydrochloric acid on product distribution from co-pyrolysis and the relative contents of the major components in bio-oil were investigated. A maximum bio-oil yield of 40.00 wt.% was obtained at 200 °C for 60 min with 0.5 M hydrochloric acid. As pretreatment temperature, reaction time and acid concentration increased, respectively, the relative contents of phenols, diesel fraction (C12 + aliphatics), and other oxygenates decreased. The gasoline fraction (including C5–C12 aliphatics and aromatics) ranged from 55.77% to 73.30% under various pretreatment conditions. Therefore, excessive reaction time and concentration of acid are not beneficial to upgrading bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) is an important furanic compound that can be obtained from renewable raw materials. HMF has wide application in the industry, acting as an intermediate in the production of fine chemicals, polymer, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals. In this research, HMF was obtained from the catalytic fructose dehydration. Purolite® SGC650H, a gel-type strongly acidic resin, was applied as a catalyst using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent. All experiments were carried out in a batch reactor (BTR) and a continuous packed bed reactor (PBR). The reactor performance data showed that increase in temperature resulted in higher HMF yield. In contrast, the higher the fructose concentration, the lower the HMF conversion. The HMF production rates in the PBR were higher because of the concentration of the catalyst. The rate constants were calculated by means of a pseudo-first-order reaction model, and the Arrhenius kinetic parameters obtained changed with regards to the reactants concentrations. The kinetic parameters displayed linear correlation in the Cremer-Constable diagram, which means that the system was under a kinetic compensation effect (KCE); therefore, the model was not suitable to represent the reaction. Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LHHW) models for rate equation were also tested. However all of them failed to adjust to the data, and thus a rate law was not determined. Due to the observed KCE, it was believed that there is at least a set of parallel dehydration reactions initiated from the different fructose isomers which has an influence on kinetic parameters. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accumulation and disposal of kitchen food waste is a substantial environmental issue due to the absence of appropriate reuse techniques. The present study developed a low-cost biodiesel production method and used Taguchi optimization technique to improve FAME yield. A single phase blend (oil, co-solvent and solvent mixture) was prepared and subjected to microwave irradiation to accelerate the initial slow reaction rate. Transesterification was carried out in a closed vessel under various temperature-pressure conditions. The reaction parameters were optimized through Taguchi model. Maximum FAME yield of 96.89 wt% was achieved at microwave cell pressure: 2.2 MPa, temperature: 170 °C, reaction time: 4 min and catalyst concentration: 0.5 wt% with single phase blend ratio 1:6:30 (oil: co-solvent: methanol). Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was used as co-solvent that contributed to maximum FAME conversion and produced glycerol tert-butyl ether (GTBE), a useful fuel additive as a byproduct. Improved cetane number observed for the kitchen food waste derived biodiesel signifies the fuel of superior fatty acid structure. Maximum 85 wt% GTBE conversion was attained at 200 °C temperature and cell pressure 3.9 MPa at 10 min reaction time. Microwave irradiation method consumed 2.7% lesser energy than conventional heating method. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Furanic diethers are considered as one of potential biofuels or green solvents. 2,5-Bis(methoxymethyl)furan (BMMF), diether of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) with methanol, is difficult to effectively synthesize in traditional homogeneous catalytic systems due to active groups of BHMF. In this case, HCl and AlCl3, representatives of Brønsted and Lewis acid, are separately employed to explore catalytic performance in BHMF etherification. We also demonstrated that Lewis and Brønsted acid not only synergistically catalyze the etherification but also take respectively charge of main and side reactions. Subsequently, the catalytic performance of ZSM-5 and modified ZSM-5 proved this conclusion. High yield and selectivity of BMMF catalyzed by 1.5%Sn-ZSM-5 was obtained, about 95%, which may be attributed to suitable Brønsted and Lewis acidity as well as pore structure. This suggests that synthesis of BMMF by using solid acid is possible in the future industrialization. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Almost the complete amount of jet fuel available on the global market is produced from fossil crude oil being an exhaustible raw material. Furthermore its use is inherently connected with emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2. To cope with this, several processes for the production of alternative aviation fuels were developed including the use of biomass as a renewable feedstock. Since biomass from cultivation farming is in competition with food and fodder production, the preferred raw material would be residues from agriculture and forestry or municipal waste, also microalgae can be used. Independent of the raw material, the conversion of biogenic feedstock into alternative jet fuel is based on microbial, thermal and/or chemical breakdown of larger (bio)-molecules into smaller ones, followed by the catalytic formation of fuel molecules and hydrogenation. An overview on the production of different alternative bio-based jet fuels is given including a survey about producers and capacities, focusing on already certificated bio-based jet fuels. In addition to that, a comparison of fundamental combustion properties between Jet A-1 and different alternative jet fuels is presented: Laminar burning velocities and ignition delay times, each measured for two synthetic jet fuels based on fossil resources (coal-to-liquid—CtL and gas-to-liquid—GtL) as well as for two biofuels (farnesane and an Alcohol-to-Jet fuel—AtJ). Measurements of the burning velocities were performed at a preheat temperature of 473 K and pressures of 1 and 3 bar by variation of the fuel–air-equivalence ratios φ. Ignition delay times were determined for φ-values of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, at an initial pressure of about 16 bar and temperatures ranging between 800 and 1700 K. It turns out that with respect to the characteristic combustion properties tested the considered alternative fuels have a combustion behavior similar to Jet A-1. © 2018, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.

AB  - Microwave-assisted direct liquefaction of solid digestate was carried out in polyethylene glycol and glycerol employing sulfuric acid as catalyst, in order to convert it into a biofuel. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) coupled with Box-Behnken Design (BBD) with a total of 15 individual experiments was used to optimize the conditions of three independent variables (temperature, reaction time and solvent-to-biomass ratio) related to the bio-oil yield, the higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil and the energy use of microwave treatment. Desirability function was employed to determine the optimal reaction conditions of the liquefaction process. The results showed that at the optimal conditions the bio-oil yield, the HHV of bio-oil and energy use were respectively 59.38%, 28.48 MJ/kg, and 115.93 Wh. The predicted responses showed a good compliance to the obtained experimental data. The optimized bio-oil was further characterized using FTIR analysis while the properties of the solid digestate and the liquefaction residue were analyzed by means of SEM analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of biodiesel at high temperatures may result in the formation of transient and stable free radicals immobilized on particulate emissions. Consequently, free radicals adsorbed on particulates are believed to be precursors for health-related illnesses such as cancer, cardiac arrest, and oxidative stress. This study explores the nature of free radicals and particulate emissions generated when Croton megalocarpus biodiesel is pyrolyzed at 600 °C in an inert environment of flowing nitrogen at a residence time of 0.5 s at 1 atm. The surface morphology of thermal emissions were imaged using a field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG SEM) while the radical characteristics were investigated using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (EPR). A g-value of 2.0024 associated with a narrow ∆Hp-p of 3.65 G was determined. The decay rate constant for the radicals was low (1.86 × 10−8 s−1) while the half-life was long ≈ 431 days. The observed EPR characterization of Croton megalocarpus thermal particulates revealed the existence of free radicals typical of those found in coal. The low g-value and low decay rate constant suggests that the free radicals in particulates are possibly carbon-centered. The mechanistic channel for the formation of croton char from model biodiesel component (9-dodecenoic acid, methyl ester) has been proposed in this study. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Glycerol as raw material for further use within biorefineries has been evaluated by reviewing and comparing several processes, mostly from the literature but also a few developed for this work. The evaluation of these processes for transforming glycerol into fuels and chemicals includes their economics and the influence of main process design parameters. The possibility of reusing those chemicals within the biorefinery complex provides further integration possibilities. Various chemical complexes have been described from the literature, and a new process to obtain acrolein is developed. On the one hand, high added-value products allow a biodiesel production cost rather competitive. However, this reduces the integration opportunities and even the fuel yield from oil. On the other hand, for biorefineries to be attractive, a combination of yield and economics needs to be achieved. It looks like a distributed production is so far preferable, based on the current studies. But a more comprehensive supply chain study should be developed to evaluate and integrate biodiesel production plants and processes in a territory. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Multi-enzyme immobilized carbon-felt electrodes are fabricated for application as a bioanode in biofuel cells to utilize both maltose and glucose as the fuel. The unique combination of three enzymes (maltase, mutarotase, and glucose oxidase) enables us to utilize maltose as the fuel for the bioanode. The new electrode based on carbon felt (CF) demonstrates a high oxidation current density of 6.5 mA cm−2 at 0.34 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a neutral phosphate buffer solution containing 0.025 mol dm−3 (≡M) maltose in a half-cell configuration. Furthermore, we improve the bioanode performance by changing the surfactant from cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to Triton X-100® (TX), which is used as a carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersant in the bioanode preparation process. A superior current density of 17 mA cm−2 at 0.34 V vs. Ag/AgCl is demonstrated with the multi-enzyme bioanode by using TX as the CNT dispersant, owing to the good dispersion of CNTs attached to CF and the reduced deactivation and leakage of the enzymes. A maltose/O2 biofuel cell, composed of the multi-enzyme immobilized bioanode and a biocathode based on bilirubin oxidase and mediator, delivers a maximum power density of 2.3 mW cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage of 0.69 V in 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution containing 50 mM maltose. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - While biodiesel production is on the rise, so too is the production of the low-value product, glycerol. Interesterification is an alternative reaction that produces fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and avoids the production of glycerol. In this work, ferric sulfate is used as a potential heterogeneous catalyst for interesterification of model triglyceride, triolein, using methyl acetate. Reaction conditions were optimized by varying reaction temperature, methyl acetate to oil mole ratio (MAOMR), catalyst loading, as well as FAME as co-solvents. Additionally, this work also evaluated the effect of typical triglyceride feedstock contaminants, water and free fatty acids (FFA). The optimal reaction conditions were found to be 120 °C, 20:1 MAOMR and a mass loading of 7.5% ferric sulfate with yields up to 83%. The addition of FAME and water in the system is shown to have potential benefits on reaction rate and yield while FFA addition had mildly negative impacts on initial reaction rate. The results in this work show relatively high yields at mild temperatures and reagents loadings and could be a promising means of alternative FAME production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the effect of different degumming processes on the phosphorus content of Crambe abyssinica oil and resultant biodiesel was evaluated. The non-edible oil was submitted to water degumming and chemical degumming with different concentrations of phosphoric acid and varying the acid to oil volume percentages. Phosphorus content of the products was measured by UV spectroscopy after sample calcination, according to NP 1994:2000. Biodiesel was produced by transesterification using a 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio and 1 wt% sodium hydroxide as catalyst at 65 °C, during 1 h. The biodiesel produced directly from the crude oil presented high phosphorus concentration (>20 ppm); consequently, a degumming process was required to fulfil the quality standard (<4 ppm according to EN 14214). Water degumming was not effective, leading to biodiesel with a phosphorus concentration of 12.2 ppm. Among the acid degumming processes evaluated and taking into account technical and operational variables, the best established conditions, which allowed the fulfilment of the quality standard regarding phosphorus concentration, was considered to be 25 wt% acid concentration and 0.80 vol% of acid to oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation process is a potential route for upgrading biofuel intermediates, like vanillin, which is obtained in huge quantities through the chemical treatment of the abundant lignocellulosic biomass resources of nature, and this is attracting increasing attentions over the years. Herein, we report the grafting of palladium nanoparticles at the surface of porous organic polymer Pd-PDVTTT-1 synthesized through the co-condensation of 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione and divinylbenzene in the presence of radical initiator under solvothermal reaction conditions. The Pd-PDVTTT-1 material has been characterized thoroughly by powder X-ray diffraction, nitrogen sorption, ultra-high-resolution transmission electron Microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, 13C MAS NMR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. High surface area together with good thermal stability of the Pd-PDVTTT-1 material has motivated us to explore its potential as heterogeneous catalyst in the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin for the production of upgraded biofuel 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol in almost quantitative yield and high selectivity (94%). © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An alternative approach to producing biodiesel from spent coffee grounds (SCGs) has been developed with methanol washing applied as a pretreatment step, followed by in-situ transesterification. Under optimal conditions, methanol washing was able to reduce the high acid value of SCGs to 0.78 mg KOH g−1 with a negligible loss of their oil content, which ended up being 11.43% by mass. Pretreated SCGs were then directly treated with a potassium methoxide solution and isopropanol as co-solvents in the in-situ transesterification process. A central composited rotatable design was applied to determine the optimal conditions for KOH concentration and proportion of isopropanol. The results showed that both KOH concentration and proportion of isopropanol had significant effects on the biodiesel yields, residual triglyceride in the biodiesel, and extraction performance (p-value &lt;0.05). The optimal conditions were provided by KOH concentration of 2.5 g in a 100 mL mixture of methanol and 25% volume of isopropanol, using 2.7 mL of the reagent to 1 g of SCGs at 30 °C for 2 h. Under these conditions, 88.8% biodiesel yield (i.e., 102 mg of biodiesel per 1 g of SCGs), with a less than 0.1% mass of residual triglycerides in the biodiesel, was achieved. © 2018

AB  - Despite the critical importance of ecological systems for sustaining all chemical and manufacturing processes, process design has kept nature outside its system boundary. Recent efforts for sustainable process design aim to reduce environmental impact, but no design method considers the capacity of ecosystems to supply the goods and services that are needed to sustain a process. Overcoming this deficiency of conventional process design is essential to transform the chemical industry into an activity that respects ecological constraints and results in a net positive societal impact. As an important step toward meeting this goal, this work expands the boundary of process design to include ecosystems as unit operations in traditional design. Similar to tasks performed by conventional unit operations, ecological processes perform ecosystem functions resulting in goods and services required by the technological system. The goal behind designing integrated techno-ecological process flowsheets is to balance the ecosystem service demand of technological systems with the ecosystem service supply of ecological systems. Systems are optimized to balance the demand and supply subject to unit operation level constraints of technological and ecological systems, and interactions between detailed process level variables and ecological variables are explored. The Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES) Design method is developed and applied to a biofuel production system, considering ecosystem services like water provisioning and water quality regulation provided by wetland ecosystems. Comparing the integrated TES design with conventional techno-centric design shows that TES design can result in net positive impact manufacturing: a case where the ecosystem service supply is equal to or exceeds the demand, with little or no compromises in process profitability. These results should encourage close integration between technological and ecological systems while designing sustainable processes, and identify many challenges for developing TES of individual processes and across the life cycle. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 2390–2407, 2018. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Butanol production from glycerol was investigated through Clostridium pasteurianum entrapped into polyvinyl alcohol particles. Using an optimized system, batch and repeated batch fermentations with free and entrapped cells were performed, respectively. In both systems, glycerol samples of different purity were tested. In repeated batch fermentations, process time decreased from 19.5 to 2.7 h and butanol productivity increased 6.3 times (3.08 g L−1 h−1) compared with the free-cell process, using pure glycerol. In the case of glycerol from biodiesel production, butanol productivity of 2.90 and 1.76 g L−1 h−1 was achieved from glycerol 01 and glycerol 02, respectively. No cell growth or solvent production was observed when the same glycerols were used in free-cell fermentations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nanozeolites with different crystallographic structures (Nano/TS1, Nano/GIS, Nano/LTA, Nano/BEA, Nano/X, and Nano-X/Ni), functionalized with (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA), were studied as solid supports for Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) immobilization. Physicochemical characterizations of the surface-functionalized nanozeolites and nanozeolite-enzyme complexes were performed using XRD, SEM, AFM, ATR-FTIR, and zeta potential measurements. The experimental enzymatic activity results indicated that the nanozeolitic supports functionalized with APTMS and GA immobilized larger amounts of enzymes and provided higher enzymatic activities, compared to unfunctionalized supports. Correlations were observed among the nanozeolite surface charges, the enzyme immobilization efficiencies, and the biocatalyst activities. The catalytic performance and reusability of these enzyme-nanozeolite complexes were evaluated in the ethanolysis transesterification of microalgae oil to fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). TLL immobilized on the nanozeolite supports functionalized with APTMS and GA provided the most efficient biocatalysis, with FAEEs yields above 93% and stability during five reaction cycles. Lower FAEEs yields and poorer catalytic stability were found for nanozeolite-enzyme complexes prepared only by physical adsorption. The findings indicated the viability of designing highly efficient biocatalysts for biofuel production by means of chemical modulation of nanozeolite surfaces. The high biocatalyst catalytic efficiency observed in ethanolysis reactions using a lipid feedstock that does not compete with food production is an advantage that should encourage the industrial application of these biocatalysts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We demonstrate an electrodeposition process for the fabrication of highly porous PtCu alloy anodes. In the fabrication process, Pt and different amounts of a second noble metal (Pd, Ru, Au) are repeatedly co-deposited with Cu from an aqueous electrolyte, followed by selective dealloying of Cu. In this way, highly porous PtCu alloys with roughness factors ranging from 400 to 4000 can be obtained. In all cases, both noble-metal partners are present on the electrode surface, whereas the majority of copper is likely buried underneath. In addition, we can show that H desorption and CO stripping yield substantially different roughness factors, even when applied to PtCu anodes. Hence, when using or comparing results from different stripping methods, a calibration is required. Compared to PtCu anodes, small additions of Ru (ca. 3 at% Ru) lead to significantly enhanced catalytic activity for the electro-oxidation of formic acid and methanol, whereas Au-rich PtCu−Au alloys (ca. 75 at% Au) exhibit significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation. In some cases, large variations impede the identification of significant differences in electrocatalytic activity. To reduce process variability and to increase the specific surface area, further optimization of the fabrication process is required. Similarly, the deposition of defined alloy compositions will require further investigation, as the composition of electrolyte and deposited alloy do not directly correspond. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Besides free sugars, sweet sorghum stalks contain cellulose and hemicellulose that can be used for biofuel production. The pretreatment of stalks without the extraction of free sugars is more complicated than typical lignocelluloses, because of the degradation of free sugars during most pretreatment processes. In this study, the bioconversion of sweet sorghum stalks into biogas and bioethanol was studied using an improved organosolv pretreatment within a biorefinery framework. The organosolv pretreatment was developed using an aqueous solution of ethanol (EtOH) and isopropanol (IPOH). The process was optimized to obtain a liquor containing free sugars with the least sugar degradations together with a highly degradable solid fraction. The liquor was subjected to anaerobic digestion for biomethane production, while the solid was used for ethanol production via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The most influencing pretreatment parameters, i.e., temperature, time, alcohol to water ratio, EtOH to IPOH ratio, and the presence or absence of sulfuric acid (as a catalyst), were adjusted to achieve the highest yields of bioconversion. The maximum methane and ethanol production yields of 271.2 mL CH4/g VS and 87.8% (equal to the gasoline equivalent of 0.170 and 0.241 L/kg, respectively) were achieved from the liquor and pretreated solid, respectively; however, they were obtained at different optimum conditions. Considering the biorefinery perspective, the highest gasoline equivalent of 0.249 L/kg was efficiently obtained from the whole process after pretreatment at 140 °C for 30 min using 60:20 EtOH/IPOH ratio in the presence of 1% sulfuric acid. Further analyses, including enzymatic adsorption/desorption, compositional analysis, FTIR, and SEM, were conducted to investigate the effects of this newly developed pretreatment on the substrate. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In dealing with lignocellulosic and algal biomass, thermal acid hydrolysis is an economical and efficient method. In this process, 5-hydroxy-methylfurfural (5-HMF) is formed unavoidably, which inhibits downstream reducing sugar fermentation. Fortunately, 5-HMF can be biotransformed into 2,5-furan-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), the top 14 biomass platform molecules. Base on the connection between 5-HMF removal and FDCA production, microbes capable of biotransforming 5-HMF into FDCA are beneficial to raise biofuel yield and potential molecule production. In this research, pure strain Methylobacterium radiotolerans G-2 capable of transforming 5-HMF into FDCA was enriched and isolated from local campus soil, and its abilities of 5-HMF biotransformation and FDCA production were characterized. Strain M. radiotolerans G-2 could completely transform 1000 mg/L 5-HMF into FDCA with maximum concentration of 513.9 mg/L at an initial pH of 7 at 26°C. Algal acid hydrolysate after two-fold dilution was suitable for strain M. radiotolerans G-2 to perform 5-HMF biotransformation, and 459.7 mg/L FDCA could be obtained. Interestingly, strain M. radiotolerans G-2 did not significantly consume reducing sugar and reducing sugar consuming efficiency was less than 16%. © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - The oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of raw bio-oil (obtained by fast pyrolysis of pine sawdust) has been studied on a Rh/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst under a wide range of operating conditions (600-750 °C; steam-to-carbon molar ratio, 3-9; oxygen-to-carbon molar ratio, 0.34; space time, 0.15-0.6 gcatalyst h/gbio-oil) in order to delimit the suitable conditions for high and stable H2 production. The runs were conducted in a two-step system provided with a thermal step (at 500 °C) for bio-oil vaporization and pyrolytic lignin retention, followed by an online catalytic reforming step in a fluidized bed reactor. The spent catalyst was characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation, temperature-programmed reduction, and transmission electron microscopy in order to ascertain the causes of deactivation and the effect of the reaction conditions on these causes. The evolution with time on stream of both bio-oil oxygenates conversion and yields of reaction products shows different periods and catalyst states, with two sharp changes associated with different catalyst deactivation causes: (i) change in the states of Rh species and aging of the support (with fast dynamics) and (ii) coke deposition (at low temperature) or Rh sintering (at high temperature, with slow dynamics). © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The potential application of rice husk ash (RH26) as support for the immobilization of a recombinant Rhizopus oryzae (rROL) lipase as biocatalyst in the enzymatic biodiesel production using alperujo oil and the comparison with commercial hydrophobic support OD403 (RelOD) has been made. Although the specific activity (UA mg support−1) was around one-half lower in RH26 than in RelOD when they were used as biocatalyst in biodiesel reaction, the normalized initial rate was similar, between 1.6 and 2.4 μmol FAME mL−1 mL−1 UA−1. Thus in terms of biocatalysis performance, rice husk as is an alternative to commercial supports. However, the main problem is the more complex recovery of RH26 for the reutilization compared with commercial ones. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A novel strategy that combines steam reforming of bio-oil and recovering waste heat from blast furnace (BF) slag was proposed, and the thermodynamic characterizations of steam reforming of bio-oil model compounds recovering waste heat from BF slag for hydrogen production were investigated. When temperature ranged from 600 to 700 °C, hydrogen yield and its component reached maximum, about 100 mol kg−1 bio-oil model compounds and 70%, respectively. The higher mole ratio of steam to carbon in bio-oil (S/C), the higher hydrogen yield and its component were obtained, but according to the practical process, the most suitable S/C was 4. The ordinary pressure (1 bar) was considered as the optimum pressure for steam reforming of bio-oil model compounds recovering waste heat from BF slag. At lower temperatures (below 500 °C), BF slag could promote hydrogen yield, but it slightly decreased equilibrium yield of hydrogen at the optimal conditions. Besides, BF slag could promote hydrogen component at lower temperatures (below 600 °C), but it had little effect at the optimal conditions. Solid carbon should be reduced during steam reforming of bio-oil compounds recovering waste heat from BF slag. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - In the study, biochar was easily produced from bio-oil distillation residue through a tube furnace at a broad induction temperature range of 200–700 °C under nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The comparative evolution of biochar was characterized by evaluating its physicochemical properties including elements, calorific values, functional groups, graphitization degree and thermal stability. The results showed that compared with nitrogen atmosphere, carbon dioxide first contributed to biochar yield. After 600 °C, biochar yield in carbon dioxide dropped rapidly, while nitrogen had little effect on biochar yield. Through bomb calorimeter, the maximum calorific value of biochar was 34.13 MJ·kg−1 at 200 °C under carbon dioxide. Based on elements analysis, O/C, H/C and N/C of biochar induced by nitrogen were higher than those of carbon dioxide. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) indicated that induction temperature and atmosphere selectively affected the evolution of biochar functional groups. C[dbnd]O stretching vibration in carbon dioxide was more durable than that in nitrogen, whereas the stretching vibration of –CH2 and C–C had opposite phenomenon. In addition to 200 °C, the biochar under nitrogen possessed less graphitization with temperature increasing by Raman spectra analysis. Furthermore, the biochar induced by nitrogen was more stable than that induced by carbon dioxide according to the thermogravimetric analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Effect of reaction variables of in situ transesterification on the biodiesel production, and the characteristic differences of biodiesel obtained from aerobic granular sludge (AG) and algae-bacteria granular consortia (AAG) were investigated. The results indicated that the effect of variables on the biodiesel yield decreased in the order of methanol quantity > catalyst concentration > reaction time, yet the parameters change will not significantly affect biodiesel properties. The maximum biodiesel yield of AAG was 66.21 ± 1.08 mg/g SS, what is significant higher than that of AG (35.44 ± 0.92 mg/g SS). Although methyl palmitate was the dominated composition of biodiesel obtained from both granules, poly-unsaturated fatty acid in the AAG showed a higher percentage (21.86%) than AG (1.2%) due to Scenedesmus addition. Further, microbial analysis confirmed that the composition of biodiesel obtained from microbial granules was also determined by bacterial community, and Xanthomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae were the dominant bacteria of AG and AAG, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste cooking oil, which can be used as a raw material for biodiesel fuel (BDF), contains two kinds of oil components: triglycerides (TGs) and free fatty acids (FFAs). Therefore, both alkaline-type and acid-type catalysts are needed to produce BDF from waste cooking oil. In this study, an alkaline-type grafted fibrous catalyst bearing OH- ions was synthesized by radiation-induced emulsion grafting of 4-chloromethylstyrene onto a polyethylene-coated polypropylene (PE/PP) nonwoven fabric, amination with trimethylamine, and further treatment with NaOH. Furthermore, an acid-type catalyst bearing H+ ions was synthesized by radiation-induced emulsion grafting of ethyl p-styrenesulfonate onto a PE/PP nonwoven fabric, saponification with NaOH, and protonation with HNO3. The OH- and H+ densities of the grafted fibrous catalysts were controlled by the grafting yield. The maximum OH- and H+ densities of the catalysts were 3.6 mmol-OH-/g-catalyst and 3.4 mmol-H+/g-catalyst, respectively. The performances of the catalysts were evaluated in the batchwise transesterification of TGs and ethanol, and the batchwise esterification of FFAs and ethanol. In both cases, TGs and FFAs were gradually converted into BDF. The mixed oil and four actual waste cooking oils, which contained both TGs and FFAs, were completely converted into BDF by sequential catalytic reactions with the acid-type grafted fibrous catalyst and then the alkaline-type grafted fibrous catalyst. © 2017

AB  - Biodiesels have come up as a very strong alternative for diesel fuel. Biodiesels such as Jatropha Oil Methyl Ester (JOME) are comparable in performance with that of the diesel engine. The thermal efficiency of engines fuelled with biodiesels was found lower than conventional diesel fuel but due to the bio-origin, the emission characteristics are much better. However, biodiesel increases the NOx emissions as these are rich in oxygen, hence nanoparticles are used in this experiment to curb the high temperatures and reduce the NOx formation. The experiment on naturally aspired diesel engine was conducted with four prepared test fuels other than neat diesel and neat biodiesel. The 50 and 150 of alumina nanoparticles were added separately to the pure diesel and pure Jatropha biodiesel to form the nano emulsions using ultrasonicator.

AB  - The advent of novel carbonaceous nanomaterials (CMs) associated with microalgae paved an alternate way for the bioeconomic production of biofuels as well as high value added compounds. Herein, we for the first time, present a holistic approach for sustainable biomass and lipid production from Chlorella pyrenoidosa, wherein CMs, namely N-doped carbon nanosheets (CNS) and N-doped graphene nanosheets (NGS) were used as one of the algal growth supporting factors. Doping carbon nanomaterials with nitrogen can effectively tune its electronic structure and other intrinsic properties for efficient photocatalysis. The utilization of CNS and NGS in this process lead to rapid, environment friendly, and facile assimilation of biomass and lipids for the development of nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and other bioenergy associated applications. Employing a suite of characterization methods, the intrinsic structural and morphological properties of CMs were revealed. Compared with control, the lipid content obtained in the presence of undoped carbonized carbon materials (CCM), CNS, and NGS were found to be around 1.5-, 2-, and 6-fold higher, respectively, at similar growth conditions. We, therefore, envisage that graphitic nitrogen rich NGS plays a pivotal role in enhancing the lipid production from algae. This finding, therefore, exhibits a promising potential to bring about a paradigm shift in the field of bioenergy frameworks. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of biomass is praised as an efficient and feasible process to selectively convert lignocellulosic biomass into bio-fuels and bio-chemicals. Pith of sugarcane bagasse could be an attractive lignocellulosic waste from depithing process from pulp and paper mill, which can utilize for production of biofuel and added value products. In this study, we employed a tandem micro-reactor coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy to investigate the products distribution from pith of sugarcane bagasse via catalytic fast pyrolysis. In the operating conditions, pyrolysis temperature and HZSM-5 catalyst had significant effect on products and distributions. An increase in the pyrolysis temperature from 400°C to 550°C led to an increase in the yield of phenolic compounds (6.3%, w/w%), followed decrease at higher temperature. The maximum carboxylic acids (10.6%) and furfural (3.5%) were obtained at lower temperature. At presence of HZSM-5 catalyst, the selectivity of aromatics such as benzene, toluene, indene, and naphthalene were improved. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We report the development of a two-step pyrolytic fractionation approach that is especially applicable to processing oleaginous algae feed stocks. The first step is a low-temperature pyrolysis (T ∼ 300-320 °C) to produce bio-oils from degradation of protein and carbohydrate fractions. Solid residues left behind can subsequently be subjected to a second higher temperature pyrolysis (T ∼ 420-430 °C) to volatilize and/or degrade triglycerides to produce fatty acids, their derivatives, and long chain hydrocarbons. Thus, pyrolytic fractionation can be used to "fractionate" oleaginous biomass and separately recover triglyceride degradation products. Proof-of-concept micropyrolyzer and subsequent lab-scale fixed-bed experiments were performed using oleaginous Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. to demonstrate the pyrolytic fractionation technique and determine bio-oil yields. As expected, triglyceride-specific bio-oils were rich in hydrocarbons and free fatty acids, were nearly free of water, short-chain organic acids, and other carbohydrate degradation products, and had low N-content. Due to production of "high quality" triglyceride-specific bio-oil vapors, pyrolytic fractionation would allow product upgrading via in situ gas-phase catalytic processes to generate drop-in fuels (hydrocarbons) or specialty chemicals (e.g., fatty amides), without the need to condense the vapors. A conceptual process design is developed and energy requirements for pyrolytic fractionation are assessed and discussed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - With the increased availability of low-cost natural gas (NG), co-conversion of natural gas and biomass-to-liquid (GBtL) fuels has gained interest from industry and the U.S. Department of Energy due to the potential to improve liquid fuel yields while lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this article, we explore the conceptual process design and cost comparison of liquid biofuels using both biomass-derived gas intermediates and natural gas, as well as studies on quantification and assessment of sustainability metrics including life cycle/GHG emissions. Additionally, we have performed sensitivity analysis to understand the impact from variations of the biomass-to-NG ratio, design assumptions, and NG prices on process economics. This is to understand key cost drivers, parameters influencing the environment, and to discover opportunities to optimize the use of NG along with biomass. Our analysis shows that different blending ratios of natural gas/biomass have a large effect on the economic and environmental performance of the GBtL fuels. Co-processing NG enables the economic feasibility of converting biomass to the liquid fuel but at the expense of environmental sustainability. This study determined that the maximum amount of NG that can be blended with biomass would be 28% to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) GHG emission targets for advanced fuels, with a resulting minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $2.75 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE). In addition, the paper demonstrates the impact of the co-conversion operation on equipment design, raw materials, utility consumption, and overall process economic performance for the GBtL system. A secondary outcome: This study shows that renewable liquid fuel could be cost competitive with fossil-derived liquid fuel if further improvements and optimizations could be made to blending ratios of NG, optimization of heat integration of the process, and reduction of excess hydrogen and excess electricity production. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Ferrocene-functionalized polyethylenimine and multiwalled carbon nanotubes were attached covalently by glutaraldehyde onto a carbon cloth to develop an immobilized enzyme (glucose oxidase) electrode for biofuel cell applications. Developed enzymatic anode was characterized by electrochemical methods to determine electrochemical performance. Anodic open-circuit potential was measured as within 0–20 mV range. Cyclic voltammetry showed anodic peak for glucose oxidation around 400–600 mV (vs. sat. Ag/AgCl) varying with scan rate. An enzyme fuel cell with 2.5 mg/cm2 glucose oxidase-loaded bioanode and 0.70 mg/cm2 Pt-loaded cathode attached to Nafion™ 115 membrane has provided around 2.5 mA/cm2 current density at short-circuit conditions. Enzymatic kinetic parameters of prepared anode were determined by electrochemical methods that surprisingly indicated less KM (i.e., better substrate affinity) than that of determined by conventional enzymatic methods. Enzymatic stability determined by electrochemical methods moreover indicated longer enzyme half-life. © 2017 Curtin University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The conversion of carboxylic acid through ketonization process reduces O-atoms and increases C[sbnd]C bonds, which can provide attractive routes for upgrading biomass feedstocks into biofuels. The key factors influencing the surface ketonization activity over CeO2-based oxides catalysts remain matters of active discourse. Here, a series of Ce1-xFexO2-δ catalysts were investigated for vapor-phase ketonization of acetic and propionic acid. The catalysts were characterized in detail using various physico-chemical techniques both before and after reaction to gain understanding of the ketonization process. The turnover frequency (TOF) based on the basic sites changed with the Fe content. The Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-δ sample showed the prominent ketonization activity with the highest TOF value. On one hand, for samples with a lower Fe addition (x &lt; 0.3), the formed CeO2-like solid solution with numerous Ce-O-Fe species showed a dramatic increase in surface oxygen vacancies. These oxygen vacancies were beneficial to catalytic performance. Moreover, the superior redox properties with weaken M[sbnd]O bonds of Ce-O-Fe species thereby promote the ketonization activity. On the other hand, the higher Fe addition (x &gt; 0.3) caused the damage of the Ce-O-Fe structure, thus reducing ketonization activity. Notably, the investigation of the reaction temperature regime of Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-δ sample directly proved the existence of surface redox cycle during the ketonization process. © 2017

AB  - The search for beneficial biofuels with positive energy gains and reduced carbon dioxide emissions is a key target of the road transportation sector. This work focuses on alternative fuels for fossil fuel substitution in the transportation sector and we have examined the production of three different types of synthetic fuels: Dimethyl Ether, Synthetic Natural Gas and the diesel fraction of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis products. We analyze different pathways to make green synthetic fuels starting from waste carbon dioxide recovered from various sources and residual biomass. Processes for biofuel production that combine high temperature co-electrolysis in a solid oxide electrolysis cell (supplied with renewable electricity) to a downstream catalytic reactor that upgrades further the electrolysis-derived syngas are investigated. The integrated co-electrolysis catalytic upgrade is a way to “recycle” CO2 to either a gas or liquid fuel depending on the selected catalytic route. We have considered two different sources for waste carbon dioxide recovery: the CO2-rich off-gas of biogas-to-biomethane plants and CO2 that could be available from fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture. Residual biomass is the other CO2 source analyzed in this work. Fuel demand and, the CO2 and renewable electricity resources available on a regional scale have been assessed to develop a case study of synthetic fuels production in Italy. Results show how synfuel production from biogas off-gas and residual biomass allow to cover a limited percentage of the overall fuel demand (ranging from 1.5% to 37% depending on the synfuel), while using carbon dioxide recovered from fossil power plants could potentially provide enough synfuel to cover completely the fuel demand using Dimethyl Ether or Synthetic Natural Gas. However, an increase of renewable electricity would be needed (ranging from 50% to a three-fold increase depending on the synfuel). Finally, the impact of fuel substitution on the overall carbon dioxide emissions has been investigated showing that a complete substitution of fossil fuels using synfuels produced from waste recovered CO2 could lead to an emission reduction of almost 40% with respect to the current fossil fuel dominated scenario. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The significance of mileage to the fruitful operation of a trucking organization cannot be downplayed. Fuel is one of the biggest variable expenses in a trucking wander. An attempt is made in this research to improve the combustion efficiency of a diesel engine for better fuel economy by introducing hydroxy gas which is also called browns gas or HHO gas in the suction line, without compromising performance and emission. Brown’s gas facilitates the air-fuel mixture to ignite faster and efficient combustion. By considering safety and handling issues in automobiles, HHO gas generation by electrolysis of water in the presence of sodium bicarbonate electrolytes (NaHCO3) and usage was explored in this research work over compressed pure hydrogen, due to generation and capacity of immaculate hydrogen as of now confines the application in diesel engine operation. Brown’s gas was utilized as a supplementary fuel in a single-cylinder, four-stroke compression ignition (CI) engine. Experiments were carried out on a constant speed engine at 1500 rpm, result shows at constant HHO flow rate of 0.73 liter per minute (LPM), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreases by 7% at idle load to 16% at full load, and increases brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 8.9% at minimum load to 19.7% at full load. In the dual fuel (diesel +HHO) operation, CO emissions decreases by 19.4, 64.3, and 34.6% at 25, 50, and 75% load, respectively, and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions decreased by 11.3% at minimum load to 33.5% at maximum load at the expense of NOx emission increases by 1.79% at 75% load and 1.76% at full load than neat diesel operation. The negative impact of an increase in NOx is reduced by adding EGR. It was evidenced in this experimental work that the use of Brown’s gas with EGR in the dual fuel mode in a diesel engine improves the fuel efficiency, performance, and reduces the exhaust emissions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Hydrotreating technique is one of the most promising method for producing high quality of biofuels from plant oils. Here, the non-esculent rice bran oil was subjected to hydrotreatment in a high pressure cata-test unit, using sulfided NiMo/Al2O3, catalyst, under various pressures, temperatures and liquid hourly space velocities. The influence of each of these factors on the qualities and quantities of the acquired products was investigated, and the operating conditions were optimized. Evaluation of the final product was made on basis of its fuel characteristics, and compared with those of the raw oil. The results revealed the significant improvement of the physicochemical properties of the hydrotreated product to become very close, or may be better than those derived from petroleum sources. © 2018

AB  - Sugars derived from biomass hemicelluloses, especially pentoses, have low value because they are generally not suitable for industrial fermentation processes. In contrast, dehydration of xylose, one of the main constituents of hemicelluloses, yields furfural. The dehydration process is relatively simple, and furfural has several applications mainly in the polymer and lubricant industries. Moreover, chemical upgrade of furfural can yield 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and ethyl levulinate (EL), two chemicals that can be used as fuel additives in gasoline and diesel, respectively. In this work, three chemical upgrading routes for furfural were proposed and simulated based on process data available in the literature. The economic analysis showed the feasibility of producing MTHF in a two-step hydrogenation process, in four geographic regions (Brazil, China, European Union, and the United States). The maximum furfural price to allow profits at a minimum acceptable rate of return of 10% is $457 Mg−1. On the other hand, the conversion of furfural to ethyl levulinate is not economically attractive mainly because of its lower energy density, which resulted in a low selling price. This study also discussed the need for new catalysts to avoid high hydrogen to furfural ratios while enabling hydrogenation at high pressures. These operating conditions were found to be major technoeconomic hurdles for the chemical upgrade of biomass-derived furfural to MTHF and EL. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A techno-economic assessment of a novel biorefinery concept is carried out. It combines the hydrotreatment of vegetable oils (HEFA) with a power-to-gas (PTG) unit that provides the required hydrogen. Several scenarios are examined: the electricity supply for the PTG unit is varied from a grid-based supply to a renewable island solution; the hydrogen supply is varied from a PTG unit to conventional steam reforming; the utilised vegetable oil is varied from jatropha to rapeseed, palm and used cooking oil; the main product is varied from jet fuel to diesel. The HEFA-plant is assumed to process 500 kt of vegetable oil annually. In the reference scenario, jatropha oil is used as feedstock producing 227 kt a−1 of jet fuel. Per ton of processed oil, 1910 kWhel are used to produce 35.7 kg of hydrogen required for its treatment. By using different vegetable oils, both hydrogen demand and fuel output vary in a range of about ±10%. The overall energetic efficiency towards jet fuel is 41.6%. With a bandwidth between 1295 and 1800 EUR t−1 of jet fuel, the specific production costs are three to four times higher than the market price for fossil jet fuel. Operating the refinery in diesel-mode could lower the production costs by ca. 30%. More high-value, long-chained fuels are produced this way due to a lower cracking rate compared to the jet-mode. Investments of around 132 million EUR are required for the HEFA-plant in all scenarios. Investments for the PTG-plant lie around 82 million EUR if there is a constant electricity supply from the grid. They reach 246 million EUR if electricity is supplied in an island-solution based on fluctuating renewables demanding much higher hydrogen production and storage capacities. Total investments in the biorefinery reach 378 million EUR in this case. Despite high capital costs, the largest cost item is vegetable oil – similarly to a conventional HEFA plant. Supporting policy instruments such as subsidies or quotas for renewable jet fuel seem indispensable for an introduction of the PTG-HEFA technology in the short to medium term. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The energy requirements are globally on a rapid escalation, as technology advances, which is also true for a developing country like Nigeria, which is dependent on fossil fuels and its derivatives. Apart from its adverse effect on its economy, it has also negative impacts on the health and the environment, in general. However, investments in renewable energy are faced by the competitive oil prices, the very high investment cost for renewable energy, and high local electricity prices. This paper appraises the attractiveness of investing in renewable energy sources over the continued use of non-edible oil for electricity generation. Methods: This paper explores the application of biomass seed oil to produce a renewable fuel (biodiesel) using heterogeneous base catalyst. Meanwhile, two-step processes were employed to produce the biofuel. In the first step (esterification), the acid value of the oil was reduced to the recommended limit (FFA ≤ 1.5) using H2SO4, while in the second step (transesterification), the catalyst calcination of grounded Brette Pearl Spar Mable (BPSM) pre-soaked in methanol was used as a biobase for biodiesel production. For the optimization, minitab response surface (MRS) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to model and optimize the process variables responsible for the optimum production of the oil and the biodiesel. Results: The result presented showed that T. peruviana seed was found to be rich in oil with an average yield of 44.00% (w/w), and the oil was highly unsaturated with a high FFA. The maximum experimental biodiesel yield obtained was 86.00% at a catalyst amount of 4 g, a reaction time of 70 min, and a methanol/oil ratio of 0.1(v/v). This result was validated in triplicate under the same conditions, which yielded 85.70% (v/v) for MRS and 85.98% (v/v) for ANN. Furthermore, the optimization results also indicated that the p values (p &lt; 0.05) of the model terms were significant, and the accuracy of the models achieved by MRS and ANN based on R2 depict that both optimization tools gave good predictions of R2 (MRS: R2 = 99.98% and ANN: R2 = 99.97%). The properties of the biodiesel, as described in other earlier reports using the same feedstock with different catalysts, indicated that the produced biodiesel had properties which agreed to those reported in the literature. Conclusions: T. peruviana seed has proved to be a good biomass raw material for oil production, and its conversion to biofuel using a heterogeneous biobase catalyst showed its suitability as a renewable environmental friendly fuel. Government should invest in more sustainable sources of energy by imposing law for the use of non-edible oil or decreasing the price of electricity. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Continuous measurements of ambient aerosols were performed with a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer in Nanjing during all four seasons of 2015. Ambient particles were clustered into 11 classes, which included elemental carbon (EC) mainly with sulfate (EC-S); EC with nitrate and sulfate (EC-SN); EC with obvious organic signals (ECOC); organic carbon (OC); biomass/biofuel burning particles (Biomass); Ammonium; particles with obvious Na, K (NaK) and sulfate (NaK-S), NaK with nitrate and sulfate (NaK-SN); iron-containing particles (Fe-rich); miscellaneous metal-containing particles (MiscsMetals) and Dust. Seasonal local sources, dominated air masses and distinct atmospheric processes all affected the concentrations of various particles and caused different diurnal changes. EC-SN during summer slowly increased in the afternoon and NaK-SN had a peak at noon during winter. Differences in size distribution of each particle type between seasons were discussed. All types of particles showed unimodal number size distributions, their peak radius ranked as follows: fall &lt; spring &lt; summer ≤ winter. OC during fall had higher number fractions of between 0.2 and 0.5 μm (&gt;20%) as a result from the decrease in temperature and increase in relative humidity (RH). The distributions of ECOC varied with seasons and were obviously influenced by EC and OC particles. Mixing states showed seasonal variations. In general, the fractions of particles mixed with secondary species were the highest/lowest in winter/fall. The effects of meteorological conditions on particles were investigated. With the increase of RH, the fractions of EC increased, and most particles mixed with more NH4 + and less C2H3O+. Characteristics of precipitation, such as duration and total rainfall amount, influenced particles. Enhanced secondary organic/inorganic species were found in particles during long-/short-term precipitation with intensities &lt;1 mm. Less NH4 +, C2H3O+ and HSO4 − were found during precipitation compared with non-precipitation days. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the use of carnauba straw residue to produce cellulosic ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with three industrial yeasts was investigated. Hydrothermal (HT), alkaline (AL), and acid-alkaline (AA) pretreatments were carried out on the residues, and the efficiency of the enzymatic hydrolysis of these residues was evaluated. The SSF was performed using Saccharomyces cerevisiae UFLA CA11, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CAT-1, and Kluyveromyces marxianus ATCC-36907 at 35, 40, and 45 °C. The AL pretreatment resulted in the best removal of lignin and hemicellulose. In addition, enzymatic hydrolysis of the dry residue treated with AL converted 64.43% of the lignocellulosic biomass to sugars. SSF of the AL-pretreated residue using Kluyveromyces marxianus ATCC-36907 cultivated at 45 °C produced 7.53 g/L ethanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Pretreatment of biomass to maximize the recovery of fermentable sugars as well as to minimize the amount of enzyme inhibitors formed during the pretreatment is a challenge in biofuel process. We develop a modified Fenton pretreatment in a mixed solvent (water/DMSO) to combine the advantages of organosolv and Fenton pretreatments. The hemicellulose and cellulose in corncob were effectively degraded into xylose, glucose, and soluble glucose oligomers in a few hours. This saccharide solution, separated from the solid lignin simply by filtration, can be directly applied to the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol fermentation. Results: After the pretreatment, 94% carbohydrates were recovered as soluble monosaccharide (xylose and glucose) and glucose oligomers in the filtrates, and 87% of solid lignin was recovered as the filter residue. The filtrates were directly applied to enzymatic hydrolysis, and 92% of raw corncob glucose was recovered. The hydrolysates containing the glucose and xylose from the enzymatic hydrolysis were directly applied to ethanol fermentation with ethanol yield equals 79% of theoretical yield. The pretreatment conditions (130 °C, 1.5 bar; 30 min to 4 h) are mild, and the pretreatment reagents (H2O2, FeCl3, and solvent) had low impact to environment. Using ferrimagnetic Fe3O4 resulted in similar pretreatment efficiency and Fe3O4 could be removed by filtration. Conclusions: A modified Fenton pretreatment of corncob in DMSO/water was developed. Up to 94% of the carbohydrate content of corncob was recovered as a saccharide solution simply by filtration. Such filtrate was directly applied to the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and where 92% of the corncob glucose content was obtained. The hydrolysate so obtained was directly applied to ethanol fermentation with good fermentability. The pretreatment method is simple, and the additives and solvents used have a low impact to the environment. This method provides the opportunity to substantially maximize the carbohydrate and solid lignin recovery of biomass with a comparatively green process, such that the efficiency of biorefinery as well as the bioethanol production process can be improved. The pretreatment is still relatively energy intensive and expensive, and further optimization of the process is required in large-scale operation. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The environmental problems caused by emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels are increasing the demand for renewable and sustainable energy sources. Biofuels from microalgae, also known as third generation biofuels, promises to be an alternative to substitute the fossil fuels. One of steps to improve the microalgae biofuel production is the optimization of the microalgae production rate. This work applied the Taguchi's method to improve the culture conditions into bubble column photobioreactors in order to maximize biomass and fatty acids productivity by marine microalgae Chlorella minutissima. The independent variables taken into account were carbon dioxide percentage, nitrate concentration, phosphate concentration, supplementation of metals and vitamins, temperature and salinity. The microalgae kinetic growth tacked into account the logistic model. The fatty acids productivity for the best condition was compared with other microalgae cultures in the batch bubble-column photobioreactors presented in literature and the results showed the highest productivity of palmitic acid and a good productivity of stearic acid, important fatty acids to biodiesel formulations. Thus, the methodology and the results presented in this study may be useful for further studies aiming the economic feasibility of microalgae biofuels production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Selective conversion of carbohydrates to fuels and fine chemicals is of great importance for biorefinery. However, development of efficient solid acidic catalysts which perform stably for this process is still challenging. Herein, we reported a novel carbon-based solid acidic catalyst, prepared via hydrothermal carbonization of glucose followed by magnetization of Fe3O4 and sulfonation of H2SO4, which can serve as an efficient and recyclable catalyst in the catalytic dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and subsequent etherification of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) with ethanol from various carbohydrates. The effects of reaction conditions (temperature, time, solvents, catalyst amount, and γ-valerolactone (GVL) concentration) were optimized affording to a maximum EMF yield of 67.4 % at 120 °C, 55 wt % catalyst loading based on starting fructose and 60 vol.% of GVL in ethanol after 24 h of reaction. Noticeably, GVL promotes the formation of EMF and HMF reducing the extent of side reactions. Recycling experiments showed that the catalyst could be easily separated with a magnet and reused up to 4 consecutive times without significant loss of activity. The present work opens a way to synthesize reusable and cost-effective solid acidic catalysts from biomass wastes and may contribute to a holistic approach for biomass valorization. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - We carried out oligomerization of ethylene using nickel supported on an acidic zeolite β (Ni-Hβ) catalyst in a laboratory-scale packed bed reactor for the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons in milliliter quantities. We evaluated the effect of several process variables (temperature, pressure, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), and nickel loading) on the ethylene conversion, liquid hydrocarbon/coke yield, and oligomeric product selectivity. Increases in pressure resulted in higher ethylene conversion, leading to a liquid yield of 13.0 wt%, with 10.0 wt% coke at 65 bar. As the pressure increased to 65 bar, the selectivity towards octenes reached 10%, along with a decrease in C4 to 34%, which suggested that higher pressures promoted butene dimerization. Under the conditions studied, a minimum temperature of 120 °C was required to produce liquid hydrocarbons. The liquid yield increased with temperature, with a maximum of 17.0 wt% at 190 °C. Higher temperatures led to the formation of odd-numbered oligomers primarily due to acid-catalyzed cracking reactions. In the range of WHSV tested, a moderate 2.0 h−1 resulted in a local maximum of 10.6 wt% of liquid hydrocarbon yield. A moderate nickel loading of 3.4 wt% also resulted in the highest liquid yield (10.6 wt%) out of the three loadings tested. The results strongly suggest that the ionic form of nickel is much more active catalytically than the NiO form. The variation in nickel loading revealed the importance of having a synergistic balance of nickel and acid sites on the catalyst to maximize ethylene conversion and maintain high liquid hydrocarbon yield. The results from this work formed the basis for pilot scale runs carried out at the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI) for the Advanced Hardwood Biofuels (AHB) project. The pilot runs highlighted the need for efficient removal of ethanol from the ethylene feed after the dehydration process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of biofuels from renewable biomass resources is an attractive way to mitigate CO2 emissions and alleviate the shortage of fossil fuels. A novel green one-pot synthesis of biodiesel from Ricinus communis seeds by basic heterogeneous catalysis is reported in this work. The direct transesterification (one-step process) of the seeds with methanol in the presence of homogeneous (HCl and NaOH) or heterogeneous (Na2ZrO3) catalysts was evaluated. Additionally, the comparison of the conventional (two-step process) transesterification against the direct transesterification reaction was analysed. The conventional transesterification of Ricinus communis oil with acidic (HCl/CH3OH, 5% v/v) and basic (NaOH/CH3OH, 5% w/w) homogeneous catalysts showed conversions of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) &gt; 97% at 6 h and 3 h, respectively. Moreover, direct transesterification was carried out using a basic Na2ZrO3 catalyst. The maximum FAME yield was 99.99% at 4 h of reaction time and 5 wt % catalyst. Finally, Green Metrics Parameters of biodiesel showed that heterogeneous direct transesterification resulted in a seven times greener synthesis compared to conventional process. This novel heterogeneous one-step process is almost ten times less hazardous than the conventional process and five times less harmful than the homogeneous one-step reaction. No n-hexane is required for oil extraction. Thus, methanol as a reactant and as a solvent increased the greenness of the heterogeneous process, and the resulting biodiesel shows good purity and composition. In addition, no water is required to purify the biodiesel. According to these results, heterogeneous direct transesterification is a promising alternative for more sustainable, cleaner and efficient biodiesel production that is crucial to developing new technologies (by chemo-selectivity). © 2018

AB  - To obtain a clearer understanding of the catalytic bio-oil reforming mechanism, we performed density functional theory calculations on the decomposition of formic acid over a stepped Ni surface. Formic acid was selected as a model bio-oil compound. Fourteen elementary reactions were considered. All the zero-point-energy corrected activation energies and reaction energies were obtained. The kinetic parameters of the reaction rate constants and thermodynamic equilibrium constants in the temperature range of 300–1000 K were revealed. COOH formation and its subsequent dissociation are energetically easier than that of HCOO. When combined with kinetic modeling, the most preferable pathway for formic acid dissociation on the surface is HCOOH → COOH → CO. The rate-determining step is COOH dehydroxylation to CO, associating with an activation energy of 0.51 eV and a rate constant of 5.16 × 10 9 s −1 at 773 K. In addition, HCOO will be slowly accumulated on the surface as the temperature rises. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study is conducted to quantify the fossil energy input (FEI) and the global warming potential (GWP) of hydrogen production through iron-based chemical-looping process with CO2 capture using non-aqueous phase bio-oil (NAPB) from biomass fast pyrolysis as fuel. The eBalance software with Chinese Life Cycle Database is employed to implement this work based on the method of life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA results indicate NAPB production consumes the largest fossil energy and contributes the largest GWP while chemical-looping hydrogen production (CLHP) plays a critical role in lessening greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. The net FEI and the net GWP of hydrogen production is, respectively, 0.597 MJ and −0.0767 kg CO2, eq. per MJ hydrogen gas via the proposed production pathway, far below those of the conventional hydrogen production via natural gas steam reforming and coal gasification. The sensitivity analysis shows the data uncertainty of the discussed parameters except the electricity consumption for NAPB production has no significant impact on the net GWP. The chemical-looping process with CO2 capture may be a more promising option to sustainably produce hydrogen gas especially using renewable biomass as fuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Poplar is considered a suitable resource for production of renewable fuels and chemicals due to its rapid growth and tolerance to environmental stresses. Switchgrass is also extensively studied for biofuel production due to its use as a resource-efficient low-input plant and ability to grow and thrive in diverse weather or soil conditions. In this study, fast pyrolysis of biomass obtained from various parts (main stem, secondary stems, branches) of eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) was carried out in an inductively heated reactor. Devolatilization rates (ranging from 450 °C to 600 °C) were initially obtained to determine their decomposition kinetics and estimate process parameters (temperatures and times) suitable for their pyrolysis using this method of pyrolysis. The effect of temperature (450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C) on pyrolysis product yields and composition was investigated. Results indicate that activation energies ranged from 9.2 to 13.5 kJ/mol, while pre-exponential constants ranged from 0.23 to 0.51 s−1. The maximum quantity of bio-oil of 39.8% ± 9.50 was obtained from poplar stem at 450 °C whereas the least amount of bio-oil obtained was 33% ± 0.0085 from poplar branch at 550 °C. The highest amount of bio-oils from switchgrass (34% ± 0.023) was obtained at 450 °C. Water content in the bio-oil obtained from switchgrass was significantly higher than that from poplar. The GC–MS results showed that bio-oil compositions are similar among the various parts of poplar trees, with phenols being the dominant chemical specie and acids and alcohols present in negligible amounts. As temperature increases, an increase in furans is observed. Bio-oil and char fractions derived from stems have higher HHV than those from switchgrass, with the average HHV of char and water-free bio-oils ranging between 20.2 and 25.6 MJ/kg and 13.2 and −16.4 MJ/kg, respectively. Overall process energy recovery from initial biomass reached a maximum of 80.1% in the case of cottonwood main stem pyrolyzed at 500 °C. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of liquid biofuels (like bioethanol and biodiesel) to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector has generated a great deal of interest in the last few years, with particular attention being given to Jatropha methyl ester (JME). Jatropha curcas (Jc)—a species native to Mexico—shows some promise as a source of oil for biodiesel. A few studies on biodiesel production from Jc have been conducted in Mexico, but just one study involved a life cycle assessment (LCA) of JME. At the international level, most studies dealing with Jc focus on the biodiesel industrial process, while in this paper we also look in detail at the agricultural production phase. This case study provides preliminary results on GHG emissions and energy balances of JME production in Mexico, applying the LCA methodology recommended by the European Renewable Energy Directive (RED). Four production systems (JME 1–4) were studied, resulting in GHG mitigation of between 41 and 53% with regards to diesel if no direct land-use change (dLUC) change occurs. However, when accounting for GHG emissions arising from direct land-use change (dLUC), total emissions increase from 40 to 508 kg CO2e/GJ. The differences between dLUC on tropical dry forest and dLUC on grassland are of lesser importance than those between systems with and without dLUC. Using JME from plantations on lands, previously not cultivated, leads to GHG emissions three or six times higher than using fossil diesel. These results are an approximation to the environmental and energetic impacts of JME production in Mexico. Further studies should be performed before implementing more plantations to produce biofuel from J. curcas. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Previous research shows that alkali addition in entrained flow biomass gasification can increase char conversion and decrease tar and soot formation through catalysis. This paper investigates two other potential benefits of alkali addition: increased slag flowability and in situ sulfur capture. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations show that addition of 2–8% alkali catalyst to biomass completely changes the chemical domain of the gasifier slag phase to an alkali carbonate melt with low viscosity. This can increase feedstock flexibility and improve the operability of an entrained flow biomass gasification process. The alkali carbonate melt also leads to up to 90% sulfur capture through the formation of alkali sulfides. The resulting reduced syngas sulfur content can potentially simplify gas cleaning required for catalytic biofuel production. Alkali catalyst recovery and recycling is a precondition for the economic feasibility of the proposed process and is effected through a wet quench. It is shown that the addition of Zn for sulfur precipitation in the alkali recovery loop enables the separation of S, Ca and Mg from the recycle. For high Si and Cl biomass feedstocks, an alternative separation technology for these elements may be required to avoid build-up. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In order to improve the product quality and make the process more sustainable, lignin-based char was used as a catalyst during microwave co-pyrolysis of lignin and low density polyethylene (LDPE). Lignin-based char modification using zinc transition metal proved to be beneficial by improving the porosity and selectiveness of the prepared catalyst. General selectivity of lignin-based char catalyst was observed to produce bio-oil with high selectivity of valued compounds. GC/MS analysis proved that the major chemical components of the bio-oil were hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, phenols and guaiacols(∼70%). A central composite experimental design (CCD) was used to optimize the product yield and component composition. The optimum condition to produce the highest quantity and quality of bio-oil was 450 °C and 12.5% LDPE/lignin ratio. GC analysis of the syn-gas revealed that the valued compounds were H2, CO and CH4, the content of which was about 40%, 20% and 5%, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study focuses on the laboratory production of jet fuel from microalgae. In contrast with many studies that use partial nutrient starvation to boost lipid content of the species, physiological modification was undertaken under complete nutrient starvation for 3 days to increase lipid content beyond 80%. This was followed by biomass harvesting, which was necessary for downstream processes. Large amounts of biomass were achieved between day 8 and day 10 during the cultivation period, with temperatures ranging between 15 and 35 °C under constant luminance of 1000 lux and daily supply of CO2 for 15 days. It was found that Nannochloropsis sp. grew effectively between 15 °C and 25 °C with more biomass produced in the same temperature range. Conversion processes involved steps such as oil extraction, thermal cracking without catalyst at 300 °C and fractionation between 70 °C and 250 °C. The pyrolysis of bio-oil was also undertaken as a fast cracking process for the temperature ranging between 350 °C and 450 °C within 12 s. Some parameters such as flash point, net heat of combustion, sulfur, and viscosity complied with ASTM standards. Jet fuel from microalgae therefore shows potential despite many challenges related to cost effectiveness and sustainability. In order to obtain a bio-jet fuel that is completely compliant with ASTM standards, upgrading, reforming processes, and the use of additives will be needed more, especially for pilot and large-scale production once fuel sustainability is achieved. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Ni/AC (nickel on active carbon) catalysts with different Ni loadings were synthesized and studied for the decarboxylation and aromatization of oleic acid in the absence of H2 or hydrogen donors. Without the use of hydrogen source, the whole deoxygenation process became more economical. Moreover, oleic acid can be saturated using the H2 derived from the production of aromatics, which were also considered as the critical component in aviation biofuels. The structure and properties of the catalysts were investigated using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption of CH3COOH and CO. The experimental and characterization results revealed that 30% Ni/AC had a higher adsorption capacity of CH3COOH among the other Ni/AC catalysts and highly dispersed and small Ni particles, providing a heptadecane yield of 40.7%. It also contained 13.8% aromatics, which fulfills the requirement of aviation fuels. This Ni/AC catalyst showed good stability even after being reused thrice. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, a bioanode for biofuel cells was produced using a composite of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO) wherein SGO shows synergistic impact by going about as charge adjusting dopant and a conductive filler. The conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS alongside SGO fill in as a way to encourage electron transfer and co-immobilize the enzyme in the meantime. Extensive surface area controlled by SGO prompts high catalyst stacking and empowers to enhance the current density of the fuel cells. Ferritin additionally upgrades the transportation of electrons by going about as a redox mediator that effectively transfers electrons from enzyme to the conducting support. Examination of electrochemical execution of modified bioanode in presence of glucose was completed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at various scan rates (20–100 mV s−1) in 35 mM of glucose concentrations prepared in 0.3 M potassium ferrocyanide [K4Fe(CN)6] solution. The findings showed that current increases with increase in glucose concentration and anode displayed good electrocatalytic action with saturation current density of 27 ± 2 mA cm−2. © 2018 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd

AB  - A sequential two-step microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) of water hyacinth for hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil production is studied. This newly developed technique is characterized by microwave-assisted fast pyrolysis followed by catalytic upgrading using an additional catalyst packed bed, and it thus achieves the independent control of pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading. On the other hand, in order to minimize coke formation and promote hydrocarbon production in sequential two-step MACFP of water hyacinth, Ce-doped γ-Al2O3/ZrO2 composite mesoporous catalyst (CAZ) is synthesized and used in this study. The effects of catalyst type, pyrolysis temperature, catalytic upgrading temperature and catalyst reusability on product distribution and chemical compositions in bio-oil are investigated. The results demonstrate that water hyacinth is a good biomass candidate for fuel demand, and CAZ can facilitate the hydrocarbon fuel production in bio-oil and exhibits an excellent catalyst reusability. Meanwhile, it is found that the optimal temperatures for water hyacinth pyrolysis and pyrolytic vapor upgrading are 650 °C and 450 °C, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: When applied to recalcitrant lignocellulosic feedstocks, multi-stage pretreatments can provide more processing flexibility to optimize or balance process outcomes such as increasing delignification, preserving hemicellulose, and maximizing enzymatic hydrolysis yields. We previously reported that adding an alkaline pre-extraction step to a copper-catalyzed alkaline hydrogen peroxide (Cu-AHP) pretreatment process resulted in improved sugar yields, but the process still utilized relatively high chemical inputs (catalyst and H2O2) and enzyme loadings. We hypothesized that by increasing the temperature of the alkaline pre-extraction step in water or ethanol, we could reduce the inputs required during Cu-AHP pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis without significant loss in sugar yield. We also performed technoeconomic analysis to determine if ethanol or water was the more cost-effective solvent during alkaline pre-extraction and if the expense associated with increasing the temperature was economically justified. Results: After Cu-AHP pretreatment of 120 °C NaOH-H2O pre-extracted and 120 °C NaOH-EtOH pre-extracted biomass, approximately 1.4-fold more total lignin was solubilized (78% and 74%, respectively) compared to the 30 °C NaOH-H2O pre-extraction (55%) carried out in a previous study. Consequently, increasing the temperature of the alkaline pre-extraction step to 120 °C in both ethanol and water allowed us to decrease bipyridine and H2O2 during Cu-AHP and enzymes during hydrolysis with only a small reduction in sugar yields compared to 30 °C alkaline pre-extraction. Technoeconomic analysis indicated that 120 °C NaOH-H2O pre-extraction has the lowest installed ($246 million) and raw material ($175 million) costs compared to the other process configurations. Conclusions: We found that by increasing the temperature of the alkaline pre-extraction step, we could successfully lower the inputs for pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Based on sugar yields as well as capital, feedstock, and operating costs, 120 °C NaOH-H2O pre-extraction was superior to both 120 °C NaOH-EtOH and 30 °C NaOH-H2O pre-extraction. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, in order to increase the quality of life of people, energy usage has become very important. Researchers are constantly searching for new sources of energy due to increased energy demand. Engine tests are being conducted to investigate the feasibility of the new sources of energy such as alternative fuels. In the engine tests, engine performance, combustion characteristics and exhaust emissions are evaluated by obtaining the results. The effect of newly developed fuels on engine lifetime, safe transport and storage are also examined for fuel availability. In addition, the potential and the price of fuels are important in terms of sustainability. In these studies, laboratory environments are needed for experimental setups. It is difficult to determine the availability of the most suitable alternative fuel since numerous results are obtained in the engine tests and studies. This integrated model provides a great advantage in terms of time and cost. The physical and chemical properties of the fuel affect experimental results such as engine performance, combustion, and exhaust emission. The suggested model can be making the most efficient and eco-friendly fuel choice without the need for experimental studies by using physical and chemical properties of the fuel. It also can offer the best fuel for cost, safety and maintenance processes. In this study, animal fat biodiesel derived from waste animal fats and vegetable oil biodiesel produced from aspir-canola oils were investigated. Biodiesel fuels are mixed with diesel at 5%, 20%, and 50%, and nine different fuels prepared with three pure fuels, and six different fuel blends are compared. Before using these fuels in an experimental study, estimates are made about which fuels may be more advantageous in terms of many criteria. In the process, nine varied fuel specifications are taken as references such as calorific value, cetane number, oxygen content rate, fuel price, flash point, viscosity, lubricity, iodine number and water content. The criteria weights are determined with SWARA (Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) from multi-criteria decision-making models, and MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis) is ranked according to fuels' characteristics from the best to the worst. While theoretically, the best fuel is ultimately VOB20, VOB50 and AFB20 were selected as the second fuel and the third fuel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigated the environmental and economic sustainability of liquid hydrocarbon biofuel production via fast pyrolysis of poplar biomass through two pathways: a one-step pathway that converted poplar via fast pyrolysis only, and a two-step pathway that includes a torrefaction step prior to fast pyrolysis. Optimization of these fast pyrolysis-based biofuel processes were investigated through heat integration and alternative uses of the coproduct biochar, which can be sold as an energy source to displace coal, soil amendment or processed into activated carbon. The impacts of optimization on the cost of hydrocarbon biofuel production as well as the environmental impacts were investigated through a technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA), respectively, with two-step and one-step processing compared to fossil fuels. The TEA indicates that a one-step heat integrated pathway with the production of activated carbon has a minimum selling price of 3.23/gallon compared to 5.16/gallon for a two-step heat integrated process with burning of the coproduct biochar to displace coal. The LCA indicates that using the displacement analysis approach, a two-step heat integrated pathway had a global warming potential of -102 g CO2 equivalent/MJ biofuel compared to 16 CO2 equivalent/MJ biofuel for the heat integrated one-step pathway. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The following paper provides an overview of the potential uses of seaweeds derived both from artificial cultivation as well as from eutrophic reservoirs as the feedstock for biofuels production. This review presents biochemical (anaerobic digestion [AD] and fermentation), chemical (extraction and transesterification) and thermochemical conversions (combustion, liquefaction, gasification and pyrolysis) of seaweeds for biofuels with special attention being paid to seaweeds processing such as pretreatment techniques, production methods and experimental conditions, and so forth. Seaweeds are considered as a suitable source for biogas and bioethanol production due to their high carbohydrate content. This review explores also the possibility of the application of oil extracted from seaweeds for biodiesel production. Since the chemical composition of seaweeds significantly differs from land biomass, a new comprehensive approach is required. Many macroalgal components are recalcitrant to bioconversion and pose microbiological challenges. The text deals with advantages and disadvantages of seaweeds as a feedstock for biofuels. Since macroalgae exploitation only for energy production is too expensive, seaweed integrated biorefineries were proposed as a solution which enables a development of high-value algal bioproducts. Algae appear to be a promising source of biofuels. Utilization of waste algal biomass constitutes a link between the pollution abatement and energy production.

AB  - Acetic acid can be used as a model compound in the study of the steam reforming of the hydrophilic phase of bio-oil. In order to perform acetic acid reforming reactions, low cost catalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity are required. Thus, Ni–Mg–Al hydrotalcite derived catalysts emerge as a good alternative. In this work, four Ni–Mg–Al hydrotalcite type precursors were prepared, with different Ni/Mg molar ratios (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6). Various characterization tests have been performed for the prepared hydrotalcite type precursors. The stability of the catalytic activity was evaluated during 24 h and the used samples were submitted to a thermogravimetric analysis to evaluate carbon accumulation. Characterization tests proved that Ni/Mg ratios had a direct influence in the reducibility of the precursors. The Temperature-programmed surface reaction analysis showed that the steam reforming of acetic acid occurred majorly when the temperature reached 873 K. Stability test showed that precursors 04NiMg and 05NiMg had the best catalytic performance. It was also seen that sample 06NiMg suffered from deactivation by carbon deposition, which was confirmed by the thermogravimetric analysis. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Cell disruption is an integral part of microalga production process, which improves the release of intracellular products that are essential for biofuel production. In this work, pre-treatment parameters that will enhance the efficiency of lipid production using high-pressure homogenizer on microalgae biomass will be investigated. The high-pressure homogenizer that is considered is a GYB40-10S/GY60-6S; with a pre-treatment pressure of 1000 psi, 2000 psi, and 3000 psi, the number of passes; 1, 2, and 3, a reaction time of 3, 3.5, and 4 h. Pressure and cavitation increase the efficiency of the pre-treatment process of the homogenizer. In addition, homogenization shear force and pressure are the basic significant factors that enhance the efficiency of microalgae cell rupture. Also, the use of modelling to simulate pre-treatment processes (Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Box-Behnken Designs (BBD), and design of experiment (DOE) for process optimization will be adopted in this study. The results clearly demonstrate that high-pressure homogenization pre-treatment can effectively disrupt microalga cell walls to enhance lipid recovery efficiency, with a relatively short extraction time, both that are essential for maintaining a good quality of lipids for biofuel production. A maximum of 18% lipid yields were obtained after 3 h of HPH pre-treatment at 3000 psi. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Following the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP21 (Paris, France), several countries have attempted to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reach this objective, microalgae could be used to capture carbon dioxide and transform it into a biomass composed essentially of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. Moreover, cultivating microalgae does not require arable land, in opposition to several oleaginous plants used to produce biofuels. Despite the fact that microalgae could be transformed into several biofuels such as bioethanol (by fermentation of hydrocarbons) and biomethane (by anaerobic digestion), transforming lipids into biodiesel could allow the reduction of oil-based diesel consumption. However, microalgae biodiesel production costs remain high for a short-term commercialization. The microalgae lipids can be transesterified into biodiesel in the presence of catalysts (homogeneous or heterogeneous). In order to commercialize biodiesel from microalgae, biodiesel physicochemical properties must respect the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. The aim of the study was to describe the current technologies available to produce biodiesel from microalgae. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Enormous amounts of brewers’ spent grains (BSGs) per year are generated to produce bear worldwide. BSGs can be used as a carbon source, biofuel to generate energy and as a source of biogas. Typically, BSGs contain &gt;60 mass% of water and, therefore, drying kinetics is a paramount for the development of any of these valorisation processes. In this work, we reveal the main parameters and mechanism of drying kinetics of BSGs at isothermal conditions (60 °C–90 °C), measured by thermogravimetric analysis. Diffusion coefficients ranged from 1.42 × 10−9 m2 s−1 to 2.67 × 10−9 m2 s−1 while the activation energy was 26.6 kJ mol−1. Furthermore, for the first time, biodiesel production from BSGs is reported. We employed acid catalysed in situ transesterification process, at different catalyst concentrations, methanol to BSGs ratios, reaction time and temperature. The outcomes of our study show promise for alternative valorisation of brewers’ spent grains, an abundant waste spread around the world. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Muconic acid (MA) is a dicarboxylic acid used for the production of industrially relevant chemicals such as adipic acid, terephthalic acid, and caprolactam. Because the synthesis of these polymer precursors generates toxic intermediates by utilizing petroleum-derived chemicals and corrosive catalysts, the development of alternative strategies for the bio-based production of MA has garnered significant interest. Plants produce organic carbon skeletons by harvesting carbon dioxide and energy from the sun, and therefore represent advantageous hosts for engineered metabolic pathways towards the manufacturing of chemicals. In this work, we engineered Arabidopsis to demonstrate that plants can serve as green factories for the bio-manufacturing of MA. In particular, dual expression of plastid-targeted bacterial salicylate hydroxylase (NahG) and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CatA) resulted in the conversion of the endogenous salicylic acid (SA) pool into MA via catechol. Sequential increase of SA derived from the shikimate pathway was achieved by expressing plastid-targeted versions of bacterial salicylate synthase (Irp9) and feedback-resistant 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate synthase (AroG). Introducing this SA over-producing strategy into engineered plants that co-express NahG and CatA resulted in a 50-fold increase in MA titers. Considering that MA was easily recovered from senesced plant biomass after harvest, we envision the phytoproduction of MA as a beneficial option to add value to bioenergy crops. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - For the disintegration and extraction of microalgae to produce lipids and biofuels, a novel processing technology was investigated. The utilization of a hydrothermal treatment was tested on four different microalgae species (Scenedesmus rubescens, Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis oculata and Arthorspira platensis (Spirulina)) to determine whether it has an advantage in comparison to other disintegration methods for lipid extraction. It was shown, that hydrothermal treatment is a reasonable opportunity to utilize microalgae without drying and increase the lipid yield of an algae extraction process. For three of the four microalgae species, the extraction yield with a prior hydrothermal treatment elevated the lipid yield up to six times in comparison to direct extraction. Only Scenedesmus rubescens showed a different behaviour. Reason can be found in the different cell wall of the species. The investigation of the differences in cell wall composition of the used species indicate that the existence of algaenan as a cell wall compound plays a major role in stability. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, the replacement of fossil resources with renewable ones has focused great interest, expecially as regards the production of new valuable bio-products and bio-fuels, in progressive replacement of the traditional petroleum-based ones.The Waste Management Policy strongly encourages the valorization of waste biomasses into added-value bio-chemicals, instead of their traditional combustion for energy recovery or, even worse, of their landfill disposal. In this context, the acid-catalysed hydrothermal conversion of negative-value bio-wastes into levulinic acid (LA) represents a smart exploitation possibility, already developed and optimized on pilot-scale, and widely adaptable to different kinds of feedstocks. In this work, the LA production was investigated starting from two bio-wastes deriving from industrial Italian food-processing, e.g.exhausted lemon peels and coffee silverskins, together with that of a clean cellulose powder, which derives from the cutting operations occurring during the tissue paper production. The effect of the main reaction parameters on the LA synthesis, in particular the concentration of the acid catalyst, the biomass loading, the reaction temperature/time and, additionally, the effect of an upstream milder acid pretreatment, was investigated and discussed. Moreover, in the case of coffee silverskin, a preliminary extraction step of the water-soluble phenolics has further improved the fractionation and exploitation of this waste biomass. These compounds have been proposed as natural antioxidants, which represent very valuable niche products for nutraceutical uses. The described examples confirm the feasibility of an integrated valorization of the waste biomass, well in agreement with the Biorefinery concept. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Glucosamine is a monomer of chitosan, which is a biopolymer derived from the exoskeletons of crustaceans. This work investigated the conversion of glucosamine into the platform chemical levulinic acid (LA), in a sulfamic acid-catalyzed hydrothermal reaction. The optimized results of LA production showed that the conditions of 200 °C, 125 g L-1 glucosamine, 0.3 M sulfamic acid, and 15 min produced a 33.76 ± 0.19 mol% LA yield. The same conditions produced only 0.14 mol% 5-HMF yield. These results show that glucosamine is a potential bioresource to produce platform chemicals. Also, in the field of biofuels and chemical synthesis processes, the catalytic system using sulfamic acid is significant. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.

AB  - The chromium polluted water hyacinth was subjected to pyrolysis to understand its pyrolytic characteristic in a fixed bed. The results indicated that chromium has a positive effect on the bio-oil produced, accompanied by a decrease of gas yield and moderate formation of char. The maximum bio-oil yield obtained from Cr-WH pyrolysis reached the maximum of 63.1 wt.%. The acid number and high heating value of the Cr-WH pyrolytic bio-oil were 85.04 mgKOH/g and 26.72 MJ/kg, respectively. GC-MS analysis of the bio-oils showed that the amount of nitrogenous compounds, alcohols and phenols increased, while the number of esters reduced in the Cr-WH pyrolytic bio-oil which indicated that chromium promoted bond rupture of lignin and changed the degradation process of protein. Furthermore, after pyrolysis, Cr may transfer from the toxic state of ions into an amorphous state in the char, which reduce its harm to the environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells are emerging technologies which gain a lot of interest as a power source for implantable devices. Effective enzyme wiring and simplification of the cell architecture are the main limitations of the fuel cell development nowadays. In the present study, spray coating was used as a reliable process to produce flexible biocathodes. That was achieved through spray coating of a conductive ink formulated by surfactant assisted carbon nanotubes dispersion. A thin continuous layer of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was successfully coated on top of a gas diffusion layer paper. The film thickness was modulated by varying the CNT load in the ink and the number of deposited layers. It varied between 1 and 7.8 μm for a number of deposited layers between 5 and 100. Laccase enzyme was then wired to printed CNT electrodes thanks to the host-guest interaction between the hydrophobic pocket of laccase and pyrene-adamantane. Electrochemical investigations showed that laccase was effectively wired to the CNTs and presented a favorable orientation toward oxygen reduction. The biocathode current density was dependent of the number of deposited CNT layers and reached an optimum at 170 μA cm−2 for 50 deposited layers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study aimed to develop an integrated treatment of agro-industrial waste for biofuel (biogas and syngas) production and for phosphorus recovery. In the first step, an anaerobic digestion (AD) process was carried out on two different mixtures of raw agro-industrial residues. Specifically, a mixture of asparagus and tomato wastes (mixture-1) and a mixture of potatoes and kiwifruit residues (mixture-2) were investigated. The results proved that the properties of mixtures notably affect the evolution of the digestion process. Indeed, despite the lower organic load, the maximum biogas yield, of about 0.44 L/gCOD removed , was obtained for mixture-1. For mixture-2, the digestion process was hindered by the accumulation of acidity due to the lack of alkalinity in respect to the amount of volatile fatty acids. In the second step, the digestates from AD were utilized for syngas production using supercritical water gasification (SCWG) at 450 °C and 250 bar. Both the digestates were rapidly converted into syngas, which was mainly composed of H 2 , CO 2 , CH 4 , and CO. The maximum values of global gasification efficiency, equal to 56.5 g/kgCOD, and gas yield, equal to 1.8 mol/kgTS, were detected for mixture-2. The last step of the integrated treatment aimed to recover the phosphorus content, in the form of MgKPO 4 ·6H 2 O, from the residual liquid fraction of SCWG. The experimental results proved that at pH = 10 and Mg/P = 1 it is possible to obtain almost complete phosphorus removal. Moreover, by using the scanning electronic microscopy, it was demonstrated that the produced precipitate was effectively composed of magnesium potassium phosphate crystals. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In the last decade, the transformation of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel through a sugar platform has been an active research subject due to depletion of fossil fuel sources. Total reducing sugars (TRS) obtained from lignocellulosic materials are considered intermediates for the preparation of various valuable chemical compounds. In this work, pyridinium based ionic liquids were synthesized and utilized for the dissolution of cellulose and further conversion to TRS in the presence of metal salts as catalysts. The prepared ILs were characterized using 1H NMR and evaluated for the dissolution of cellulose and found that [C4C1Py][Cl] is the best solvent to dissolve it up to 28% at 110 °C. Optical microscopy in conjunction with FTIR, SEM, XRD and TGA analyses were employed to monitor dissolution phenomenon and ascertain structural changes in regenerated cellulose. SEM results showed disrupted flaky construction for regenerated cellulose. The thermal stability decreased for regenerated cellulose as observed by TGA analysis. This desirable change in cellulose after IL pretreatment was utilized to facilitate metal salts based on the catalytic conversion of cellulose to TRS. Among metal salts, CoCl2 was identified as the best one to generate the highest yield of TRS i.e. 78% at 110 °C for 4 h. Various reaction conditions like time, temperature, and catalyst loading were optimized for catalytic conversion.

AB  - This study compares the use of three low boiling point polar aprotic solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetone, and 1,4-dioxane, for extracting biomass sugars in ethanol biorefineries. The techno-economic analysis employs experimental data to build a chemical process model and estimate capital and operating costs of a commercial-scale biorefinery. The biomass solvent liquefaction in a 2000 metric tonne per day sugar fermentation biorefinery yields ethanol at minimum fuel-selling prices (MFSP) of $2.98 to $4.06 per gallon. THF achieves the lowest MFSP. Uncertainty analysis indicates that solvent to biomass ratio, glucose and xylose yields, feedstock price, and capital costs are the primary drivers of the ethanol MFSP. The 10% to 90% percentile for THF-based ethanol MFSP are estimated to be $2.31 and $3.21 per gallon. Life cycle analysis shows that with a lower solvent to biomass ratio as suggested by previous studies, our process could achieve GHG emissions reduction of 25% and 45% for THF and acetone cases, respectively. Further optimization of the process could lead to significant reductions in ethanol costs, commercialization risks, and GHG emissions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has attracted considerable attention as an advanced electrode material for electrochemical sensors and biosensors, due to its unique electrical and physicochemical properties. Here, we demonstrate the facile preparation of a positively-charged and hierarchical micro-structured PEDOT electrochemical interface with enhanced electrode kinetics for the electrooxidation of NADH. Processable PEDOT colloidal microparticles (PEDOT CMs) were synthesised by template-assisted polymerisation and were then utilised as building blocks for the fabrication of hierarchically-structured electrodes with a larger accessible electroactive surface (2.8 times larger than that of the benchmark PEDOT:PSS) and inter-particle space, thus improving electrode kinetics. The intrinsic positive charge of the PEDOT CMs further facilitated the detection of negatively-charged molecules by electrostatic accumulation. Due to the synergistic effect, these hierarchically-structured PEDOT CMs electrodes exhibited improved NADH electrooxidation at lower potentials and enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to the compact structure of conventional PEDOT:PSS electrodes. The PEDOT CMs electrodes detected NADH over the range of 20–240 μM, with a sensitivity of 0.0156 μA/μM and a limit of detection of 5.3 μM. Moreover, the PEDOT CMs electrode exhibited a larger peak separation from the interferent ascorbic acid, and improved stability. This enhanced analytical performance for NADH provides a sound basis for further work coupling to a range of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases for applications in biosensing, bio-fuel cells and biocatalysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigates for the first time the combustion in a micro gas turbine (MGT) of a new bioliquid, a viscous biocrude, which is a liquefied wood (LW) produced via solvolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in acidified glycols. The test rig includes a modified fuel injection line, a re-designed combustion chamber and revised fuel injection positions. The main novelties of this work are: (1) producing of liquefied wood with pure ethylene glycol as a solvent, and methanesulfonic acid as a catalyst, to obtain a bio-crude with lower viscosity and higher lignocellulosics content than previous tested formulations; (2) upgrading raw liquefied wood by blending it with ethanol to further reduce the viscosity of the mixture; (3) utilizing a commercially available MGT Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of 25 kW electrical power output, with notably reduced extent of adaptations to use the newly obtained fuel mixture. Fuel properties, and their impact on combustion performance using liquefied wood, are investigated by analyzing MGT performance and emissions response at different load and blend ratios. Emissions revealed that the presence of LW in the blends significantly affects CO and NOX concentrations compared to conventional fuels. CO roughly increased from 600 ppm (pure ethanol as fuel) to 1500 ppm (at 20 kW electrical power). The experimental study reveals that it is possible to achieve efficient MGT operation while utilizing high biocrude to ethanol ratios, but a number of adaptations are necessary. The achieved maximum share of liquefied wood in the fuel blend is 47.2% at 25 kW power output. Main barriers to the use of higher share of liquefied wood in these type of systems are also summarized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Improvement of processes that utilize renewable feedstocks to produce chemicals ordinarily derived from fossil carbon feedstocks is paramount to creating environmentally sustainable chemical and fuel industries. Catalytic conversion of biorefinery-derived ethanol via the Guerbet condensation has the potential to serve such a purpose. In this contribution, we demonstrate marked selectivity changes in the ethanol condensation over a copper-doped porous metal oxide catalyst upon a single exposure to ppm quantities of a soluble chloride source. Without this modification, ethyl acetate is the major product, with the others being n-butanol (principally) plus some 1-hexanol, butyl acetate, and ethyl butanoate. A single exposure to chloride increases activity and, more importantly, dramatically changes selectivity to give n-butanol and 1-hexanol as the largest products. X-ray diffraction and basicity measurements pre- and post-reaction were used to examine how chloride alters the properties of this Earth-abundant catalyst prepared by calcining a Cu-doped Mg/Al hydrotalcite. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Low recovery coupled with intensive energy requirement due to long processing time makes the potential of bio-oil production not seamlessly appreciated. In this study, the optimization of bio-oil yield from non-edible Swietenia macrophylla seeds through microwave pretreatment before ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction was investigated. Central composite design of response surface methodology was employed to analyze the effects to the bio-oil yield of the irradiation time (4–8 min) and irradiation power (90–450 W) as pretreatment variables using a microwave oven at 2.45 GHz frequency. Results showed that microwave pretreatment significantly increased the bio-oil yield by 5% with optimum recovery of 43% at shortened pretreatment time of 7 min instead of 6 h in the conventional oven heating method. The bio-oil yield increased when the irradiation time was increased, while irradiation power showed no significant effect. Analysis of the produced bio-oil through Fourier Transform Infrared Radiation spectroscopy identified similar functional groups present both in the extracted bio-oils from the microwave and the conventional pretreated seeds indicating that the former pretreatment, like the latter, did not destruct the compounds present in the seeds. The study demonstrated that the seeds of S. macrophylla have strong potential for bio-oil production and poise huge implications to the future of liquid biofuel and chemical industries. © 2018 Chinese Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taiwan

AB  - The composition in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) of the biogas produced by seven landfills of Giugliano (Naples, Campania, Italy) was determined and VOC emission rates assessed to verify if these compounds represent a potential threat to the population living nearby. VOC composition in the biogas could not be predicted, as heterogeneous waste was dumped from the late 1980s to the early 2000s and then underwent biological degradation. No data are available on the amount and composition of VOC in the biogas before the landfills closure as no operational biogas collection system was present. In this study, VOC composition was determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), after collecting samples from collection pipes and from soil fractures in cover soil or capping. Individual VOC were quantified and data compared with those collected at two landfills in Latium, when they were still in operation. Relevant differences were observed, mainly due to waste aging, but no specific VOC revealing toxic waste dumping was found, although the concurrent presence of certain compounds suggested that dumping of industrial wastes might have occurred. The average VOC emission was assessed and a dispersion model was run to find out if the emitted plume could affect the health of population. The results suggested that fugitive emissions did not represent a serious danger, since the concentrations simulated at the neighboring cities were below the threshold limits for acute and chronic diseases. However, VOC plume could cause annoyance at night when the steady state conditions of the atmosphere enhance pollutants accumulation in the lower layers. In addition, some of the emitted VOC, such as alkylbenzenes and monoterpenes, can contribute to tropospheric ozone formation. © 2018

AB  - This work addresses the co-valorisation in supercritical water of bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of wood and crude glycerol yielded as a by-product during biodiesel production. The experiments were conducted at 380 °C and 230 bar for 30 min with a Ni-Co/Al-Mg catalyst, analysing the effects on the process of the catalyst loading (0–0.25 g catalyst/g organics) and feed composition (each material alone and all possible binary mixtures). The yields to gas, upgraded bio-oil (liquid) and solid varied as follows: 4–87%, 0–46% and 0–18%, respectively. A synergistic interaction between crude glycerol and bio-oil took place during the upgrading process, which allowed the complete and simultaneous transformation of both materials into gas and liquid bio-fuels with a negligible solid formation. The compositions of the gas and the upgraded liquid can be easy tailored by adjusting the catalyst amount and the composition of the feed. The gas phase was made up of H2 (7–49 vol.%), CO2 (31–56 vol.), CO (0–7 vol.%) and CH4 (6–57 vol.%) and had a Lower Heating Value (LHV) ranging from 8 to 22 MJ/m3 STP. The upgraded bio-oil consisted of a mixture of carboxylic acids (0–73%), furans (0–7%), phenols (0–85%), ketones (0–22%) and cyclic compounds (0–53%). The proportions of C, H and O in the liquid shifted between 66–77 wt.%, 7–11 wt.% and 15–25 wt.%, respectively, while its Higher Heating Value (HHV) ranged from 29 to 34 MJ/kg. An optimum for the simultaneous production of gas and liquid bio-fuels was achieved with a solution having equal amounts of each material and employing a catalyst amount of 0.25 g catalyst/g organics. Under such conditions, 37% of the bio-oil was transformed into an upgraded liquid having a HHV (32 MJ/kg) two times higher than the original material (16 MJ/kg) with a negligible solid formation; the rest of the bio-oil and all the crude glycerol being converted into a rich CH4 (55 vol.%) biogas with a high LHV (21 MJ/m3 STP). This represents a step-change in future energy production and can help to establish the basis for a more efficient and sustainable biomass valorisation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The dependence of fresh-water for biomass growth is a major drawback in third generation microalgae biofuels, which need to be replaced with alternate sources. Optimizing nutrient concentrations already present in wastewater and its utilization towards microalgae growth could be a sustainable approach. In the present study, native microalga Chlorella thermophila (MF179624) was isolated and identified as model strain to optimize low-nutrient content campus sewage wastewater (CSW) using central composite design (CCD) followed by steepest ascent method (SAM). In consideration to the statistical optimization, addition of 325 mg L-1 and 1.8 g L-1 of KH2PO4 and NaNO3 resulted in 60% enhancement of biomass yield (2.59 g L-1) with two fold lipid productivity (81.38 mg L-1 d-1). In addition, substantial nutrient removal of ammonia (98.48 ± 1.52%), nitrate (86.37 ± 3.73%), phosphate (73.83 ± 4.28%), along with COD (82.53 ± 4.37%) were achieved. Further, TGA, FTIR, and 1H-NMR based characterization of lipid revealed its potential as a biofuel feedstock. To confirm that, two-step acid-base catalytic transesterification reaction was performed, which resulted in 474.42 mg L-1 FAME yield containing 85.14% C16 and C18. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The carbon net negative conversion of biochar, the byproduct of pyrolysis bio-oil production from biomass, to very high-purity (99.95%), highly crystalline flake graphite that is essentially indistinguishable from high-grade commercial Li-ion grade graphite, is reported. The flake size of the graphite is determined by the physical dimensions of the metal particles imbedded in the biochar, demonstrated in the range of micrometers to millimeters. "Potato"-shaped agglomerates of graphite flakes result when the flake diameter is in the 1-5 μm range. The process is shown to work with a variety of biomass, including raw lignocellulose (sawdust, wood flour, and corn cob) and biomass components (cellulose and lignin), as well as lignite. The synthesis is extremely rapid and energy efficient (0.25 kg/kWh); the graphite is produced with a very high yield (95.7%), and the energy content of its coproduct, bio-oil, exceeds that needed to power the process. The demonstrated process is a tremendous advance in the sustainability of graphite production, currently commercially mined or synthesized with very high environmental impacts, and results in a value-added product that could economically advantage carbon-neutral bio-oil production. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass gasification in fluidized beds is a complex process in which particles occur in a wide range of size and density. In this paper, the mixing behavior of the char, biomass and bed material in a gasification reactor of a typical dual fluidized bed (DFB) system was investigated in a cold flow model. Experiments with ternary mixtures were performed in which the size and the density of the used particles were varied. For the experiments, a cold flow model was constructed with a full bed material recirculation loop, similar to DFB systems. Experiments revealed that at low fluidization velocities, the smaller char particles and biomass particles occur more preferentially in the bed material recirculation stream. If the fluidization velocities are increased, this tendency diminishes. Furthermore, the experiments showed that the mass fraction of biomass particles in the recirculation stream is always higher than that of the lighter char particles. It is also shown that the current design of the gasification reactor in DFB systems is not optimal. A way to overcome this issue in existing plants is presented. © 2018

AB  - In this study, carbon nitride/titania nanotubes (C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 NTs) composites were synthesized for the enhanced visible light mediated photocatalytic degradation and pre-treatment of wastewater sludge for enhanced biogas production. The co-existence of C 3 N 4 and TiO2 NTs and visible light activity was confirmed by XRD, TEM, UV–visible and PL spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 NTs with 2% of melamine (precursor of C 3 N 4 ), enhanced the degradation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) (k = 0.0176 min −1 ), where 96.6% removal was achieved at optimum pH 7.0 and 2-CP concentration of 30 mg/L. On the other hand, the application of C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 NTs for solubilization of the rigid structure of sludge by photocatalysis released the soluble organics showing an improvement in sCOD production (4587 mg/L). Subsequently, anaerobic digestion of solubilized sludge has improved the methane production (723.4 ml kg −1 VS) by 1.37 and 1.6 times compared to that in anaerobic digestion with photolytic and raw sludge, thus showing a promising applicability for biogas production from sludge and wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, magnetic cross-linked enzyme aggregates (mCLEAs) of CALB (lipase B from Candida antarctica) were prepared and characterized. Moreover, a method for an easy, sustainable and economic extraction of lipids from nitrogen-starved cells of Chlorella vulgaris var L3 was developed. Then, the extracted lipids (oils and free fatty acids, FFAs) were converted to biodiesel using mCLEAs and chemical acid catalysis. Among several lipid extraction methods, saponification was selected given the amount of wet microalgal biomass it can process per unit of time, its low market value, and because it allows for the use of less toxic solvents. A biodiesel conversion of 80.2 ± 4.4% was obtained by chemical catalysis (1 h at 100°C) using FFAs and methanol as the alkyl donor. However, a biodiesel conversion of more than 90% (3 h at 30°C) was obtained using mCLEAs and methanol. Both chemical and enzymatic catalysts gave biodiesel with similar fatty acid alkyl ester (FAAE) composition. Methanol, at 15% (v/v) or higher concentration, caused a decrease of lipase activity and a concomitant increase in the size of mCLEA aggregates (up to 2 μm), as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The magnetic character of the novel biocatalyst permits its easy recovery and reuse, for at least ten consecutive catalytic cycles (retaining 90% of the initial biodiesel conversion), using mild reaction conditions and environmentally-friendly solvents. © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Lignocellulosic residues from energy crops offer a high potential to recover bioproducts and biofuels that can be used as raw matter for agriculture activities within a circular economy framework. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a well-established driver to convert these residues into energy and bioproducts. However, AD of lignocellulosic matter is slow and yields low methane potential, and therefore several pre-treatment methods have been proposed to increase the energy yield of this process. Hereby, we have assessed the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass (barley straw) with the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate and its effect on the biochemical methane potential (BMP). The BMP of the residue was evaluated at different inoculum to substrate (I/S) ratios and working under meso and thermophilic conditions. Solids destruction upon AD is highly enhanced by the IL-pretreatment. This also resulted in a higher BMP, both in mesophilic as well as thermophilic conditions. At the optimum I/S ratio of 2:1 (dried weight, dw), the BMP of the IL-pre-treated feedstock increased 28 and 80% for 35 days of thermophilic and mesophilic AD, respectively, as compared to the fresh feedstock, achieving values of 364 and 412 LCH4/kgTS. We also explored the effect of this pretreatment on the phosphorus recovery potential from the digestate upon release from the AD process. Thermophilic anaerobic digestion of IL-pre-treated biomass provided the highest P recovery potential from lignocellulosic residues (close to 100% of the theoretical P content of the lignocellulosic feedstock). Therefore, the pretreatment of lignocellulosic feedstock with IL before AD is a promising platform to obtain bioenergy and recover P to be regained for the agriculture sector. © 2018 Padrino, Lara-Serrano, Morales-delaRosa, Campos-Martín, Fierro, Martínez, Melero and Puyol.

AB  - The appropriate system is needed to produce a scalable and economically viable renewable energy from biomass. The objective of this study is to improve the quality of bio-oil, in terms of Organic Liquid Product (OLP), water content, acidity, favourable fractions, as well as gasoline-range chemicals. The influence of a staged layered catalyst system consists of a mesoporous catalyst, Al-MCM-41, and a microporous catalyst, HZSM-5, on the bio-oil quality was investigated. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperatures in the range of 400–600 °C with the optimum staged catalyst system on the catalytic pyrolysis product was analysed. The experiments of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis were performed using a fixed bed reactor equipped with oil condensers and a gas collection sample bag. The quality of bio-oil produced from the thermal pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, catalytic pyrolysis with single catalysts, catalytic pyrolysis with the staged catalyst system, as well as catalytic pyrolysis with mixed catalyst system was studied. The results show that Al-MCM-41 with HZSM-5 in the staged catalyst system enhanced the production of favourable compounds: hydrocarbons, phenols, furans, and alcohols. The favourable compounds yield that boosted 5.25–6.43% of that with single HZSM-5 catalyst was produced with HZSM-5:Al-MCM-41 mass ratio of 3:1 and 7:1. The pyrolysis and catalysis temperature of 500 °C with HZSM-5:Al-MCM-41 ratio of 3:1 obtained the optimum quality of bio-oil with 11.08 wt.% of OLP, 76.20% of favourable fractions, 41.97 wt.% of water content, low TAN of 43.01 mg-KOH/g, high deoxygenation, as well as high gasoline-range production of 97.89%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The TwoStage Viking gasifier from the Technical University of Denmark is being further developed for biofuel synthesis applications. In order to optimize the gasification process, it is suggested to apply an O2-CO2 gas mixture as gasification medium, instead of air, to limit N2-dilution of the product gas. It is found through a modeling study that the system is expected to achieve operating conditions in the range of air-blown operation, when 21v% O2 in CO2 is applied, and nearly identical parameters as the concentration is increased to 30v%. An experimental campaign with the 80kWth Viking pilot plant using 21v% oxygen confirms this, as operation temperatures are seen to slightly decrease the partial oxidation (POX) temperature by 52–69 °C and grate temperature by 31–36 °C. Tests with 25v% oxygen were also carried out with slightly higher temperatures. Detailed gas analysis showed that N2 had effectively been reduced to a few percent and that tar and sulphur levels were similar to the very high standards of the air-blown operation: only a few mg/Nm3 of tar and &lt;3 ppm sulphur were detected. The lone gas cleaning, a bag filter, was found to be virtually inactive for capturing these impurities. Hence, the gasifier had been successfully demonstrated with O2-CO2 mixtures and is expected to be able to maintain its simple design, whilst enabling very high system efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The utilization of waste feedstocks rich in free fatty acids (FFAs) improves biofuel production on the basis of economics and sustainability. However, converting these feedstocks to usable biofuel poses inherent problems in terms of the FFA to biofuel conversion yield and the catalyst lifetime. Here, we report novel ferric sulfate impregnated carbon derived from waste tires as highly active catalysts for FFA to biofuel conversion. Our approach takes advantage of facile synthesis methods involving sonication and dehydration processes to create materials that are useful for the efficient catalytic conversion of FFAs to advanced biofuels. Esterification of FFAs to fatty acid methyl esters was achieved at 65 °C and atmospheric pressure with >98% yield even in the presence of triglycerides. These catalysts maintained similar activity after four successive uses, which indicates that the active catalytic sites are effectively supported by the three-dimensional meso/microporous architecture of the tire-derived carbon. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - n-Butanol is considered as the next-generation biofuel, because its physiochemical properties are very similar to fossil fuels and it could be produced by Clostridia under anaerobic culture. Due to the difficulties of strict anaerobic culture, a host which can be used with facultative environment was being searched for n-butanol production. As an alternative, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, which is known as facultative bacteria, was selected as a host and studied. A plasmid containing adhE2 encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, various CoA transferases (ctfAB, atoAD, pct, and ACT), and acs encoding acetyl-CoA synthetase were introduced and examined to S. oneidensis MR-1 to produce n-butanol. As a result, ctfAB, acs, and adhE2 overexpression in S. oneidensis-pJM102 showed the highest n-butanol production in the presence of 2% of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), 0.3% of butyrate, and 0.1 mM of IPTG for 96 h under microaerobic condition. When more NAG and butyrate were fed, n-butanol production was enhanced, producing up to 160 mg/L of n-butanol. When metal ions or extra electrons were added to S. oneidensis-pJM102 for n-butanol production, metal ion as electron acceptor or supply of extra electron showed no significant effect on n-butanol production. Overall, we made a newly engineered S. oneidensis that could utilize NAG and butyrate to produce n-butanol. It could be used in further microaerobic condition and electricity supply studies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The waste tyre and waste cooking oils have a great potential to be used as alternative fuels for diesel engines. The aim of this study was to convert light fractions of pyrolysis oil derived from Pakistani waste vehicle tyres and waste soybean oil methyl esters into valuable fuel and to reduce waste disposal-associated environmental problems. In this study, the waste tyre pyrolysis liquid (light fraction) was collected from commercial tyre pyrolysis plant and biodiesel was prepared from waste soybean oil. The fuel blends (FMWO10, FMWO20, FMWO30, FMWO40 and FMWO50) were prepared from a 30:70 mixture of waste tyre pyrolysis liquid and waste soybean oil methyl esters with different proportions of mineral diesel. The mixture was named as the fuel mixture of waste oils (FMWO). FT-IR analysis of the fuel mixture was carried out using ALPHA FT-IR spectrometer. Experimental investigations on a diesel engine were carried out with various FMWO blends. It was observed that the engine fuel consumption was marginally increased and brake thermal efficiency was marginally decreased with FMWO fuel blends. FMWO10 has shown lowest NOx emissions among all the fuel blends tested. In addition, HC, CO and smoke emissions were noticeably decreased by 3.1–15.6%, 16.5–33.2%, and 1.8–4.5%, respectively, in comparison to diesel fuel, thereby qualifying the blends to be used as alternative fuel for diesel engines. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - In order to improve the quality of bio-oil and reduce the coking and deactivation of HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst in the catalytic cracking of bio-oil upgrading process, Non-Thermal Plasma (NTP) assisted HZSM-5 technical scheme was proposed, online upgrading of rape straw vacuum pyrolytic vapors were conducted in a fixed bed reactor to verify the effectiveness of the technology. In the research, the influence of catalyzing temperature, catalyst bed height, discharge power on the physicochemical properties of refined bio-oil were studied, and the yield of refined bio-oil was regarded as evaluation index, response surface methodology was adopted to optimize upgrading processing parameters. Chemical composition of the refined bio-oil which was obtained under optimized parameters was analyzed by GC–MS, and using thermogravimetric analysis, the impact of NTP on catalyst anti-coking property was evaluated. Research results indicates that catalyzing temperature, catalyst bed height and discharge power have significance effect on yield and physicochemical properties of refined bio-oil. With the optimized processing parameters of 392 °C catalyzing temperature, 34 mm catalyst bed height and 23.7 W discharge power, the oxygen content, high heating value and pH of refined bio-oil were respectively 19.79%, 33.14 MJ/kg and 4.98. Compared with original HZSM-5 catalytic upgrading method, the quality of refined bio-oil was improved obviously, and the amount of catalyst coke deposit reduced from 5.88% to 2.14%, the feasibility of NTP assisted HZSM-5 online upgrading bio-oil was confirmed. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - Background: Engineering strategies to create promoters that are both higher strength and tunable in the presence of inexpensive compounds are of high importance to develop metabolic engineering technologies that can be commercialized. Lignocellulosic biomass stands out as the most abundant renewable feedstock for the production of biofuels and chemicals. However, lignin a major polymeric component of the biomass is made up of aromatic units and remains as an untapped resource. Novel synthetic biology tools for the expression of heterologous proteins are critical for the effective engineering of a microbe to valorize lignin. This study demonstrates the first successful attempt in the creation of engineered promoters that can be induced by aromatics present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates to increase heterologous protein production. Results: A hybrid promoter engineering approach was utilized for the construction of phenolic-inducible promoters of higher strength. The hybrid promoters were constructed by replacing the spacer region of an endogenous promoter, P emrR present in E. coli that was naturally inducible by phenolics. In the presence of vanillin, the engineered promoters P vtac, P vtrc, and P vtic increased protein expression by 4.6-, 3.0-, and 1.5-fold, respectively, in comparison with a native promoter, P emrR. In the presence of vanillic acid, P vtac, P vtrc, and P vtic improved protein expression by 9.5-, 6.8-, and 2.1-fold, respectively, in comparison with P emrR. Among the cells induced with vanillin, the emergence of a sub-population constituting the healthy and dividing cells using flow cytometry was observed. The analysis also revealed this smaller sub-population to be the primary contributor for the increased expression that was observed with the engineered promoters. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the first successful attempt in the creation of engineered promoters that can be induced by aromatics to increase heterologous protein production. Employing promoters inducible by phenolics will provide the following advantages: (1) develop substrate inducible systems; (2) lower operating costs by replacing expensive IPTG currently used for induction; (3) develop dynamic regulatory systems; and (4) provide flexibility in operating conditions. The flow cytometry findings strongly suggest the need for novel approaches to maintain a healthy cell population in the presence of phenolics to achieve increased heterologous protein expression and, thereby, valorize lignin efficiently. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The technical and economic prospects for synthesis gas production via an integrated biomass pyrolysis and gasification (IBPG) process are evaluated for the case where rice straw is a considered feedstock. Modeling of the integrated process is performed by using the Aspen Custom Modeler program. The simulation results show that the production rates of synthesis gas and bio-oil derived from an IBPG process increase as pyrolysis temperature increases, due to the increased volatiles. Compared to a conventional biomass gasification, IBPG provides additional bio-oil as a valued by-product, releases less waste heat and offers higher energy efficiency at the same synthesis gas production rate. The IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C shows the best technical performance. However, pinch analysis indicates that the IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C or 500 °C and conventional biomass gasification is technically feasible; the optimum heat integration structures are achieved. The economic analysis, which considers only the reaction-related equipment, indicates that the IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C offers synthesis gas and bio-oil production rates of 1.185 and 0.2044 kmol h−1, respectively, and an energy efficiency of 68.86% is most economically feasible. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique is used in this work to simulate the hydrothermal liquefaction of Nannochloropsis sp. microalgae in a lab-scale continuous plug-flow reactor to understand the fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and reaction kinetics in a HTL reactor under hydrothermal condition. The temperature profile in the reactor and the yield of HTL products from the present simulation are obtained and they are validated with the experimental data available in the literature. Furthermore, the parametric study is carried out to study the effect of slurry flow rate, reactor temperature, and external heat transfer coefficient on the yield of products. Though the model predictions are satisfactory in comparison with the experimental results, it still needs to be improved for better prediction of the product yields. This improved model will be considered as a baseline for design and scale-up of large-scale HTL reactor. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, pyrolysis of tomato waste has been performed in fixed bed tubular reactor at 500 °C, both in absence and presence of Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. The influences of heating rate, catalyst preparation method and catalyst loading on bio-oil yields and properties were examined. According to pyrolysis experiments, the highest bio-oil yield was obtained as 30.31% with a heating rate of 100 °C/min, 5% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst loading ratio and co-precipitation method. Results showed that the catalysts have strong positive effect on bio-oil yields. Bio-oil quality obtained from fast catalytic pyrolysis was more favorable than that obtained from non-catalytic and slow catalytic pyrolysis. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - The waste resulted from fish processing industries are discarded into the environment around the world, causing environmental pollution. The main problem of fish oil extracted from waste is the high content in free fatty acids (FFA) which decrease the yield in fatty acids esters during transesterification reactions. Therefore, to correct the fish-oil properties, a new environmentally friendly heterogeneous superacid catalyst (SO4 2−/SnO2-ZrO2) was tested in the esterification reaction of FFA with ethanol. The catalyst was characterized by different techniques (XRD, FT-IR, FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine, BET, SEM-EDX, TGA and acidity measurements). The reaction was found to follow a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) dual-site mechanism with the novelty that both Brönsted and Lewis acid centers participate equally in the esterification reaction. The pre-treated oil was subjected to transesterification reaction with ethanol over a heterogeneous base catalyst and then, the saturated and unsaturated fractions of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) were separated using a vacuum rectification unit with falling film. The saturated content can be used as biofuel, while the unsaturated FAEE are further transesterified with glycerol in order to obtain oil with high content in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). A detailed study of the intrinsic kinetic process at the surface of the superacid catalyst and a thorough mathematical model of the fixed bed reactor were written and validated by an experimental program, designed according to the D-optimal methodology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study explores a novel photocatalytic approach for the conversion of complex biomass into smaller molecular units for their utility in generation of biofuel precursors. Following hydrothermal method, TiO2/Bi2WO6 nanocomposite photocatalyst for different ratio of TiO2 viz. 15% and 25% by weight have been synthesized. The efficiency of photodegradation of organic molecule is determined. Composite loaded with 25% TiO2 found to represent maximum photocatalytic efficiency of 99.9%. The structural and optical properties of the synthesized photocatalyst nanomaterial were characterized. A band gap of 2.7 eV was observed for 25% TiO2 composition which displayed an excellent visible light photoactivity, examined by removal of Rhodamine B. We further observe a four-fold higher photocatalytic activity in this composite compared to pristine Bi2WO6. Using this composite, solar energy is harvested to perform photocatalytic fragmentation of a biopolymer, namely starch, to derive smaller molecule precursors. Colorimetric analysis of reducing sugars from the degraded biomass quantifies the monomarization of starch. The linear chain molecular fragments thus formed were further analyzed by Raman, FTIR and ESI-MS. The results demonstrate photocatalytic pretreatment of starch by nanocomposite of TiO2/Bi2WO6 resulted in the formation of organic precursors that are common feedstock for the microbiota of anaerobic methanation and ethanol fermentation. We therefore conclude that photocatalytic pretreatment of biomass can be utilized for hydrolysis and partial acedogenesis of biomass in biofuel conversion processes. Such an approach represent environmentally benign way to convert biomass waste to biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new integrated process of biofuel production is introduced and analyzed. This process consists of lignocellulosic biomass fast pyrolysis, gasification, electrical power generation and latest bio-oil upgrading in biorefinery processes. Upgrading processes include hydrotreating, distillation, hydrocracking and steam reforming units. Biomass is converted to bio-oil, gas and bio-char through fast pyrolysis which is then used in biorefinery and gasification. Simulation results show that 1 kg/s hybrid poplar biomass generate about 0.68 kg/s bio-oil, 0.16 kg/s gas and 0.17 kg/s char. Also 5.62 MW electrical power can be gained from the steam cycle. The excess heat of gasification can be used as a part of the required heat source in the process. Moreover the produced syngas is used in the steam reforming unit to provide the required hydrogen in the refinery. In addition, by heat integration the consumption of hot and cold utilities decreased and consequently the process performance improved. The obtained results show that synthetic biofuel yield is about 0.49 wt% and 0.51 wt% gasoline/diesel blendstocks. Moreover economic analysis, sensitivity analysis was also done to study the effects of major operating parameters, i.e., steam reforming temperature, steam/carbon ratio of gasification and greenhouse gas emission, on the process performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste camellia seed shell was placed in the fluidized bed tubular reactor and carbonized at 700 °C for the preparation of a carbon material. The obtained-carbon material was simultaneously modified by La3+ and concentrated sulfuric acid for the synthesis of a novel solid Brönsted acid catalyst SO42−/La3+/C by performing impregnation method. Physical and chemical properties and structural characteristics of the SO42−/La3+/C catalyst were characterized and analyzed by several methods. The catalytic activity and stability of SO42−/La3+/C were evaluated from the catalytic synthesis of biodiesel via esterification of oleic acid and methanol. The highest conversion of oleic acid was 98.37 wt% when the mass ratio of catalyst/reactant, mass ratio of methanol to oleic acid, reaction temperature and reaction time were fixed at 0.75 wt%, 9:1, 62 °C and 5 h, respectively. Additionally in terms of reusability, the conversion of oleic acid was still 81.9 wt% after SO42−/La3+/C catalyst had been recycled for ten times. The high catalytic activity and stability can be ascribed to the formation of a six-coordination bond from the interactions of SO42−/La3+, C–OH oxygen of the carboxyl group and H2O. Hence, SO42−/La3+/C will exhibit strong Brönsted acidity and keep high stability in a reaction medium with large amount of H2O. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Utilization of lignocellulosic biomass as a future energy source is a research field of widespread growth. The lignin fraction has potential as a renewable resource to provide building blocks for the chemical industry and is the most prominent source of bio-based aromatics. Lignin, combined with formic acid and water under high temperature and pressure, is converted to a bio-oil rich in alkylated phenols and aliphatic hydrocarbons in a unique conversion process termed the LtL-process (lignin-to-liquid). In this work, this conversion technique has shown to be applicable to a variety of lignins, with organosolv extracted lignin as the main focus because of its high purity. The organosolv lignins appeared to be well suited for LtL-conversion generating higher yields of bio-oil than a lignin-rich residue from enzymatic hydrolysis. 31P NMR and GC-MS showed that the O/C ratios of the bio-oils decreases with increasing reaction temperature during LtL-solvolysis because of a decrease in methoxylated phenols and an increase in phenols with no methoxy substituent. This was verified by partial least-squares (PLS) regression analysis and elemental analysis of the feedstocks and resulting bio-oils, from which an effective hydrodeoxygenation during LtL-conversion was evident too. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Food waste contributes to increase the environmental impact, besides the ethical issue. One interesting way of valorization is its conversion in biofuel, thus helping to boost the concept of circular economy. The target of this work was to find out the feasibility of the use of the oil included in solid food waste (SFW) to produce biodiesel that meets the European biodiesel standard EN 14214. For this purpose, Soxhlet extraction of the lipid fraction of SFW from different restaurants has been carried out. Fatty acid composition was analyzed and potential differences concerning the source of SFW were evaluated through principal component analysis. Results showed significant differences in the oil fatty acid composition depending on the restaurant. However, oil physical and chemical properties were similar, excepting the acid value. Due to the high free fatty acid content (acidity of 11.21 mg KOH/g) of the oil from fine dining restaurant residues, acid-catalyzed esterification pre-treatment to the alkaline transesterification was needed. The fatty acid composition of oils from SFW differs depending on the restaurant, but the range of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is similar to that found in vegetable oils, showing a content of oleic acid (C18:1) between 36.39 and 41.57% w/w and linolenic acid (C18:2) of 21.37–38.63% w/w. Several chemical and physical properties of SFW oil biodiesel were analyzed. It was found that biodiesel fulfil the European standard EN 14214, with the exception of FAME yield, oxidation stability and glyceride content. For this reason and to improve biodiesel quality, further reaction optimization study, blending with diesel fuel or the use of additives is strongly recommended. It may be concluded, from this field trial, that oil from SFW from different restaurants may be mixed together and used to produce biodiesel. To corroborate this statement, further diesel engine tests are needed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aim of this paper is to present an engineering tool for the design and modeling of the upgrading of three biomass derived liquids (bio-oil, vegetable oil and algal oil) through hydrotreating process for the production of advanced biofuels. For each case, the appropriate approach was followed regarding the model compound selection for each bio-feedstock, the main reactor modeling, the products separation and purification and the make-up hydrogen production. Simulation runs were performed in ASPEN Plus™ and revealed the importance for make-up H2 production from recovered light gases and external fuel such as natural gas (the heat content on LHV basis if the inlet natural gas is 7.4% of the produced fuel in the jatropha oil case), showing also the beneficial impact of a good catalyst. The energy balance calculations showed that the most energy demanding components are the air compressor before reformer and make-up H2 compressor at the hydrogen production plant. The assumption of a chemical equilibrium can be regarded as a well-fitting and valid approach for the process design. The representation of bio-liquid by a model compound (i.e. palmitic acid in case of algal oil) may result in good estimations in terms of mass (0.845 kgG-Diesel/kgalgal-oil product yield) and heat balance of the total process (94.9% thermal efficiency) but all the detected fatty acid is suggested be taken into account for a more detailed analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Liquefaction of biomass by an in situ hydrogenation process has received increasing attention to upgrade bio-oil. This study aims to examine the hydrogenation of rice stalk using ethanol–water co-solvent in an autoclave with hydrogen generated in situ mainly from ethanol steam reforming (ESR) reactions. ESR occurred at a mild temperature of 320 °C over Ni-Mo-S/Al2O3 catalyst with H2 being the major gaseous product, and the H2 yield increased significantly with elevated temperature. A higher energy recovery of 0.79 was obtained at 320 °C with NiMoS/Al2O3. Methoxy-substituted phenols were reduced due to the hydrogenolysis reactions, and the total content of phenols was decreased by as high as 37% at 340 °C. TG analysis indicated that higher temperature promoted the formation of low-boiling point compounds in the bio-oil, especially in the presence of Ni-Mo-S/Al2O3. This work demonstrated the feasibility of in situ hydrogenation of rice stalk in supercritical ethanol–water co-solvent. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of temperature, reaction time, biomass/water feedstock ratio, NaOH concentration, and ZSM-5 catalyst amount were investigated relative to the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of sugarcane bagasse. The experimental results showed that the maximum yield of bio-oil (46.9%) was achieved with the following conditions: 10 g of sugarcane bagasse, 200 mL of distilled water, 30 min, and 285 °C. It was seen that the products of oxygenation (phenols, acids, ketones, alkenes, and esters) were abundant in the bio-oil. With the addition of NaOH, the residue yield decreased remarkably, and the yield of organics dissolved increased. The yields of acids and furfurals in the bio-oil decreased with the presence of NaOH during HTL. Additionally, ZSM-5 effectively decreased the acidic compounds and improved the liquid properties during HTL. Sugarcane bagasse in HTL with catalysts significantly improved the quality of bio-oil with lower oxygen content and higher HHV. Moreover, the gaseous products H2 and CH4 were noticeably affected by the temperature, NaOH concentration, and ZSM-5 amount.

AB  - Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) represents a promising source for biofuel production and other bioactive compounds because of their high availability and high biomass yield. The present work aims to determine the possibility for biofuel production and other active compounds from seasonally collected water hyacinth. The water hyacinth samples were collected at four seasons (2014/2015) from River Nile, Giza, Egypt, and the biofuel (biodiesel and bioethanol), lipids, glycerol content, carbohydrates and other biochemical compounds were determined in addition to physico-chemically characterized of produced biodiesel The obtained results indicated that, water hyacinth samples showed variable lipid contents (6.79–10.45%), which by transesterification produced biodiesels (3.22–6.36%) and sediment (pigments+glycerol). Biodiesel composed either totally of saturated fatty acids (Myristic acid) of winter and autumn samples, However, Myristic and Stearic acids with small proportion of pentadecanoic acid of summer and spring samples by 8.1 and 7.9% respectively. The monounsaturated fatty acid, Oleic, was only recorded in the summer sample by11.6%. So biodiesels produced from water hyacinth have good stability and acceptability to be used in diesel engines, the co-products (sediment) composed of pigments and glycerol reached to 4.69 mg/g and 1.05 mmol/L respectively in winter season. Also, pretreatment of water hyacinth by acid at mild conditions was found to be effective with high yield of fermentable sugars and production of ethanol during 120–180 min for different seasonally collected plants. From the results, we can conclude that the produced biodiesel (from water hyacinth) was within the recommended standards and met the criteria required to be a diesel substitute compared with the Egyptian fuel standards In addition, it is possible to use its pigments as natural coloring substances in food industry, and glycerol can be incorporated in different petrochemical industries. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Mesoporous Ti-Mo bi-metal oxides with various titanium-molybdenum ratios were successfully fabricated via a facile approach by using stearic acid as a low-cost template agent. thermal gravity (TG)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC. analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM. and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements indicated these materials possessing mesoporous structure, sufficient pore size and high acid intensity. The catalytic performance of prepared catalysts was evaluated by esterification of free fatty acids in Jatropha curcas crude oil (JCCO. with methanol. The effects of various parameters on FFA conversion were investigated. The esterification conversion of 87.8% was achieved under the condition of 180°C, 2 h, methanol to JCCO molar ratio of 20:1 and 3.0 wt.% catalyst (relative to the weight of JCCO). The mesoporous catalysts were found to exhibit high activities toward the simultaneous esterification and transesterification of JCCO. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recovered with a good reusability. © 2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - An eco-friendly and low-cost lignosulfonate-based acidic carbonaceous catalyst (LS-SO3H) was effectively fabricated using the sulfite pulping by-product of sodium lignosulfonate as a precursor by facile one-step simultaneous carbonization and sulfonation, and employed for the synthesis of promising biofuel furan derivatives from biorenewable feedstocks. The catalyst preparation conditions significantly affected the preparation and properties of LS-SO3H. A relatively high catalyst preparation yield (40.4%) with strong -SO3H density (1.33 mmol g-1) were achieved when the lignosulfonate was treated in concentrated H2SO4 solution at 120 °C for 6 h. The preparation yield of LS-SO3H was nearly twice as much as that of one-step prepared catalyst using alkaline lignin (another technical lignin from pulping) as a precursor. The as-prepared LS-SO3H had similar textural characteristics to the frequently-used two-step prepared carbonaceous catalyst involving pyrolysis carbonization and sulfonation. LS-SO3H was found to show good catalytic activity for the synthesis of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) in ethanol medium, affording around 86%, 57% and 47% yields from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), fructose and inulin, respectively. Also, a high HMF yield of 83% could be obtained from fructose when DMSO was replaced as reaction medium. The used LS-SO3H was readily recovered by filtration, and remained active in recycle runs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laccases belong to the family of blue multicopper oxidases, these enzymes are efficient in many applications, including in biofuel cells to produce electricity through chemical reactions. Several laccase immobilization methods have been elucidated, such as covalent link and entrapment. RESULTS: The present work describes how, for the first time, laccase was successfully immobilized by entrapment into polymer inclusion ionic liquid membranes (PILMs) based on ionic liquids and polyvinylchloride. The immobilization rate was very high in all cases (99.2 ± 0.6%), so that the enzyme entrapment strategy described can be considered as successful and one of the best methods for laccases immobilization that have been reported to date. The assayed membranes were evaluated as performing carrier for laccase by means of the ABTS oxidation. Four screened ionic liquids were used for the first time for this purpose: [OMIM][NTf2], [EMIM][NTf2], [Epy][NTf2] and [Chol][NTf2]. This work demonstrated the efficiency in terms of the activity rate and stability of the enzyme versus IL concentrations. The most suitable IL as regards activity [Chol][NTf2]. However, the reuse assays showed that the most stable PILM was the one constituted by 50% [Epy][NTf2]. For physical resistance and water insolubility, the [OMIM][NTf2] based PILM was selected for microbial fuel cell (MFC) application. CONCLUSION: This is the first report describing this original entrapment strategy for laccase immobilization into PILM. The application of this laccase-membrane in MFC showed high stability during almost one week of use and good efficiency in producing bio-energy and removing COD from industrial wastewater. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Biodiesel is a powerful alternative fuel that is less polluting and problematic to produce and implement. The production process of biodiesel also gives us the byproduct glycerol, which is a useful feedstock to produce hydrogen and syngas as fuels. With such high value as a fuel we are in need of better production technologies for biodiesel, which is currently being pursued through sonochemical reactors. The development of continuous sonochemical reactors for biodiesel production is a crucial requirement for the biofuel industry. Sonochemical reactors make use of ultrasound and acoustic cavitation to produce biodiesel from waste cooking oils (WCO). In this work we carried out both numerical simulation and experimental analysis of sonochemical reactors with multiple transducers. Through simulation, the effect of double vs a single transducer has been tested for a continuous flow sonochemical reactor. In experimental work three different cases with different ultrasound systems (bath, probe and bath + probe) have been tested. In both the studies, acoustic pressure and biodiesel conversion are analyzed. Results for the simulation show that in shorter reactors, the high cavitation from two transducers dampens the acoustic pressures leading to low conversion. However, at taller heights the effect of combined cavitation is less severe and the acoustic pressure and biodiesel yield are very similar between the designs having single and double transducers. From experiments it was found that the biodiesel conversion depends on several acoustic conditions mainly cavitation. A meticulous and insightful analysis was made to understand the difference in bath type and probe type ultrasound systems on acoustic pressure and biodiesel conversion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although the application of microreactors in different processes has been extensively explored in recent decades, microreactors continue to be underexplored in the context of the enzyme-catalysed process for biodiesel production. Due to their numerous advantages, microreactors could become the next step in the development of a biodiesel production process characterised by sustainability, cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency. In this investigation, biodiesel production was catalysed by lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (Lipolase L100). Edible sunflower oil was used as a model substrate in order to investigate the process. After optimal process conditions had been determined, waste-cooking oil was used for biodiesel production to make the production process more sustainable. Three different substrate-feeding strategies were investigated and finally an optimal strategy was proposed. In all the investigated systems, fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) content was higher than 95% and obtained in a significantly shorter time (less than 2 h) compared to the batch process in which biodiesel production was catalysed by lipase (C = 95%, t = 96 h). After the optimal biodiesel production system had been proposed, an integrated system with two microchips connected in series was developed. The first microchip was used for biodiesel production and the second for simultaneous purification i.e. glycerol separation. Finally, purified biodiesel was produced with glycerol content below the detection limit. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Yeast surface display has become a powerful technology in recent decades and one of the promising areas in this field is the biodiesel synthesis by microbial lipases. Hence, in this study the optimized lipase A (Lip A) gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was fused to GPI-anchored protein Gcw61 and successfully displayed on the surface of Pichia pastoris X33. A lipase activity of 85.2 U/mg dry cell weight was obtained from recombinant P. pastoris. The copy numbers of inserted lipase gene were determined 2.09 ± 0.06 by real time PCR absolute quantification method. The enzyme showed the best stability in pH 7.0–10.0 and at temperature 37 °C–40 °C and was also stable in hydrophilic organic solvents. Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+ ions enhanced enzyme activity, whereas Fe2+ and Zn2+ ions and some detergents like SDS, CTAB, Tween 20 and 80 dramatically decreased the activity of the enzyme. The results demonstrate that our whole cell biocatalyst exhibited a good potential for biodiesel production from microalgae oil in 10 repeated batch cycles. © 2018

AB  - The wild strain of Mucor circinelloides URM 4182 from a Brazilian culture collection was previously recognized as potential oleaginous microorganism that supplied single cell oil (SCO) with suitable properties for biodiesel synthesis. This work focused on assessing the accumulation of storage lipid by this strain grown in various media containing different carbon sources and the subsequent conversion of the microbial lipids into biodiesel. The chosen carbon sources can be obtained from several agro-industrial residues such as sucrose and fructose (sugarcane molasses), xylose (hydrolysate of lignocellulosic materials like sugarcane bagasse), starch (corn milling), ethanol and glycerol (byproducts from biodiesel production). The carbon source was found to influence the obtained fatty acid profile of M. circinelloides oil, realizing important attributes that favor its use for biodiesel production, including good levels of saturated (Cn: 0) and monounsaturated (Cn: 1) fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids with two (linoleic acid) or three double (linolenic acid) bonds were also found, but their concentrations decreased from 33.2 to 19.8% when glucose was replaced by a substrate based on sucrose. The feasibility of using low-cost feedstocks in the synthesis of microbial lipids was demonstrated, with the exception of ethanol that inhibited fungal growth. The lipid-bearing biomass was then subjected to direct transesterification using a robust solid acid catalyst (12-molybdophosphoric acid supported on alumina) in a high-pressure reactor, producing ethyl esters as biodiesel material with very high conversion yields (98.5%) and minor levels of byproducts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODEn) is an emerging biofuel that has a great potential to become one of the competitive alternative fuels for diesel engine. In the present study, systematic studies were made to evaluate the influences of PODEn on the physical fuel properties that are routinely used to define the quality of diesel fuels. Such fuel properties were measured for the three (diesel + PODEn) mixtures, diesels, and PODEn. The measured properties included cetane number, lubricity, density, viscosity, solidifying point, cold filter plugging point, flash point, and heat capacity. Comparisons of measured properties of the mixtures and their individual components were made to achieve the following purposes: First, to reveal the changes in the properties of diesels upon the addition of PODEn and in the properties of the (diesel + PODEn) mixtures as the weight percent of PODEn is increased; Second, to see whether or not the addition of PODEn worsens the properties of diesels, in particular, whether or not the measured values of the (diesel + PODEn) mixtures exceed the standard values set by the Beijing-VI. Novel theoretical equations were developed to quantitatively predict the density, viscosity, and heat capacity of the (diesel + PODEn) mixtures in terms of the corresponding properties of the diesel and PODEn. Comparisons were made between measured and predicted properties and the agreements are excellent. © 2018

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a promising feedstock for biofuel production because its oil is highly suitable for processing bio-jet fuels and biodiesel. However, Jatropha exhibits a long juvenile stage in subtropical areas. miR172, a conserved small non-proteincoding RNA molecule with 21 nucleotides, regulates a wide range of developmental processes. To date, however, no studies have examined the function of miR172 in Jatropha. There are five miR172 precursors encoding two mature miR172s in Jatropha, which are expressed in all tissues, with the highest expression level in leaves, and the levels are up-regulated with age. Overexpression of JcmiR172a resulted in early flowering, abnormal flowers, and altered leaf morphology in transgenic Arabidopsis and Jatropha. The expression levels of miR172 target genes were down-regulated, and the flower identity genes were up-regulated in the JcmiR172a-overexpressing transgenic plants. Interestingly, we showed that JcmiR172 might be involved in regulation of stem vascular development through manipulating the expression of cellulose and lignin biosynthesis genes. Overexpression of JcmiR172a enhanced xylem development and reduced phloem and pith development. This study helped elucidate the functions of miR172 in perennial plants, a known age-related miRNA involved in the regulation of perennial plant phase change and organ development. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - With an objective to improve the yield and selectivity of phenols in pyrolysis bio-oil from lignin, this study investigates the effects of mass ratio of lignin-to-susceptor and different types of susceptors (activated carbons of different particle sizes, charcoal and graphite) in microwave pyrolysis. Pyrolysis was carried out in a batch microwave reactor, and the temperature profiles at different operating conditions were captured. Increasing the mass of susceptor with respect to lignin enhanced the bio-oil yield, and maximum yield of 66 wt% with >90% selectivity to phenols was obtained with 10 g lignin:90 g activated carbon. Moisture present in the susceptor is shown to control the pyrolysis severity and lead to better phenol yields. This was verified by the high yield of hydrogen gas formed due to the steam-assisted cracking of lignin. With highly porous activated carbon, 80% selectivity of phenol was obtained, albeit with a low yield of bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil was added as a substitute for phenol for the preparation of a foaming phenolic resin (PR), which aimed to reduce the brittleness and pulverization of phenolic foam (PF). The components of bio-oil, the chemical structure of bio-oil phenolic resin (BPR), and the mechanical performances, and the morphological and thermal properties of bio-oil phenolic foam (BPF) were investigated. The bio-oil contained a number of phenols and abundant substances with long-chain alkanes. The peaks of OH groups, CH2 groups, C=O groups, and aromatic skeletal vibration on the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum became wider and sharper after adding bio-oil. These suggested that the bio-oil could partially replace phenol to prepare resin and had great potential for toughening resin. When the substitute rate of bio-oil to phenol (B/P substitute rate) was between 10% and 20%, the cell sizes of BPFs were smaller and more uniform than those of PF. The compressive strength and flexural strength of BPFs with a 10-20% B/P substitute rate increased by 10.5-47.4% and 25.0-50.5% respectively, and their pulverization ratios decreased by 14.5-38.6% in comparison to PF. All BPFs maintained good flame-retardant properties, thermal stability, and thermal isolation, although the limited oxygen index (LOI) and residual masses by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of BPFs were lower and the thermal conducticity was slightly greater than those of PF. This indicated that the bio-oil could be used as a renewable toughening agent for PF. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Red mud (RM) was activated by a feasible digestion-precipitation method followed by calcination at 600 °C (denoted as ACRM), which was used as a novel catalyst during the thermal degradation of the lignin. The prepared catalyst was then applied to the lignin derived from agricultural waste using a vertical fixed-bed microreactor between 350–650 °C. The texture characteristics of the activated RM were characterized by XRF, FTIR, XRD, TEM, SEM-EDS, NH3-TPD, and the N2 isothermal absorption method. The analysis results indicated that the ACRM catalyst possessed a high specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, acidity and active metal oxides (Fe2O3, Al2O3, and TiO2). Maximum bio-oil yield (25 wt.%) was observed at 550 °C, however, the bio-oil yield exhibited an overall declined trend in comparison to the non-catalytic pyrolysis at the corresponding pyrolysis temperatures. The relative contents of alkyl-phenols and the hydrocarbons significantly increased using the ACRM catalyst at 550 °C, which was attributed to the strengthening of dehydroxylation, demethylation, demethoxylation, and alkylation reactions. The study demonstrated the ACRM could be used as a promising catalyst for upgrading the pyrolysis vapours of lignin with considerable economic and ecological benefits. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herein, the potato peels which are the huge household and agro-industrial disposable waste material have been evaluated as a promising and sustainable natural antioxidant for enhancing the oxidation stability of the biodiesel produced from Nahar (Mesua ferrea L.) oil. A sample of biodiesel without PPE (Potato peel extract) denoted as BP0 (0 ppm) and total of four treatments of biodiesel with PPE i.e., 100 ppm (BP1), 150 ppm (BP2), 200 ppm (BP3), 250 ppm (BP4) were prepared for evaluating the effectiveness of PPE in oxidation stability enhancement. The oxidation stability of all the samples was evaluated with the help of Rancimat instrument manufactured by metrohm. The results revealed that a minimum concentration of 150 ppm of PPE in Mesua ferrea L. biodiesel was capable of enhancing its IP (induction period) from 5.63 h to 6.21 h, which met the standard European (ENE14214) biodiesel specification for oxidation stability. Comparison of PPE with TBHQ (tert-butylhydroquinone) has also been accomplished to know the effectiveness of PPE against TBHQ. The results in this study have shown that PPE is equally capable of enhancing oxidation stability of Mesua ferrea L. biodiesel as compared to TBHQ. Hence, PPE can be used as natural antioxidant for biodiesel instead of using synthetic antioxidant TBHQ procured from non-renewable source. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OleT, a recently discovered member of the CYP152 family of cytochrome P450s, catalyzes a unique decarboxylation reaction, converting free fatty acids into 1-olefins and carbon dioxide using H2O2 as an oxidant. The C-C cleavage reaction proceeds through hydrogen atom abstraction by an iron(IV)-oxo intermediate known as Compound I. The capacity of the enzyme for generating important commodity chemicals and liquid biofuels has inspired a flurry of investigations seeking to maximize its biosynthetic potential. One common approach has sought to address the limitations imposed by the H2O2 cosubstrate, particularly for in vivo applications. Numerous reports have shown relatively efficient decarboxylation activity with various combinations of the enzyme with pyridine nucleotides, biological redox donors, and dioxygen, implicating a mechanism whereby OleT can generate Compound I via a canonical P450 O2 dependent reaction scheme. Here, we have applied transient kinetics, cryoradiolysis, and steady state turnover studies to probe the precise origins of OleT turnover from surrogate redox systems. Electron transfer from several redox donors is prohibitively sluggish, and the enzyme is unable to form the hydroperoxo-ferric adduct that serves as a critical precursor to Compound I. Despite the ability for OleT to readily bind O2 once it is reduced, autoxidation of the enzyme and redox partners leads to the generation of H2O2, which is ultimately responsible for the vast majority of turnover. These results illuminate several strategies for improving OleT for downstream biocatalytic applications. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - 5-Ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), a potential and viable biofuel, was synthesized in one pot from D-fructose by using cheaper and environmentally friendly deep eutectic solvents (DESs) at mild condition. A variety of DESs were synthesized and used under microwave irradiation to get the maximum conversion of fructose and selectivity to EMF. Among various DESs the combination of choline chloride-oxalic acid gave the highest conversion of D-fructose (92%) with yield of EMF (74%) in 3 h at 343 K. A systematic study on effect of different parameters on reaction rate and selectivity was undertaken. Ethyl levulinate (EL) is also formed due to a parallel reaction of D-fructose with ethanol and water generated in-situ coupled with a consecutive reaction of ethanol with EMF. The formation of EL, which is also a fuel additive, was controlled by using lower temperature. DESs are highly reusable and show good activity up to four cycles. All raw materials used in this process are derived from biomass. The process parameters were optimized to get maximum yield of EMF. The process is green. © 2018

AB  - Biodiesel production by performing the oleic acid esterification reaction in a new reactor system, realized by coupling the batch reactor with a tubular permeoselective membrane, has been investigated. Such reactor configuration was adopted to remove the water produced as by-product during the reaction thus increasing the oleic acid conversion and the alkyl ester production. The activity of acid catalysts and zeolites was evaluated in presence of methanol and ethanol. The membrane resulted much more selective towards water separation when ethanol was used, allowing to force thermodynamic equilibrium at higher conversion values. Very interesting results in terms of oleic acid conversion were achieved with both methanol and ethanol (96% and 98% respectively) in presence of a commercial Amberlyst-15 catalyst, at 80 °C, at a low membrane surface to gas volume ratio (0.20 cm−1) and low acid/alcohol molar ratio (2/1 and 1/1 respectively). Over zeolite samples, conversion values higher than 60% were obtained at 100 °C after 5 h in the esterification reaction performed in vapor permeation configuration. © 2018

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) were synthesized via in situ lipase-catalyzed transesterification in rice bran without additional catalyst. With this method, FAME were synthesized directly from oil in rice bran by simply adding methanol, with the aid of rice bran lipase already existing in rice bran. The effects of temperature, molar ratio (oil in rice bran to methanol), and water content of the rice bran were investigated. The yield of FAME and the free fatty acid content were monitored as a function of reaction time. The optimum conditions were a temperature of 40 °C, a molar ratio of 1:6, and a water content of 12%. Under the optimum conditions, the FAME yield of 83.4 wt% was obtained after 12 days. To further increase the FAME yield, the transesterification was repeated using the rice bran obtained from the first transesterification. The oils in rice bran that could be converted to FAME were completely transformed throughout the repeated transesterification. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 2015, the Worldatlas recorded 50 countries whose source of income is fossil fuel and its derivatives. Surprisingly, these countries solely depend on this source of energy up to 100% (Omar, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) because of technology improvement. It's so sadden that apart from its adverse effect on the economics of the countries, fossil fuels harmful effects on the universe cannot be overlooked. Meanwhile, the use of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuel and its derivatives are faced by the high oil price, high cost of investment for alternative energy, and unfathomed electricity prices. This research work evaluates desirability of making use of alternative source of energy sources by making use of biomass oil over the use of fossil fuel and its derivatives for electricity generation. Lucky nut is an agricultural non edible seed that was employed as raw material for biofuel production. The non-edible oil was extracted from the seeds and the oil was further converted to Lucky nut biofuel via a heterogeneous based catalyst produced from calcinated pearl spar. For modelling and optimization, design expert coupled with genetic algorithms were used to generate experimental designs so as to correlate the variable factors considered for production. The extraction of Lucky nut seed revealed the optimum production yield of 50.80% (v/v) and the oil is highly unsaturated. Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrophotometer analyses and scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the calcined catalyst obtained from pearl spar showed the major component found in the pearl spar was K with relative abundance of 58.48%, which favoured the yield of Lucky nut biodiesel (91.00% (v/v)). Based on predicted values, the optimum validated Lucky nut biodiesel by RSMED and ANNED were 89.68% (v/v) and 92.87% (v/v), respectively. Produced properties of biofuel conformed to the biofuel standard. The study concluded that Lucky nut seed is a good source of oil, and its transformation to alternative fuel via a using calcined catalyst proved its fitness as a replacement for fossil fuel. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - For the catalytic co-pyrolysis of glucose and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fixed-bed reactor, the effects of different layout schemes of feedstock and catalysts on bio-oil yield and aromatics selectivity were investigated based on the Diels-Alder reaction of furans and short-chain olefins on HZSM-5 for aromatics production. Experimental results showed that the arrangement (HDPE/HZSM-5/glucose/HZSM-5) had advantages on bio-oil yield and aromatics selectivity. A mixture of pine sawdust and MgCl2 as a glucose substitute that provided furan compounds (Furfural) reacted with short-chain olefins for aromatics production. We found that acquiring high selectivity of aromatic bio-oil from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and HDPE with MgCl2 and HZSM-5 is feasible. The effects of co-pyrolysis temperature, biomass to HDPE ratio, and feedstock to catalyst ratio on bio-oil yield and chemical compositions were discussed. Notably, an appropriate ratio between the amounts of furans and short-chain olefins is necessary for increasing bio-oil yield and aromatics selectivity. Maximum oil phase product yield of 20.6% and aromatics selectivity (area %) of 95.9% were obtained when pyrolysis temperature, biomass to HDPE ratio, and feedstock to catalyst ratio were 600 ℃ 1:2, and 1:1, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The 10CuZr catalyst shows the highest HMF yield (25.6%) with an acceptable glucose conversion (75.8%) after 1.5 h on stream. By increasing the time on stream from 1.5 to 5.5 h the HMF yield (33.2%) and glucose conversion (94.5%) are improved. In the case of DMF production, the 15CuZr catalyst shows the highest DMF yield (30%). This behavior is notably improved when Ru is added to the 15CuZr catalyst, reaching a DMF yield of 45.6%. These activity results could be related to the higher amount of Cu0 species exposed on the catalyst surface and the increase of coke resistance. Finally, the 1Ru15CuZr catalyst is used in DMF production using glucose derived HMF as raw material, and a DMF yield and HMF conversion of 16.4% and 77.5% are achieved, respectively. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Energy security coupled with the impact of greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in growing interest in investigating new technologies for renewable energy production as an alternative to fossil fuels. In this context, seawater is an inexhaustible and environmentally benign source for the production of clean energy. Natural seawater is the most convenient medium to produce energy, when compared to synthetic seawater or fresh water. To date, there have been no detailed reviews regarding energy conversion methods using seawater. The main aim of this review is to furnish the important features of energy production/conversion technologies using seawater as a medium. The basic principle, application and important finding of the available technologies such as photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical, microbial desalination, biochemical, electrolysis, reverse electrodialysis, capacitive mixing, pressure retarded osmosis, mixing entropy battery, and seawater batteries have been described in this review. Energy or energy carriers can be produced in the form of electricity, hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and biodiesel. Relevant design and operating conditions that influence the energy production from seawater such as physicochemical properties of materials, reaction conditions, reactor design, and formation of byproducts are summarized briefly. We also found that most of the technologies have been evaluated only at the laboratory scale. To avoid the fouling problems, it is advised to use natural seawater after filtration. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The strong upward trend in air transport has promoted the development of renewable and clean fuels, making for a sustainable growth in the aviation sector. This paper describes alternative aviation fuel obtained from the transesterification and subsequent distillation of jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.), babassu (Orbignya phalerata) and palm kernel (Elaeis guineensis) oils. The methanolic transesterification reaction was performed using the homogeneous basic catalysis method. The yields were higher than 81.72%. The blends were prepared with the esters obtained from the synthesis and commercial aviation kerosene (Jet-A1) in proportions of 5, 10 and 20% (v/v). The same proportions were used with ester fractions at a boiling point lower than 190 °C. These fractions were obtained by fractional vacuum distillation. The quality standards of the blends were evaluated based on the procedures established by Brazilian Standard ABNT (Brazilian Technical Standards Association) and American Standard ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) for the properties: kinematic viscosity, calorific value, density and flash point. The preliminary results of methyl esters/Jet-A1 blends confirmed that the biofuel obtained using the 10% proportion has similar properties compared to the available commercial aviation fuels, hence the use of these new fuels is a viable alternative. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aims to produce bio-fuel from lignin via catalytic upgrading of vapors from lignin microwave pyrolysis. The effects of cobalt modified ZSM-5 catalysts on products yield and chemical selectivity of bio-oils were investigated. A central composite experimental design (CCD) was used to optimize the reaction conditions for bio-fuel production. The effects of the reaction temperature and ratio of catalyst to lignin on products (bio-oil, gas and volatiles) yield distribution and chemical composition of bio-oil were investigated. Response surface analysis indicated that the obtained models were able to predict the products yield distribution and the major chemical compound distribution of the bio-oil. GC/MS analysis revealed that the main chemical compounds were ketones, furans, phenols and guaiacols, which accounted for more than 85% in the detected bio-oil. GC analysis showed that the major components of the gas were H2 and CO (about 60%). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article takes stock of the world's largest low-carbon technology demonstration programme – the EU's NER 300. The programme has been marked by delays and many withdrawn projects since becoming operational in 2010: CCS projects have failed and not reached final investment decisions; wind and solar projects have succeeded, whereas bioenergy projects have seen successes as well as failures. These outcomes can be explained by specific design features in the program that placed large-scale projects at a disadvantage, and by the wider context of EU climate and energy policies providing inadequate market-pull incentives for CCS and biofuels. The design and policy challenges identified are related more to political feasibility than to lack of knowledge of what is needed to trigger innovation. The proposal for a follow-up Innovation Fund is assessed against the lessons from NER 300. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Background: In this study, a two-step processing method (hydrothermal liquefaction followed by catalytic upgrading) was used to produce upgraded bio-oil. A comprehensive screening analysis of algal species, including four microalgae and four macroalgae, was conducted to bridge the gap between previous accounts of microalgae and macroalgae hydrothermal liquefaction and the upgrading process of the resulting crude bio-oils. Results: Hydrothermal liquefaction using eight algal biomasses was performed at 350 °C for 1 h. The microalgae always produced a higher crude bio-oil yield than the macroalgae due to their high lipid content, among which Schizochytrium limacinum provided the maximum crude bio-oil yield of 54.42 wt%. For microalgae, higher amounts of N in the biomass resulted in higher amounts of N in the crude bio-oil; however, contrary results were observed for the macroalgae. The crude bio-oils generated from both the microalgae and macroalgae were characterized as having a high viscosity, total acid number, and heteroatom content, and they were influenced by the biochemical compositions of the feedstocks. Next, all eight-crude bio-oils were treated at 400 °C for 2 h with 10 wt% Ru/C using tetralin as the hydrogen donor. The hydrogen source was provided after tetralin was transformed to naphthalene. All the upgraded bio-oils had higher energy densities and significantly lower N, O, and S contents and viscosities than their corresponding crude bio-oils. However, the H/C molar ratio of the upgraded bio-oils decreased due to the absence of external hydrogen relative to the crude bio-oils. The S content of the upgraded bio-oil produced from upgrading the Schizochytrium limacinum crude bio-oil was even close to the 50 ppm requirement of China IV diesel. Conclusions: Microalgae are better feedstocks than macroalgae for liquid fuel production. Biochemical components have a significant impact on the yield and composition of crude bio-oil. Tetralin does not perform as well as external hydrogen for controlling coke formation. The S content of the upgraded bio-oil can be reduced to 76 ppm for the crude bio-oil produced from Schizochytrium limacinum. Upgraded bio-oils have similar properties to those of naphtha and jet fuel. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Among the fossil fuels, diesel has the major share in petroleum product consumption. Diesel demand in Iran has increasingly grown due to the low price of diesel, a high subsidy, and an unsuitable consumption pattern. During 2006-2007, this growth imposed 2.2 billion liters of imports, which were equivalent to 7.5% of diesel production in 2007 and cost about $1.2 billion. Therefore, the government implemented fuel rationing in 2007 and a targeted subsidy law in 2010. These projects have not gained effective control of consumption due to the wide gap between the international diesel price and the domestic price. Diesel import after the implementation of fuel rationing and the targeted subsidy law in 2011 imposed 3.6 billion liters of import and cost about $2.2 billion. Therefore, the government will need fundamental strategies and policies to face and control the negative impact on the economy and the environment. Third generation fuels, biofuels, as another supplementary approach seems to have the capability to reduce the petroleum requirement. This paper investigates the potential of biodiesel as diesel alternative fuel from oil seeds and microalgae in Iran along with evaluating the policy for reducing diesel consumption. Dunaliella salina as an indigenous green microalga isolated from the Maharlu Salt Lake was cultivated in an integration of an airlift system and a raceway pond (IARWP) to prove microalgal potentials in Iran. Additionally, the natural culture medium from the Maharlu Salt Lake was utilized for Dunaliella salina in order to commercialize and reduce cultivation cost. Compared to oilseeds, microalgae because of their high lipid content have much potential to solve a fuel consumption problem. This paper found that only 21 percent of cultivable land is needed to replace the diesel currently consumed in Iran with microalgal biodiesel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The aim was to study the effect of artificially constructed consortia of microalgae-bacterial symbionts on growth and lipid production by Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), as well as the inter-relationship between microalgae and bacterial in a photoautotrophic system. The results showed that compared to an axenic culture of C. vulgaris, H1 co-culture system (axenic C. vulgaris-Stenotrophomona smaltophilia) had the strongest effect on the C. vulgaris growth. The biomass, specific growth rate and maximum productivity of C. vulgaris were increased by 21.9, 20.4, and 18%, respectively. The bacteria in co-culture system had a significant effect on the accumulation of lipid and fatty acid components of C. vulgaris: the content of lipid was increased by 8.2–33.83%, and the components of the saturated fatty acids and oleic acids also had an obvious improvement. The results indicate that the microalgae-bacterial co-culture system can improve microalgal biomass and the quality of biodiesel. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Both untransformed poplar and genetically modified "zip-lignin" poplar, in which additional ester bonds were introduced into the lignin backbone, were subjected to mild alkaline and copper-catalyzed alkaline hydrogen peroxide (Cu-AHP) pretreatment. Our hypothesis was that the lignin in zip-lignin poplar would be removed more easily than lignin in untransformed poplar during this alkaline pretreatment, resulting in higher sugar yields following enzymatic hydrolysis. We observed improved glucose and xylose hydrolysis yields for zip-lignin poplar compared to untransformed poplar following both alkaline-only pretreatment (56% glucose yield for untransformed poplar compared to 67% for zip-lignin poplar) and Cu-AHP pretreatment (77% glucose yield for untransformed poplar compared to 85% for zip-lignin poplar). Compositional analysis, glycome profiling, and microscopy all supported the notion that the ester linkages increase delignification and improve sugar yields. Essentially no differences were noted in the molecular weight distributions of solubilized lignins between the zip-lignin poplar and the control line. Significantly, when zip-lignin poplar was utilized as the feedstock, hydrogen peroxide, catalyst, and enzyme loadings could all be substantially reduced while maintaining high sugar yields. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The effective hydro-liquefaction process of sawdust is proposed over different ionic liquid Ni-based catalysts at 320 °C. This study investigated the relationship between ionic liquid composition and catalytic performance. The maximum sawdust conversion of 83.11% and liquid yield of 52.38% were achieved over the catalytic system including nickel chloride and 1-butyl-3-methyllimidazolium bromide ([Bmim]Br), suggesting that the anion in ionic liquid played an vital role on the sawdust hydro-liquefaction. The defined impact index was provided to further evaluate the liquefaction performance using ionic liquid Ni-based catalyst. The largest impact index obtained from [Bmim]Br/NiCl2 was in agreement with its excellent catalytic liquefaction performance. The analysis of ionic liquid Ni-based catalyst indicated the coordination interaction between ionic liquid and nickel chloride, which would be favorable to feedstock conversion and improve the bio-oil quality. According to the component distribution, the introduced ionic liquid Ni-based catalytic system was beneficial to sawdust cracking, resulting in the increased amount of smaller compounds. Additionally, the oil compositions highly depended on the employed type of ionic liquid. © 2018

AB  - Since 2014 (Euro VI), heavy goods vehicles must be equipped with a complex exhaust gas post-treatment system including a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), a catalyst for the selective reduction of NOx (SCR), and a diesel particulate filter (DPF), with a required durability of 7 years or 700,000 km. Consequently, when biodiesel is used, especially pure biodiesel (B100), catalysts will be subjected over 700,000 km to kilogrammes of inorganic elements (Na, K, and P), even if they are limited to a few ppm in biodiesel fuel. The durability of the catalytic exhaust system is therefore questionable. This issue is of major concern to vehicle manufacturers. This study aims to make a detailed investigation of the impact of biodiesel use on the durability of the existing Euro VI catalytic systems, with a special focus on deactivation through poisoning for DOC and SCR catalysts, and on the physics and chemistry of particles and their reactivity. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Renewable energy generation through biorefineries is increasingly considered as more sustainable in comparison with fossil-based fuels as well as single-product renewable energy systems. However, biorefineries have many system variations, and therefore, the evaluation of their environmental performance and comparison with conventional systems before large-scale deployment is essential. In this paper, the sustainability of three different biorefiney scenarios (Sc-1, Sc-2, and Sc-3) based on Eruca sativa (ES) as feedstock were investigated using a life cycle assessment approach from energy balance and environmental point of views. Biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, heat, glycerol, and/or biomethane were the marketable products taken into account under the conditions of these scenarios. According to the results obtained, we argue that although biorefineries offer unique features as most effective alternatives for mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the selection of biomass processing options and management decisions can widely affect the final evaluation results. Overall, providing transportation fuel through Sc-2 in which biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, heat, and glycerol were produced could decrease GHG emissions by approximately 140% compared with the combustion of neat diesel while also offering a total net energy gain (NEG) of 4.94E+08 MJ/yr. Nevertheless, if biorefineries are to be used for future transportation fuel production, a great deal of efforts should still be made to achieve better environmental performance in the Human Health and Ecosystem quality damage categories. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of bio-oil from palm kernel shell (PKS) via subcritical and supercritical hydrothermal liquefaction was investigated. In order to maximize the bio-oil yield, design of experiment and optimization was performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Four factors which included temperature (330–390 °C), pressure (25–35 MPa), reaction time (60–120 min) and biomass-to-water ratio (0.20-0.50 wt/wt) were investigated. The regression model developed gave accurate predictions and fitted well with the experimental results, with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.9109. Based on the model, the optimum liquefaction condition was predicted to be at temperature of 390 °C, pressure of 25 MPa, reaction time of 60 min and biomass-to-water ratio of 0.20 with a prediction yield of 15.48 wt%. This condition was validated by experimental runs which produced an average of 14.44 wt% bio-oil yield. Then, the mediation effect of supercritical CO2 on bio-oil yield was studied. Hydrothermal liquefaction of PKS was performed at the optimum condition in the presence of supercritical CO2. The effect of supercritical CO2 was found to be insignificant at higher liquefaction temperature of 390 °C but it was significant at lower liquefaction temperature of 300 °C, producing bio-oil yield of 11.35 wt%. GC/MS analysis showed that phenolic compounds constituted the major portion of the bio-oils, while ketones, aromatic compounds and carboxylic acid were also detected. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a promising technology for improving the properties of pyrolysis bio-oils. However, the role that intermolecular reactivity between the numerous chemical components of bio-oil plays on the overall performance of the process has been scarcely investigated. In order to gain additional insights into the network of chemical processes taking place during bio-oil upgrading, the present work investigates the hydrodeoxygenation of mixtures of guaiacol and propionic acid using Ni based catalysts supported on solids exhibiting different acidity and textural characteristics: hierarchical ZSM-5 (h-ZSM-5), SBA-15 and Al-SBA-15. In addition, to the products of the HDO of each component of the binary mixture, such cyclohexane and propane, this work shows that hydrodeoxygenation is coupled with esterification, which occurs as a consequence of the in situ formation of methanol by demethoxylation of guaiacol, and other alcohols produced by hydrogenation. Minor contributions of alkylation reactions to the final product distribution are also revealed. Those secondary processes increase the chain length of the products and they contribute positively to avoid carbon losses in the gas phase. Results reported here indicate that the use of acidic supports improves the catalytic behavior leading much higher HDO degree. In this sense, Ni/h-ZSM-5 catalyst shows HDO values close to 100% and significant esterification activity, becoming a very promising catalyst for improving bio-oils properties as advanced biofuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipases namely Mucor miehei, Pseudomonas cepacia, Rhizopus delemar, Geotrichum candidum, Candida rugosa, Porcine pancreas-II, Pseudomonas fluorescence, and Candida antarctica lipase-B (Novozyme-435) were employed for biodiesel synthesis from spent coffee oil. Around 96% oil-to-biodiesel conversion was obtained using Novozyme-435 as a catalyst at 1:5 oil-to-methanol molar ratio and 40ºC. Total spent coffee grounds generated at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus (NWU PC) was estimated which could be used to produce 162 L of biodiesel. A waste valorization strategy was devised for converting organic wastes produced at the NWU PC to bioenergy. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Valuable intermediates for solvents, biofuels and biopolymer precursors are produced from levulinic acid (LA). In this study, rice husk (RH) was fractionated using a three-step biorefining approach for LA production: (1) acid pretreatment, (2) alkaline pretreatment and (3) catalytic depolymerization of cellulose. In third step, the H2SO4-acid concentration (Ad), reaction temperature (Td) and reaction time (td) on the LA concentration (CLA), selectivity (SLA) and yield percentage based on the theoretical value (Yt,LA), were investigated. Optimal values for CLA of 27.2 g/L, SLA of 62.2% and Yt,LA of 60.6 mol% were obtained at Ad of 5.0% w/v, Td of 175 °C and td of 75 min. A scenario based on 100 kg of dry RH produced 11.8 kg of LA with a yield of 42.9 mol% based on the theoretical values of the cellulose in the RH, as well as 12.5 kg of xylose, 12 kg of lignin and 2.9 kg of formic acid. Furthermore, the potential route to LA production with the requirement to remove the ash and with a low production of carbonaceous species (∼2.5 kg) was highlighted in this study. These results offer new insight into selective conversion of RH to bio-based products. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyanobacteria, which perform oxygenic photosynthesis, have drawn attention as hosts for the direct production of biofuels and commodity chemicals from CO 2 and H 2 O using light energy. Although cyanobacteria capable of producing diverse chemicals have been generated by metabolic engineering, anaerobic non-photosynthetic culture conditions are often necessary for their production. In this study, we conducted cell type-specific metabolic engineering of the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, which forms a terminally differentiated cell called a heterocyst with a semi-regular spacing of 10–15 cells. Because heterocysts are specialized cells for nitrogen fixation, the intracellular oxygen level of heterocysts is maintained very low even when adjacent cells perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Pyruvate decarboxylase of Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were exclusively expressed in heterocysts. Ethanol production was concomitant with nitrogen fixation in genetically engineered Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Engineering of carbon metabolism in heterocysts improved ethanol production, and strain ET14, with an extra copy of the invB gene expressed from a heterocyst-specific promoter, produced 130.9 mg L −1 of ethanol after 9 days. ET14 produced 1681.9 mg L −1 of ethanol by increasing the CO 2 supply. Ethanol production per heterocyst cell was approximately threefold higher than that per cell of unicellular cyanobacterium. This study demonstrates the potential of heterocysts for anaerobic production of biofuels and commodity chemicals under oxygenic photosynthetic conditions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A new class of renewable diesel fuels has been synthesized by acid catalyzed condensation of 2-tridecanone with a series of diols that can be generated from biomass. These fuels exhibit comparable net heats of combustion (NHOCs) to conventional biodiesel, while maintaining derived cetane numbers between 82-91, values which are 20-30 units higher than conventional biodiesel and 40-50 units higher than petroleum-derived diesel fuel. The short combustion delays of the dioxolane fuels make them compelling blendstocks to enhance the combustion efficiency of petroleum-derived diesel fuel by increasing the cetane number and oxygen content of the blends. In addition, careful selection of the renewable diol allows for custom tailoring of viscosity and freezing point. Unlike conventional biodiesel which is often generated from plant or animal derived triglycerides, 2-tridecanone and other methyl ketones, along with the diols, can be efficiently generated from biomass sugars or CO 2 /H 2 via fermentation with metabolically engineered microorganisms. This biosynthetic approach may allow for the generation of these fuels on industrially relevant scales while eliminating competition with food sources and promoting responsible use of land resources. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Molecular structure transformation is a critical step for synthesis of aviation biofuels from triglycerides, to yield alkanes, aromatics and cycloalkanes. To this end, triglycerides were treated by catalytic cracking coupled with rectification to obtain hydrocarbon fuels, and the molecular weight of the liquid product was adjusted to the desirable boiling range of aviation fuel. To further modify the molecular structures, the pyrolytic hydrocarbons were partially converted into aromatics and cycloalkanes by a two-step process. Different raw materials including soybean oil, rubber seed oil, waste cooking oil and acidified oil were cracked with a 5 wt% base catalyst at 350-450 °C (under the atmospheric pressure) in a benchtop reactor. Afterwards, the linear hydrocarbons of C8-C15 size were transformed into aromatics by HZSM-5 at 350 °C for 6 h. Then, a portion of the aromatics were converted into cycloalkanes catalyzed by Pd/AC at 200 °C and 6 MPa (H 2 ) for 6 h. As a result, a desirable mixture of linear hydrocarbons, aromatics and cycloalkanes was obtained with a similar composition and properties to traditional fossil aviation fuels. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this research biodiesel is produced from goat tallow in the presence of homogenous catalysts such as KOH and NaOH using trans-esterification process. For this purpose, effect of several parameters such as temperature, reaction time, methanol to oil ratio, type and concentration of a catalyst has been investigated. The results showed that the maximum biodiesel yield (96 and 98 %) was obtained using NaOH and KOH, respectively, and optimal conditions were determined. Also, to improve some properties of biodiesel, biodiesel was mixed with diesel at different ratio (B5-B100) and their properties such as flash point, cloud point, pour point, viscosity and density were measured. It was found that the properties of produced biodiesel is in the range of standard and can be used as a biofuel. © Esmaeli H., Foroutan R., 2018.

AB  - In thermodynamics, the useful work in any process can be evaluated by using the exergy quantity. The analyses of irreversibility are fundamental in the engineering design and in the productive processes' development in order to obtain the economic growth. Recently, the use has been improved also in the thermodynamic analysis of the socio-economic context. Consequently, the exergy lost is linked to the energy cost required to maintain the productive processes themselves. The fundamental role of the fluxes and the interaction between systems and their environment is highlighted. The equivalent wasted primary resource value for the work-hour is proposed as an indicator to support the economic considerations on the biofuel production by using biomass and bacteria. The equivalent wasted primary resource value for the work-hour is proposed as an indicator to support the economic considerations of the biofuel production by using biomass and bacteria. Moreover, the technological considerations can be developed by using the exergy inefficiency. Consequently, bacteria use can be compared with other means of biofuel production, taking into account both the technologies and the economic considerations. Cyanobacteria results as the better organism for biofuel production. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Cellulose represents the major component of the abundant and inedible lignocellulosic biomass on earth. The valorization of cellulose into liquid biofuels and high value-added bio-based chemicals has drawn intensive attentions in recent years. However, because of the rigid structure of crystalline cellulose, the breakage of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, the first step of cellulosic biomass utilization is still a critical challenge under mild conditions. Herein, we report the cleavage of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds of cellobiose on Ir/HY catalyst with high activity and high selectivity (>99%) under visible light illumination at temperature not exceeding 100 °C. We found that the hydrolysis of cellobiose under mild condition is mainly owing to a cooperation effect between the Ir nanoparticles as the plasmonic photothermal source and acid catalysis of HY zeolite. This work provides a distinctive, sustainable pathway to efficiently convert cellulose to chemicals driven by solar energy under mild conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction of poplar was performed at 220–280 °C, and the liquid phase produced was extracted by ethyl acetate to obtain light oil (LO), which contained LO1 (water-soluble) and LO2 (ethyl acetate-soluble). The residue was further extracted with acetone to produce heavy oil (HO) and solid residue (SR). The highest bio-oil yield of 19.88% was obtained at 260 °C. The HO produced at 260 °C had the highest content of C (69.13%) and the higher heating value was 27.97 MJ/kg. The O/C and H/C ratios of LO were higher than those of HO due to less aromatics in LO. Oxidative inhibition rates of bio-oils, measured in DPPH-ethanol solution at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, reached 60.76% for LO1 while 90.29% and 90.85% for LO2 and HO, respectively. The bio-oil with good antioxidant activity can be utilized as an additive in bio-diesel to improve oxidation stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigates the efficiency of the organic acids on the pretreatment of an industrially generated cotton gin waste for the removal of lignin, thereby releasing cellulose and hemicellulose as fermentable sugar components. Cotton gin waste was pretreated with various organic acids namely lactic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, and maleic acid. Among these, maleic acid was found to be the most efficient producing maximum xylose sugar (126.05 ± 0.74 g/g) at the optimum pretreatment condition of 150 °C, 500 mM, and 45 min. The pretreatment efficiency was comparable to the conventional dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment. A lignin removal of 88% was achieved by treating maleic acid pretreated biomass in a mixture of sodium sulfite and sodium chlorite. The pretreated biomass was further evaluated for the release of sugar by enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequently bioethanol production from hydrolysates. The maximum 686.13 g/g saccharification yield was achieved with maleic acid pretreated biomass which was slightly higher than the sulfuric acid (675.26 g/g) pretreated waste. The fermentation of mixed hydrolysates(41.75 g/l) produced 18.74 g/l bioethanol concentration with 2.25 g/l/h ethanol productivity and 0.48 g/g ethanol yield using sequential use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis yeast strains. The production of bioethanol was higher than the ethanol produced using co-culture in comparison to sequential culture. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the maleic acid pretreatment and fermentation using sequential use of yeast strains are efficient for bioethanol production from cotton gin waste. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising thermochemical technology to produce biocrude oil from algae; however, further improvement of the process efficiency is still required. In this study, we used a cost-effective catalyst (Fe/HZSM-5) during HTL of microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. The highest biocrude oil yield (38.1 ± 3.2%) was achieved at 365 °C with the inclusion of Fe/HZSM-5, which improved the biocrude oil yield by 25% compared with the non-catalyzed group. In addition, Fe/HZSM-5 showed a positive effect on influencing element migration during the HTL process. An increase of carbon in the biocrude oil and increase of nitrogen in the aqueous phase were observed, which would benefit downstream processing, including biocrude oil upgrading and nutrients recovery. Furthermore, the presence of low-molecular weight ketones, acids, amides and phenols in the biocrude oil indicated improvement of the oil quality. Hence, Fe/HZSM-5 could be a promising catalyst for the HTL of algae, enhancing biocrude oil production and regulating the distribution of carbon and nitrogen in the product fractions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The process intensification possibilities of a gas-solid vortex reactor have been studied for biomass fast pyrolysis using a combination of experiments (particle image velocimetry) and non-reactive and reactive three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations. High centrifugal forces (greater than 30g) are obtainable, which allows for much higher slip velocities (&gt;5 m s-1) and more intense heat and mass transfer between phases, which could result in higher selectivities of, for example, bio-oil production. Additionally, the dense yet fluid nature of the bed allows for a relatively small pressure drop across the bed (∼104 Pa). For the reactive simulations, bio-oil yields of up to 70 wt % are achieved, which is higher than reported in conventional fluidized beds across the literature. Convective heat transfer coefficients between gas and solid in the range of 600-700 W m-2 K-1 are observed, significantly higher than those obtained in competitive reactor technologies. This is partly explained by reducing undesirable gas-char contact times as a result of preferred segregation of unwanted char particles toward the exhaust. Experimentally, systematic char entrainment under simultaneous biomass-char operation suggested possible process intensification and a so-called "self-cleaning" tendency of vortex reactors. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microalgae cultivation is a promising approach to remove ambient CO2 via photosynthesis process. This paper investigates the impact of high CO2 concentrations (6, 12, and 16%) on algae growth, CO2 biofixation, lipid and carbohydrate contents, and nutrient removal of newly isolated microalgae, Coelastrum sp. SM. In addition, the ability of microalgae to produce biodiesel at optimal condition was studied. The microalgae were cultivated in wastewater using an airlift photobioreactor. Under 12% CO2, the maximum biomass productivity and CO2 fixation rate were 0.267 g L−1 day−1 and 0.302 g L−1 h−1, respectively. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorous (TP), nitrate, and sCOD removal efficiency were 84.01, 100, 86.811, and 73.084%, respectively. Under 12% CO2 and at the same condition for cell growth, the highest lipid and carbohydrate contents were 3 7.91 and 58.45%, respectively. The composition of fatty acids methyl ester (FAME) of the microalga lipid was defined. Based on the obtained results and FAME profile, Coelastrum sp. SM was a suitable feedstock for biodiesel production and also, the organism had a great potential for CO2 biofixation, which is also more suitable than any other reported strains in other related studies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Residual biomass shows potential to be used as a feedstock for fast pyrolysis bio-oil production for energetic and chemical use. Although environmentally advantageous, further catalytic upgrading is required in order to increase the bio-oil stability, by reducing reactive compounds, functional oxygen-containing groups and water content. However, bio-oils may separate in fractions either spontaneously after ageing or by fractionated condensation. Therefore the effects of upgrading on different fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) fractions obtained from a commercially available FPBO were studied by elemental analysis, GC-MS and 1H-NMR. Not only the FPBO was upgraded by catalytic hydrotreatment, but also the heavy phase fraction formed after intentional aging and phase separation. The reactions were conducted between 175 and 325 °C and 80–100 bar by using a nickel–chromium catalyst in batch experiments. The influence of the hydrotreatment conditions correlated with the composition of the upgraded products. Higher oxygen removal was obtained at higher temperatures, whereas higher pressures resulted in higher hydrogen consumption with no significant influence on deoxygenation. At 325 °C and 80 bar 42% of the oxygen content was removed from the FPBO. Compounds attributed to pyrolysis oil instability, such as ketones and furfural were completely converted while the number of alcohols detected in the upgraded products increased. Coke formation was observed after all reactions, especially for the reaction with the fraction rich in lignin derivatives, likely formed by polymerization of phenolic compounds mainly concentrated in this phase. Independently of the feedstock used, the upgraded bio-oils were very similar in composition, with reduced oxygen and water content, higher energy density and higher carbon content. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of durability on the regulated and unregulated emissions, as well as the power and fuel economy performance of a biodiesel-powered engine equipped with a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system based on a 500-h durability test. Furthermore, a BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) test was employed to analyze the specific surface area changes of the DOC and SCR. Results show that after the durability, the power performance improved and the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) reduced due to the running-in effect. Although the deterioration of the DOC and SCR after the durability resulted in an increase in the carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbon (THC) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) emission factors of the biodiesel-powered engine based on European steady state cycle (ESC) by 41.3%, 36.1% and 39.2%, respectively, these emissions were still below China-Ⅴ limits. For unregulated emissions, the reduced BSFC caused by the durability led to a decrease in the carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, but the durability resulted in higher aldehyde emission. The BET specific surface areas of the DOC and SCR decreased by 40.2% and 35.0%, respectively after the durability, which accounted for their catalytic performance deterioration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic esterification of acetic acid with high boiling point benzyl alcohol is a primary goal to decrease oxygen content and acidity of crude pyrolysis biofuels before their further refining steps; meanwhile, the produced benzyl acetate is a value-added chemical building. In the search for efficient and recyclable solid acids for the above process, Brønsted acidic ionic liquid functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres, [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs (C3 = PrSO3H, Im = imidazolium cation), are demonstrated via co-condensation route followed by quaternary ammonization and anion exchange. The [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs with nanometer size, hollow interior, opening and permeable thin shell as well as large BET surface area are successfully applied in esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol in toluene as a simulated pyrolysis biofuel, and influence of reaction temperature, benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio and water content on the catalytic activity and selectivity are evaluated. The [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs exhibit significantly high catalytic activity and selectivity in target reaction, outperforming Amberlyst-15 resin and HY zeolite; moreover, morphological characteristics, textural properties and surface hydrophobicity impact the esterification activity. The [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs also exhibit good catalytic stability and reusability, and leaching of acid sites as well as changes of chemical structure and morphology of the nanohybrids are hardly observed after the reaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, microwave assisted depolymerization of alkaline lignin into bio-oil was investigated in the presence of CuNiAl hydrotalcite based solid base catalysts in methanol. The effects of catalysts, reaction temperature, time, and heating methods were all studied in detail to improve the bio-oil yield. The promotion effect of microwave heating and Cu amount in the CuNiAl based catalysts was obviously observed during degradation of lignin, leading to improved bio-oil yield and lower molecular weight. The highest yield of bio-oil was up to 60.1%, when the depolymerization was conducted at 160 °C for 80 min over CuNiAl based catalyst (metal ratio of 1.5:4.5:2). The monomers and oligomers were identified by GC-MS and MALDI-TOF MS, finding p-hydroxyacetophenone (H2), guaiacol (G1), p-hydroxyacetovanillon (G5), and syringaldehyde (S3) as the main monophenols in bio-oil. The possible chemical structures for oligomers with molecular weight of 288 m/z, 306 m/z, 316 m/z, 330 m/z, 412 m/z, 426 m/z, and 456 m/z were obtained, and plausible depolymerization pathways were proposed in order to facilitate the understanding of possible relationship for the formation of prominent oligomers and monomers. This study confirmed that heterogeneous base catalysts coupled with microwave heating could provide a promising technique to convert lignin to liquid fuels. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CAL-B) is largely employed as a biocatalyst for hydrolysis, esterification, and transesterification reactions. CAL-B is a good model enzyme to study factors affecting the enzymatic structure, activity and/or stability after an immobilization process. In this study, we analyzed the immobilization of CAL-B enzyme on different magnetic nanoparticles, synthesized by the coprecipitation method inside inverse micelles made of zwitterionic surfactants, with distinct carbon chain length: 4 (ImS4), 10 (ImS10) and 18 (ImS18) carbons. Magnetic nanoparticles ImS4 and ImS10 were shown to cross-link to CAL-B enzyme via a Michael-type addition, whereas particles with ImS18 were bond via pyridine formation after glutaraldehyde cross-coupling. Interestingly, the Michael-type cross-linking generated less stable immobilized CAL-B, revealing the influence of a cross-linking mode on the resulting biocatalyst behavior. Curiously, a direct correlation between nanoparticle agglomerate sizes and CAL-B enzyme reuse stability was observed. Moreover, free CAL-B enzyme was not able to catalyze transesterification due to the high methanol concentration; however, the immobilized CAL-B enzyme reached yields from 79.7 to 90% at the same conditions. In addition, the transesterification of lipids isolated from oleaginous yeasts achieved 89% yield, which confirmed the potential of immobilized CAL-B enzyme in microbial production of biodiesel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This work aimed to study the enzymatic production of biodiesel from lipids produced by Mucor circinelloides URM 4182 using Novozym 435® as catalyst under different conditions, in which microwave irradiations were used to perform both the lipids extraction and transesterification heating. Sequential or simultaneous approaches were also investigated. In direct transesterification, ethanol serves as a solvent for lipid extraction and a reactant for the reaction, simultaneously. Cell growth and the lipids accumulation were carried out in a bioreactor containing glucose and corn steep liquor as carbon and nutrients sources, respectively. Corn steep liquor (CSL) can be a good replacement for synthetic nutrients allowing higher volumetric biomass production (3.1 ± 0.01 gL−1day−1). M. circinelloides oil revealed as main fatty acids: palmitic acid C16:0 (18.9%), oleic C18:1 (25.3%), linoleic C18:2 (19.3%) and linoleic acid C18:3 (18.3%). With regards to biodiesel synthesis, the two steps technology, which combined the lipids extraction from microbial biomass followed by enzymatic transesterification reaction both carried out under microwave irradiation, allowing for the attainment of 98.5% ethyl esters in 10 h, compared to 30 h under conventional heating. The simultaneous extraction and transesterification also shows promising results, although the ester content was slight lower (90.1%). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Neutralization of the bio-oil pH has been shown to generate a neutralized bio-oil aqueous phase (NBOAP) that includes most of the acidic components and a neutralized bio-oil organic phase (NBOOP) that includes hydrophobic organics, such as phenols. NBOOP can be used for fuel production, while NBOAP can be fed to microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) for hydrogen production. After pH neutralization, some organic acidic components remain in NBOOP. This work is focused on capturing acidic compounds from NBOOP through water extraction and electrosorption, and demonstrating hydrogen production via MECs. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is proven effective in capturing ions from NBOOP-contacted water and NBOAP via electrosorption. Captured acidic compounds enable the MEC application to effectively produce renewable hydrogen. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 49.2%, 61.5%, and 60.8% for 2, 4, and 10 g/L-anode/day loading were observed, corresponding to a total COD degradation of 0.19 g/L, 0.79 g/L, and 1.3 g/L, respectively. A maximum hydrogen productivity of 4.3 L-H2/L-anode/day was obtained. Major compounds in the water phase such as fatty acids, sugar derivatives, furanic and phenolic compounds were converted to hydrogen with an efficiency of 80–90%. This approach may lead the entire biomass pyrolysis process to be an overall carbon-neutral process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Direct electron transfer (DET) between enzymes and electrodes is a key issue for practical use of bioelectrocatalytic devices as a bioenergy process, such as enzymatic electrosynthesis, biosensors, and enzyme biofuel cells. To date, based on the DET of bioelectrocatalysis, less than 1% of the calculated theoretical current was transferred to final electron acceptor due to energy loss at enzyme-electrode interface. This study describes the design and construction of a synthetic glucose dehydrogenase (GDH; α and γ subunits) combined with a gold-binding peptide at its amino or carboxy terminus for direct contact between enzyme and electrode. The fused gold-binding peptide facilitated stable immobilization of GDH and constructed uniform monolayer of GDH onto a Au electrode. Depending on the fused site of binding peptide to the enzyme complex, nine combinations of recombinant GDH proteins on the electrode show significantly different direct electron-transfer efficiency across the enzyme-electrode interface. The fusion of site-specific binding peptide to the catalytic subunit (α subunit, carboxy terminus) of the enzyme complex enabled apparent direct electron transfer (DET) across the enzyme-electrode interface even in the absence of the electron-transfer subunit (i.e., β subunit having cytochrome domain). The catalytic glucose oxidation current at an onset potential of ca. (-)0.46 V vs Ag/AgCl was associated with the appearance of an flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)/FADH2 redox wave and a stabilized bioelectrocatalytic current of more than 100 μA, determined from chronoamperometric analysis. Electron recovery was 7.64%, and the catalytic current generation was 249 μA per GDH enzyme loading unit (U), several orders of magnitude higher than the values reported previously. These observations corroborated that the last electron donor facing to electrode was controlled to be in close proximity without electron-transfer intermediates and the native affinity for glucose was preserved. The design and construction of the site-specific "sticky-ended" proteins without loss of catalytic activity could be applied to other redox enzymes having a buried active site. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels and the oleochemical industry are highly dependent on plant oils for the generation of renewable product lines. Consequently, production of plant lipids, such as palm and rapeseed oil, for industrial applications competes with agricultural activity and is associated with a negative environmental impact. Additionally, established chemical routes for upgrading bio-lipids to renewable products depend on metal-containing catalysts. Metal leaching during oil processing results in heavy metal contaminated process wastewater. This water is difficult to remediate and leads to the loss of precious metals. Therefore, the biofuels and chemical industry requires sustainable solutions for production and upgrading of bio-lipids. With regard to the former, a promising approach is the fermentative conversion of abundant, low-value biomass into microbial, particularly yeast-based lipids. This study describes the holistic, value-adding conversion of underexploited, macroalgae feedstocks into yeast oil, animal feed and biosorbents for metal-based detoxification of process wastewater. The initial step comprises a selective enzymatic liquefaction step that yields a supernatant containing 62.5% and 59.3% (w/dwbiomass) fermentable sugars from L. digitata and U. lactuca, respectively. By dispensing with chemical pretreatment constraints, we achieved a 95% (w/w) glucose recovery. Therefore, the supernatant was qualified as a cultivation media without any detoxification step or nutrition addition. Additionally, the hydrolysis step provided 27-33% (w/dwbiomass) of a solid residue, which was qualified as a metal biosorbent. Cultivation of the oleaginous yeast C. oleaginosus on the unprocessed hydrolysis supernatant provided 44.8 g L−1 yeast biomass containing 37.1% (w/dwbiomass) lipids. The remaining yeast biomass after lipid extraction is targeted as a performance animal feed additive. Selectivity and capacity of solid macroalgae residues as biosorbents were assessed for removal and recycling of rare and heavy metals, such as Ce+3, Pb+2, Cu+2 and Ni+2 from model wastewater. The biosorption capacity of the macroalgae residues (sorption capacity ∼ 0.7 mmol g−1) exceeds that of relevant commercially available adsorption resins and biosorbents. To facilitate the integration of our technology in existing chemical and biotechnological production environments, we have devised simple, rapid and cost-efficient methods for monitoring both lipogenesis and metal sorption processes. The application of the new optical monitoring tools is essential to determine yeast cell harvesting times and biosorption capacities respectively. For the first time we report on a waste-free bioprocess that combines sustainable, microbial lipid production from low value marine biomass with in-process precious metal recycling options. Our data allowed for a preliminary economic analysis, which indicated that each product could be cost competitive with current market equivalents. Hence, the synaptic nature of the technology platform provides for the economic and ecologic viability of the overall process chain. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Biofuels were produced with waste cooking oil by Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC). The catalytic reactions involved two catalysts of Endurance and CGP-1HN, which were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), N2 Adsorption-Desorption, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Pyridine Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Py-FTIR). The results indicated that the structure and properties of Endurance and CGP-1HN were similar, and the most obvious difference between them was a different content of acid sites. The Lewis and Brönsted acid contents of Endurance were 189.39 and 341.69 μmol/g, respectively, and the Lewis and Brönsted acid contents of CGP-1HN were 21.53 and 258.23 μmol/g, respectively. The different acid sites resulted in different distributions of products under the same reaction conditions. A higher diesel yield (32.04 wt%) was achieved using Endurance, and a higher Liquefied Petroleum Gas(LPG) yield (42.71 wt%) was produced using CGP-1HN. The result shows that different type acid and acid contents effect on the product distribution. The Lewis acid sites decreases the catalytic cracking depth of waste cooking oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Particulate emissions from an urban bus fueled with B20 (20% biodiesel from waste cooking oil and 80% diesel by volume) were investigated using portable emissions measurement system (PEMS), then the effect of a catalyzed continuously regeneration trap (CCRT) on the particulate emissions of the B20-fueled bus were ascertained. Results show that compared with a D100 (pure diesel), B20 reduced particulate number (PN) and particulate mass (PM) emission rates of the bus by 13.9% and 24.3% under cruise control. Under transient condition, B20 reduced the PN and PM emission rates by 18.4% and 16.3%. B20 decreased the total PN concentration by 6.6% whereas increased the proportion of nucleation particles from 89.0% to 92.0%. Correspondingly causing a decrease in the GMD (geometric mean diameter) from 43.02 nm to 41.25 nm under cruise condition, and from 41.26 nm to 39.57 nm under transient condition. Using a CCRT exhibited an excellent filtration effect on both PN and PM from the B20-fueled bus. Both under cruise and transient conditions, CCRT could reduce more than 93% of the PN and PM. In addition, CCRT had a better filtration effect on accumulation particles. The use of CCRT also changed the particle size bimodal distribution of the B20 by removing the accumulation mode peak. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A renewable H2 was obtained via catalytic reforming/cracking of rice husk pyrolysis volatiles (RHPV) with the catalyst-employed rice husk pyrolysis carbon (RHPC) as the support. Five differently treated processes such as pyrolysis impregnation (P-I), impregnation pyrolysis (I-P), activation, acid washing (A-W), and calcining in air were employed to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The catalytic activity for bio-oil, gas, and real pyrolysis volatiles was investigated. The role of Fe and Ni was also investigated. The H2 content reached 50% for bio-oil. The catalytic activity and stability were in the following order: 0.1FeNi/RHPC(P-I) &gt; 0.1FeNi/RHPC(A-W) 0.1FeNi/RHA &gt; 0.1FeNi/RHPC-2(I-P) &gt; 0.1FeNi/AC (active carbon), which is consistent with the results of BET and NH3-TPD. It suggests that the highly active RHPC support catalyst is prepared avoiding pretreatment, activation, and calcination, which makes the preparation procedure of catalysts simple and energy saving. Bio-oil, gas, and real pyrolysis volatiles were employed to investigate the interaction and the catalytic reforming mechanism. Moreover, the characterization of the catalysts showed that the active center is the FeNi nanoalloy, and the RHPC support was an intermediate reductant to keep the stability of the catalyst via reducing the metal oxides. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A techno-economic assessment was conducted to estimate the capital and operating costs of a hypothetic biofuel system based on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of forest residues in British Columbia. Three scenarios were investigated to understand how supply chain designs could influence the system's economic performance. The minimum selling price (MSP) of HTL biofuels was found to be 63%–80% higher than that of petroleum fuels. Converting forest residues to bio-oil and wood pellet before being transported to the conversion facility can lower the variable operating cost but not the MSP of HTL biofuels, due to the considerable increase in capital investment. Processing parameters such as the yield of bio-oil and biofuel can significantly influence the MSP of HTL biofuels, therefore, technology advancement can make great contribution in reducing the production cost. Alternatively, a high carbon tax is needed to make the HTL biofuels competitive with petroleum fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The co-pyrolysis of pretreated lignin and soapstock was carried out to upgrade vapors under microwave irradiation. Results showed that the yield of 29.92–42.21 wt% of upgraded liquid oil was achieved under varied pretreatment conditions. Char yield decreased from 32.44 wt% for untreated control to 24.35 wt% for the 150 °C pretreated samples. The increased temperature, irradiation time and acid concentration were conducive to decrease the relative contents of phenols and oxygenates in liquid oils. The main components of the liquid oil were gasoline fraction (mono-aromatics and C5–C12 aliphatics), which ranged from 57.38 to 71.98% under various pretreatment conditions. Meanwhile, the diesel fraction (C12+ aliphatics) ranged from 13.16 to 22.62% from co-pyrolysis of pretreated lignin and soapstock, comparing with 10.18% of C12+ aliphatics from co-pyrolysis of non-pretreated lignin and soapstock. A possible mechanism was proposed for co-pyrolysis of pretreated lignin and soapstock for upgraded liquid oils. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hybrid process that integrated fermentation, pervaporation and esterification was established aiming to improve the economic feasibility of the conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process. Candida sp 99–125 cells were used as full-cell catalyst. The feasibility of batch and fed-batch esterification using the ABE permeate of pervaporation (ranging from 286.9 g/L to 402.9 g/L) as substrate were compared. Valuable butyl oleate was produced along with ethyl oleate. For the batch esterification, due to severe inhibition of substrate to lipase, the yield of butyl oleate and ethyl oleate were only 24.9% and 3.3%, respectively. In contrast, 75% and 11.8% of butyl oleate and ethyl oleate were obtained, respectively, at the end of the fed-batch esterification. The novel integration process provides a promising strategy for in situ upgrading ABE products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fast pyrolysis of biomass forms bio-oil, char, and light noncondensable gases. Bio-oil is the desired product in context of converting biomass to biofuel. The effect of temperature on bio-oil yield and composition is anticipated to be different under reaction-limited and transport-limited operating conditions. Attaining fundamental understanding of the effect of temperature and transport on bio-oil yield and composition is challenging, because of limited knowledge of pyrolysis chemistry and the inter-relationship between chemistry and transport. In this work, we performed thin-film and powder pyrolysis experiments to investigate the thermal decomposition of glucose (biomass model compound) under both reaction-controlled and transport-limited operating conditions. In thin-film (size ≤10 μm) experiments, the effect of temperature on pyrolysis product distribution, especially on bio-oil yield and composition, was studied. In addition, using the thin-film data, mechanistic insights into glucose decomposition were provided and a map of reaction pathways was proposed. Decomposition of glucose in the reaction-controlled regime is initiated by dehydration reactions. With increase in temperature, anhydrosugars (viz, levoglucosan and levoglucosenone) apparently converted to furans (hydroxymethylfurfural) and light oxygenates (formic acid/methyl glyoxal), respectively, as ring opening and fragmentation reactions became more facile. Pyrans remained relatively stable. The effect of transport was investigated by performing pyrolysis experiments with different particle sizes. The variation in the yield and composition of bio-oil, with respect to temperature and particle size, was also analyzed. In the case of glucose powder, levoglucosan yield increased significantly with particle size but decreased marginally with temperature, while hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural, formic acid, and methyl glyoxal yields monotonically increased as the temperature and particle size each increased. A thin film of glucose gave a lower yield of bio-oil and a higher yield of char than that of glucose powder. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Diminishing fossil fuel reserves and the increasing consumption of light olefins are driving intensive research to find a new non-petrochemical substitute resource to produce light olefins. Biomass-derived bio-oil is a promising substitute resource because it is renewable, abundant, and carbon-neutral. In this study, three bio-oil models, oleic acid (OA), methyl laurate (ML), and waste cooking oil (WCO), were catalytically cracked over La2O3-modified ZSM-5 (LaZ) aiming for production of light olefins. The content of La2O3 in catalysts was adjusted to optimize the structure and properties of catalysts. The maximal light olefin yield was 131 mL/g for OA, 120 mL/g for ML, and 128 mL/g for WCO, which was obtained over the LaZ catalyst containing 6% La2O3 (6LaZ). The maximal light olefin selectivity was 36.1% for OA, 30.3% for ML, and 33.8% for WCO. The obtained light olefins mainly contained propylene (13.6-17.1%), ethylene (10.7-15.4%), and butene (5.3-6.3%). Aromatic hydrocarbons and graphite were the main components in the liquid product and solid product (coke), respectively. 6LaZ exhibited better catalytic activity and anticoking ability than La-free ZSM-5, which was attributed to its appropriate porosity and acidity. The unsaturated molecular structure of feedstock was found, helping to improve the light olefin yield. Our investigations are useful for developing a new process route to produce light olefins from renewable biomass resources. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The performance of a pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) for treating antibiotic solvent wastewater under different cross flow velocities (CFV) was investigated. Effects of mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS), colloid total organic carbon (TOC) and CFV on membrane fouling rate (RMF) were also explored in this paper. Throughout 341 days of experiment, the average total removal rate of N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was 98.5% which hardly affected by the variation of CFV, and the compliance rate of DMF was 92% according to the Chinese standard (&lt;25 mg/L). However, the relevant high total removal rate of M-cresol (MC) was achieved as 97.5%, the content of effluent failed to meet the national level emission standard (&lt;0.1 mg/L). The biogas yield and the methane content of the biogas increased gradually with the increase of CFV, and the average methane content were over 70%. There were four kinds of methanogens in AnMBR, Methanosaeta spp was the largest methanogenic community, with an area of 45–70% of the archae. There was a linear relationship between colloid TOC and RMF at different MLSS concentrations. Then a universal mathematical model for the changes of RMF with influence factors was established. The result showed that model well fitted the laboratory data. It is suggested that the model proposed could reflect and manage the membrane fouling of AnMBR treating antibiotic solvent wastewater. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A reductive fractionation process for the valorization of Quercus suber bark toward hydrocarbons in gasoline and diesel ranges and optionally 4-ethylguaiacol has been developed. The procedure involves three steps: (1) tandem hydrogen-free Pd/C-catalyzed transfer hydrogenolysis of lignin where the carbohydrates serve as an inherent hydrogen donor under slightly alkaline conditions to also facilitate the depolymerization of suberin, (2) optional distillation, to isolate the 4-ethylguaiacol, (3) hydrodeoxygenation of the mixture from the first step by a Pt-MoO3/TiO2 catalyst generated hydrocarbons in gasoline and diesel ranges. The yield of 4-ethylguaiacol (90% purity) is 2.6% of dry bark weight (12% of acid insoluble lignin), and yield of hydrocarbon bio-oil is 42% of dry bark weight. This corresponds to a theoretical maximum yield of 77% for lignin and suberin. The carbon yield of the obtained bio-oil is thereby 64% from the total initial bark. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A route for directional conversion of bio-oil into phenol by means of coupling the catalytic cracking of the bio-oil with the hydroxylation of the bio-oil-based benzene-rich aromatics is proposed. High selectivity for phenol in the resulting organic liquid was achieved, with an almost complete conversion of the bio-oil. Co-cracking of the bio-oil with methanol over a Zn-modified zeolite significantly enhanced the yields of aromatics and decreased the deactivation of the catalyst during the catalytic cracking of the bio-oil. The phenol yield depended on the metal oxide catalysts, the temperature, and the reaction time during hydroxylation of the benzene-rich aromatics. The reaction pathway of converting bio-oil into phenol was elucidated based on the products identified and the characterization of the catalysts. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Levulinate esters are versatile chemicals that have been used in various fields. Herein, the production of ethyl levulinate (EL) from corn stover was investigated under microwave irradiation. Several reaction parameters, including acid concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time, and liquid-to-solid mass ratio, were investigated to evaluate the reaction conditions. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the reaction conditions for the production of EL. A quadratic polynomial model was fitted to the data with an R2 value of 0.93. The model validation results reflected a good fit between the experimental and predicted values. A high conversion yield (58.1 mol%) was obtained at the optimum conditions of 190 °C, 30.4 min, 2.84 wt% acid, and 15 g/g liquid-to-solid mass ratio. Compared with conventional heating, microwave irradiation facilitated the conversion of corn stover to EL by dramatically shortening the reaction time from several hours to ∼30 min. Thus, microwave-assisted conversion of corn stover to EL is an efficient way of utilizing a renewable biomass resource. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass is expected to play a significant role in power generation in the near future. With the uprising of carbon fuel cells, hybrid direct carbon fuel cells (HDCFCs) show its intrinsic and incomparable advantages in the generation of clean energy with higher efficiency. In this study, two types of biomass treated by physical sieve and pyrolysis from raw sawdust are investigated on an anode-supported HDCFC. The structure and thermal analysis indicate that raw sawdust has well-formed cellulose I phase with very low ash. Electrochemical performance behaviors for sieved and pyrolyzed sawdust combined with various weight ratios of carbonate are compared in N2 and CO2 purge gas. The results show that the power output of sieved sawdust with 789 mWcm−2 is superior to that of pyrolyzed sawdust in CO2 flowing, as well as in N2 flowing. The anode reaction mechanism for the discrepancy of two fuels is explained and the emphasis is also placed on the modified oxygen-reduction cycle mechanism of catalytic effects of Li2CO3 and K2CO3 salts in promoting cell performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A fermented solid containing lipases was produced by solid-state fermentation of Rhizopus microsporus on sugarcane bagasse enriched with urea, soybean oil, and a mineral solution. The dry fermented solid produced using R. microsporus (RMFS) was used to catalyze the synthesis of alkyl-esters by esterification in a solvent-free system containing ethanol and oleic acid (as a model system) or a mixture of fatty acids obtained from the physical hydrolysis of soybean soapstock acid oil (FA-SSAO) in subcritical water. The conversions were 93.5 and 84.1%, for oleic acid and FA-SSAO, respectively, at 48 h and 40 °C, at a molar ratio (MR) of ethanol to fatty acid of 5:1. A further increase in the MR to 10:1 improved the production of ethylic-esters, giving conversions at 48 h of 98 and 86% for oleic acid and FA-SSAO, respectively. The results obtained in this work foster further studies on scaling-up of an environmentally friendly process to produce biofuels. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - One of the major obstacles for the application of biomass gasification systems is the relatively high tar content of the producer gas that can inhibit its use in engines or turbines or in further processes like methanation or conversion to other secondary fuels or chemicals. Moreover, tars are difficult to define and also because of the different attempts to do so remains the determination of its content challenging. Nowadays conventional wet chemical and other standard methods for the determination of tars are very time consuming and do not allow continuous online monitoring of the gas quality. Furthermore, the execution by different users can affect the results. One approach to avoid these disadvantages is an automatic system that monitors the tar concentration in the producer gas online during the gasification process. Such an automatic system was developed at IFK in the past with the goal of commercialization and moreover better comparability of the results from tar measuring. To show its accuracy and advantages over standard methods, comparative measurements with the standard method DIN CEN/TS 15439 at an electrically heated lab scale gasifier at different settings have been performed at IFK over several hours. Then, the results of both measurement techniques were compared to each other. The results show a stable operation of the gasifier and therefore also the tar production and its fast detection with the online system. Furthermore, the comparison of the results from both measurement techniques shows good agreement. A satisfying validation of the online method could be conducted. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the most important aspects in the catalytic cracking of bio-oil is understanding the kinetics of the process.The aim of this paper was to study the kinetics of bio-oil cracking with a silica-alumina catalyst using a continuous fixed-bed reactor. The reaction was studied over the temperature range of 450 to 600 °C with a catalyst bed length of 1 to 4 cm. Three models, Models 1, 2, and 3, were proposed to represent the catalytic cracking kinetics of bio-oil. Model 1 was based on the cracking of bio-oil into the products, while Models 2 and 3 were based on the three-and four-lump models, respectively. The results showed that the rate constants of the catalytic cracking of bio-oil increased with an increasing temperature. The reaction rate constants of the catalytic cracking of bio-oil using Model 1 ranged from 0.221 to 0.416 cm3/g cat·min with an activation energy of 22.3 kJ/mol. It was found that the reaction rate constants from Model 2 can be employed to describe the cracking phenomenon of bio-oil, liquid hydrocarbons, and gas and coke, whereas Model 3 can illustrate the kinetics of bio-oil, kerosene, gasoline, and gas and coke cracking.

AB  - A novel strategy for the synthesis of high-density biofuel using two biomass-derived oxygenated compounds, furfural and guaiacol, with a variety of heterogeneous catalysts is proposed. In the first step of this strategy, furfural is converted with high yields and selectivity to cyclopentanol (CPOL) over Mg-Al supported Cu catalysts. Then, the cyclopentanol is used to alkylate guaiacol over a series of HY zeolites to generate C9-C16 oxygenates with an appropriate molecular weight to be used as transportation fuels. Finally, in the last step of this catalytic strategy, the C-alkylation products are successfully hydrodeoxygenated over ruthenium nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (Ru/MWCNT), producing a liquid mixture of cyclic hydrocarbons with high density (0.865 g mL-1 at 20 °C) and excellent low-temperature properties. This overall reaction route is a promising approach for converting biomass-derived compounds into transportation fuel precursors. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Bio-oil from biomass fast pyrolysis is considered to be an important feedstock for the production of renewable fuels and green chemicals. Fast pyrolysis bio-oil generally contains a water-soluble fraction (excluding water), a water-insoluble fraction (i.e., pyrolytic lignin, PL), and water in a single phase. However, phase separation can occur during bio-oil transport, storage, and processing. In this study, a mixed solvent (MS) is developed based on the compositions of various fast pyrolysis bio-oils produced from a wide range of feedstocks and reactor systems. Experiments are then carried out to investigate the phase behavior of the PL/MS/water ternary system. Several ternary phase diagrams are constructed for PL and its fractions, and the PL solubilities in various MS/water mixtures are also estimated. Under the experimental conditions, the PL solubility in the MS is high, i.e., ∼112 g per 100 g of MS. In the PL/MS/water system, an increase in water content to ∼17 wt% in the MS/water mixture leads to a slight increase in the PL solubility to a maximal value of ∼118 g per 100 g of MS/water mixture, followed by a gradual decrease in the PL solubility when the water content further increases. It is found that the phase stability of the PL/MS/water system is strongly determined by the composition of the system. For example, the PL/MS/water system is always stable when the MS content is >50 wt%, while the system is always phase-separated when the PL content is >54 wt%. A comparison of the results for various PL fractions indicates that the molecular weight of PL can affect the ternary phase diagram, with the PL of a lower molecular weight having a higher solubility in the same MS/water mixture. The presence of free sugar (i.e., levoglucosan, present in bio-oil as solute) also influences the ternary phase diagram of the PL/MS/system, but only at a low water content (i.e., < 20 wt%). The results suggest that such ternary diagrams may be potentially an important tool for predicting the phase separation of bio-oil, as a result of changes in the bio-oil chemistry in various processes (e.g., cold-water precipitation and aging). © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Raw and charred walnut shells were investigated as solid fuels in direct carbon solid fuel cells operating within the temperature range 600–850 °C. Char was prepared by means of thermal processing of pulverised shells in a quartz reactor within a temperature range of 400–850 °C. Elemental analysis identified high carbon and marginally low sulphur contents in char obtained from biomass-derived solid waste. With increased temperatures, a greater degree of carbonisation of raw material was observed in the char, along with reduced sulphur and hydrogen contents. XRD and Raman spectroscopy investigations showed that the char samples were characterised by a disordered carbon structure. The particles were characterised by the presence of smaller isometric particles as well as a porous structure. Thermogravimetric analysis performed in a pure CO2 gas atmosphere within a temperature range of 25–850 °C demonstrated a substantial loss of mass due to CO production via the Boudouard reaction. Tests showed that DC-SOFCs supplied by char obtained from walnut shells were characterised by stable operation with reasonably satisfactory levels of current and power density. A significant improvement was noted in the performance of a DC-SOFC supplied by all forms of char when CO2, as opposed to N2, was used as the shielding gas in the anode chamber. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of immobilized enzymes as biocatalysts has great potential to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of many industrial processes. Here, we report a novel approach that allows for the direct production of a highly active immobilized lipase within the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Cry3Aa-lipA crystals were generated by genetically fusing Bacillus subtilis lipase A to Cry3Aa, a protein that naturally forms crystals in the bacteria. The crystal framework significantly stabilized the lipase against denaturation in organic solvents and high temperatures, resulting in a highly efficient fusion crystal that could catalyze the conversion of triacylglycerols to fatty acid methyl ester biodiesel to near-completion over 10 cycles. The simplicity and robustness of the Cry-fusion crystal (CFC) immobilization system could make it an appealing platform for generating industrial biocatalysts for multiple bioprocesses. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Algal systems have emerged as a promising strategy for simultaneous treatment and valorization of wastewater. However, further advancement and real-world implementation are hindered by the limited knowledge on the full energetic and nutrient product potentials of such systems and the corresponding value of these products. In this work, an aqueous-based system for the conversion of wastewater-derived algae and upgrading of crude products was designed and demonstrated. Bio-oil, fuel gas, and fertilizer products were generated from algal biomass harvested from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. Experiments showed that 68% of chemical energy contained in the algal biomass could be recovered with 44% in upgraded bio-oil and 23% in fuel gas (calculated as higher heating values), and 44% and 91% of nitrogen and phosphorus element contents in the original feedstock could be recovered as fertilizer products (ammonium sulfate and struvite), respectively. For 1,000 kg of such dry algal biomass, these products had an estimated total value of $427 (in 2014 U.S. dollars). For the first time, experiment-based energy and nutrient recovery potentials of wastewater-derived algae were presented in an integrated manner. Findings also revealed critical research needs and suggested strategies to further improve resource recovery and waste valorization in these systems. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The release of refined soybean oil wastewater (RSOW) with a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and oil content burdens the environment. The conversion of RSOW into lipids by oleaginous yeasts may be a good way to turn this waste into usable products. Results: The oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans was used for treating the RSOW without sterilization, dilution, or nutrient supplementation. It was found that the COD and oil content of the RSOW were removed effectively; microbial oil was abundantly produced in 48 h; and the phospholipids in the RSOW tended to contribute to a higher biomass and microbial lipid content. With Plackett-Burman design and response surface design experiments, the optimal wastewater treatment conditions were determined: temperature 28.3 °C, amount of inoculum 5.9% (v/v), and initial pH 6.1. The optimized conditions were used in a 5-L bioreactor to treat the RSOW. The maximum COD degradation of 94.7% was obtained within 40 h, and the removal of the oil content was 89.9%. The biomass was 7.9 g/L, the lipid concentration was 3.4 g/L, and the lipid content was 43% (w/w). The microbial oil obtained, with a main component of unsaturated fatty acids, was similar to vegetable oils and was suggested as a potential raw material for biodiesel production. Conclusion: Trichosporon fermentans can be effectively used for RSOW treatment, and lipid production and can complete pretreatment and biochemical treatment simultaneously, allowing the utilization of RSOW, which both solves an environmental problem and positively impacts the use of resources. These results provide valuable information for developing and designing more efficient waste-into-lipid bioprocesses. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Particle-resolved CFD simulations of multilayered packed beds containing 30 particles of different particle shapes (trilobe, daisy, hollow cylinder, cylcut, and 7-hole cylinder) with a tube to particle diameter ratio of 5, were performed to understand the effect of particle shape on pressure drop (ΔP), dispersion, CH4 conversion and effectiveness factors for methane steam reforming reactions. The effect of different boundary conditions and particle modeling approaches were analyzed in detail. The empirical correlations (Ergun and Zhavoronkov et al.) over-predicted the ΔP and a modified correlation was developed to predict ΔP for the particles with different shapes. Overall, the externally shaped particles (trilobe and daisy) offered lower ΔP and higher dispersion because of the lower surface area and higher back flow regions, whereas the internally shaped particles (cylcut, hollow, and 7-hole cylinder) offered higher CH4 conversion and effectiveness factors because of the better access for the reactants. The cylcut-shape offered the highest CH4 conversion/ΔP. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 4162–4176, 2018. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - An efficient method for microwave-assisted low temperature catalytic elimination of primary tars using cheap biochar as catalyst has been developed along with H2 rich syngas production. Tar removal efficiency reached 94.03% after 8 min reaction at 600 °C, while the concentration of H2 and syngas was up to 50.5 vol% and 94.5 vol% respectively, which were significantly comparable to conventional technologies at 700–900 °C. The FT-IR, ICP and EDX results indicated that the biochar surface contained O-containing functional groups and 12.6 wt% uniformly dispersed alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in the carbon skeleton. The low temperature behaviours were attributed to the hot spots, which were induced by the increased dielectric properties of biochar and decentralized AAEMs under microwave heating. Possible reaction mechanism for the elimination of primary tars over biochar catalysts were discussed based on this experimental study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Radiata pine with black liquor from an existing Kraft pulp mill. The biomass into the HTL process was assumed at 2000 t/day and converted into bio-crude through the HTL process and upgraded to produce a gasoline and diesel blend. The HTL process was scaled-up based on an existing published patent. Mass and heat balance of the process was obtained through the process simulator, Aspen Plus. Process Integration was carried out to minimise the hot and cold utility of the process. The production rate of the process is 78.7 kt/y of fuel. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) was estimated at 0.95 USD/LGE (litre gasoline equivalent). A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the MFSP in 2017 and to study the changes of MFSP due to the uncertainty in the capital cost estimation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agave tequilana bagasse is the main solid waste of the tequila manufacturing and represents an environmental issue as well as a potential feedstock for biofuel production due to its lignocellulosic composition and abundance. In this contribution, this feedstock was subjected to pretreatments with HCl and H2SO4 for sugar recovery and methane was produced from the hydrolysates in batch and sequencing batch reactors (AnSBR). Sugar recovery was optimized by using central composite designs at different levels of temperature, acid concentration and hydrolysis time. Results showed that at optimal conditions, the HCl pretreatment induced higher sugar recoveries than the H2SO4 one, 0.39 vs. 0.26 g total sugars/g bagasse. Furthermore, the H2SO4 hydrolysate contained higher concentrations of potential inhibitory compounds (furans and acetic acid). Subsequent anaerobic batch assays demonstrated that the HCl hydrolysate is a more suitable substrate for methane production; a four-fold increase was found. A second optimization by using HCl as acid catalyst and methane production as the response variable demonstrated that softer hydrolysis conditions are required to optimize methane production as compared to sugar recovery (1.8% HCl, 119 °C and 103min vs. 1.9% HCl, 130 °C and 133min). This softer conditions were used to feed an AnSBR for 110 days and evaluate its stability at three different cycle times (5, 3 and 2 days). Results showed stable reactor performances at cycle times of 5 and 3 days, obtaining the highest methane yield and production at 3 days, 0.28 NL CH4/g-COD and 1.04 NL CH4/d respectively. Operation at shorter cycle times is not advised due to microbial imbalance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A bottleneck in the production of biodiesel from microalgae is the dewatering and lipid extraction process which is the dominant energy penalty and cost. A novel biodiesel production platform based on vortex fluidic device (VFD)-assisted direct transesterification (DT) of wet microalgal biomass of Chloroparva pannonica was developed and evaluated. Fatty acid extraction and fatty acid to FAME conversion efficiencies were used at different parameter settings to evaluate performance of the processing technology in confined and continuous mode. A response surface method based on Box-Behnken experimental design was used to determine the effects of water content, the ratio of biomass to methanol and residence time in the VFD. Average extraction efficiencies were 41% and conversion efficiencies >90% with the processing technology showing a broad tolerance to parameter settings. The findings suggest that VFD-assisted DT is a simple and effective way to produce biodiesel directly from wet microalgae biomass at room temperature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Iranian energy sector has recently discovered a great interest in the concept of renewable and clean energy. The interest is motivated primarily by concerns about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global climate change, as well as the desire to find alternative and sustainable energy sources and create potential job opportunities related to these new technologies for future generations of Iranians. This study supports the search for alternative, sustainable energy sources by assessing okra's usability as a biofuel. Okra is an annual, warm season crop that provides a rich source of industrial oil and protein. According to our investigation, the seeds of Iranian okra ecotypes that have an oil content of 20% could produce up to 325 kg/ha oil yield. Our study on Iranian okra seed oil showed that, the most dominant fatty acids of are linoleic acid (C18:2) (38–40%), Palmitic acid (C16:0) (29–30%), and Oleic acid (C18:1) (19–22%). The biodiesel derived from okra via a transesterification reaction using an ultrasonic system could meet ASTM D6751 standards with satisfactory results in methyl ester content (more than 96%), viscosity (2.3–2.4 mm −2 /S, and flash point (155–158 °C)). Because of its high oil yield, quality, and large ecological adaptation window, okra is a strong contender to provide a new source of non-edible oil for biodiesel production in bioenergy farms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of palm oil and diesel blended with ethanol, known as a microemulsion biofuel, is gaining attention as an attractive renewable fuel for engines that may serve as a replacement for fossil-based fuels. The microemulsion biofuels can be formulated from the mixture of palm oil and diesel as the oil phase; ethanol as the polar phase; methyl oleate as the surfactant; alkanols as the cosurfactants. This study investigates the influence of the three cosurfactants on fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions in a direct-injection (DI) diesel engine. The microemulsion biofuels along with neat diesel fuel, palm oil-diesel blends, and biodiesel-diesel blends were tested in a DI diesel engine at two engine loads without engine modification. The formulated microemulsion biofuels increased fuel consumption and gradually reduced the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and exhaust gas temperature; however, there was no significant difference in their carbon monoxide (CO) emissions when compared to those of diesel. Varying the carbon chain length of the cosurfactant demonstrated that the octanol-microemulsion fuel emitted lower CO and NOx emissions than the butanol-and decanol-microemulsion fuels. Thus, the microemulsion biofuels demonstrated competitive advantages as potential fuels for diesel engines because they reduced exhaust emissions. © 2018 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.

AB  - The use of liquid or gaseous biofuels in reciprocating internal combustion engines (ICEs) is today a relevant issue as these systems are largely diffused for both steady power generation and transportation due to their flexibility and easiness of use. The improvement and perfect control of the combustion process under non-conventional fueling is mandatory to achieve high-energy efficiency without substantial changes to the architecture or the fuel supply system. In this perspective, the detailed characterization of multiphase reacting systems achievable though computational fluid dynamics (CFD) may give a decisive contribution. However, the assessed combustion models used for fossil fuels (diesel oil, gasoline, methane), tuned on the ground of a massive amount of experimental data, often results poor in predicting the actual behavior of renewable fuels whose composition and properties may change also according to technology for their production. Present work aims at filling some existing gaps in biofuel combustion modeling by performing investigations on two representative engine cases, for their characterization and performance enhancement. Two approaches are followed, namely through reduced chemical kinetics coupled with turbulence within a coherent flame schematization, and through a turbulent species transport approach with detailed kinetics. Simulations are first carried out on a compression ignition (CI) ICE. The formulation of a 3D CFD model is described to reproduce the performance of this engine in a dual-fuel mode with premixed syngas from biomass gasification and a biodiesel pilot injection leading to self-ignition. Pollutants formation and energy efficiency are calculated as syngas amount and the biodiesel start of injection (SOI) are varied. Attention is then focused on the implementation of renewable alcohol fuels (ethanol and butanol), as these lasts are receiving large interest due to low production costs. A validated reduced kinetic mechanism for PRF-ethanol-butanol combustion performs well in multi-component oxidation conditions, as well as in neat fuel oxidation conditions, in terms of ignition delay time, laminar flame speed and HCCI combustion conditions. The paper shows that CFD, even at different level of approximation, may describe into detail the combustion process and provide important guidelines for the design of new generation ICEs fuelled by biofuels. © Copyright © 2018 Costa and Piazzullo.

AB  - Pyrolysis oil of rubber seed oil (RSO) was upgraded by methyl esterificationusingSO42−/ZrO2 solid acid as catalyst. The activity and reusability of SO42−/ZrO2 solid acid were investigated and the experiment indicated that the esterification rate could reach 99.62% and was still above 95% in the third reaction. The component of SO42−/ZrO2 solid acid changed little after the third used. The properties of the obtained biofuel were studied and the results showed they were superior to pyrolysis oil and biodiesel, and similar to 0# diesel. The methyl esterification reaction kinetics was researched. The kinetics calculation indicated that the reaction order of the methyl esterification is 1.058, and Arrhenius equation can be expressed as k1=7.711×106e-[Formula presented]. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To inspire upper-division undergraduate students to gain a deeper understanding of biorefinery, an experiment related to biofuels and lignin-based sunscreen products from corncob was performed in multiple offerings of a summer-semester class. Specifically, corncobs were pretreated with 1% H2SO4 to obtain hemicellulose hydrolysates, which were detoxified, and followed with oleaginous yeast fermentation to yield microbial lipids. The microbial lipids were chemically transesterified into biodiesel in situ by an alkali catalyst. Subsequently, dilute acid-pretreated corncob residue was enzymatically saccharified to release glucose for ethanol production by separation hydrolysis and fermentation. Finally, the resultant lignin from the cellulosic ethanol production was valorized to make sunscreen. The main objectives of this work are to introduce students to integrated biorefinery concepts and techniques so that they can learn how to obtain added-value products from waste materials and to evoke students' awareness of environmental issues. © 2018 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - Background: Pretreatments are one of the main bottlenecks for the lignocellulose conversion process and the search for cheaper and effective pretreatment methodologies for each biomass is a complex but fundamental task. Here, we used a 2ν5-1 fractional factorial design (FFD) to optimize five pretreatment variables: milling time, temperature, double treatment, chemical concentration, and pretreatment time in acid-alkali (EA) and acid-organosolv (EO) pretreatments, applied to elephant grass leaves. Results: FFD allowed optimization of the pretreatment conditions using a reduced number of experiments and allowed the identification of secondary interactions between the factors. FFD showed that the temperature can be kept at its lower level and that the first acid step can be eliminated in both pretreatments, without significant losses to enzymatic hydrolysis. EA resulted in the highest release of reducing sugars (maximum of 205 mg/g substrate in comparison to 152 mg/g in EO and 40 mg/g in the untreated sample), using the following conditions in the alkali step: [NaOH] = 4.5% w/v; 85 °C and 100 min after ball milling the sample. The factors statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) in EA pretreatment were NaOH concentration, which contributes to improved hydrolysis by lignin and silica removal, and the milling time, which has a mechanical effect. For EO samples, the statistically significant factors to improved hydrolysis were ethanol and catalyst concentrations, which are both correlated to higher cellulose amounts in the pretreated substrates. The catalyst is also correlated to lignin removal. The detailed characterization of the main hemicellulosic sugars in the solids after pretreatments revealed their distinct recalcitrance: glucose was typically more recalcitrant than xylose and arabinose, which could be almost completely removed under specific pretreatments. In EA samples, the removal of hemicellulose derivatives was very dependent on the acid step, especially arabinose removal. Conclusion: The results presented herewith contribute to the development of more efficient and viable pretreatments to produce cellulosic ethanol from grass biomasses, saving time, costs and energy. They also facilitate the design of enzymatic cocktails and a more appropriate use of the sugars contained in the pretreatment liquors, by establishing the key recalcitrant polymers in the solids resulting from each processing step. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Furfural (FF) is obtained from lignocellulosic biomass and is a promising platform chemical that can produce valuable chemicals including furfuryl alcohol (FA) and 2-methylfuran (MF). We synthesized both FA and MF using electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (ECH) of FF in acidic electrolyte using a Cu electrode. We investigated the role of concurrent side reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polymerization of furanic compounds during ECH, as well as the potential dependence of the reaction pathway for ECH of FF. As the magnitude of applied potential increased, both ECH and HER were promoted. Polymerization of furanic compounds was diminished by lowering the initial concentration of FF, but at a cost of increased the HER activity. In contrast, higher concentrations of FF suppressed the HER, though excessive initial concentrations of FF resulted in lowering the activity of both ECH and the HER due to a polymeric film being formed on the electrode. The highest mole balances and faradaic efficiencies towards ECH were achieved at −0.5 V, though at the expense of lower conversions of FF than those obtained at greater overpotentials. We also found that the ECH of FF followed two parallel reactions to independently produce FA and MF on Cu in 0.5 m H2SO4 regardless of the applied potential. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Chemical fixation of CO2 and synthesis of biofuels through convenient reaction pathways are very demanding in the context of sustainable and eco-friendly catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of iron-phosphonate nanoparticles HPFP-1(NP) through the simple chemical reaction between hexamethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(methylphosphonic acid) and FeCl3 under hydrothermal conditions. The material has been characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), N2 adsorption/desorption studies and FE-SEM. This porous material showed high catalytic activity for the synthesis of organic carbonates from a wide range of epoxides at room temperature in the presence of CO2 at atmospheric pressure. This nanocatalyst also exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the conversion of levulinic acid into alkyl levulinates. The HPFP-1(NP) catalyst showed high recycling efficiency in these catalytic reactions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study extended previous work investigating two-step liquefaction by supercritical ethanol of rice straw under CO2 atmosphere at temperatures of 270–345 °C. Subcritical CO2–subcritical ethanol (SubCO2–SubEtOH) pretreatment decreased the content of lignin in the rice stalk from 22.94 to 21.43 wt%. The results showed that although oxygen-transfer reaction, transesterification, carbonylation, and other reactions may occur with the supercritical CO2–supercritical ethanol (ScCO2–ScEtOH) liquefaction reactions, transesterification was the main reaction. The “de-oxygen-transfer” reaction mainly comprised de-oxygenation and decarboxylation. For temperatures exceeding 320 °C, the bio-oil yield decreased because the effects of esters decreased. The residence time affected the H/C and O/C ratios to a minor extent. It was shown that the nucleophilic and hydrolytic functions of ethanol might be strengthened, generating higher amounts of ester, phenolic, acidic, and hydrocarbon derivatives in the bio-oil fraction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Even though a shift from conventional to renewable resources is often envisaged, lignocellulosic biorefinery concepts struggle with economic viability and sustainability. In order to overcome these barriers, a full analysis from biomass supply chain, process performance optimization, and product-portfolio selection is targeted. Addressing the economic viability and sustainability already at an early process development stage when only limited knowledge is available, Process Network Flux Analysis (PNFA) [Ulonska et al., AIChE J. 2017, 62, 3096-3108] is capable of systematically identifying the most valuable processing pathways. This enables a first performance ranking based on the profit or global warming potential of pathways, thereby accelerating process development. While so far only processing networks have been considered, the methodology is herein extended to consider biomass supply chain optimization and market-dependent price developments such that all main influencing factors are considered simultaneously. The extended methodology is validated identifying reasonable plant locations in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Enhancing economic viability of the best performing biofuel ethanol, a multiproduct biorefinery is targeted coproducing value-added chemicals. Herein, a coproduction of iso-butanol raises the profit significantly: a mass ratio of at most 1.9 (ethanol:iso-butanol) is required to break even. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A hierarchical mesoporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) was processed based on cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a morphological regulating agent and amino acid (L-histidine) as assisting template agent. Burkholderia cepacia lipase (BCL) was successfully immobilized by ZIF-8 as the carrier via an adsorption method (BCL-ZIF-8). The immobilized lipase (BCL) showed utmost activity recovery up to 1279%, a 12-fold boost in its free counterpart. BCL-ZIF-8 was used as a biocatalyst in the transesterification reaction for the production of biodiesel with 93.4% yield. There was no significant lowering of conversion yield relative to original activity for BCL-ZIF-8 when continuously reused for eight cycles. This work provides a new outlook for biotechnological importance by immobilizing lipase on the hybrid catalyst (ZIF-8) and opens the door for its uses in the industrial field. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Direct electron transfer bioelectrocatalysis is an essential type of reaction for the development of bioelectrochemical devices such as biosensors, biofuel cells, and bioreactors. In this work, we performed several modifications of mesoporous electrodes to improve the heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics and the orientation of three different enzymes: bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria, hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F, and tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The results are discussed based on the curvature effects of mesoporous structures, the edge effect of the diffuse double layer around microporous structures, and the electrostatic interactions between enzymes and electrodes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: In the last years, the most outstanding trend for obtaining high added-value components and second-generation (2G) biofuels consisted on exploitation of plant biomass. But recently, 3G biofuels, based in algae biomass, have emerged as a great alternative for production of energy. Results: In this work, a versatile β-glucosidase from the ascomycete fungus Talaromyces amestolkiae has been purified, characterized, and heterologously expressed. The synthesis of this β-glucosidase (BGL-3) was not induced by cellulose, and the presence of a specific carbon source is not required for its production, which is uncommon for β-glucosidases. BGL-3, which was obtained from a basal medium with glucose as carbon source, was profusely secreted under carbon starvation conditions, which was corroborated by qRT-PCR assays. BGL-3 was purified from T. amestolkiae cultures in one step, and biochemically characterized. The enzyme showed high thermal stability, and very high efficiency on pNPG (K m of 0.14 mM and V max of 381.1 U/mg), cellobiose (K m of 0.48 mM and V max of 447.1 U/mg), and other cello-oligosaccharides. Surprisingly, it also showed remarkable ability to hydrolyze laminarin, a β-1,3-glucan present in algae. The recombinant enzyme, obtained in the yeast Pichia pastoris, exhibited kinetic and physicochemical properties similar to those found for the native protein. Enzyme efficiency was examined in wheat straw saccharification processes, in which BGL-3 worked better supplementing Celluclast 1.5L than the commercial cellulase cocktail N-50010. Besides, BGL-3 hydrolyzed laminarin more efficiently than a commercial laminarinase. Conclusions: A very efficient 1,4-β-glucosidase, which also showed activity over 1,3-β-glucose bonds, has been produced, purified, and characterized. This is the first report of such versatility in a 1,4-β-glucosidase. The application of this enzyme for saccharification of wheat straw and laminarin and its comparison with commercial enzymes suggest that it could be an interesting tool for the production of 2G and 3G biofuels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The direct conversion of waste cooking oil (WCO) into bio-jet fuel was investigated over a core-shell hierarchical USY@Al-SBA-15 zeolite-supported NiMo catalyst. The core-shell structure showed better acid and pore size distributions. The synergetic effect of the core-shell micropore and mesopore structure significantly contributed to enhancing the selectivity for the jet fuel (C9–15 hydrocarbons) from 9.3 % over NiMo/USY up to 35.7 % over NiMo/USY@Al-SBA-15, with high isomerization (iso-/n-paraffins ratio = 2.7) and moderate aromatic fraction (18.7 %). The decarboxylation reaction was selectively enhanced. Optimal selectivity for jet fuel (39.7 %) was obtained at 380 °C and a high H2/oil ratio would decrease the yield of jet fuel. This catalyst showed excellent stability for the hydroconversion of WCO to hydrocarbons. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - A novel hierarchically nanoporous carbon (NPC) derived from Al-based porous coordination polymer is prepared by two-step carbonization method for immobilization of the Co3O4 in the application of the nonenzymatic biofuel cells and biosensors. The structure and morphology are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) is to characterize the porous nature of the NPC, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is to characterize the composition of Co3O4@nanoporous carbon (Co3O4@NPC). Without collapse in the high carbonization temperature (above 1600 °C), the NPC maintains the nanoporous structure and high specific surface area of 1551.2 m2 g−1. In addition, the NPC is composited with Co3O4 by hydrothermal method to form the Co3O4@NPC. When tested as the nonenzymatic electrocatalyst for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), the Co3O4@NPC exhibits higher response to glucose, in which the current shifts up by 64 %, than pure Co3O4 in 0.1 M KOH. The limit of detection is 0.005 mM (S/N=3) and response time is within 3 s. The detection range can be divided into two sections of 0.02–1.4 mM and 1.4–10.7 mM with the sensitivity of 249.1 μA mM−1 cm−2 and 66.6 μA mM−1 cm−2, respectively. A glucose fuel cell is constructed with the Co3O4@NPC as the anode and Pt/C catalyst as the cathode. The open-circuit potential of the nonenzymatic glucose/O2 fuel cell was 0.68 V, with a maximum power density of 0.52 mW cm−2 at 0.27 V. This work may contribute to exploring other nanoporous carbons for application in glucose fuel cells and biosensors. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Non-edible oils (Brassiceae family) were utilized for biodiesel production. Biodiesel was produced from four plants seeds oils and blended with ULSD. Two different methods were used for extraction of oil and the crude oil yields were 77.4 ± 2.14, 78.73 ± 3.1, 71.02 ± 2.15, 62.3 ± 3.4 (%) for B. napus, B. nigra, B. campestris and C. sativa plants, respectively. The oil obtained was pre-treated (chemical refinement through degumming, neutralization and bleaching) and was subjected to alkali-catalysed trans-esterification. Quality of produced biodiesel was compared with the fuel standards (ASTM D6751, ASTM D975, ASTM D7467 and EN 14214 and EN 590) and biodiesel properties were recorded to be in line with standards criteria except the kinematic viscosity of B. napus, B. nigra and C. sativa methyl esters and oxidative stability of B. napus and C. sativa. The fatty acids analysis by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry revealed the highest proportion of erucic acid (43%) in methyl esters along with other minor components. The properties of methyl esters, both pure and blended were comparable with biodiesel fuels standards. So far, methyl esters properties of Brassiceae family plants are acceptable based on biodiesel standards and methyl esters can be used in blends with ULSD as a fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The production of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources is increasingly important due to the environmental concern and depletion of fossil fuel. Despite the fast technical development in the production of aviation fuels, there are still several shortcomings such as a high cost of raw materials, a low yield of aviation fuels, and poor process techno-economic consideration. In recent years, olefin metathesis has become a powerful and versatile tool for generating new carbon-carbon bonds. The cross-metathesis reaction, one kind of metathesis reaction, has a high potential to efficiently convert plant oil into valuable chemicals, such as α-olefin and bio-aviation fuel by combining with a hydrotreatment process. Results: In this research, an efficient, four-step conversion of plant oil into bio-aviation fuel and valuable chemicals was developed by the combination of enzymatic transesterification, olefin cross-metathesis, and hydrotreating. Firstly, plant oil including oil with poor properties was esterified to fatty acid methyl esters by an enzyme-catalyzed process. Secondly, the fatty acid methyl esters were partially hydrotreated catalytically to transform poly-unsaturated fatty acid such as linoleic acid into oleic acid. The olefin cross-metathesis then transformed the oleic acid methyl ester (OAME) into 1-decene and 1-decenoic acid methyl ester (DAME). The catalysts used in this process were prepared/selected in function of the catalytic reaction and the reaction conditions were optimized. The carbon efficiency analysis of the new process illustrated that it was more economically feasible than the traditional hydrotreatment process. Conclusions: A highly efficient conversion process of plant oil into bio-aviation fuel and valuable chemicals by the combination of enzymatic transesterification, olefin cross-metathesis, and hydrotreatment with prepared and selected catalysts was designed. The reaction conditions were optimized. Plant oil was transformed into bio-aviation fuel and a high value α-olefin product with high carbon utilization. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the fossil energy consumption and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of polyol fuel produced via corn stover fast pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading based on life cycle assessment (LCA). The required material and energy inputs involved in the unit processes of LCA are taken from Aspen Plus simulation models established according to a demonstration plant with annual polyol output of 1000 tonnes. The eBalance software with a Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD) is employed to perform this task. The research results show the net fossil energy input (FEI) and the net global warming potential (GWP) of polyol fuel are respectively 0.760 MJ and 0.0444 kgCO2,eq per MJ energy output under the proposed production pathway. Compared to petroleum-based gasoline and diesel, the net FEI of polyol fuel reduces by 42.9% and 42.2% respectively and the net GWP of polyol fuel decreases by 55.1% and 56.9% accordingly. Sensitivity analysis indicates the data uncertainty of the polyol yield and the electricity consumption for bio-oil production has significant impact on the GHG emissions. The polyol fuel is expected to partly replace petroleum-based fuels. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In situ and ex situ catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapors from Douglas fir pellets in the presence of activated carbon (AC) prepared by chemical activation was studied in a microwave pyrolyzer. The in situ catalytic upgrading configuration gave lower bio-oil yields (10.25-25.5 wt%) than ex situ catalytic upgrading configuration (20.03-32 wt%). The bio-oil yield from the in situ upgrading process was significantly affected by both catalytic reaction temperature and catalyst to biomass ratio. However, the bio-oil yield from ex situ upgrading process was only significantly affected by catalyst to biomass ratio. Bio-oils compositional analysis indicated that the ex situ upgrading process generated higher phenols concentration (4.14-19.76 mg ml -1 ) than in situ upgrading (4.14-9.90 mg ml -1 ). However, the selectivity of phenols from in situ upgrading process reflected by the peak area percentages was higher than that from ex situ upgrading. The catalyst recycling tests showed that the prepared AC catalyst can be reused for three times in phenol-rich bio-oil production via catalytic microwave pyrolysis. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources decreases the consequences of greenhouse gas emission from fossil fuels. Biodiesel, an easily burning and biodegradable fuel, is an alternative to conventional diesel fuel. The esterification of long-chain fatty acids and transesterification of triglycerides are two major reactions widely used to convert vegetable oils or animal fats into biodiesel. As solid acid catalysts are considered promising candidates for biodiesel production, we have synthesized a series of organic knitted porous polyaromatics (OPPs) using pyrene, anthracene, and naphthalene as monomers via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, followed by crosslinking reactions. The resultant polymers showed good surface morphology, stability and swelling property, high capacity for functionalization due to the unreacted bromomethyl groups on the surface, and excellent hydrophobicity. The sulfonated polymer microspheres obtained by the surface sulfonation showed good surface acidity; thus, they can be employed as heterogeneous solid acid catalysts for the esterification of long-chain fatty acids and transesterification of triglycerides, and they are reusable without any leaching of functional groups. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the results of testing the performance of tractors using fossil diesel, biodiesel, and blends of biodiesel and fossil diesel. The results of tests conducted in stationary and non-stationary conditions indicate that, in contrast to fossil diesel, the use of biodiesel and blends of biodiesel and fossil diesel reduce the power of engine and drawbar power, and increase specific fuel consumption. Thermal efficiency slightly improves with biodiesel blends. The differences become notable with bigger share of biodiesel in the blend. However, the changes are less notable regarding the differences in heating value, which is the result of complete combustion. Use of different fuels, compared to use of fossil diesel only, reduces the CO emission and temperature of exhaust fumes, and increases the CO2 emission and NOx. At maximum load, the difference between the parameters measured in stationary and non-stationary conditions is minimal. On the other hand, at lower loads, the load variable formed in non-stationary conditions of testing becomes noticeable which results in greater differences. However, decrease in engine power and increase in fuel consumption using biodiesel significantly deteriorated the exploitation characteristics of plowing tractors (production efficiency was reduced by 12.87% and fuel consumption per unit of cultivated area was increased by up to 21.63%). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crude pyrolysis bio-oil contains significant quantities of carboxylic acids which limit its utility as a biofuel. Vapour phase ketonisation of organic acids contained within biomass fast-pyrolysis vapours offers a potential pre-treatment to improve the stability and energy content of resulting bio-oils formed upon condensation. Zirconia is a promising catalyst for such reactions, however little is known regarding the impact of thermal processing on the physicochemical properties of zirconia in the context of it's corresponding reactivity for the vapour phase ketonisation of acetic acid. Here we show that calcination progressively transforms amorphous Zr(OH)4 into small tetragonal ZrO2 crystallites at 400 °C, and subsequently larger monoclinic crystallites &gt;600 °C. These phase transitions are accompanied by an increase in the density of Lewis acid sites, and concomitant decrease in their acid strength, attributed to surface dehydroxylation and anion vacancy formation. Weak Lewis acid sites (and/or resulting acid-base pairs) are identified as the active species responsible for acetic acid ketonisation to acetone at 350 °C and 400 °C, with stronger Lewis acid sites favouring competing unselective reactions and carbon laydown. Acetone selectivity is independent of acid strength. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Non-thermal Plasma Synergistic Catalysis (NPSC) was firstly proposed and employed in the upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapors for preparation of biofuels. The effects of the three-way catalysis (non-thermal plasma, HZSM-5 body and modified components) on the bio-oil upgrading performance and catalyst stability were comprehensively investigated. Bio-oil yields continued to decrease, but the physicochemical properties were further improved. The contents and compositions of hydrocarbons in bio-oil were increased and improved to varying degrees. The introduction of non-thermal plasma technology enhanced performance of cracking and deoxygenation for whole catalytic process. Besides, anti-coking performance of Zn/HZSM-5 was enhanced to a certain extent, but the multiple interactions significantly improved the cracking performance when Ti species introduced, increased the coke content, and an “isomorphism” phenomenon for two kinds of coke was emerged. In general, obtained biofuels still belonged to the hydrogen-deficient fuel, lower (H/C)eff of the vapors limited substantial improvement of the fuel grade. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of green synthesis using renewable resources is of crucial importance in various applications, including adsorption and catalysis. In this work, hierarchical faujasite nanosheets have been successfully prepared by a hydrothermal process in the presence of a dimethyloctadecyl-(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl) ammonium chloride (TPOAC) as a hierarchical porogen using an extracted silica derived from renewable resources. The extracted nanosilica was obtained from a corn cob ash by the sol-gel method without adding any dispersing agent. The TPOAC content and crystallization temperature have a great effect on tuning the morphologies and textural properties of hierarchical faujasite nanosheets. Interestingly, the obtained materials also exhibit outstanding catalytic properties in terms of activity, desired product selectivity, and catalyst lifetime for the hydrogenation of lignin-derived alkylphenols, which is an important step of bio-oil upgrading. The high yield of 4-propylcyclohexanol over novel designed catalysts is about 2.14 times compared with the conventional faujasite. The first presented approach, thus not only demonstrates a highly efficient way to produce zeolites with hierarchical nanosheet structures via a green synthesis method, but also opens up interesting perspectives for the development of heterogeneous catalysts for bio-oil upgrading applications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Support- and sulfide-free cobalt molybdenum catalysts are prepared via different synthetic procedures for catalytic deoxygenation of oleic acid under inert (N2) and solvent-free conditions. Among the tested catalysts, the CoMo catalyst prepared via a sol-gel method achieves the highest catalytic performance, namely, 88.9% oleic acid conversion, with 48.1% C9–C17 selectivity, and 69.6% oxygen removal rate, owing to its excellent physical properties. Additionally, oxygen vacancy is formed in CoMo catalyst during sol-gel synthesis process and it also effect on the catalytic activity. Examination of the deoxygenation reaction over pre-reduced catalysts reveals that the CoMoO4 species is the active species in the CoMo catalysts. The fuel properties of the resultant products are affected strongly by the catalytic performances of the CoMo catalysts. The biofuel produced using the CoMo catalyst prepared via the sol-gel method showed the highest calorific value (10,119 cal/g) and the lowest viscosity (31.5 cP), and, consequently, this CoMo catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic activity and has significant potential for application in biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing incorporation of renewable energy sources into the grid is motivating efforts to identify new strategies for the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy. Fuel cells, which convert chemical energy into electricity, will play an important role in this transformation. Herein, we report a new strategy for electrochemical O 2 reduction in a fuel cell that uses an organic mediator to shuttle electrons and protons between the electrode and a heterogeneous catalyst that is contained within an off-electrode packed-bed reactor where O 2 reduction occurs. Design and synthesis of a robust quinone mediator provided the basis for this advance. Further development of this fuel cell design has the potential to achieve higher power densities than current state-of-the-art non-PGM fuel cells. This strategy has potential use in various other electrode-driven chemical redox transformations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
New methods for interconversion of electrical and chemical energy are crucial to addressing emerging challenges in renewable energy storage and conversion. Dissolved redox mediators provide an effective means to transport electrons (and protons) between an electrode and catalysts that are not in direct physical contact with an electrode. Mediators are widely implemented in biofuel cells, but such devices typically exhibit low power densities. Here, we report the development of a tetrasubstituted quinone mediator that exhibits excellent stability under strongly acidic conditions and supports electrochemical reduction of O 2 at an off-electrode heterogeneous cobalt catalyst contained within a packed-bed reactor. Efficient oxidation of the hydroquinone by O 2 in the reactor provides the basis for mediator regeneration, and an integrated “flow-cathode” fuel cell system supports high power densities. These results establish the combination of organic mediators with off-electrode heterogeneous catalysts as a versatile platform for development of new electrode-driven chemical redox transformations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biodiesel engines produce several intermediate species, which can potentially harm the human health. The concentration of these species and their health risk potential varies depending on engine technology, fuel, and engine operating condition. In this study, experiments were performed on a large number of engines having different configurations (emissions norms/fuel used), which were operated at part load/full load using B20 (20% v/v biodiesel blended with mineral diesel) and mineral diesel. Experiments included measurement of gaseous emissions, and physical, chemical, and biological characterization of exhaust particulate matter (PM). Chemical characterization of PM was carried out for detecting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and PM bound trace metals. The biological toxicity associated with PM was assessed using human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK 293T). The mutagenic potential of the PM was tested at three different concentrations (500, 100, and 50 μg/mL) using two different Salmonella strains, TA98 and TA100, with and without liver S9 metabolic enzyme fraction. PM samples exhibited cytotoxic effect on HEK 293T cells (IC 50 &lt; 100 μg/mL) and there was significant potential for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Comparison of different engines showed that modern engines (Euro-III and Euro-IV compliant) produced relatively cleaner exhaust compared to older engines (Euro-II compliant). Biodiesel-fueled engines emitted lower number of particles compared to diesel-fueled engines. However, chemical characterization revealed that biodiesel-fueled engines exhaust PM contained several harmful PAHs and trace metals, which affected the biological activity of these PM, as reflected in the biological investigations. Mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of PM from biodiesel-fueled engines were relatively higher compared to their diesel counterparts, indicating the need for exhaust gas after-treatment. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microwave pyrolysis of wood pellets was investigated in a pilot scale fixed bed microwave reactor at various biomass loadings and microwave power levels. A fixed proportion of biochar (10% of biomass loading) was used as a microwave absorber in each test conditions. Effect of biomass loading and the power level on the product yields and on the characteristics of biochar and bio-oil products were examined. While the bio-oil yield decreased when the biomass loading was increased from 1500 g to 3500 g, the biochar and gaseous product yields increased with the biomass loading. However, the microwave power level shows an opposite trend. Biochar exhibited good higher heating value (31 MJ/kg) and possessed a fine pore size (&lt;1 nm), which can be used as a fuel or a source of porous carbon. Higher heating value of bio-oil was found in the range 12–14 MJ/kg. Kinematic viscosities of bio-oils were estimated in the range 1.8–6.1 mm2/s at 40 °C that is similar to the viscosity requirement for the gas turbine applications. Moisture content in bio-oils was found in the range of 57.3–69.3%, which is higher than the upper limit of water content (30% wt.). Only a few chemicals, including furfural, phenol, 3-Methyl-1,2-Cyclipentanedione, 3-Methylphenol, and 4-Methylguaiacol were found in the bio-oils because of the high moisture content. Results of product characterization of biochar and bio-oils confirm that both microwave power level and biomass loading does not have any significant impacts. Further research can be carried out to find out the measures to reduce the moisture content in the bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Today, many researchers are focusing on research for alternative promising energy sources and sustainable technology for bioethanol production to meet the increasing global energy demand. Here, we develop a novel one-pot pretreatment technology by co-immobilizing laccase, cellulase and β-glucosidase to act as a tri-enzyme biocatalyst for evaluating the bioethanol production potential of four sustainable lignocellulosic biomasses viz., Typha angustifolia, Arundo donax, Saccharum arundinaceum, and Ipomoea carnea. The co-immobilized enzyme system was more stable at different temperatures and at longer storage, compared to free enzyme. During enzymatic saccharification, Saccharum arundinaceum showed higher total reducing sugar of 205 ± 3.73 mg/g when compared to other biomass. The highest percentage of bioethanol yield of 63.43 ± 9.35% was obtained with Ipomoea carnea. The effects of co-immobilized tri-enzyme biocatalyst on the biomasses were evaluated. The results revealed that the co-immobilized tri-enzyme biocatalyst could act as effective one-pot pretreatment for the production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main objective of this investigation is to compare catalytic activity of three different catalysts derived from chicken waste. The prepared catalysts were characterized by DTG, SEM, BET, XRD, and FT-IR. The effect of catalysts (chicken manure, chicken bone, and egg shell) on biodiesel yield (from E. compressa algal oil) were evaluated by varying calcination temperature, reaction temperature, molar ratio, catalyst amount, mixing speed, reaction time, and water content in methanol. The maximum biodiesel yield was obtained for egg shell catalyst-95% while for chicken bone catalyst −94% and chicken manure catalyst −85% at 9:1 M, 5% (w/w) of catalyst amount, 65 °C, 2% water content, and 400 rpm for 3 h. The chicken bone catalyst is highly active in reaction but in presence of water content (max. 2%) in methanol egg shell shows higher biodiesel yield performance. The recovered catalyst can be used maximum three times with a slight deviation. The quality of biodiesel merged with standards value. The conversion of waste raw materials into valuable resources make this method a cost-effective and reveals a recyclable procedure for the production of biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, magnetic composite graphene oxide/cellulose (GO/CM@Fe3O4) microspheres were prepared as support material, which are cost-efficient, non-toxic and environmental friendly. The microspheres with higher adsorption capacity were further modified using triethylene tetramine (TETA), and H3PW12O40 (HPW) was immobilized to form GO/CM-NH2@Fe3O4-HPW microspheres as heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production. The novel heterogeneous catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). For the first time, GO/CM-NH2@Fe3O4--HPW was applied in the transesterification of highly-acidic Pistacia chinensis seed oil to biodiesel. Under optimal reaction conditions 80 °C, methanol/oil molar ratio 12:1, catalyst 15 wt% (w/w of oil) for 8 h, a 94% biodiesel yield was achieved. The heterogeneous catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction system by using magnetic field and efficiently recycled for at least six times. This novel procedure overcomes the disadvantages of the current catalyst support such as active site leaching, complicated preparation process and high costs. Therefore, it was a potential novel heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, valorisation of high acid value waste cooking oil into biodiesel has been investigated. Non-catalytic transesterification using supercritical methanol has been used for biodiesel production. Four controllable independent process variables have been considered for analysis including methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio, temperature, pressure and time. Uncommon effects of process variables on the reaction responses, e.g. biodiesel and glycerol yields, have been observed and extensively discussed. Response surface methodology (RSM) via Central Composite Design (CCD) has been used to analyse the effect of the process variables and their interactions on the reaction responses. A quadratic model for each response has been developed representing the interrelationships between process variables and responses. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) has been used to verify the significance effect of each process variable and their interactions on reaction responses. Optimal reaction conditions have been predicted using RSM for 98% and 2.05% of biodiesel and glycerol yields, respectively at 25:1 M:O molar ratio, 265 °C temperature, 110 bar pressure and 20 min reaction time. The predicted optimal conditions have been validated experimentally resulting in 98.82% biodiesel yield, representing 0.83% relative error. The quality of the produced biodiesel showed excellent agreement with the European biodiesel standard (EN14214). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the effects of inorganic (HCl, HNO3 and H2SO4) and organic (HCOOH, CH3COOH and HOOCCOOH) acid pretreatments on the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of municipal secondary sludge (MSS) were investigated. The results showed that all acid pretreatments could increase bio-oil yield by changing the proportion of organic matters and ash content in feedstock and thus facilitating the conversion of water soluble product to bio-oil. A maximum bio-oil yield of 26.75 wt% was obtained from the HCl pretreatment which increased 7.5 wt% compared to the blank experiment. Moreover, the inorganic acid pretreatments showed a better performance in terms of enhancing bio-oil quality as their higher heating values (HHVs, 31.83–36.04 MJ/kg) were much higher than that from organic acid pretreatments (24.57–29.22 MJ/kg). The characterization analysis of bio-oil indicated that the HCl pretreatment was most beneficial for the formation of light fraction and increment of hydrocarbon. © 2018

AB  - Non-catalytic transesterification has been recognised as an effective technique for biodiesel production. It has many advantages over conventional catalytic transesterification, where it eliminates the difficulties of catalysts preparation and separation. It also produces high biodiesel yield in shorter reaction time. However, it requires harsh operating conditions at high reaction temperature and pressure, in addition to using large excess of methanol. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, a process design/integration for biodiesel production has been performed. The process has been subjected to both mass and energy integration to minimise fresh methanol requirements and to minimise heating and cooling energies, respectively. A new graphical Pinch Analysis method has been used to evaluate the energy performance of a literature design for the current process. It has been subsequently used to develop an optimum heat exchanger network (HEN) for the process by matching of process streams. Also, the design made by using an automated commercial simulation (Aspen Energy Analyzer) has been evaluated using the same graphical method. The produced HEN design from graphical method has achieved the optimum results with respect to energy targets. © 2018

AB  - Upgrading of crude glycerol to high value-added chemical products is an attractive process in biomass conversion and biorefinery industry. In this work, production of triacetin (TAG) from direct conversion of glycerol with acetic acid over SO3H-glycerol-carbon catalyst assisted with ultrasound was investigated for the first time. The catalyst was synthesized from glycerol via in-situ carbonization and sulfonation. The significant factors for TAG production obtained from 2 k factorial design were in the order of reaction temperature &gt; ultrasonic power &gt; reaction time. The TAG selectivity (100%) was successfully achieved in mild conditions. Kinetic studies indicated that ultrasound-assisted acetylation reaction followed first-order reaction while an activation energy of 51.08 kJ/mol was obtained. For comparison between as-synthesized catalyst with various commercial solid acid catalysts, the glycerol conversion turnover rate toward TAG was considerably highest on SO3H-glycerol-carbon with the rates exhibited in the order of SO3H-glycerol-carbon &gt; Amberlyst-35 &gt; H-USY &gt; SiO₂-Tosic acid &gt; Al2O3. The SO3H-glycerol-carbon also exhibited excellent reusability for 10 consecutive cycles without any decreasing in glycerol conversion and TAG selectivity after regeneration process was carried out. The obtained results indicated that the contribution of catalyst acidity with ultrasonic power was responsible for determining TAG selectivity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a novel route was proposed for microalgae biofuel production by catalytic upgrading of Chlorella hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) derived biocrude. Al-SBA-15, CuO/Al-SBA-15, ZuO/Al-SBA-15, and CuO-ZnO/Al-SBA-15 catalysts were synthesized in a facile, one-pot way, and tested for methyl palmitate decarboxylation and biocrude upgrading without H2 addition. These modified SBA-15 catalysts enhanced alkane selectivity of methyl palmitate decarboxylation from 7.6 wt% up to 79.6 wt% at 340–350 °C. FT-IR, TG and GC–MS characterizations were employed to identify the composition and properties of the upgraded bio-oils. Compared with thermal upgrading, modified SBA-15 catalysts enriched the yield of low boiling point compounds, and the content of heavy bio-oil (&gt;400 °C) declined from 9.57 wt% to 1.89 wt%. Hydrocarbon yield was greatly enriched on the catalysts, and aromatics predominant on Al-SBA-15 while aliphatics abundant on metal oxide(s) supported catalysts. The hydrocarbon yield was increased from 25.1 wt% (thermal) to 65.7 wt% on the CuO/Al-SBA-15. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The continuing dependence on fossil fuels and the rising energy use in the transport sector have resulted in increased research into viable transport biofuels to mitigate climate change and improve energy security. As transport biofuels now only have a small share of the transport sector energy supply and the complexity in providing the fuels because of issues related to available land and food security, this paper develops conversion path solutions for transport biofuel development based on a technological paradigm study. A data-driven approaches system (DAS) that combines visualization analyses with technological paradigm theory is proposed to reveal the key areas and trends in transport biofuels. Timeline, timezones, and cluster visualizations identified the transport biofuel technological paradigm (TBTP) from current transport biofuel developments; a pre-shift phase (including TBTP competition and TBTP diffusion) and a shift phase (TBTP shift), which respectively relate to conventional biofuels, advanced biofuels, and biofuel cells. However, from further DAS trend analyses and the practical findings, electric energy trends were revealed, indicating that there was a paradigm shift from the biofuel paradigm to a bio-electric energy paradigm. From the developed bio-electric energy framework, both indirect and direct methods were found to have led to an this electric energy conversion to an e-bio fuel cell vehicle for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) and bioelectricity for electric vehicles (EV), both of which can contribute to a low-carbon, sustainable transportation future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With increasing environmental issues, production of bio-fuel represents a viable source of renewable energy and constitutes an alternative for the replacement of fossil fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, the effect of particle size, pyrolysis temperature, carrier gas flow rate (N2) was analyzed for obtaining of bio-oil from pyrolysis process of rapeseed oil cake. Optimum parameters obtained for the maximum liquid quantity and bio-oil yield (≈49.8% and 38.7%, respectively) were particle size range ≤0.5 mm, 500°C and 100 mL/min (N2) carrier gas flow rate. The calorific value of bio-oil was of 36.25 MJ/kg and the characterization of bio-oil was performed by FTIR, GC–MS and NMR and this demonstrates that can be a viable alternative fuel for public transport and agriculture sectors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During pyrolysis process, hundreds of parallel and successive pyrolytic reactions between different constituents take place forming complex products. Understanding the pyrolysis behavior of each individual component as well as the interaction of different components is a challenge to further elucidate the complex biomass pyrolysis process. The present study aimed to explore the effect of celluloses (CE), as a main component of lignocellulosic biomass, on catalytic co-pyrolysis of Enteromorpha clathrata polysaccharides (ENP) and Sargassum fusiforme polysaccharides (SAP). The yields of bio-oil and non-condensable gas of pyrolyzed algal polysaccharides showed the lowest values, with the highest bio-char yield. However, co-pyrolysis of algal polysaccharides with CE enhanced the bio-oil yield of ENP and SAP by 34% and 29%, respectively, over the corresponding individual pyrolyzed polysaccharides. The results of GC–MS and FTIR of bio-oils confirmed the synergistic interaction between polysaccharides and CE during co-pyrolysis. Furthermore, bio-oils yields increased by 7.0% and 14.4% by catalytic co-pyrolysis of ENP + CE and SAP + CE, respectively. Interestingly, ZSM-5 resulted in significant reduction in acids and N-containing compounds of the produced bio-oil. In addition, ZSM-5 catalytic co-pyrolysis of the two studied polysaccharides with cellulose sharply increased furans and ketones proportions. The present results suggested catalytic co-pyrolysis as more favorable process for enhanced production of upgraded bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current research reports the synthesis of in-situ TiO2/RGO nanocomposite and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. The prepared catalyst was characterized viz. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques conforming the successful formation of nanocomposite. The effects of various reaction parameters used for transesterification were examined to optimize the reaction conditions. The best operational conditions were oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:12 at 65 °C with 1.5 wt% catalyst loading and reaction time of 3 h. The catalyst showed good catalytic activity in biodiesel production and biodiesel conversion of 98% was obtained under optimum reaction conditions. Biodiesel conversion was confirmed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C NMR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) techniques. The excellent catalytic activity of TiO2/RGO could be attributed to the enhanced surface area of the composite. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein we present a high yield 2-methylfuran production process with the required features to be implemented in a future integrated biorefinery. The strategy is based on the right solvent selection, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, which i) can be used to extract the reactant, furfural, from the aqueous solution obtained after corncob biomass hydrolysis; ii) allows for highly selective 2-methylfuran production form furfural with up to 80% yields and iii) presents suitable biofuel properties in the gasoline range. Using this innovative approach, two energy intensive separation steps are avoided: the initial furfural purification and the final solvent/product complete separation. Further benefits of this process arise from the developed low-cost, selective, and reusable Cu-Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A plant converting sugarcane bagasse to liquid fuels through thermal liquefaction in an Australian setting was modelled in ASPEN Plus. Ethanol was investigated as a liquefaction solvent due to its effect of higher yields and higher biocrude heating value compared to water (i.e. hydrothermal liquefaction). The plant produced 0.67 kg biocrude per kg dry feed, which was further processed to 0.46 kg liquid fuels per kg of dry feed for a total of 25.8 million L/y of biofuel product. Ethanol losses incurred the highest share in operating costs, although there are opportunities for cost reduction around lower solvent to biomass ratio. Over the plant life and with a corporate tax rate of 30%, it was determined that the minimum selling price for the fuel products is US$ 0.99/L, which was comparable to other liquefaction studies using water as solvent. It was demonstrated that continuous operation mode was economically more advantageous than semi-batch production. Product price, hydrodeoxygenation conversion efficiency and plant capacity were determined to be the factors to which NPV is most sensitive, while biocrude yield and hydrodeoxygenation conversion efficiency were the key factors in decreasing the minimum selling price of the product to a level that can be competitive. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The chemical-catalyzed transesterification process to produce biofuels i.e. pentyl valerate (PeVa) is environmentally unfriendly, energy-intensive with tedious downstream treatment. The present work reports the use of Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) crosslinked onto magnetic chitosan/chitin nanoparticles (RML-CS/CH/MNPs). The approach used to immobilize RML onto the CS/CH/MNPs yielded RML-CS/CH/MNPs with an immobilized protein loading and specific activity of 7.6 mg/g and 5.0 U·g−1, respectively. This was confirmed by assessing data of field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A three-level-four-factor Box-Behnken design (incubation time, temperature, substrate molar ratio, and enzyme loading) was used to optimize the RML-CS/CH/MNP-catalyzed esterification synthesis of PeVa. Under optimum condition, the maximum yield of PeVa (97.8%) can be achieved in 5 h at 50 °C using molar ratio valeric acid:pentanol (1:2) and an enzyme load of 2 mg/mL. Consequently, operational stability experiments showed that the protocol adopted to prepare the CS/CH/MNP nanoparticles had increased the durability of RML. The RML-CS/CH/MNP could catalyze up to eight successive esterification cycles to produce PeVa. The study also demonstrated the functionality of CS/CH/MNP nanoparticles as an eco-friendly support matrix for improving enzymatic activity and operational stability of RML to produce PeVa. © 2018

AB  - The enzymatic esterification of an acid waste oil was investigated using a commercial lipase (Thermomyces lanuginosus) in batch reactors, under the following reaction conditions: temperature of 35 °C, molar ratio of acid:alcohol of 1:1.5, vigorous magnetic stirring and enzyme concentration from 2 to 5 wt.%. The reaction progressed during 24 h. The acid oil obtained from soapstock of vegetable oil refining had an acidity of 65.5 wt.% and a very high sulphur content of 10 400 mg/kg. Thus, a pretreatment to reduce the mineral acidity before enzymatic esterification was necessary. The selected pretreatment consisted of one wash with 1:1 V/V oil:NaOH solution followed by two washings with 1:1 V/V oil:distilled water. The results from the esterification of the pretreated oil showed a clear influence of enzyme concentration in the reduction of the acidity, most of which was achieved in the first 7 h. The amount and type of alcohol had minor influence in the reaction conversion and the fractionated addition of methanol had only expressive effect for lower catalyst concentrations, with final conversions being still unsatisfactory. The best conditions found were 4 wt.% of enzyme, 35 °C, 24 h, and 1:1.5 molar ratio of acid:alcohol, which afforded an 80% reduction of acidity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper focuses on fabricating cost effective and time-efficient bioelectrodes for enzymatic bio fuel cells by immobilizing the enzymes, glucose oxidase, and laccase on the surface of buckeye composite Bucky paper (BP) without any redox cofactors. Electrochemical studies including linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry open circuit potential, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were carried out to evaluate the performance of the prepared electrodes. Maximum current density of 9.79 mA/cm2 at 0.4 V and 2 mA/cm2 at 0.3 V was observed for anode and cathode, respectively, at a scan rate of 10 mV/s at 40-mM glucose concentration. Morphological studies using scanning electron microscope revealed uniform dispersion of the enzymes on the surface of the BP electrodes facilitating the presence of enzyme active sites for catalytic reactions. The absence of redox cofactors in this approach dramatically reduces the cost and fabrication cycle time and also preserves their biocompatible nature. The fabricated BP-based bioelectrodes have shown excellent performance and further encourage toward future studies at the microfluidics level. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Increased urbanization and increase in population has led to an increased demand for fuels. The result is the prices of fuels are reaching new heights every day. Using low-cost feedstocks such as rendered animal fats in biodiesel production will reduce biodiesel expenditures. One of the low-cost feedstocks for biodiesel production from poultry feathers. This paper describes a new and environmentally friendly process for developing biodiesel production technology from feather waste produced in poultry industry. Transesterification is one of the well-known processes by which fats and oils are converted into biodiesel. The reaction often makes use of acid/base catalyst. If the material possesses high free fatty acid then acid catalyst gives better results. The data resulted from gas chromatography (GC) revealed these percentages for fatty acid compositions: myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. The biodiesel function group was analyzed by using FTIR. This study concluded that the rooster feathers have superior potential to process them into biodiesel than broiler chicken feathers fat because of fatty acid composition values and it has important properties of biodiesel. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - A single-step method for transesterifying and recovering lipids in concentrated slurries (ca 20% w/w solids) of ruptured microalgae is presented. A soluble Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) was used to directly transesterify the lipids in the marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina. This allowed both triglycerides (TAG) and polar saponifiable lipids to be recovered as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) using a nonpolar solvent (hexane). Up to 90 wt% of the total saponifiable lipids (SL) were converted to FAME within 24 h, approximately 75% of which was recovered in the hexane by centrifugation. Two pathways for the conversion and recovery of polar lipids were identified. The water in the slurry buffered against potential lipase inhibition by methanol, but necessitated a high methanol dose for maximal FAME conversion. Nonetheless the method enables the recovery of polar lipids as FAME while avoiding the need for both drying of the biomass and a downstream transesterification step. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The initial aim of the paper is to dramatically improve the pretreatment stage of biodiesel production, which converts problematic free fatty acids to fatty acid methyl esters, by introduction of a microbubble mediated reactive distillation stage instead of acid pretreatment. This will shift the conventional esterification process towards completion with a yield higher than 80%, even without high excess methanol. Application of ozone microbubbles has the advantage over acid gas catalysis in that it gives higher conversion and leaves no catalyst residue and requires no further catalyst recovery separation steps (a “phantom” catalyst). Unreacted ozone breaks down into oxygen, so the off-gases are just a humid air stream that can be vented. Importantly, ozonolysis breaks carbon–carbon double bonds into aldehydes and carboxylic acids. Many ester species were found after contacting the feedstock with ozone-rich microbubbles, depending on the molecular structure of the alcohols for the ozonolysis of oleic acid with alcohols, i.e., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, and n-butanol. In the case of ozonolysis of used cooking oil mixed with methanol, the results from the GC–MS show that all saturated free fatty acids (including palmitic acid, stearic acid, and myristic acid) are converted to methyl esters within 20 h of 60 °C ozonolysis, whereas trace amounts of these chemicals remain at lower temperatures. The results also show that the conversion of oleic acid to form oleic acid methyl ester is 91.16% after 32 h of ozonolysis at 60 °C. Therefore, the free fatty acid content in used cooking oil is less than 1.33%, which makes it suitable as a reactant for biodiesel production via transesterification. However, this result is different from the result provided by ASTM D974 in that the acid numbers decrease dramatically by 25% at the beginning of ozonolysis followed by a plateau. Moreover, if the fluidic oscillator is used to generate bubbles in ozonolysis of oleic acid mixed with methanol, the results show that the yields of ozonolysis product 1-nonanal increase by 30%. This observation means that ozonolysis of oleic acid is relative to the specific interfacial area, and favoured at low liquid temperatures. © 2018

AB  - The separate collection of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) is gaining popularity through several countries in Europe. An appropriate management of UCO waste stream leads to substantial benefits. In this study, we analyse two different possibilities of UCO energy reuse: the direct feed to a reciprocating internal combustion engine (ICE) for cogeneration purpose, and the processing to generate biodiesel. Concerning biodiesel production, we analyse four among conventional and innovative technologies, characterised by different type and amount of used chemicals, heat and electricity consumptions and yields. We perform a systematic evaluation of environmental benefits and drawbacks by applying life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis to compare the alternatives. For the impact assessment, two methods are selected: the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CExC). Results related only to the processing phases (i.e. not including yet the avoided effects) show that the recovery of UCO in cogeneration plant has in general lower values in terms of environmental impacts than its employment in biodiesel production. When products and co-products substitution are included, the savings obtained by the substitution of conventional diesel production, in the biodiesel cases, are significantly higher than the avoided effects for electricity and heat in the cogeneration case. In particular, by using the UCO in the biodiesel production processes, the savings vary from 41.6 to 54.6 GJex per tUCO, and from 2270 to 2860 kg CO2eq per tUCO for CExC and GWP, respectively. A particular focus is put on sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Overall, high uncertainty of final results for process impacts is observed, especially for the supercritical methanol process. Low uncertainty values are evaluated for the avoided effects. Including the uncertain character of the impacts, cogeneration scenario and NaOH catalysed process of biodiesel production result to be the most suitable solutions from the process impacts and avoided effects perspective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil, a hopeful substitute as an alternative fuel has gained significant attention due to the predicted shortness of conventional fuels and environmental concern. Bio-oils have attracted a lot of interest, as they are liquid energy carriers and general sources of chemicals. In this study, the pyrolysis characteristics of lemon grass were studied to evaluate their potential use as source of bio-oil. Flash pyrolysis of the lemon grass was carried out on a fluidized bed reactor with nitrogen gas atmosphere. The effects of operating parameters such as temperature, particle size and sweep (nitrogen) gas flow rate were investigated. During this study, the maximum yield of pyrolysis bio-oil 50.6 wt% can be achieved under the operation conditions of 450 °C process temperature, 1.0 mm particle size at sweep gas flow rate of 1.75 m3/h. At the end of the study the bio-oil obtained from the flash pyrolysis was analyzed for physical, elemental and chemical compositions by using Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and 1H NMR spectroscopy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic components in pyrolysis bio-oil is considered to be a potential strategy for producing renewable aromatic chemicals. The key issue of this process is the establishment of an effective catalytic system that can cleave the CAr-O bonds without affecting the aromatic structure. To achieve this goal, an efficient heterogeneous catalyst with solid acid support (WOx/ZrO2) and active metal (Ru) was prepared in this study. The Ru-WOx/ZrO2 catalyst can effectively convert model phenolic compounds into aromatic hydrocarbons. For a mixed phenolic sample, the conversion to and selectivity for arenes were all around 90%. The good selectivity was proved to be strongly related to the surface adsorption and acid properties of the catalyst as well as the reaction pathway. Moreover, the hydrodeoxygenation of a pretreated bio-oil was also conducted and presented a satisfactory yield of arenes at 240 °C with 1 MPa of H2 reacted for 5 h. The depolymerization of high-molecular-weight phenolic oligomers was found to be significant during the catalytic process, which further enhanced the yield of aromatic monomers. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Platinum and WOx-promoted platinum supported on SiO2-Al2O3, Al2O3, AlPO4-5 and ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method and investigated for deoxygenation of oleic acid (OA, a representative fatty acid) producing diesel-range hydrocarbons. Support and WOx influenced the textural, electronic and catalytic properties of Pt. WOx promoted the deoxygenation activity through hydrodeoxygenation pathway. Structure-activity correlations revealed that metallicity of Pt and acidity of the catalyst are crucial in determining the catalytic performance and product selectivity. Among the catalysts tested, 4Pt-8WOx/ZrO2, having adequate metal dispersion and electron rich Pt (desired for hydrogen splitting), reduced WOx species (W5+; -desired for OA activation) and less amount of strong acid sites (desired to avoid hydrocracking) showed highest catalytic deoxygenation performance (OA conversion = 100 mol% and C18 hydrocarbon selectivity = 89.4% at 260 °C and 20 bar H2 pressure). The study reveals that support plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of platinum. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, non-edible seed oil namely raw neem oil was converted into biodiesel using transesterification process. In the experimentation, two biodiesel blends were prepared namely B25 (25% neem oil methyl ester with 75% of diesel) and B50 (50% neem oil methyl ester with 50% diesel). Urea-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technique with catalytic converter (CC) was fixed in the exhaust tail pipe of the engine for the reduction of engine exhaust emissions. Initially, the engine was operated with diesel as a working fluid and followed by refilling of biodiesel blends B25 and B50 to obtain the baseline readings without SCR and CC. Then, the same procedure was repeated with SCR and CC technique for emission reduction measurement in diesel, B25 and B50 sample. The experimental results revealed that the B25 blend showed higher break thermal efficiency (BTE) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) with lower break-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) than B50 blend at all loads. On comparing with biodiesel blends, diesel experiences increased BTE of 31.9% with reduced BSFC of 0.29 kg/kWh at full load. A notable emission reduction was noticed for all test fuels in SCR and CC setup. At full load, B25 showed lower carbon monoxide (CO) of 0.09% volume, hydrocarbon (HC) of 24 ppm, and smoke of 14 HSU and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) of 735 ppm than diesel and B50 in SCR and CC setup. On the whole, the engine with SCR and CC setup showed better performance and emission characteristics than standard engine operation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, Jatropha oil was catalytically cracked using Co(NO3)2 and Mn(NO3)2 as heterogeneous catalysts at different ratios of 0.5%–3% to obtain different grades of biofuel. The physical and fuel properties of the obtained biofuels were characterized by measuring the following properties: density, viscosity, specific gravity, pour point, flash and fire points, cetane number, carbon and ash residues and sulfur content. The determined properties were located within the limits of the specific standards of ASTM specifications. The type of transition metal and the ratio of the used catalysts were greatly affect the physical and fuel properties of the obtained biofuels. Comparing the reactivity of (Co(NO3)2 and Mn(NO3)2) as catalytic cracking catalysts revealed that Co(NO3)2 is more reactive than Mn(NO3)2. Using of low catalysts ratio produced biofuel comparable to biodiesel according to ASTM specifications; while higher catalyst ratio produced biofuel comparable to bio-gasoline. Lighter fractions of the biofuel in the range of gasoline were produced at higher catalysts ratios and the optimum concentration was 3%. The reactivity of the two salts was discussed based on their electronic configurations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To achieve the emission mitigation and decarbonization goals, future aviation requires alternative sustainable fuels. Synthetic paraffinic kerosene, generated by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, is certified as a drop-in jet fuel up to 50%. Potential fuel production routes are via conversion of biomass (Biomass-to-Liquid, BtL), the combination of renewable power and biomass (Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquid, PBtL) and the conversion of carbon dioxide with hydrogen from renewable power (Power-to-Liquid, PtL). In order to compare the three different production routes, an Aspen Plus® model is designed for each production path and techno-economically assessed for an assumed capacity of 11 Mg h−1 fuel production (equals 90 Gg·a−1 plant capacity). Even though the BtL route allows the lowest net production costs, it has some drawbacks compared to PBtL and PtL. Especially the low H to C ratio of biomass leads to limited fuel yields in the BtL process. These yields can be increased by a factor of about 3 when conducting the PBtL process with the same biomass input instead of BtL. The highest X-to-Liquid efficiency based on power input and energy in feedstock is found for PBtL (51.4%) followed by PtL (50.6%) and BtL (36.3%). For BtL 73% of the introduced carbon is lost as CO2. The total investment costs are highest for BtL, followed by PBtL and PtL. The net production costs are in the reverse order. The cost analysis reveals total PBtL investment costs of 742 M€ and net production costs of around 3 €·kg−1 with an electricity price of 105 €·MWh−1. The costs for electrolyzer and gasifier represent the largest shares of the total capital costs. As the net production costs are dominated for the electricity costs, low electricity prices and high capacities are advantageous for PBtL, while high electricity and low biomass costs favor BtL concept. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The lipid content in leather fleshing waste is very high and hence, an innovative method for the complete extraction of lipid for biofuel generation was carried out. Acid/base assisted fat extraction method was developed for industrial application without the use of inorganic solvents. The lipid yield of about 25.4% was achieved with 98% of extraction efficiency when the extraction was carried out with 4% of H2SO4 at 120 °C for 1.5 h. Acid hydrolysis assisted Soxhlet method extraction yielded of about 26% with 100% extraction efficiency in 1.5 h at 80 °C with reduced solvent consumption and time. The acid hydrolysis method is also industrially viable to process a huge quantity of fat rich solid waste materials. Also, the energy consumption is comparatively low when compared to the traditional solvent extraction method. The hydrolyzed leather fleshing and fat oil is characterized by FTIR, SEM, TGA, GC-MS and H1 NMR spectroscopy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The renewable energy sources are considered the vital factor to promote global green business. The environmental cost of doing business is the pre-requisite to analyze sustainable policies that facilitate the eco-minded entrepreneurs to produce healthier goods. This study examines the impact of renewable energy sources (i.e., hydro energy, biofuel energy, and wind energy) on the environmental cost of doing business in a panel of BRICS (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa) countries, for the period of 1995–2015. The study employed principal component analysis to construct an “integrated environmental index” by using three alternative and plausible factors including carbon dioxide emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption, and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. The environmental index is used as an interactive term with the three cost of doing business indicators including business disclosure index, the cost of business start-up procedures, and logistics performance index to form environmental cost of doing business (ECDB) indicators. The results of three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimator show that foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows supported the green business while trade openness deteriorates the environment, which partially validates the “pollution haven hypotheses (PHH)” in a panel of countries. There is no evidence for environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis; however, there is a monotonic decreasing relationship between per capita income and ECDB indicators. The hydro energy supports the sustainable business environment, while biofuel consumption deteriorates the environmental impact on the cost of business start-up procedures. Finally, wind energy subsequently affected the ECDB indicators in a panel of BRICS countries. The overall results conclude that growth factors and energy sources both have a considerable impact on the cost of doing business; therefore, there is a momentous need to formulate sustainable policy vista to magnetize green business across countries. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A combination of postsynthesis modifications and ion exchange aiming to obtain basic cation-rich hierarchical zeolites X and Y was utilized in this work for the preparation of catalysts for biofuel production from vegetable oils. The secondary mesopore system with a narrow pore size distribution in the 4 nm range was introduced by successive acid and base treatments accompanied by surfactant templating. This was followed by ion exchange with Cs+ and K+ cations to produce strong basic catalysts. The prepared hierarchical zeolites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and solid-state NMR. The transesterification reaction over the zeolite catalysts was performed in a microwave batch-type reactor, and the effects of the reaction conditions, basic properties, and pore structure of the hierarchical faujasites were studied in detail. The conversion of triglycerides increased with increasing concentration of Cs and K in modified zeolites but declined with decreasing framework aluminum content. The balance between the strength of the basic sites and their accessibility in hierarchical zeolites and its effect on the catalytic performance of these nanostructured materials is discussed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) of farm biomass is growing importance as it offers environmental benefits and the biogas produced from AD which can be used as fuel for co-generation of heat and electricity. The study aimed to explore the viability of energy recovery from bio-waste on a small-scale dairy farm to produce biogas using AD and the gas used as biofuel to fuel a combined heat and power (CHP) which generated electrical power and heat for the farm. The AD and the CHP system was designed and simulated using ECLIPSE software. Various ages of cow manure were sampled, analysed and used as an AD feedstock and it was found that as cow manure aged the amount biogas produced from anaerobic digestion was decreased; a reduction in biogas production of 5.76% was found over two months, and in the subsequent two months the reduction rate was found to accelerate, leading to a 16.92% reduction after four months. It was found that 1 t fresh manure as the feedstock produced 58.6 m3 of biogas. That means cow manure should be used as an AD feedstock as soon as possible, as carbon lost in the form of methane (CH4) occurs naturally in the atmosphere, accelerating over time. The rate of CH4 emission is increased by 3 fold (i.e. 21,196 kg per year) if the annual manure mass is left uncovered for four month. Early insertion of fresh manure into an anaerobic digester can significantly increase biogas production and subsequently reduce emissions of CH4, which has a global warming potential (GWP) of twenty-five times that of carbon dioxide (CO2). The simulation results indicated that enough energy can be recovered from the quantity of cow manure available on the farm to provide the electrical and heating energy demands of the farmyard and the attached dwellings, thus creating a sustainable farming system. In combination with the environmental benefits, it was determined that a substantial annual revenue could be generated from utility bill savings and current favourable incentive rates available to promote renewable energy technologies in farming industry in the UK. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Saccharification of lignocellulose is a necessary procedure for deconstructing the complex structure for building a sugar platform that can be used for producing biofuel and high-value chemicals. In this study, a carbon-based solid acid catalyst derived from sodium lignosulfonate, a waste by-product from the paper industry, was successfully prepared and used for the hydrolysis of hemicellulose in corncob. The optimum preparation conditions for the catalyst were determined to be carbonization at 250 °C for 6 h, followed by sulfonation with concentrated H2SO4 (98%) and oxidation with 10% H2O2 (solid-liquid ratio of 1:75 g mL-1) at 50 °C for 90 min. SEM, XRD, FT-IR, elemental analysis and acid-base titration were used for the characterization of the catalysts. It was found that 0.68 mmol g-1 SO3H and 4.78 mmol g-1 total acid were loaded onto the catalyst. When corncob was hydrolyzed by this catalyst at 130 °C for 12 h, the catalyst exhibited high selectivity and produced a relatively high xylose yield of up to 84.2% (w/w) with a few by-products. Under these conditions, the retention rate of cellulose was 82.5%, and the selectivity reached 86.75%. After 5 cycles of reuse, the catalyst still showed high catalytic activity, with slightly decreased yields of xylose from 84.2% to 70.7%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.

AB  - The production of gas via bio-oil gasification, which would act as a bridge between bio-oil and transportation fuels, has been increasingly concerned. Bio-oil gasification was performed by using air - steam as gasifying agents. The effects of two important influential factors (steam to bio-oil ratio and gasifier temperature) on the quality of the product gas (gas composition, H2: CO, CO: CO2, tar content, degree of oxidation and heating value) and the gasification process performance (gas yield, steam decomposition, cold gas efficiency, and carbon conversion efficiency) were investigated. The results showed that the impact of the steam to bio-oil on the gas quality and gasification performance had an optimum point (steam to bio-oil ratio = 2.5); However, the influence of the gasifying temperature on both of them demonstrated a sole monotone function. The hydrogen concentration in the product gas reached a maximum of 30.0 vol.% and the ratio of H2/CO basically remained 2.0 over a range of steam to bio-oil ratio from 2.5 to 4.0. The product gas with such a H2/CO ratio is expected to be applied in CO hydrogenation processes, such as Co-catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Moreover, the product gas is also suitable for the generation of electricity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of raw kaolinite-supported SO4 2−/ZnAl2O4 (S/ZA-Kao) macroporous solid acid catalysts were synthesized and applied in esterification of both oleic acid with methanol and acetic acid with n-butanol for the biofuels synthesis. The structures and acidic properties of S/ZA-Kao catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, FE-SEM, EDS, BET, FT-IR (direct and NH3 adsorbed), NH3-TPD, TG and XPS. The results indicated the mass ratio of ZnAl2O4/kaolinite played a significant role in adjusting the active components dispersion, textural and acidic properties. The optimal S/ZA-Kao(6:4) catalysts performed the macroporous structure and the high dispersion of active components, which might be the essential reason for its improved acid sites and reduced limitation of mass transfer. As a result, the macroporous solid acid exhibited superior conversion of 98.2% in acetic acid esterification and 70.1% in oleic acid esterification. The kinetic study demonstrated that the relatively lower values of activation energy over the S/ZA-Kao(6:4) macroporous solid acid, further confirming that the macroporous solid acid was highly efficient for the biofuel synthesis via esterification. Moreover, the further investigation indicated the catalytic activities were closely related to the ratio of Brönsted acid sites on catalysts. Besides, S/ZA-Kao(6:4) macroporous solid acid particularly displayed excellent reusability, which was due to its structural stability and high dispersion of active components. © 2018

AB  - Rising level of CO2, increasing demands and price of fossil fuel, generation of waste are the major challenges of the modern society. Biorefinery approach for production of biodiesel using waste as feedstock could be an alternative of these problems. The present research demonstrates the use of municipal secondary sludge as growth media for production of biodiesel by chemolithotrophic, oleaginous bacteria Serratia sp. ISTD04. The characterization of bacteria and biodiesel was performed by TEM and GC–MS, NMR respectively. The hydrocarbon range, C-7 to C-25 and suitable saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composition, makes it an impending fuel. Optimization of in-situ transesterification process parameters increased the yield by 25% and similarly increases in transesterification efficiency from 74% to 94%. The fuel properties (Total acid value, Cetane number, Cloud point, Pour point, Heating value, Kinematic viscosity) of 5% blended biodiesel was analyzed by ASTM standard methods and its shows good fuel behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were prepared by precipitating ferrous ion (Fe2+) and ferric ion (Fe3+) in alkaline solution. The Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were modified by tannic acid. After functionalization process, two methods were used to immobilize Lipase on Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles. In the first method, novel tannic acid magnetic cross-linked enzyme aggregates of lipase (TA-MNPs-CLEAs) were synthesized by cross-linking of lipase aggregates and starch as co-feeder with Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles improved by tannic acid (TA-MNPs). In the second method, the lipase was successfully immobilized on the surface of TA-MNPs. The properties of Fe3O4 and its modified forms were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and zeta potential measurements. Novel TA-MNPs-lipase and TA-MNPs-CLEAs-starch-lipase were enhanced and provided an effective method to improve the activity and stability of lipase for biodiesel production. Using 1% TA-MNPs-lipase and TA-MNPs-CLEAs-starch (w/w of oil) conversions around 67.87, and 85.88%, respectively, were obtained at 40 °C after 2 h of reaction. Furthermore, the immobilized enzyme was easily recovered from the reaction mixture and reused. The obtained results suggest that TA-MNPs-lipase and TA-MNPs-CLEAs-starch-lipase can become a powerful biocatalyst for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A methodology for the synthesis of gasoline-range fuels from carbon neutral resources is introduced. Sorbitol, a sugar-based compound, was employed as a raw material because the compound is readily obtained from cellulose. Gasoline-range hydrocarbons were produced via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) on zirconium phosphate-supported Pd-bimetallic (Pt−Pd, Ru−Pd, Ni−Pd, Fe−Pd, Co−Pd, W−Pd) catalysts. Among the tested catalysts, the bimetallic W−Pd/ZrP catalyst exhibited the highest yield of gasoline products, peaking at ∼70%. However, with the bimetallic Fe−Pd and Co−Pd catalysts, high-octane gasoline products were made (research octane number (RON) of the products was higher than 100). The Fe−Pd catalyst also showed the highest initial activity for the HDO of sorbitol. This study demonstrates that HDO in the Pd-system is a promising option to produce high-quality gasoline-range hydrocarbons from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present investigation, the effects of crude glycerol concentration, spore inoculum concentration, yeast extract concentration and shaking frequency on seed morphology of Aspergillus niger PJR1 on malic acid production were investigated and dispersed fungal mycelium with higher biomass (20.25 ± 0.91 g/L) was obtained when A. niger PJR1 grow on crude glycerol. Dry cell weight under dispersed fermentation was 21.28% higher than usual pellet fermentation. The optimal crude glycerol, nitrogen source and nitrogen source concentration were found to be 160 g/L, yeast extract and 1.5 g/L, respectively. Batch fermentation in a shake flask culture containing 160 g/L crude glycerol resulted in the yield of malic acid 83.23 ± 1.86 g/L, after 192 h at 25 °C. Results revealed that morphological control of A. niger is an efficient method for increased malic acid production when crude glycerol derived from biodiesel production is used as feedstock. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs, biodiesel) was optimized from wet Nannochloropsis gaditana microalgal biomass (81.8 wt% water and 28.1 wt% saponifiable lipids, SLs, from the dry biomass). FAME production was carried out by direct acid-catalyzed methylation of the SLs from the microalgal biomass and FAME extraction with hexane. A three-variable, three-level Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied to optimize the sulphuric acid (catalyst) concentration, the methanol/SL ratio and the hexane/SL ratio. The best FAME yield was obtained with a methanol/SL ratio of 254 mL/g, a sulphuric acid concentration of 3.7% (v/v) and a hexane/SL ratio of 107.7 mL/g at 100 °C and for 105 min. Under these conditions, 100% of the SLs were transformed into FAMEs. Finally, the FAME purity was increased from 78.7 to 86.8 wt% using an adsorption treatment with bentonite. © 2018

AB  - As a part of developing a hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process to valorise lignin, it is important to consider integration possibilities with existing infrastructures in order to obtain an overall positive economic impact. One obvious example is to integrate the HTL process with the kraft pulp mill: transport and storage costs is reduced, the temperature levels on process streams can be matched (energy integration) and the recovery/use of alkali can be made efficient. In this study, softwood kraft lignin was depolymerised using sub-critical water (623 K; 25 MPa) in a continuous, small pilot unit with a flow rate of 2 kg/h. ZrO2, K2CO3/KOH and Na2CO3/NaOH were used as catalytic system, and phenol as the capping agent. The influence of the ratio between sodium and potassium in the feed on the yield and composition of the product stream was investigated. The results showed that bio-oil, water-soluble organics (WSO) and char yields were not remarkably influenced by shifting the catalytic system from potassium to sodium. Moreover, the yields of most phenolic compounds did not change significantly when the sodium fraction was varied in the feed. The amounts of suspended solids in the bio-oil produced showed, however, a diminishing trend, (decrease from 10.8 to 3.8%) when the sodium fraction was increased in the feed, whilst the opposite trend was observed for the heavy oil, which increased from 24.6 to 37.6%. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Bio-based chemicals can be produced from furfural through hydrotreatment. In this study, 2-methylfuran (MF), a potential biofuel component, was produced with Pt, Ru, and Ni catalysts supported on wood-based activated carbons. The catalytic hydrotreatment experiments were conducted in a batch reactor at 210–240 °C with 2-propanol as solvent and 40 bar H2 pressure. Two types of activated carbon supports were prepared by carbonization and activation of lignocellulosic biomass (forest-residue-based birch and spruce from Finland). Both types of activated carbons were suitable as catalyst supports, giving up to 100 % furfural conversions. The most important factors affecting the MF yield were the metal dispersion and particle size as well as reaction temperature. The highest observed MF yields were achieved with the noble metal catalysts with the highest dispersions at 240 °C after 120 min reaction time: 3 wt % Pt on spruce (MF yield of 50 %) and 3 wt % Ru on birch (MF yield of 49 %). Nickel catalysts were less active most likely owing to lower dispersions and incomplete metal reduction. Interesting results were obtained also with varying the metal loadings: the lower Pt loading (1.5 wt %) achieved almost the same MF yield as the 3 wt % catalysts, which can enable the production of MF with high yields and reduced catalyst costs. Based on this study, biomass-based renewable activated carbons can be used as catalyst supports in furfural hydrotreatment with high conversions. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Integrating enzymatic treatment and acid hydrolysis potentially improves the economics of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) production and demonstrates a sustainable cellulosic ethanol co-generation strategy. In this study, the effect of enzymatic treatment on filter paper and wood pulp fibers, and CNCs generated via subsequent acid hydrolysis were assessed. Characterization was performed using a pulp quality monitoring system, scanning and transmission electron microscopies, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. Enzymatic treatment partially reduced fiber length, but caused swelling, indicating simultaneous fragmentation and layer erosion. Preferential hydrolysis of less ordered cellulose by cellulases slightly improved the crystallinity index of filter paper fiber from 86% to 88%, though no change was observed for wood pulp fibre. All CNC colloids were stable with zeta potential values below -39 mV and hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 205 to 294 nm. Furthermore, the temperature for the peak rate of CNC thermal degradation was generally not affected by enzymatic treatment. These findings demonstrate that CNCs of comparable quality can be produced from an enzymatically-mediated acid hydrolysis biorefining strategy that co-generates fermentable sugars for biofuel production. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis characteristics of walnut shell and bio-oil distillation residue were investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis followed by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (TGA-FTIR). Multiple reaction models were employed to fit individual pyrolysis experiment of walnut shell and bio-oil distillation residue to find the optimal model for further analysis of co-pyrolysis. The results showed that the pyrolysis behavior of bio-oil distillation residue was different from that of walnut shell. Compared to the pyrolysis of walnut shell, bio-oil distillation residue retained more biochar and a relatively lower rate of mass loss. However, the best fitting models for walnut shell and bio-oil distillation residue were all five-reaction model through comparing the fitting effect and the component complexity. Moreover, five-reaction model was introduced to analyze the co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and bio-oil distillation residue, indicating that the co-pyrolysis had good adaptability to five-reaction model. The thermal degradation of the co-pyrolysis shoulder and spike peaks could be accurately predicted. In addition, the gas products of bio-oil distillation residue and walnut shell had the same absorption band by infrared spectroscopy, indicating that the pyrolysis of two raw materials had similar products while the different absorption intensities represented different concentrations of gas products. Based on Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods, as the proportion of walnut shell in blend sample increased, the average activation energy gradually increased except for the pure walnut shell. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The overreliance on dwindling fossil fuel reserves and the negative climatic effects of using such fuels are driving the development of new clean energy sources. One such alternative source is hydrogen (H 2 ), which can be generated from renewable sources. Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius is a facultative anaerobic thermophilic bacterium which is frequently isolated from high temperature environments including hot springs and compost. Results: Comparative genomics performed in the present study showed that P. thermoglucosidasius encodes two evolutionary distinct H 2 -uptake [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenases and one H 2 -evolving hydrogenases. In addition, genes encoding an anaerobic CO dehydrogenase (CODH) are co-localized with genes encoding a putative H 2 -evolving hydrogenase. The co-localized of CODH and uptake hydrogenase form an enzyme complex that might potentially be involved in catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 ) in P. thermoglucosidasius. Cultivation of P. thermoglucosidasius DSM 2542 T with an initial gas atmosphere of 50% CO and 50% air showed it to be capable of growth at elevated CO concentrations (50%). Furthermore, GC analyses showed that it was capable of producing hydrogen at an equimolar conversion with a final yield of 1.08 H 2 /CO. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of the facultative anaerobic P. thermoglucosidasius DSM 2542 T for developing new strategies for the biohydrogen production. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Wheat straw can be converted into biofuel candidate-methyl levulinate with copper sulfate as the cheap catalyst. To take advantage of the whole components of wheat straw, a two-stage pretreatment process was developed in this study. In the first-stage process, the hemicellulose component in wheat straw can be converted into biosurfactant at the mild conditions, and the lignin component can be extracted as another value added by-product in the second stage. On the basis, the pretreated wheat straw was used as raw material for methyl levulinate production, and a yield of 20.2 wt% can be obtained under the optimum reaction conditions. Meanwhile, the catalyst recycling experiments showed that copper sulfate was stable and can be reused more than five times. The results of mass balances and preliminary economic analysis further indicated that the production of integrated biorefinery processes producing diversified products offers potential for the sustainable valorization of wheat straw. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biogas production using waste activated sludge (WAS) is one of the most demanding technologies for sludge treatment and generating energy in sustainable manner. The present study deals with the photocatalytic pretreatment of WAS using ZnO-ZnS@polyaniline (ZnO-ZnS@PANI) nanocomposite as means for increasing its degradability for improved biogas production by anaerobic digestion (AD). Photocatalysis accelerated the hydrolysis of WAS and increased the sCOD by 6.7 folds after 6 h and transform tCOD into bioavailable sCOD. After the AD of WAS, a removal of organic matter (60.6%) and tCOD (69.3%) was achieved in photocatalytic pretreated sludge. The biogas production was 1.6 folds higher in photocatalytic sludge with accumulative biogas up to 1645.1 ml L−1vs after 45 days compared with the raw sludge (1022.4 ml L−1 VS). Moreover, the photocatalysis decrease the onset of methanogenesis from 25 to 12 days while achieve the maximum conversion rate of reducing sugars into organic acids at that time. These results suggested that photocatalysis is an efficient pretreatment method and ZnO-ZnS@PANI can degrade sludge efficiently for enhance biogas production in anaerobic digestion process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The activity coefficients at infinite dilution, γ13∞ and gas-liquid partition coefficients, KL for 62 solutes: alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, thiophene, ethers, ketones, esters, butanal, nitrogen compounds and water in the ionic liquid trihexyl-tetradecyl-phosphonium tricyanamide were determined by gas-liquid chromatography at the temperatures from 328.15 K to 368.15 K. The partial molar excess Gibbs energies ΔG1E,∞, enthalpies ΔH1E,∞ and entropies ΔS1E,∞ at infinite dilution were calculated from the experimental γ13∞ values obtained over the temperature range. The selectivities and capacities at infinite dilution for water/butan-1-ol separation problem were calculated from the γ13∞ and compared to the literature values for other ionic liquids. High selectivity was obtained in comparison to other ionic liquids. Butanol is considered as possible biofuel. This alcohol is produced by fermentation and it must be separated from the aqueous fermentation broth. The values of KL were used to determine the linear free energy relationship (LFER) system constants as a function of temperature. The density of the investigated ionic liquid was also measured at temperatures from 298.15 K to 368.15 K. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Quantitative production of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) was achieved at room temperature (25 °C) via highly selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) employing alkali salt KF as catalyst and polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) as hydrogen source. A moderate turnover frequency (TOF: 4.2 h−1) was observed for this mild and sustainable reaction process. Moreover, a combination of Amberlyst-15 with KF could successfully catalyze the direct synthesis of BHMF from hexose sugars such as fructose and inulin via tandem dehydration and hydrogenation in a single pot. This catalytic system is more selective compared with H2-participated counterpart, giving a high BHMF yield and selectivity of up to 98% and &gt;99% from HMF, respectively. Moreover, the catalytic performance of KF could remain for at least five consecutive cycles in the conversion of HMF to BHMF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present investigation, crude glycerol derived from transesterification process was utilized to produce the commercially-valuable malic acid. A combined resistant on methanol and malic acid strain of Aspergillus niger MTCC 281 mutant was generated in solid medium containing methanol (1–5%) and malic acid (40–80 g/L) by the adaptation process for 22 weeks. The ability of induced Aspergillus niger MTCC 281 mutant to utilize crude glycerol and pure glycerol to produce malic acid was studied. The yield of malic acid was increased with 4.45 folds compared with that of parent strain from crude glycerol. The highest concentration of malic acid from crude glycerol by using beneficial mutant was found to be 77.38 ± 0.51 g/L after 192 h at 25 °C. This present study specified that crude glycerol by-product from biodiesel production could be used for producing high amount of malic acid without any pretreatment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to rapid changes in food habits, a substantial amount of waste fat and used oils are generated each year. Due to strong policies, the disposal of this material into nearby sewers causes ecological and environmental problems in many parts of the world. For efficient management, waste cooking oil, a less expensive, alternative and promising feedstock, can be used as a raw material for producing biofuel. In the present study, we produced a biodiesel from hydrolyzed waste cooking oil with a subcritical methanol process using a synthesized solid super acid catalyst, a sulfated zirconium oxide supported on Santa Barbara Amorphous silica (S-ZrO2/SBA-15). The characterization of the synthesized catalyst was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The catalytic effect on biodiesel production was examined by varying the parameters: temperatures of 120 to 200 °C, 5-20 min times, oil-to-methanol mole ratios between 1:5 to 1:20, and catalyst loadings of 1-2.5%. The maximum biodiesel yield was 96.383%, obtained under optimum reaction conditions of 140 °C, 10 min, and a 1:10 oil-to-methanol molar ratio with a 2.0% catalyst loading. We successfully reused the catalyst five times without regeneration with a 90% efficiency. The fuel properties were found to be within the limits set by the biodiesel standard. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In order to reduce the economic and environmental consequences caused by spent car catalyst, we herein report for the first time a novel promising multi-metal catalyst prepared from spent car catalytic converters to upgrade the pyrolysis bio-oils. The physico-chemical properties of prepared catalyst were characterized by XRD, EDS, FESEM, and FT-IR analyses. The thermal stability of the multi-metal catalyst was studied with TGA. To investigate the activity of the catalyst, Conversion of Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) into bio-products was carried out via a fixed bed reactor with and without catalyst at the temperature of 500 °C. Although the catalyst didn't catalyze the gasification reaction, bio-oil was upgraded over the catalyst. The main effect of the catalyst on the bio-oil components is deoxygenating of nitrogen compounds and promotion the ketonization reaction, which converts acid to ketone and declines the corrosive nature of bio-oil. © 2017

AB  - In 1972, for the first time, the term “sustainable development” was coined at the Stockholm conference, and in 1987, the Brundtland report established the sustainability-innovation “binomial”. Since then, extensive research into sustainability-oriented innovation has been conducted, focused during the last decade on SMEs and recognizing these as the main actor of sustainable development, for which foreign direct investment (FDI) is considered, from a research and institutional point of view, as a vital source, although academic literature presents conflicting conclusions. In this context, this paper aims to perform a microeconomic analysis of how FDI influences the innovative process of SMEs and how this can lead to a process oriented towards sustainability. To this end, a panel of 4667 SMEs has been analyzed, spanning a sample period between 2004 and 2013, through a binary logit model, which compares and contrasts SMEs with FDI and equivalent SMEs without FDI, over time and, therefore, exposed to a changing economy. The most significant results are that FDI is attracted mainly by factors associated with technological supply, which, when coupled with being of medium size and located in a manufacturing sector of medium-high technology, generates positive spillovers. These depend, to a large extent, on public funding, which allows these companies to be more innovative and makes it more likely they focus their innovative process on sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The different catalytic behaviour of solid acid catalyst and mineral acid catalyst towards the acid-treatment of bio-oil was investigated. The hydrogen ions in the mineral acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid homogeneously dispersed in the reaction medium made the conversion of main components of bio-oil including carboxylic acids, sugars and phenolics more efficient. In comparison, there was a steric hindrance for these components of bio-oil to access the hydrogen located in the local surface of the solid acid catalyst such as Amberlyst 70. This negatively affected their conversions during the acid-treatment. However, the inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen ions from Amberlyst 70 in the reaction medium created high concentration of hydrogen ions in the local vicinity of the solid catalyst surface of the catalyst, which is found to be crucial for the occurrence of the etherification reactions. Understanding how the dispersion of hydrogen ions of catalyst affect the esterification of bio-oil can provide useful information for the development of the effective catalysts for upgrading of bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Production of molecular scale palladium (Pd) nanoparticles (NPs) is important due to their catalytic function in electrochemical oxidation of a number of core fuel molecules in fuel cells. Biogenic methods offer an economic and environmentally friendly synthesis route. In this work, the electrochemically active bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is employed as a reducing agent to generate PdNPs as well as a support for the immobilization of the PdNPs. The synthesis was carried out at 28 °C and pH 7.0, and completed within one hour. The PdNPs are monodisperse (6.2 nm) and located on the bacterial membrane surface. Mapping by conductive atomic force microscopy shows that the presence of these PdNPs promotes electron transfer and enhances the electric conductivity of the cells. Compared to electrodeposited PdNPs, PdNPs generated by S. oneidensis MR-1 catalyze electrochemically the oxidation of formate with 200 mV less over-potential. Notably they show unique selective activity toward electrochemical oxidation of formate, whereas no electrochemical catalysis was found for oxidation of ethanol, methanol and acetate. This work demonstrates a sustainable and low-cost method for producing efficient PdNP catalysts with high catalytic selectivity. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The in situ (one-step) acid-catalyzed transesterification step for conversion to biodiesel of biomass from oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica grown on waste cooking oil (WCO) is studied. The process yield of biodiesel was optimized by investigating effects of various parameters, namely, biomass, methanol, chloroform, catalyst, temperature, time and sonication. A Plackett-Burman statistical design of experiments revealed that biomass is the most significant factor influencing biodiesel (FAME, fatty acid methyl ester) production. Subsequently, a one variable design (OVD) of experiments for increased biomass loadings showed higher yields of FAME with no additional requirement of reactants, solvents or special equipment. The biomass grown on WCO had a lipid productivity of 0.042 g L-1 h−1 and 4 g of this loading gave a high FAME yield of 0.88 g in 8 h at 50 °C with methanol: chloroform (10:1) and acid catalyst (0.2 M H2SO4,1.0 ml g−1). The FAME profile had desirable amounts of saturated (32.81%), monounsaturated (36.41%), polyunsaturated (30.59%) methyl esters. The predicted and experimentally determined physico-chemical properties of FAME were found in accordance with specified international standards. Thus, the direct one-pot in situ transesterification reaction using Y. lipolytica biomass grown on WCO provides a high yield of biodiesel with potential applicability while simultaneously addressing the management of this pollutant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rice husks are pyrolyzed in a fluidized bed pyrolyzer and the produced vaporized bio-oils are immediately separated by fractional distillation. The effects of the pyrolysis temperature, rice husk feeding rate and superficial gas velocity on the distributions of chars, bio-oils and syngases in the product are studied. When the pyrolysis temperature is 500 °C, the rice husk feeding rate is 20 g/min and the superficial gas velocity is 0.340 m/s, the mass fraction of bio-oil in the product shows the highest value of 30.4%. The decomposable volatiles in the chars are the lowest for the chars obtained at the lower rice husk feeding rate of 10 g/min and higher superficial gas velocity of 0.425 m/s. GC–MS analyses indicate that the major chemicals in the bio-oils are acetic acid, furfural, phenol and phenol derivatives. The fractional distillation separates the bio-oil into a light fraction (C4–C7) and a heavy fraction (C7–C10). Relatively high content of acetic acid in the light fraction of the bio-oil is responsible to the lower pH value of the light fraction of the bio-oil. Phenolic compounds are rich in the heavy fraction. Vaporized bio-oils directly from the fluidized bed pyrolyzer are successfully graded by fractional distillation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The requirements for controlling particulate emissions in gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, particularly in hybrid vehicles (where frequent cold-start event impact on both, particles characteristics and catalytic aftertreament efficiency), nesesitates the need for understanding their formation mechanism and their morphological characteristics. The findings described in this investigation have significance in the design of efficient Gasoline Particulate Filters (GPFs) and the development of computational models that predict particle filtration and oxidation processes. Morphological analysis of the particulate emissions from the combustion of commercial gasoline and two bio-alcohol blends: of 25% v/v ethanol in gasoline and 33% v/v butanol and 67% v/v gasoline, in a modern GDI engine has been carried out using a transmission electron microscopy. The primary particle size distribution from the combustion of butanol-gasoline blend was slightly smaller compared to gasoline, while the mean primary particle diameter was 3 nm smaller from the combustion of ethanol-gasoline fuel. This decrease in primary particle size for ethanol-gasoline blend was also reflected in a reduction of the mean radius of gyration and mean number of primary particles per agglomerate. The combustion of butanol-gasoline blend induced improved particle oxidation rates during the combustion process and post-oxidation stage, and led in 80% and 60% reduction in particle concentration in the engine exhaust when compared to the combustion of gasoline and ethanol-gasoline blend, respectively. Additionally, the estimation of the particle fractal dimension through the use of fractal equation, minimum bonding rectangle method and root form factor showed comparable results for butanol-gasoline and gasoline, with the particle agglomerates being more compact than the ethanol-gasoline fuel, where more chain like particles are seen. Therefore, particles emitted from the combustion of ethanol-gasoline fuel are easier to be trapped (lower fractal dimension) and present a higher reactivity (high surface/volume ratio) compared to particles emitted from gasoline combustion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, series of sequential acid-alkaline and enzymatic saccharification treatments were applied on lignocellulosic biomass of Agave salmiana leaves in order to evaluate its conversion into simple sugars. The effects of a catalytic reagent and residence time were evaluated on lignocellulosic biomass. Also, several levels of FPU and cellulose loadings on the treated biomass were applied in the enzymatic saccharification. Upon completion of an acid-alkaline pretreatment, the resulting hemicellulose was completely hydrolyzed, whereas that lignin removed and the remaining cellulose reached values of 91 and 84% (w/w) respectively. The liquid by-product after acid pretreatment had a content of 0.50 g/L of glucose, 1.87 ± 0.045 g/L of arabinose, 21.35 g/L of xylose, and 39.15 g/L of reducing sugars. The saccharification process reached yields of 93.11% of conversion and glucose concentrations of 49.76 g/L. The sequential process was highly efficient in releasing simple sugars with concentrations of up to 88.91 g/L. This study provides data to improve the conversion processes of lignocellulosic components A. salmiana leaves into simple sugars, and illustrates the potential of using this crop's residue as a feedstock for biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports the synthesis of sulfonic acid functionalized Brønsted acidic ionic liquids (BAILs) using N,N-dimethyl acetamide [DMA]+, N-methylpyrrolidone [NMP]+ and 1-butyl-3-(4-sulfobutyl)imidazole [BBIM-BuSO3H]+ as cation, and methanesulfonyl [CH3SO3]− or (OTh−), trifluoromethanesulfonate [CF3SO3]− or (OTf−), and bis((trifluromethyl)sulfonyl)amide [(CF3SO3)2N]− or (NTf2 −) as anion source. The ionic liquids (ILs) demonstrated excellent catalytic performance in the valorization of waste streams of biomass to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), a high-value platform chemical and a promising biofuel additive. Catalytic screening indicated that BAILs containing NTf2 anion exhibits superior performance, giving highest HMF yield. Strong electron withdrawing properties of the trifluoromethyl functionality of [NTf2]− anion is proposed for this high activity of these BAILs. Detailed studies using NMR reveal the reaction proceeds through the (i) depolymerization of cellulose into glucose, followed by (ii) glucose isomerization to fructose and then the product HMF is formed by (iii) triple dehydration of fructose to HMF. Direct conversion of mushroom to EMF is also observed in one-pot with high yield when ethanol is used as a solvent in access amount. DFT calculations elucidated that the catalytic performance of the ILs followed the order of their deprotonation energies (DPE) which can be correlated directly to the residual charge on the Brønsted acidic proton. This study of valorization of waste mushroom coupled with DFT calculations, revealing DPE as an important descriptor, is likely the first report of this kind. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Considering a series of issues facing the application of catalysts in large scale catalytic fast pyrolysis systems, a novel composite catalyst of ZSM-5 coatings on SiC foam supports was developed and tested for ex-situ catalytic upgrading of the pyrolytic vapors. Different configurations of catalysts placement were compared and the results showed the composite catalyst could significantly improve the bio-oil quality without significantly reducing the yield. The effect of catalyst to biomass ratio on the product yields and bio-oil composition was studied and the results showed that increasing catalyst to biomass ratio could improve the quality of bio-oil at the cost of its yield. In addition, the composite catalyst can maintain its activity until a catalyst to biomass ratio of 1/10, outperforming ZSM-5 in other configurations reported in literature. Furthermore, the composite catalysts could be regenerated and reused while well preserving its material properties and catalytic activity after seven reaction-regeneration cycles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigates the performance and emission analyses of a turbo-charged diesel engine fuelled with pre-mixed and post-mixed hybrid biodiesel blends at varying load condition thereby maintaining injection timing, injection pressure and speed constant at 230bTDC, 220 bar and 1500 RPM. The experimental result depicted that post-mixed biodiesel blends (POBD 20) showed higher brake specific energy consumption and exhaust gas temperature by 4.6% and 2.02% than that of diesel while brake thermal efficiency was reduced by 5.68%. However, engine overall performance of post-mixed biodiesel blends (POBD 20) was found to be comparable with diesel and other prepared test fuel blends. Similarly, comparing exhaust emissions, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide were on its higher side by 2.64% and 2.43% than normal diesel fuel. On the contrary, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and smoke opacity for POBD 20 were found to be 36.87%, 51.5% and 23.2% lower than conventional diesel fuel. From the above study, it is finally concluded that POBD 20 blend may be used as an alternative optional fuel that can substitute present diesel fuel without much engine modification and exhaust related problems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of the biomass-derived lipid, lignocellulosic and carbohydrate resources into renewable platform intermediates, chemicals and biofuels has been lately increasing in interest. The mechanistic reaction pathways, like hydro-deoxygenation, decarboxylation and hydrocracking, of the selected palmitic acid, as a model fatty acid, over Ni/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts were studied. The ZSM-5 material with different Al/Si molar ratios was synthesized via a green template-free hydrothermal synthesis procedure, treated and subsequent functionalised with various Ni metal loadings. However, Ni/Al molar ratio was kept stoichiometric (Ni/Al = 0.5). The characteristic physicochemical properties of composite catalysts were studied by numerous characterization techniques, such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning-, as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (SEM/HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). NiO with an average particle size of 10–20 nm was found on ZSM-5 support. The relative Ni/Al atom fraction in Ni/ZSM-5 systems influenced their Lewis/Brønsted acidic sites, as well as the external exposed area of prepared heterogeneous structures. Furthermore, the mentioned morphological parameters affected predominant catalytic routes. Species’ production mechanism, as a consequence of Lewis/Brønsted centre weak/strong acidity, as well as their integral concentration, was proposed, mirroring the observed process kinetics, selectivity and turnover. It was demonstrated that the main obtained products were esters, aldehydes, alcohols, hydrocarbons and gases (CO2, CO…), produced by deoxygenation (e.g. decarbonylation), hydrogenation and cracking, less, though, through isomerisation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Slow pyrolysis of bamboo is an important conversion pathway to produce biofuels and chemicals such as biomass-derived fertilizer precursor (biochar). In this study, evolved gas analysis during pyrolysis of bamboo was conducted by a combination of TG, FTIR and GC–MS to establish a detailed pyrolysis mechanism of bamboo biomass. The main decomposition temperature zones were 300–400 °C and it reached the maximum mass loss intensity at 350 °C based on DTG curves. The main functional groups escaped from biomass during pyrolysis were –OH, –CH2, –CH3, C[dbnd]O, C–O, and –COOH. The main compounds during pyrolysis of bamboo were acetic acid and 2-propenoic acid, ethenyl ester at 300 °C, 2-oxo-propanoic acid and 1-hydroxy-2-propanone at 350 °C and acetic acid and acetic acid ethenyl ester at 400 °C. Evolved gas analysis indicated that components in bamboo occurred in different temperatures and pyrolysis mechanisms and resulted in distinguishing pyrolysis product emission characteristics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bio-oil, produced via fast pyrolysis of biomass, can be used as substitute for transportation fuels after its subsequent upgrading. However, conventional upgrading of bio-oil faces serious problems of rapid catalyst deactivation and low conversion efficiency, due to the high unsaturation degree of bio-oil. In this study, the mild hydrogenation of simulated bio-oil over monometallic catalysts (Pd and Pt) and bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Fe, Pd-Fe, Pt-Ni and Pd-Ni) was performed, in order to increase the saturation degree. It was found that the addition of Ni could significantly facilitate the conversion of phenols. The maximum conversion of guaiacol and phenol over Pt-Ni/SiO2 catalyst reached 97.8% and 99.6%, respectively. The introduction of Fe improved the conversion of AcOH by promoting the protonation of carbonyl group. Complete conversion of AcOH was achieved over Pt-Fe/SiO2 catalyst. The upgraded product, of which the activity was significantly improved, was ready for subsequent upgrading for liquid fuel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biological conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals and biofuels has emerged as an attractive strategy to address the energy and environmental concerns caused by the over-reliance on fossil fuels. In this study, an innovative microbial reverse-electrodialysis electrolysis cell (MREC), which combines the strengths of reverse electrodialysis (RED) and microbial electrosynthesis technology platforms, was developed to achieve efficient CO2-to-value chemicals bioconversion by using the salinity gradient energy as driven energy sources. In the MREC, maximum acetate and ethanol concentrations of 477.5 ± 33.2 and 46.2 ± 8.2 mg L−1 were obtained at the cathode, catalyzed by Sporomusa ovata with production rates of 165.79 ± 11.52 and 25.11 ± 4.46 mmol m−2 d−1, respectively. Electron balance analysis indicates that 94.4 ± 3.9% of the electrons derived from wastewater and salinity gradient were recovered in acetate and ethanol. This work for the first time proved the potential of innovative MREC configuration has the potential as an efficient technology platform for simultaneous CO2 capture and electrosynthesis of valuable chemicals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The heavy palm oil industry in Malaysia has generated various oil palm biomass residues. These residues can be converted into liquids (bio-oil) for replacing fossil-based fuels and chemicals. Studies on the conversion of these residues to bio-oil via pyrolysis technology are widely available in the literature. However, thermochemical liquefaction of oil palm biomass for bio-oil production is rarely studied and reported. In this study, palm kernel shell (PKS) was hydrothermally liquefied under subcritical and supercritical conditions to produce bio-oil. Effects of reaction temperature, pressure and biomass-to-water ratio on the characteristics of bio-oil were investigated. The bio-oils were analyzed for their chemical compositions (by GC–MS and FT-IR) and higher heating values (HHV). It was found that phenolic compounds were the main constituents of bio-oils derived from PKS for all reaction conditions investigated. Based on the chemical composition of the bio-oil, a general reaction pathway of hydrothermal liquefaction of PKS was postulated. The HHV of the bio-oils ranged from 10.5 to 16.1 MJ/kg, which were comparable to the findings reported in the literature. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - Sweet sorghum was subjected to an impregnation step, which recovered most of the 1st generation sugars, prior to a steam-treatment extraction of the 2nd generation sugars, at three different severity factors (SF). A medium severity (3.56 SF) treatment proved to be an optimal compromise between the amount of sugars extracted and the fermentation inhibitors generated following the subsequent depolymerization approaches applied on the broth. Next, a series of detoxification approaches (ozonation, overliming and a combination of both) were investigated following a concentration and depolymerization step. Results show that higher steam-treatment severity required more intense detoxification steps. However, when combining the 1st and 2nd generation streams at a 2:1 ratio, the inhibitors did not affect the fermentation process and ethanol yields above 90% of the theoretical maximum were achieved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, the direct electrochemistry of bilirubin oxidase from Magnaporthe orizae (MoBOD) was studied on CNTs functionalized by electrografting several types of diazonium salts. The functionalization induces favorable or unfavorable orientation of MoBOD, the latter being compared to the well-known BOD from Myrothecium verrucaria (MvBOD). On the same nanostructured electrodes, MoBOD can surpass MvBOD in terms of both current densities and minimal overpotentials. Added to the fact that MoBOD is also highly active at the gas-diffusion electrode (GDE), these findings make MoBOD one of the MCOs with the highest catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This work reports how warm water washing of biomass affects fast pyrolysis. Specifically, we applied this concept to Arundo donax, a common herbaceous biomass, and studied the washing effects on fast pyrolysis yields in a Py-GC/MS and a fluidized bed reactor. We stir-washed samples in water at 20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C, and found that water at 60 °C led to an 18% increase in the removal of ash and an 11% increase in the removal of potassium compared to a room temperature wash. We pyrolyzed these samples via Py-GC/MS-FID and found that the reduction in ash increased the pyrolysis yields of acetol, furanone and levoglucosan relative to the unwashed samples. Additionally, we pyrolyzed washed A. donax in a fluidized bed reactor and compared the results to those of unwashed A. donax. We found that A. donax washed at 60 °C produced 9.7 wt% more bio-oil than unwashed, with increases in glycolaldehyde and levoglucosan yields of 0.78 wt% and 1.24 wt%, respectively. The yield of olefinic gases increased by 0.22 wt% and yields of carbon dioxide and alkane gases decreased 2.40 wt% and 0.11 wt% respectively. Char and water yields decreased 4.32 wt% and 10.08 wt% respectively. The gas produced from pyrolysis of washed A. donax has a greater HHV than that from unwashed A. donax (7.77 MJ/kg vs. 6.81 MJ/kg). We believe these results are a consequence of differences in the extent of secondary reactions catalyzed by the inorganic species present in herbaceous biomass. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The characterization of coke deposited on a Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst used in the steam reforming of bio-oil has been studied by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) coupled with different in situ techniques: thermogravimetry (TG), modulated thermogravimetry (MTG), FTIR spectroscopy with mass spectrometry (MS), Raman spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The steam reforming of bio-oil was carried out in a reactor equipment with two steps in series, comprising bio-oil thermal treatment (500 °C) and subsequent reforming in a fluidized bed reactor (550–700 °C; and steam-to-carbon ratio, 1.5–6). TG/MS-TPO experiments identify encapsulating and filamentous coke, and a more detailed analysis using other in situ techniques enable to characterize the nature and location of 4 types of coke: (i) an encapsulating coke with aliphatic nature placed in the most superficial layers; (ii) an encapsulating coke with higher aromatic nature in inner layers; (iii) the most superficial layers of a filamentous coke, further from active sites and with a more carbonized structure compared to encapsulating coke; and (iv) an innermost and mainly polyaromatic filamentous coke with a low oxygenates content. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Protein engineering is a powerful tool to modify e.g. protein stability, activity and substrate selectivity. Heterologous expression of the enzyme α-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (Kivd) in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 results in cells producing isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, with Kivd identified as a potential bottleneck. In the present study, we used protein engineering of Kivd to improve isobutanol production in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Isobutanol is a flammable compound that can be used as a biofuel due to its high energy density and suitable physical and chemical properties. Single replacement, either Val461 to isoleucine or Ser286 to threonine, increased the Kivd activity significantly, both in vivo and in vitro resulting in increased overall production while isobutanol production was increased more than 3-methyl-1-butanol production. Moreover, among all the engineered strains examined, the strain with the combined modification V461I/S286T showed the highest (2.4 times) improvement of isobutanol-to-3M1B molar ratio, which was due to a decrease of the activity towards 3M1B production. Protein engineering of Kivd resulted in both enhanced total catalytic activity and preferential shift towards isobutanol production in Synechocystis PCC 6803. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In this work, we report for the first time the use of Li-LSX-zeolite as catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass (Isochrysis sp. Microalgae). Li-LSX-zeolite showed a good catalytic performance, principally for bio-oil denitrogenation (mainly in form of NH3), and good activity for olefins and aromatics production. At 500 °C, 11.8% aromatics and 23.1% aliphatics were produced. The increase of temperature led to transfer of C to the gas phase, coke formation on the catalyst surface and decrease in N-compounds in the bio-oil. The increase of the catalyst to biomass ratio from 0 to 3:1 resulted in the aromatics being five-fold those non-catalytically obtained and in a higher cracking power that reduced the bio-oil to 23% at expenses of olefins rich gas. However, a linear correlation between coke formation and aromatic yield was observed as the catalyst to microalgae ratio was increased. Therefore, the experimental results indicate that Li-LSX-zeolite could be used as catalyst for in-situ denitrogenation of microalgae bio-oil and for enhancing aliphatics and aromatics formation to be blend in gasoline and diesel and olefins in gas phase. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glucosamine is a monomer of chitin/chitosan, which is a renewable aquatic resource and the second most abundant biopolymer on the Earth. Moreover, methanesulfonic acid (MSA) is known as an eco-friendly green catalyst. In this study, the MSA-catalyzed conversion of glucosamine to levulinic (LA) and formic (FA) acids was optimized using the Box-Behnken statistical approach. The optimal conditions for LA yield were 50 g/L glucosamine, 0.5 M MSA, 200 °C and 30 min, which yielded 49.9% LA and 50.8% FA. The LA yield increased linearly with increasing combined severity factor (CSF) until 3.5 and then, was maintained as the CSF value was further increased. The FA yield behaved similarly to LA. Both trends fitted well to a sigmoid regression model with a high regression value. These results highlight the potential of glucosamine for biofuel and chemicals production via an MSA-catalyzed conversion system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the influence of the degree of unsaturation of the triglyceride on the composition of the products of the thermal cracking process, in particular the formation of aromatic compounds, was investigated. Experiments were performed using triglyceride sources with different degrees of unsaturation, maintaining the same operational conditions. Analysis of the products revealed that a greater amount of aromatic compounds is formed during the thermal cracking of biomass with a higher degree of unsaturation. The aromatics content in the liquid product decreased by 14% in the cracking of biomass with the lowest unsaturated content. A correlation between the aromatics content and the iodine index of the sample was proposed, as a simple way to estimate the aromatics content in bio-oil. It was also observed that the reactions for carboxyl removal were favorable in the case of saturated compounds, the acidity index reducing from 210.9 to 139.0 gKOH/g in the biomass with the lowest unsaturated content. However, long-chain paraffinic compounds were present in the products, which suggests that a catalyst or more severe conditions might be necessary for the biomass cracking. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Freshwater macroalgae has competitive advantages compared to microalgae and marine macroalgae, such as lower separation and drying cost requirements and an abundance of available freshwater media. Municipal wastewater containing large quantities of nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) is a valuable and underutilized resource. In this study, the cultivation of the naturally isolated filamentous freshwater macroalgae Spirogyra sp. was investigated in three different types of municipal wastewater including primary (PW), secondary (SW) and centrate (CW) wastewaters. Two different types of reactors including closed column photobioreactors and open rectangular aquarium reactors were operated under no and low air flow rates of less than (18 ± 2) cm−3·min−1, respectively. The SW, PW diluted with water to a 20 % volume fraction and CW diluted with water to a 2 % volume fraction appeared to promote ash-free biomass productivities of (2.17-6.68) g·m−2·d−1 and specific growth rates of (16.4–29.7) %·d−1. Nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies ranged from (50.6–90.6) % and (60.4–99.1) %, respectively. Based on ultimate analysis, the biomass produced a higher heating value of (12.4–17.1) MJ·kg−1, and also showed relatively consistent protein ((16.7–19.5) % of the dry mass fraction), carbohydrate ((41.5–55.0) %) and lipid ((2.8–10.0) %) contents. These results indicate the feasibility of using Spirogyra sp. to recover nutrients from multiple municipal wastewater sources with the simultaneous production of biomass that contains value-added biochemical components for bioenergy and biofuel applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Separation of volatile methyl siloxanes from landfill gas using fixed adsorption beds was modeled with the objective of identifying appropriate technology and the economics associated with this purification step. A general adsorption model assuming plug flow and radial symmetry was developed and used to conduct a parametric sweep of 162 unique cases. The varied parameters were adsorbent type (activated carbon and silica gel), bed height (3.05–9.15 m/10–30 ft), inlet siloxane concentration (5–15 mg/m3), moisture content (0–100% relative humidity at STP or RH), and siloxane tolerance limit (0.094–9.4 mg/m3) that correlated to three distinct energy conversion technologies (electricity production using engines or fuels cells or catalytic conversion to liquid hydrocarbon fuels). Due to the detrimental effect of RH on siloxane absorption, the maximum allowable moisture content of LFG before purification is 50% RH and moisture removal processes are also required. The design calculations using a selected case study show that the adsorption bed height required needed for 6 months minimum breakthrough time for catalytic fuel production is twice that for engine applications. Fuel cell applications require 3 times the bed height compared to engine applications. However, the purification costs amounted to 94%, 16% and 52% of recovered product value for engine, liquefaction, and fuel cell applications, respectively indicating the need for a high value product to justify purification costs. The approaches and conclusions can be extended to specific process conditions for landfill gas purification and to other processes that use biogas produced from waste as a feedstock. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Approximately 15 million dry tons of food waste is produced annually in the United States (USA), and 92% of this waste is disposed of in landfills where it decomposes to produce greenhouse gases and water pollution. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an attractive technology capable of converting a broad range of organic compounds, especially those with substantial water content, into energy products. The HTL process produces a bio-oil precursor that can be further upgraded to transportation fuels and an aqueous phase containing water-soluble organic impurities. Converting small oxygenated compounds that partition into the water phase into larger, hydrophobic compounds can reduce aqueous phase remediation costs and improve energy yields. HTL was investigated at 300◦C and a reaction time of 1 h for conversion of an institutional food waste to bio-oil, using either homogeneous Na2CO3 or heterogeneous CeZrOx to promote in situ conversion of water-soluble organic compounds into less oxygenated, oil-soluble products. Results with food waste indicate that CeZrOx improves both bio-oil higher heating value (HHV) and energy recovery when compared both to non-catalytic and Na2CO3-catalyzed HTL. The aqueous phase obtained using CeZrOx as an HTL catalyst contained approximately half the total organic carbon compared to that obtained using Na2CO3-suggesting reduced water treatment costs using the heterogeneous catalyst. Experiments with model compounds indicated that the primary mechanism of action was condensation of aldehydes, a reaction which simultaneously increases molecular weight and oxygen-to-carbon ratio-consistent with the improvements in bio-oil yield and HHV observed with institutional food waste. The catalyst was stable under hydrothermal conditions (≥16 h at 300◦C) and could be reused at least three times for conversion of model aldehydes to water insoluble products. Energy and economic analysis suggested favorable performance for the heterogeneous catalyst compared either to non-catalytic HTL or Na2CO3-catalyzed HTL, especially once catalyst lifetime differences were considered. The results of this study establish the potential of heterogeneous catalysts to improve HTL economics and energetics. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - To fulfill the need of renewable, sustainable, and cleaner form of fuel, scientists are attracted toward biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil or green (renewable) diesel. Biodiesel is generally obtained from vegetable oil by the process of transesterification while green diesel is obtained by hydrogenation. However, chemically both are completely different and thus their physical properties are highly affected. In present work, authors have compared the important properties of Pongamia biodiesel, algal biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil. It is observed that both the biofuels may be blended for use in diesel engines as this will complement their fuel characteristics. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the efficiency of a mechano-enzymatic deconstruction of two macroalgae species for sugars and bioethanol production, by using a new enzymatic cocktail (Haliatase) and two types of milling modes (vibro-ball: VBM and centrifugal milling: CM). By increasing the enzymatic concentration from 3.4 to 30 g/L, the total sugars released after 72 h of hydrolysis increased (from 6.7 to 13.1 g/100 g TS and from 7.95 to 10.8 g/100 g TS for the green algae U. lactuca and the red algae G. sesquipedale, respectively). Conversely, total sugars released from G. sesquipedale increased (up to 126% and 129% after VBM and CM, respectively). The best bioethanol yield (6 geth/100 g TS) was reached after 72 h of fermentation of U. lactuca and no increase was obtained after centrifugal milling. The latter led to an enhancement of the ethanol yield of G. sesquipedale (from 2 to 4 g/100 g TS). © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the increasing amount of polyurethane waste, chemical recycling of these materials is a topic of growing interest for many researchers. The primary purpose of polyurethane feedstock recycling is to recover the starting polyol. In this study glycerolysis using glycerine from two sources and two purity grades is proposed as a method of chemical recycling. The main effort of this paper focuses on the employment of commercial glycerine of analytical grade and waste glycerine without purification derived from the biodiesel production, as a decomposing agent for polyurethane recycling. In this study, the influence of polyurethane to glycerine mass ratio (PU/GL) and the type of decomposing agent on the chemical structure by FTIR, 1H NMR and GPC was examined. FTIR analysis of the glycerolysates showed absorption peaks similar to the virgin polyol. Those results are in compliance with GPC chromatograms, which showed for all samples, well-defined peak at ca. 13 min of retention time. The molecular weight of glycerolysates was ranging from 800 to 1300 g mol−1 depending on PU/GL mass ratio. The novel decomposition agent, namely waste glycerine derived from biodiesel production was successfully used in glycerolysis process. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - To obtain drop-in fuel properties from 3rd generation biomass, we herein report the catalytic hydrotreatment of microalgae biocrude, produced from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Spirulina. Our contribution focuses on the effect of temperature, initial H2 pressure, and residence time on the removal of heteroatoms (O and N) in a batch hydrotreating setup. In contrast to common experimental protocols for hydrotreating at batch scale, we devised a set of two-level factorial experiments and studied the most influential parameters affecting the removal of heteroatoms. It was found that up to 350◦C, the degree of deoxygenation (de-O) is mainly driven by temperature, whereas the degree of denitrogenation (de-N) also relies on initial H2 pressure and temperature-pressure interaction. Based on this, complete deoxygenation was obtained at mild operating conditions (350◦C), reaching a concurrent 47% denitrogenation. Moreover, three optimized experiments are reported with 100% removal of oxygen. In addition, the analysis by GC-MS and Sim-Dis gives insight to the fuel quality. The distribution of heteroatom N in lower (&lt;340◦C) and higher (&gt;340◦C) fractional cuts is studied by a fractional distillation unit following ASTM D-1160. Final results show that 63–68% of nitrogen is concentrated in higher fractional cuts. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae produces high amount of water-insoluble organic compounds, the biocrude oil. Using high-growth-rate Spirulina platensis as feedstock, product fraction distribution and biocrude oil chemistry from HTL at a temperature of 240–300 °C under acidic, neutral and alkaline condition were studied. Positive effects on biocrude oil yield were only found with KOH and acetic acid, and these effects were stronger under milder HTL conditions. FT-ICR MS showed that O 2 class in the biocrude was high due to higher carbohydrate in the biomass, numbers of N 3 O 5-6 species present in the sample from acetic acid run, indicating its less decarboxylation ability. GC–MS showed more ketones and amides were formed from fatty acids in catalytic HTL, and this effect was sensitive toward reaction temperature. GPC suggested more light volatiles were in biocrude from KOH run, while analysis from NMR, FT-IR and elemental confirmed its high oil quality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Glycerol excess in the market and high cost of common feedstock have encouraged the investigations of new technologies for biodiesel production. In this context, the use of macaw oil (Acrocomia aculeata) for biodiesel production through interesterification and esterification reactions with methyl acetate as acyl acceptor was evaluated, using heterogeneous catalyst γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3). Experiments were performed at different reaction temperatures (225–300 °C), catalyst contents (0–10% relation to oil mass), oil to methyl acetate molar ratios (1:10–1:40) and reaction times in a batch reactor to determine the effect of these variables in FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) and triacetin production. Catalyst γ-Al2O3 improved FAME and triacetin contents in comparison with no catalyzed reaction. Reaction at 300 °C, with 2% of catalyst in relation to oil mass and molar ratio of 1:20, in 60 min provided the best results. The catalyst could be recovered and reused for at least 6 cycles without significant activity loss. The results allowed to point out that the process showed to be promising for industrial biodiesel production with no glycerol and was financial attractive, since it used a low cost feedstock. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process is a method for the conversion of alcohols to an alternative jet fuel blendstock based on catalytic steps historically utilized by the petroleum refining and petrochemical industry. This pathway provides a means for producing a sustainable alternative jet fuel (SAJF) from a wide variety of resources and offers a near-term opportunity for alcohol producers to enter the SAJF market and for the aviation sector to meet growing SAJF demand. Herein, the technical background is reviewed and selected variations of ATJ processes evaluated. Simulation and modeling were employed to assess some ATJ conversion schemes, with a particular focus on comparisons between the use of an ethanol or isobutanol intermediate. Although the utilization of isobutanol offers a 34 % lower conversion cost for the catalytic upgrading process, the cost of alcohol production is estimated to contribute more than 80 % of the total cost at the refinery. The cost of feedstock and alcohol production has a dominant effect on the overall process economics. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In this study, 13 rice husk (RH) varieties from 4 agro-ecological zones in Uganda were characterized, NaOH-pretreated, and evaluated for their potential utilization as precursors for production of bio-oil, ash, char, and activated carbon for selected applications. RH varieties were characterized through particle size analysis, bulk density, proximate and ultimate analyses, specific surface area, pore volume, as well as lignocellulosic and inorganic compositions. Selected RH varieties were subsequently pretreated at NaOH concentrations of 1–4%w/v, using pretreatment ratios of 5 g RH: 40 mL NaOH. Properties varied among RH varieties, suiting them as feedstocks for different applications. Upland rice husk varieties are more suited precursors for production of bio-oil, and activated carbon due to their relatively lower ash content, higher specific surface area, as well as higher volatile matter and fixed carbon contents. Upland rice husks could as well be employed in the preparation of electrodes for electrochemical devices, due to their relatively higher specific surface area. A high ash content (21–32% dry basis) of lowland rice husks presents good prospects for their calcination, since larger amounts of rice husk ash could be obtained, and employed in different applications. Lowland rice husk varieties could also be more suited precursors for production of char for soil amendment, due to their relatively higher ash content, which subsequently increases their char yields. However, alkaline pretreatment of rice husks using 2–4%w/v NaOH can reduce the ash content by as much as 74–93%, depending on the rice husk variety, which paves way for utilizing rice husks with a high ash content in different applications. Aside from ash reduction, the enhanced specific surface area (1.2–1.7 m2 g−1), volatile matter (68–79%db) and fixed carbon (19–24%db) contents of NaOH-pretreated rice husks suggests they are more suited feedstocks than when employed in their raw form, for production of bio-oil, as well as activated carbon. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conversion of waste lignocellulosic (LC) biomass, a widely-available low-cost feedstock, into value-added biobased chemicals (and biofuels) has been gaining much attention recently. Therefore, the present lignin valorisation study was aimed at developing magnetically-separable highly-active catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), also proposing surface chemical kinetics. Five carbonaceous substrate-deposited Ru were synthesised and tested for the HDO of monomer moiety eugenol. Their annealing temperatures differed, specifically between 300 and 750◦C, while one was not subjected to calcination. Experiments revealed the substantial influence of annealing temperature on the product distribution. Namely, fresh nonannealed nanocomposites were not active for hydrogenolysis. By further pretreatment increase, hydrogenation and, exclusively, the deoxygenation of saturated cyclic species, were enhanced, these being more promoted considering rates and yields than commercial carbon-supported ruthenium. Over 80 mol% of 4-propyl-cylohexanol and propyl-cyclohexane could be formed over the samples, treated at 500 and 600◦C, for 100 and 125 min, respectively, under 275◦C and 5 MPa of reactor hydrogen pressure. Interestingly, a notable 4-propyl-phenol amount was produced upon 750◦C pretreating. The intrinsic microkinetic model, developed previously, was applied to determine relevant turnover parameters. Calculated modelling results indicated a 47-and 10-fold greater demethoxylation and dehydroxylation mechanism ability upon the reheatingpreheating at 600◦C in comparison to industrial (heterogeneous) Ru/C. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Present study reports the application of non-thermal plasma approach for the partial oxidation of methane to methanol. The target was achieved by employing oxygen under ambient condition in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, which was later operated as a packed bed DBD. A variety of packing materials of different nature (Al2O3, TiO2, CeO2 and glass beads) are tested and corresponding reaction pathways also have been shown. In addition, the influence of the feed gas composition, total flow rate and specific input energy has been investigated. Formation of CH3OH, H2, CO, CO2, C2H6, and HCHO has been identified. Typical results indicated that the plasma reactor operating under a packed bed configuration showed better performance than the reactor without packing. Among the packing materials used, glass beads packing provided the best selectivity of ~35% to methanol, whereas, it was around 25% with DBD reactor without packing. In a similar manner, the yield of methanol increased to 5.4% with glass beads packing against 1.7% with DBD reactor with no packing. The good performance with glass beads packing is due to the uniform distribution of the microdischarges and improved filed strength. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hyper-accumulator biomass, Pteris vittata L., was hydrothermally converted into bio-oils via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in sub-supercritical water. The distributions and characterizations of various products as well as energy recovery under different temperatures (250–390 °C) were investigated. The highest bio-oil yield of 16.88% was obtained at 350 °C with the hydrothermal conversion of 61.79%, where the bio-oil was dominated by alcohols, esters, phenols, ketones and acidic compounds. The higher heating values of bio-oil were in the range of 19.93–35.45 MJ/kg with a H/C ratio of 1.26–1.46, illustrating its high energy density and potential for use as an ideal liquid fuel. The main gaseous products were CO2, H2, CO, and CH4 with the H2 yield peaking at 22.94%. The total energy recovery from bio-oils and solid residues fell within the range of 37.72–45.10%, highlighting the potential of HTL to convert hyper-accumulator biomass into valuable fuels with high conversion efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Silica-alumina catalyst was prepared and used in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of durian rind in a drop-type two-stage reactor. The effects of catalytic temperature (400 °C–600 °C) and catalyst-to-durian rind ratio (1:30–3:30) were evaluated. Bio-oil yield was increased with increased catalytic temperature due to considerable dehydration process, but it was reduced with high catalyst loading due to the overcracking of organics into light gases. Silica-alumina catalyst possessed good selectivity and the products changed according to the temperature. The major components in bio-oil were hydrocarbons, furan derivatives, and aromatic compounds at 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C, respectively. The hydrogen and carbon contents of bio-oil were reduced with high catalyst loading due to the overcracking of organics, and the deoxygenation process became unfavorable. The silica-alumina catalyst worked well in catalytic fast pyrolysis of durian rind, and the condition may be adjusted based on the desired products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass in various industrial processes, such as the production of biofuels, requires the degradation of hemicellulose. Clostridium stercorarium is a thermophilic bacterium, well known for its outstanding hemicellulose-degrading capability. Its genome comprises about 50 genes for partially still uncharacterised thermostable hemicellulolytic enzymes. These are promising candidates for industrial applications. Results: To reveal the hemicellulose-degrading potential of 50 glycoside hydrolases, they were recombinantly produced and characterised. 46 of them were identified in the secretome of C. stercorarium cultivated on cellobiose. Xylanases Xyn11A, Xyn10B, Xyn10C, and cellulase Cel9Z were among the most abundant proteins. The secretome of C. stercorarium was active on xylan, β-glucan, xyloglucan, galactan, and glucomannan. In addition, the recombinant enzymes hydrolysed arabinan, mannan, and galactomannan. 20 enzymes are newly described, degrading xylan, galactan, arabinan, mannan, and aryl-glycosides of β-d-xylose, β-d-glucose, β-d-galactose, α-l-arabinofuranose, α-l-rhamnose, β-d-glucuronic acid, and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine. The activities of three enzymes with non-classified glycoside hydrolase (GH) family modules were determined. Xylanase Xyn105F and β-d-xylosidase Bxl31D showed activities not described so far for their GH families. 11 of the 13 polysaccharide-degrading enzymes were most active at pH 5.0 to pH 6.5 and at temperatures of 57-76 °C. Investigation of the substrate and product specificity of arabinoxylan-degrading enzymes revealed that only the GH10 xylanases were able to degrade arabinoxylooligosaccharides. While Xyn10C was inhibited by α-(1,2)-arabinosylations, Xyn10D showed a degradation pattern different to Xyn10B and Xyn10C. Xyn11A released longer degradation products than Xyn10B. Both tested arabinose-releasing enzymes, Arf51B and Axh43A, were able to hydrolyse single- as well as double-arabinosylated xylooligosaccharides. Conclusions: The obtained results lead to a better understanding of the hemicellulose-degrading capacity of C. stercorarium and its involved enzyme systems. Despite similar average activities measured by depolymerisation tests, a closer look revealed distinctive differences in the activities and specificities within an enzyme class. This may lead to synergistic effects and influence the enzyme choice for biotechnological applications. The newly characterised glycoside hydrolases can now serve as components of an enzyme platform for industrial applications in order to reconstitute synthetic enzyme systems for complete and optimised degradation of defined polysaccharides and hemicellulose. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation of biorefinery lignin-rich wastes to jet fuel hydrocarbons offers a significant opportunity for enhancing the overall operational efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency, economic viability, and sustainability of biofuels production. However, these wastes usually mainly contain lignin with sugars, furans, and their derivatives as “impurities”. Although several factors, including reactant structure, solvents, or the decreased ratio of catalyst to reactant, could be responsible for the jet fuel hydrocarbons yield loss, we found evidence that glucose, xylose, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural dramatically decreased conversion yields. For example, xylose and glucose lowered the final hydrocarbon yield by 78 and 63 %, respectively. The results revealed that these compounds could suppress metal catalysts and inhibit lignin depolymerization and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions thus decrease yields of jet fuel range hydrocarbons from biomass-derived lignin. The first-principles calculations and TGA results from spent catalysts validated these findings. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - A systematic study of the effect of nitrogen levels in the cultivation medium of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae grown in photobioreactor (PBR) on biomass productivity, biochemical and elemental composition, fatty acid profile, heating value (HHV), and composition of the algae-derived fast pyrolysis (bio-oil) is presented in this work. A relatively high biomass productivity and cell concentration (1.5 g of dry biomass per liter of cultivation medium and 120 × 106 cells/ml, respectively) were achieved after 30 h of cultivation under N-rich medium. On the other hand, the highest lipid content (ca. 36 wt.% on dry biomass) was obtained under N-depletion cultivation conditions. The medium and low N levels favored also the increased concentration of the saturated and mono-unsaturated C16:0 and C18:1(n-9) fatty acids (FA) in the lipid/oil fraction, thus providing a raw lipid feedstock that can be more efficiently converted to high-quality biodiesel or green diesel (via hydrotreatment). In terms of overall lipid productivity, taking in consideration both the biomass concentration in the medium and the content of lipids on dry biomass, the most effective system was the N-rich one. The thermal (non-catalytic) pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae produced a highly complex bio-oil composition, including fatty acids, phenolics, ethers, ketones, etc., as well as aromatics, alkanes, and nitrogen compounds (pyrroles and amides), originating from the lipid, protein, and carbohydrate fractions of the microalgae. However, the catalytic fast pyrolysis using a highly acidic ZSM-5 zeolite, afforded a bio-oil enriched in mono-aromatics (BTX), reducing at the same time significantly oxygenated compounds such as phenolics, acids, ethers, and ketones. These effects were even more pronounced in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris residual biomass (after extraction of lipids), thus showing for the first time the potential of transforming this low value by-product towards high added value platform chemicals. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents the results regarding the parametric optimization and characterizations on codensification of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver stem using biochar and bio-oil as additives. The results reveal that the relative importance of different parameters contributing to the pellet physical stability follows the order of: particle size > bio-oil content > biochar content > pressure > bio-oil type, and smaller particles size (0.1-0.3 mm) is critical for the formation of durable pellets. The biochar functioned as the fuel promoter and improved the higher heating value and energy density, however, caused poor physical stability by secondary size reduction during densification. The apple tree branch pyrolysis oil acted as an effective binder, improved the surface morphology and enabled strong interlocking of the particles, therefore, enhanced the physical stability. Above all, codensification of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver stem with biochar and bio oil generated pellets with excellent physical stability and moisture resistance. The pellets also showed better fuel characteristics than the Eucommia ulmoides Oliver stem pellets, and the cost is significantly lower than the char pellets. With comprehensiveness, these results can guide the future industrial implementation of codensification technology for the production of clean, sustainable, and efficient fuel with low cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study attempted to determine an efficient flocculant that was used for the recovery of microalgal species, namely Scenedesmus. The biomass was grown in a pilot-scale raceway pond receiving domestic wastewater discharges. The microalgae achieved treatment efficiencies of 76.5% NH4 +-N, 83.1% PO4 3−-P, 73.9% biological oxygen demand (BOD), and 42.8% chemical oxygen demand (COD). During microalgal harvesting, the highest biomass recoveries of 99.0%, 97.5%, and 96.5% were obtained by alum 300 mg/L at pH 7, chitosan 100 mg/L at pH 7, and cationic polymer 10 mg/L at pH 10, respectively. The protein, carbohydrate, and lipid yields of polymer-harvested biomass were 28.0%, 12.4%, and 17.4% (dry cell weight), respectively, which were higher than those obtained when applying either alum or chitosan flocculants. Moreover, the cationic polymer provided no detrimental effects on the fractions of fatty acids derived from the harvested microalgal cells. The microalgal biomass subjected to flocculation by either polymer or chitosan were entire and intact, whereas the lysis of cells was noticed during the alum flocculation process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The pure cultures of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris ATCC 13482 and Scenedesmus obliquus FACHB 417 were grown in municipal wastewater in 7-L airlift bubble column photobioreactor supplied with 5% CO2/air (v/v). Batch experiments were conducted at 25 °C with 14-h light/10-h dark cycle for a period of 10 days. The CO2 capture efficiencies for both the microalgae were monitored in terms of their respective biomass productivities, carbon contents, and CO2 consumption rates. In the present study, the initial concentration of ammonia (43.7 mg L−1) was decreased to 2.9 and 3.7 mg L−1 by C. vulgaris and S. obliquus, respectively. And, the initial concentration of phosphate (18.5 mg L−1) was decreased to 1.1 and 1.6 mg L−1 by C. vulgaris and S. obliquus, respectively. CO2 biofixation rates by C. vulgaris and S. obliquus, cultivated in municipal wastewater, were calculated to be 140.91 and 129.82 mg L−1 day−1, respectively. The findings from the present study highlight the use of microalgae for wastewater treatment along with CO2 uptake and biomass utilization for pilot scale production of biodiesel, biogas, feed supplements for animals, etc., thus minimizing the production costs. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - In this study, a variety of novel biochar based Bronsted acid catalysts were prepared from low cost potential feedstocks viz., cassava peel, irul sawdust, coconut shell and their catalytic activity for biodiesel production were compared. The optimization studies of biochar generation were carried out based on the influence of pyrolysis temperature and heating duration, for the preparation of acid catalyst with superior activity. The elemental analysis, surface functional groups, thermal stability, crystallographic structure, surface morphology and pore size distribution of all biochars and its sulfonated catalysts were characterized thoroughly. The performance of the sulfonated biochar catalysts for the synthesis of biodiesel from Derris indica L. seed oil was evaluated and compared. The cassava peel biochar based catalyst with a total acid density of 2.9 mmol/g and sulfonic acid group density of 1.7 mmol/g showed the best result among the sulfonated biochar catalysts for the enhanced biodiesel production. © 2018

AB  - Branched decalins are promising jet fuel components with high density, high thermal stability and low freezing point, but its accessibility is limited by fossil resources. Here we report a novel H2SO4 catalytic one-pot synthesis process using cyclic alcohols (cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol) and branched cycloalkanes (methylcyclohexane, methylcyclopentane) that can be derived from lignocellulose and/or refineries as feedstock. The reaction occurs in a consecutive way of dehydration, alkylation, rearrangement and hydrogen transfer to produce branched decalins. The dehydration/oligomerization of alcohols also produces branched cycloalkanes but the carbon yield and selectivity are very low, and the presence of branched cycloalkanes significantly improves the reaction. The reaction goes smoothly at room temperature and continuous feeding of alcohols can further increase the yield. Under optimized reaction conditions, the carbon yield and branched decalins selectivity vary in range of 61–87%, dependent on the reactants used. The branched decalins show good fuel properties like density as high as 0.88 g/mL and freezing point as low as −110 °C, and can be produced in large scale. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Strategies for the efficient transformation of abundant and sustainable bioderived molecules, such as furfuryl alcohol (FAlc), into higher value products are currently a vibrant research area. Herein, we demonstrate that furfuryl ethers, which are of significant interest as biorenewable fuel additives, are efficiently produced employing an etherification reaction of furfuryl alcohol and short chain alkyl alcohols in the presence of a recyclable ZSM-5 catalyst and an orthoester, such as trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF) or triethyl orthoformate (TEOF), used as a sacrificial reagent. These etherification reactions proceed at temperatures significantly lower than those of the previous etherification procedures, and they provide the furfuryl ether products in high yield. Importantly, the low temperature employed improves the selectivity by minimizing the formation of hydrolysis products and the competing polymerization reactions leading to humin byproducts. By carrying out the reaction in higher alcohol solvents, such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, we are able to capitalize on the ability of ZSM-5 to catalyze the orthoester exchange reaction of TMOF or TEOF to produce the corresponding furfuyl ethers in a novel, telescoped orthoester exchange-etherification reaction sequence. Finally, we also demonstrate that the etherification reaction proceeds efficiently in the presence of acetals and ketals, such as dimethoxypropane and diethoxypropane. This latter development is highly significant given the greater scope for the regeneration of acetal and ketal reagents. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study presents a sequential sodium phosphate dodecahydrate (Na3PO4·12H2O) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) pretreatment to enhance sugar release from corn cobs. The effects of Na3PO4·12H2O concentration, H2SO4 concentration and solid to liquid ratio on the reducing sugar yield were investigated. The developed model had a coefficient of determination value (R2) of 0.98. Maximum reducing sugar yield of 0.99 ± 0.01 g/g was obtained with 12.70% Na3PO4·12H2O, 1.04% H2SO4 and 14.49% solid to liquid ratio. A 9-fold increase in the sugar yield was observed compared to previous reports on corn cobs. An intelligent model was developed to determine functional relationships between the input and output parameters. Reducing sugar yield was majorly dependent on Na3PO4·12H2O concentration and fits a Weibull type of relationship. Sequential pretreatment of lignocellulosic material with alkalic salt and dilute acid significantly enhanced sugar recovery and demonstrated high efficiency for microbial production of biofuels and bioproducts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The major obstacles for the production of drop-in fuel from traditional fast pyrolysis are low bio-oil yield, poor fuel heating value and high solid yield. To overcome these obstacles, we studied the introduction of high pressure hydrogen into the pyrolysis reactor, in a process known as catalytic fast hydropyrolysis (CFHP). CFHP of anisole, a bio-oil model compound, was performed at different temperatures and pressures, to determine the effects of those variables on the CFHP reaction network. Alkanes were observed at low temperature and high pressure, whereas aromatics were dominant at low pressure and high temperature. Aspen modelling and calculation of reaction equilibrium constants showed that there is a thermodynamic barrier for simultaneous pyrolysis and hydrogenation at 600 °C. Reduced heating rates and CFHP followed by second-stage hydroprocessing (SH) were proposed as a means to control reaction temperature and efficiently deoxygenate CFHP vapors. The two-stage CFHP followed by hydroprocessing produced nearly 18 mol% carbon yield to alkanes, and a total bio-oil carbon yield of 25 mol%. The approximate bio-oil higher heating value (HHV) and aromaticity were 43.4 MJ/kg and 28 wt%, respectively, both within the range of gasoline. © 2017

AB  - Pyrolysis of pine needles was carried out in a semi-batch reactor. The effects of pyrolysis parameters such as temperature (350–650 °C), heating rate (10 and 50 °C min−1), nitrogen flow rate (50–200 cm3 min−1) and biomass particle size (0.25–1.7 mm) were examined on products yield. Maximum bio-oil yield of 43.76% was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C with a heating rate of 50 °C min−1, nitrogen flow rate of 100 cm3 min−1 for biomass particle size of 0.6 &lt; dp &lt; 1 mm. The characterization of pyrolysis products (bio-oil, bio-char) has been made through different instrumental methods like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), X-ray powder diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analysis. The empirical formula of the bio-oil and bio-char was found as CH1.47O0.36N0.005 and CH0.56O0.28N0.013 with heating value of 26.25 and 25.50 MJ kg−1, respectively. Results show that bio-oil can be potentially valuable as a renewable fuel after upgrading and can be used as a feedstock for valuable chemicals production. The properties of bio-char reveal that it can be used as solid fuels, as a cheap adsorbent and as a feedstock for activated carbon production. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Hollow mesoporous CuCo2O4 (meso-CuCo2O4) microspheres were successfully synthesized by decomposing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the template. The as-prepared CuCo2O4 microspheres were first simultaneously used for H2O2 biosensing and glucose biofuel cell (GFC) as the enzyme mimic. The resulting of meso-CuCo2O4 displayed not only excellent catalytic performances to H2O2 including a super-fast response time (within 2 s), a super-high sensitivity (654.23 μA mM−1 cm−2) and a super-low detection limit (3 nM at S/N = 3) on the sensor, but also great values in GFC as anode material with an open circuit voltage of 0.85 V, a maximum power density of 0.33 mWcm−2 and a limiting current density of 1.27 mAcm−2, respectively. The preeminent catalytic abilities to H2O2 and glucose may be attributed to the surpassing intrinsic catalytic activity of CuCo2O4 and large specific area of mesoporous structure. These significant findings deriving from this work not only provided a novel exploration for the fabrication of hollow spherical mesoporous bimetallic oxides, but also promoted the development of the supersensitive detection of H2O2 and non-enzymatic biofuel cell. © 2017

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel is drawing attention as a renewable and clean alternative to fossil diesel fuel because of numerous advantages such as higher flash point, cetane number and density. However, the high viscosity of biodiesel is one of the critical shortcomings and it causes poor atomization, decrease in engine performance and increase in exhaust emissions. To overcome this shortcoming, in this study, the effects of main transesterification reaction variables on the viscosities of produced safflower oil methyl and ethyl esters (biodiesel) were investigated as a full factorial experimental design, and optimum parametric values giving the lowest viscosity were determined. Density and viscosity were measured according to ISO 4787 and DIN 53015 standards. Sodium ethoxide (C 2 H 5 ONa) was utilized as a catalyst, and 90 and 120 minutes of reaction duration were kept constant for methanolysis and ethanolysis reactions. According to the results, the optimal reaction parameters were determined as: 0.75 % catalyst concentration, 8:1 alcohol to oil molar ratio and 56 °C reaction temperature for methanolysis; 1.00 % catalyst concentration, 12:1 alcohol to oil molar ratio and 70 °C reaction temperature for ethanolysis. Based on the reaction parameters, the methyl and ethyl esters were produced with the lowest viscosities of 3.989 mm 2 /s and 4.393 mm 2 /s, respectively. In the light of results obtained in this study, similar studies on production of biodiesels from different oils and alcohols can be performed. © 2018 Mert Gulum, Atilla Bilgin, published by Sciendo.

AB  - A nanostructured iron (Fe) catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) was prepared and evaluated using a silica nanospring (NS) support. FTS offers an approach of producing biofuels from synthesis gas (syngas) produced via biomass gasification. The Fe/NS catalysts were prepared using three different methods: (i) incipient wetness impregnation, (ii) precipitation and (iii) modified sol-gel, in order to obtain different sizes of deposited Fe nanoparticles on the NS support and investigate the influence of particle size on FTS. The Fe decorated catalysts were calcined and then activated with either H2, CO or H2 + CO mixture. The prepared Fe/NS catalysts were characterized before the FT reaction by BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in order to find correlations between physico-chemical properties of catalysts and catalytic performance. The decoration of Fe nanoparticles of different sizes onto NS using the various methods ranged from 1.7 to 10 nm. The FTS performance was also evaluated in a quartz fixed-bed microreactor (H2/CO of 2:1, 270 °C) and the products trapped and analyzed by GC-TCD and GC–MS to determine CO conversion and reaction selectivity. These results show that the highest CO conversion (76.6%) and a wide distribution of light hydrocarbon (C6 to C14) were obtained for Fe/NS catalyst prepared by impregnation and activated with CO after 12 h of the FT reaction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microwave pretreatment is an energy-efficient and environmentally benign technology that can be used to reduce the recalcitrance of complex biomass structure. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) are perennial C4 grasses that are being developed as bioenergy crops because they have high yield potential and desirable agronomic traits. These materials are promising candidates for biofuels, bioproducts and green chemicals production from biomass. In the present study, miscanthus and switchgrass biomass were solubilized in subcritical water after pretreatment by microwave at different processing temperatures. The hydrolysates obtained were evaluated for hydrogen-rich gas production by aqueous-phase reforming (APR). Higher temperature microwave processing reduced the biomass recalcitrance resulting in microwave treated materials having 7–10% higher solubility in subcritical water than untreated materials. However, gasification of pretreated biomass hydrolysates produced less gaseous products compared to untreated biomass for both switchgrass and miscanthus. Miscanthus biomass was more vulnerable to destruction by microwave treatment and recalcitrance of this biomass was achieved at lower temperature compared to switchgrass. Miscanthus biomass that was not microwave treated produced the highest gas yield. Microwave pretreatment caused significant increases in the formation of ungasified solid carbon residue in the APR process. © 2017

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL) will be biomass-derived compound, which could be transformed into a variety of valuable compounds. In this work, a series of alumina-coated silica SBA-15 catalysts were prepared via wet-impregnation method and were applied in the conversion of fructose into EL. These catalysts were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy; low and wide-angle XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption, ICP-OES, TEM, SEM, EDX and elemental mapping techniques. Among the catalysts, Al-5-SB catalyst with Al content of 2.2% showed the best results for EL production with the selectivity and yield 86% and 58%, respectively. The various parameters such as the temperature of the reaction, time of the reaction, catalyst amount and the initial amount of fructose were investigated. Moreover, an experimental design was used to find optimized reaction conditions so that 190 °C for the reaction temperature, 4 h for the reaction time, and 50 mg of the catalyst for EL production was selected. As well as, the reusability of the catalyst was studied and it was reused for four runs without significant change in its catalytic activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The upsurge in the concerning issues like global warming, environmental pollution and depletion of fossil fuel resources led to the thrust on third generation biofuels. Algal research has gained a lot of importance in the recent years. Effective utilization of algal biomass in a single step is necessary as it can produce Bio-oil (BO), gases and in addition to a variety of valuable products, along with nutrient recovery. Hydrothermal liquefaction technology does not require the energy intensive drying steps and is an attractive approach for the conversion of algae to liquid fuels. This study investigates direct hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae (Algal biomass) to produce bio-oil using a high-pressure batch reactor under subcritical water conditions. Three different micro algae samples namely, Chlorella vulgaris, Botryococcus braunii and Scenedesmus quadricauda have been examined under hydrothermal liquefaction with different water concentrations (1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9 & 1:10 ratio) at certain temperature range (200–320 °C), pressure (60 bars) and reaction time (30 min). Through liquefaction, the highest BO yield achieved with S. quadricauda was 18 wt% at 1:9 ratio. The chemical components of the obtained bio-oil were analyzed via gas chromatography and the results indicated that the algal BO was composed of furan, phenol, acid, and ester derivatives. Moreover, it was found that by increasing the temperatures, the BO yields increased. This was due to the polymerization reactions that converted the small biomass components into heavier molecules. FTIR spectra showed high percentage of Aliphatic, Phenolic, alcoholic, Carboxylic and Hydroxyl groups for solid residues. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A comprehensive comparison of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to the pyrolysis of duckweed was conducted to determine the yields and components of the crude bio-oils and their distillates. The upgrading behaviors of the distillates were thoroughly investigated with the use of used engine oil as a solvent. With all other variables fixed, HTL produced crude bio-oil with a lower H/C ratio (1.28 ± 0.03) than pyrolysis did (1.45 ± 0.04). However, its distillates had a higher H/C ratio (1.60 ± 0.05) and total yield (66.1 ± 2.0 wt%) than pyrolysis (1.46 ± 0.04 and 47.2 ± 1.4 wt%, respectively). Phenolics and nitrogenous heterocycles constituted relatively major proportions of the two crude bio-oils and most of their distillates. Obvious differences in molecular composition between the two crude bio-oils and their distillates were ascribed to the distinct impacts of HTL and pyrolysis and were affected by the distillate temperature. Co-hydrotreating with used engine oil (UEO) provided the upgraded bio-oils much higher H/C ratios (~1.78 ± 0.05) and higher heating values (~45.5 ± 1.4 MJ·kg−1), as well as much lower contents of N, O and S compared to their initial distillates. Aromatics and alkanes constituted a large proportion in most of upgraded bio-oils. N removal from the pyrolysis distillates was easier than from the HTL distillates. Distinct differences in yields and molecular compositions for the upgraded bio-oils were also attributed to the different influences associated with the two conversion routes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) possess the qualities of being a suitable catalyst with its high surface area, tunable functional groups and numerous uncoordinated active sites. However, low hydrothermal stability and poor resistance to acidic medium hinder its usage as catalysts in dehydration reactions to produce biofuels or fine chemicals. Typically, the Lewis acidic chromium sites of MIL-101 (Cr) enable catalysis of the xylose dehydration reaction up to 49% of furfural yield at 170 °C. Unfortunately, the durability of pristine MOF is still questionable, which can only be recovered for 4 times. This work reports a way to improve hydrothermal stability of MIL-101 (Cr) by functionalizing it with hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) without any significant negative impacts on its catalytic activity. The coated MOF, MIL-OTS-0.5, provides a yield of 56% with high durability of catalytic activity up to 8 reaction cycles. The confinement of the active sites within silane groups facilitates the MIL-OTS to retain their structure and properties over pristine MIL-101 (Cr). Moreover, addition of 35 ppt NaCl in the aqueous phase in presence of MIL-OTS-0.5 enhances the furfural yield up to 62.6%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with isobutene (IB) to a biodiesel additive, that is, 5-(tert-butoxymethyl)-furfural (tBMF), is studied on the Aquivion® perfluorosulfonic acid resin (PFSA) modified mesoporous silica (Aquivion®/m-SiO2) solid acid. Mesoporous silica, composed of amorphous silica-particle aggregates, is synthesized by the sol–gel method using the amphiphilic Aquivion® PFSA as both the acidic and the template reagent. The silica surface is then modified by the Aquivion® resin, leading to the hybrid Aquivion®/m-SiO2 solid acid bearing highly accessible sulfonic acid sites and adequate porous structure. The catalytic properties, including composition, thermal stability, acidity, porosity, and morphology, are characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, XPS, TGA/DTG, elemental analysis, potentiometric titration, N2 physisorption, SEM, and TEM. The influence of different reaction parameters, such as catalyst dosage, reaction time and temperature, reactants composition, and solvent, is investigated. The optimal Aquivion®/m-SiO2 catalyst (10 wt.-%), with an accessible acidity of 45 µmolH+ gcatal. –1 demonstrates 78 % conversion of HMF and 66 % yield of tBMF, in the presence of THF, after 3 h at 90 °C, whereas the yield of byproduct 5,5′-[oxy-bis(methylene)]bis-2-furfural (OBMF), generated by the oligomerization of HMF, is lowered to 4 %. The developed catalyst demonstrates good stability after regeneration for five consecutive cycles. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This study reports the synthesis of a nanocomposite comprised of graphene (G) supported manganese dioxide (MnO2) incorporated into the network of polythioaniline (MnO2-G/PTA). The hybrid composite was applied as an electrode material for the development of a bioanode. The bioanode was fabricated by the electrochemical entrapment of ferritin (Frt) as mediator and glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme in the matrix of the as-synthesized MnO2-G/PTA deposited on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface. The structural features and electrochemical behaviour of the modified electrodes were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results unfolded that the hybrid electroactive support (MnO2-G/PTA) employed for the immobilization of the enzyme (GOx) established an appropriate electrical cabling between the redox enzyme (GOx) and the electrode surface with the assistance provided by the biocompatible mediator (Frt) working to enhance the electrical signals. The developed GCE/MnO2-G/PTA/Frt/GOx bioanode attained a maximum current density of 3.68 mAcm−2 at 35 mM glucose concentration at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1. Thus, the MnO2-G/PTA/Frt/GOx modified electrode possesses high potential and good biocompatibility for bio-electricity production from glucose. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In this study, homogeneous catalyst “Sulfosuccinic acid” was added into the polymer matrix, and the functional catalytic membrane was prepared. Chitosan was chosen as a polymeric material. Sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) loaded functional chitosan membranes have been used to synthesize fuel bioadditive ethyl levulinate in a pervaporation catalytic membrane reactor. The functional membrane was characterized by the TGA and SEM. The performance of SSA loaded functional chitosan membranes was investigated with binary mixtures of ethanol/water under varying operating conditions (feed concentration, temperature, SSA amount) to study the influence on separation performance. Pervaporation catalytic membrane reactor experiments were carried out to optimize operating conditions such as reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst amount, and molar feed ratio. The kinetic model in PVCMR with the functional membrane was applied to the experimental data. The theoretical conversion data were fitted well with the experimental data. The proposed model is found as suitable for the study being conducted. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The catalytic cracking upgrading reactions over HZSM-5 of different model compounds of bio-oil have been studied with a self-designed fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) equipment. Typical bio-oil model compounds, such as acetic acid, guaiacol, n-heptane, acetol and ethyl acetate, were chosen to study the products distribution, reaction pathway and deactivation of catalysts. The results showed: C6–C8 aromatic hydrocarbons, C2–C4 olefins, C1–C5 alkanes, CO and CO2 were the main products, and the selectivity of olefins was: ethylene &gt; propylene &gt; butylene. Catalyst characterization methods, such as FI-IR, TG-TPO and Raman, were used to study the deactivation mechanism of catalysts. According to the catalyst characterization results, a catalyst deactivation mechanism was proposed as follows: Firstly, the precursor which consisted of a large number of long chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and a small amount C[dbnd]C of aromatics formed on the catalyst surface. Then the active sites of catalysts had been covered, the coke type changed from thermal coke to catalytic coke and gradually blocked the channels of the molecular sieve, which accelerated the deactivation of catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Treated silica xerogel with protic ionic liquid (PIL) and bifunctional agents (glutaraldehyde and epichlorohydrin) is a novel support strategy used in the effective immobilization of lipase from Burkholderia cepacia (LBC) by covalent binding. As biocatalysts with the highest activity recovery yields, LBC immobilized by covalent binding with epichlorohydrin without (203%) and with PIL (250%), was assessed by the following the hydrolysis reaction of olive oil and characterized biochemically (Michaelis–Menten constant, optimum pH and temperature, and operational stability). Further, the potential transesterification activity for three substrates: sunflower, soybean, and colza oils, was also determined, achieving a conversion of ethyl esters between 70 and 98%. The supports and the immobilized lipase systems were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of this work is to understand the role of metals on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction pathways of three bio-oil model compounds. Ni, Ru and Pd were impregnated on USY zeolite, and the catalysts were characterized to determine metal reduction profile, surface concentration and nanoparticle size. Ru-USY and Pd-USY were completely reduced at a temperature below 450 °C, but Ni-USY still contained surface metal oxides after reduction. There was no indication of strong interactions between the metals and USY support. Anisole, 4-ethylphenol and benzofuran were used as bio-oil model compounds, in order to determine the effects of each metal on deoxygenation of methoxy-, phenol and furan functional groups, respectively. Pd-USY was the most effective HDO catalyst, exhibiting the highest turnover frequency for HDO of all three model compounds, in addition to and high selectivity to deoxygenated products. A mechanism was proposed for each model compound, and the kinetics of hydrogenation, dehydration, C–C coupling and ring-opening reactions were determined. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the in situ hydrogenolysis of alkali lignin into bio-oil over three kinds of heterogeneous catalysts with varied catalytic properties (Ru/C, Ni/ZSM-5, and CuNiAl hydrotalcite-based catalyst) in supercritical ethanol. Phenol was first introduced to the in situ hydrogenolysis system to form a complex solvent to improve the lignin depolymerization over heterogeneous catalysts. The promotion effect of phenol was obviously observed during the hydrogenolysis process, leading to improved bio-oil yield and decreased solid residue yield, due to the unique dissolution and diffusion properties of phenol-containing solvent. The synergistic effects of basic sites and complex solvents were observed; thus, herein, the effect of catalysts, reaction temperature, and time on the hydrogenolysis, repolymerization, and coking on catalysts was investigated in detail, considering the molecular weight, elemental composition, and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil. The highest bio-oil yield was up to 81.8%, with an improved HHV of 30.09 MJ/kg, when the hydrogenolysis reaction was carried out at 290 °C for 3 h over CuNiAl catalyst, in ethanol-phenol solvent (phenol/lignin ratio of 0.8). This study could provide a beneficial reference for the hydrogenolysis of lignin over heterogeneous catalyzed systems in complex solvent. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - MCM-22 zeolite samples, having different Si/Al ratios, have been studied for the fast-pyrolysis of acid-washed wheat straw at two catalytic pyrolysis temperatures aimed to the production of partially upgraded bio-oil. The best combination of bio-oil deoxygenation activity and energy yield is obtained when the catalytic bed was operated at 450 °C using the MCM-22 sample with the lowest Al content (Si/Al = 40). Interestingly, the increase in the reaction temperature results in a lower amount of coke deposited over the zeolite. On the other hand, reducing the zeolite Si/Al ratio had a negative effect as a higher concentration of acid sites promotes non-desired reactions: severe cracking of the bio-oil vapours, leading to the enhanced production of gaseous hydrocarbons, and coke formation. Coke produced over MCM-22 zeolite exhibits high oxygen content, whereas the bio-oil fraction presents a high concentration of oxygenated aromatics. These results denote the limited aromatization activity of MCM-22 zeolite for producing aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular when compared with ZSM-5, being of interest for the selective production of phenolic compounds by biomass catalytic pyrolysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fatty acid and its derivatives have recently received considerable interest as a possible precursor for producing renewable hydrocarbon. Compared to the traditional hydrotreating method that consumes a significant amount of H2, this study developed a hydrothermal catalytic deoxygenation approach that produced hydrocarbon from fatty acids and bio-oil with in situ self-sustaining H2. The presence of H2O played a critical role in the generation of in situ H2 via enhancing water-gas shift and reforming reactions, thus promoting fatty acid decarbonylation and increased paraffin yields. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (stearic acid (SA) and oleic acid (OA)) were employed as model compounds, where 100% conversion was achieved with 63.59% paraffin yield from SA and 47% n-paraffin yield from OA. By investigating the reaction pathway, fatty acid and glycerol reforming, and water-gas shift reactions, were determined to be the major reactions for the in situ H2 generation. Decarbonylation was found as the major route for fatty acid and bio-oil deoxygenation. Fatty acid reforming and hydrogenoloysis reactions were found as the major reactions for producing short-chain hydrocarbons (C8-C16). We previously developed a sequential hydrothermal liquefaction method to produce bio-oil from yeast biomass. In this study, the produced bio-oil was also tested, where 100 wt % bio-oil conversion and 55.17 wt % of liquid n-paraffin yield were achieved at 320 °C. This study demonstrates that this hydrothermal catalytic process is a promising approach for producing liquid paraffin (C8-C15) from fatty acid and bio-oil under the conditions of no H2 supply. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pre-treatment is a significant step in the production of second-generation biofuels from waste lignocellulosic materials. Obtaining biofuels as a result of fermentation processes requires appropriate pre-treatment conditions ensuring the highest possible degree of saccharification of the feed material. An influence of the following process parameters were investigated for alkaline pre-treatment of Salix viminalis L.: catalyst concentration (NaOH), temperature, pre-treatment time and granulation. For this purpose, experiments were carried out in accordance to the Box-Behnken design for four factors. In the saccharification process of the pre-treated biomass, cellulolytic enzymes immobilized on diatomaceous earth were used. Based on the obtained results, a mathematical model for the optimal conditions of alkaline pre-treatment prediction is proposed. The optimal conditions of alkaline pre-treatment are established as follows: granulation 0.75 mm, catalyst concentration 7%, pre-treatment time 6 h and temperature 65°C if the saccharification efficiency and cost analysis are considered. An influence of the optimized pre-treatment on both the chemical composition and structural changes for six various lignocellulosic materials (energetic willow, energetic poplar, beech, triticale, meadow grass, corncobs) was investigated. SEM images of raw and pre-treated biomass samples are included in order to follow the changes in the biomass structure during hydrolysis. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigated microwave extraction approach to extract lipids from the black soldier ﬂy larval containing high lipids for biodiesel production. The comparison of the effects of different factors (solvent types, extraction temperature, and solute-solvent ratio) on the kinetics and thermodynamic of lipids extraction from the energy insect was investigated in detail. A mathematical model of lipids extraction from the pretreatment insect powder was proposed. The solid-solvent ratio and temperature can have a pronounced effect on lipids extraction rate k. The final yield of lipids increased by a factor of about 1.0–1.04 for extraction temperature elevated by 10 °C. The diffusion of lipids in the solvent constituted the limitation step in the process of extraction. The magnitudes of the diffusion coefficients range from 6.7 × 10−12–16.1 × 10−12 m2/s for three solvents used. The values of the activation energy Ea were 84.26 kJ mol−1 during the diffusion stage (30 °C–60 °C). At last, the three thermodynamic parameters results (ΔH, ΔS, ΔG) were also obtained from the extraction process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Ethyl acetate, acetone, n-octanol, and polyethylene glycol 400 as mutual solvents as well as ultrasonic treatment were employed to improve the chemical and physical properties of heavy bio-oil. When the ratio of n-octanol to heavy bio-oil was 3:1, ultrasonic power was 150 W, and exposure time was 12 min, the viscosity (40 °C) of heavy bio-oil decreased from 1244.60 to 6.05 mm2·s-1, the heat value increased to 41.02 MJ·kg-1, and the pH increased to 6.23. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that no change is obvious in the TG curve for some of the blends after 60 days. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) effectively verified that some of the blends were stable after 60 days and some were not, but no stratification was observed. FT-IR and TGA are fast and easy tools to examine the stability and homogeneity of the blends. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The production cost and viscosity of certain ionic liquids (ILs) are among the major factors preventing the establishment of economically viable IL-based biomass pretreatment technologies. Recently, mixtures of an IL with an organic solvent have been proposed for cellulose processing and biomass pretreatment. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an inexpensive organic solvent that is industrially produced from lignin, a byproduct of the pulping process. We carry out a mechanistic study of DMSO-assisted IL pretreatment of switchgrass. The physical structures of biomass samples are studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption analysis, and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Both dry and aqueous suspensions of biomass samples are measured by SANS which provides unique information on biomass pretreatment. A mixture of 42 wt % [C2C1Im][OAc] and 58 wt % DMSO is proposed as the optimal pretreatment solution, and the recycling and reuse of the mixture of solvents are also studied. The fermentability of the hydrolysates generated after pretreatment is evaluated using an E. coli strain engineered to produce isoprenol. This study suggests an avenue for developing more efficient and cost-effective IL-based processes for the production of lignocellulosic biofuels and bioproducts. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The temperature influence on bio-oil distribution of granular sewage sludge (GSS) pyrolysis from 500 °C to 800 °C in a horizontal tube reactor was investigated. The maximum yield of bio-oil was 43.6% of weight-lost percent during GSS pyrolysis. The bio-oil mainly contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and long chain nitriles. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results of bio-oil indicated that PAHs were formed during pyrolysis, which were in agreement with gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) results that PAHs in bio-oil were mainly made up of tricyclic and tetracyclic PAHs. The yield of PAHs strongly increased with temperature, reaching a maximun value at 700 °C. The present results might be valuable for assessing sewage sludge pyrolysis as thermal treatment method and also for studying the formation mechanism of PAHs during sewage sludge pyrolysis. © 2018

AB  - MoS2 was prepared by a hydrothermal method and then applied into the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of p-cresol as a model compound for bio-oil to study the effects of water and benzothiophene on the conversion, product distribution and stability in detail. The presence of water enhanced the HDO activity and decreased the hydrogen consumption: the deoxygenation degree and toluene selectivity reached to 97.0% and 88.0%, respectively. When water was replaced by benzothiophene, p-cresol conversion increased to 92.3% with toluene selectivity of 72.4%. With water and benzothiophene simultaneously introduced, at 275 °C and 4.0 MPa, the conversion and toluene selectivity were 86.0% and 79.1%, respectively. The reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure were also significant factors. The conversion was raised to 97.4% with toluene selectivity of 80.1% when the reaction temperature increased to 300 °C, but decreased to 71.7% with toluene selectivity of 77.2% when hydrogen pressure increased to 5.0 MPa. The characterization results of the spent catalysts indicated that some defects in the (0 0 2) plane of MoS2 caused by the loss of sulfur were observed after the HDO reaction, which resulted in its deactivation. This deactivation was accelerated by adding water but inhibited by adding benzothiophene. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To synthesis biodiesel from palm oil in one-time addition of methanol and solvent-free medium using CBD fused with C-terminal of lipase from G. stearothermophilus (GSlip-CBD) was immobilized onto magnetic cellulose nanosphere (MCNS). The immobilized matrix traits were preconceived by FT-IR, TEM and XRD. Perceptible biodiesel yield 98 and 73% was synthesized by GSlip-CBD-MCNS in 4 h and GSlip-MCNS in 6 h under the optimized conditions of oil:methanol ratio (1:3.5), temperature (55 and 50 °C) and enzyme loading (15 U). Intriguingly, the operational stability of GSlip-CBD-MCNS was an easily attainable owing to the magnetic properties and could be reused up to 8th and19th cycles with 94 and 45% of biodiesel yield respectively, compared to GSlip-MCNS. Thus GSlip-CBD-MCNS could be a potential biocatalyst for higher yield of biodiesel and reusability in one step addition of methanol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In response to existing global focus on improved biodiesel production methods via highly efficient catalyst-free high temperature and high pressure technologies, this study considered the comparative study of catalyst-free technologies for biodiesel production as an important research area. In this study, therefore, catalyst-free integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification and catalyst-free one step supercritical transesterification processes for biodiesel production have been evaluated via undertaking straight forward comparative energetic and environmental assessments. Energetic comparisons were undertaken after heat integration was performed since energy reduction has favourable effects on the environmental performance of chemical processes. The study confirmed that both processes are capable of producing biodiesel of high purity with catalyst-free integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification characterised by a greater energy cost than catalyst-free one step supercritical transesterification processes for an equivalent biodiesel productivity potential. It was demonstrated that a one-step supercritical transesterification for biodiesel production presents an energetically more favourable catalyst-free biodiesel production pathway compared to the integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification biodiesel production process. The one-step supercritical transesterification for biodiesel production was also shown to present an improved environmental performance compared to the integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification biodiesel production process. This is because of the higher potential environment impact calculated for the integrated subcritical lipid hydrolysis and supercritical esterification compared to the potential environment impact calculated for the supercritical transesterification process, when all material and energy flows are considered. Finally the major contributors to the environmental outcomes of both processes were also clearly elucidated. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Phenolic compounds are an important component of pyrolysis oil (bio-oil). Understanding their reaction behaviours during hydrogenation helps to clarify the reaction network during hydrotreatment of bio-oil. This study investigated the hydrogenation of typical phenolic compounds in bio-oil in water, which is an important fraction of bio-oil, and in methanol, which is used to esterify bio-oil. The results indicated that hydrogenation of the phenolics is more efficient in water than in methanol. With water medium, both the unsaturated oxygen-containing functionalities and the benzene ring of the phenolics can be effectively hydrogenated. In comparison, with methanol medium, only the unsaturated oxygen-containing functionality can be hydrogenated, while the hydrogenation of the benzene ring is rather difficult. Stereoselectivity was also observed in the hydrogenation of phenolics with three or more hydroxyl groups/methoxyl groups. For phenolics with two hydroxyl groups/methoxyl groups, the hydrogenation produces both cis- and trans-configurations. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A novel palladium nanoparticle (NP)-metalated porous organic ligand (Pd NPs/POL-xantphos) has been prepared for the chemoselective decarbonylation of aldehydes. This heterogenous catalyst not only has excellent catalytic activity and chemoselectivity, but also holds high activity after 10 runs of reuse. The effective usage of this method is demonstrated through the synthesis of biofuels such as furfuryl alcohol (FFA) via the highly chemoselective decarbonylation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxy-methylfurfural (HMF) with a TON up to 1540. More importantly, 9-fluorenone could be obtained in one step through the decarbonylation of 2-bromobenzaldehyde by using this heterogeneous catalyst. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The effects of blended additive on properties of bio oil were investigated by adding n-butanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethyl acetate to bio-oil. The blended additive, which consisted of 2.421 wt% n-butanol, 2.327 wt% DMSO and 3.252 wt% ethyl acetate, was obtained through simplex lattice of mixture design. A 24 h aging experiment at 80 °C revealed that blended additive can improve bio-oil stability, and the effect of the blended additive was superior to that of a single additive. The viscosity of the bio-oil containing optimal blended additive was 8.21 mm2/s, whereas that of a single additive ranged within 8.89–9.78 mm2/s. During the long aging process (12, 24, 36 and 48 h), the increase in viscosity and water content of the blank group was larger than that of the control group. Thermo–gravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that the residual mass fraction of the bio-oil rose with aging time, and the trend increase of blank was larger than that of control. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) findings showed that the content of phenols was highest in bio-oil samples and decreased with increasing aging duration. The total contents of ketones, aldehyde and furans diminished with aging time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic cracking processes (CC) of non-edible vegetable oils (VOs) are considered efficient pathway to produce alternative energy sources to replace the fossil fuel. Castor oil (CO) and jatropha oil (JO) are the appropriate resources for biofuels because of their chemical structures and their hydrocarbon chains which are similar to fuel. This investigation was conducted to synthesize, characterize and evaluate acidic catalyst in the CC of castor and JO. The interaction between the oils and the catalyst was studied based on the brand of the produces biofuels. The effect of the concentration of the catalyst on the reaction product was studied including: viscosity, kinematic viscosity, pour point and cloud point. The results revealed that the prepared catalyst can catalyze the cracking reaction of the VOs and produce several grades of biofuels. The study displayed that the physical and fuel characteristics of the obtained biofuels are located within the ASTM specification limits. Also, the chemical nature of the cracked oil has a substantial impact on the composition of the achieved biofuel. The mechanisms of the CC processes of CO and JO were proposed. The physical and fuel properties of the achieved biofuels were discussed using their chromatographic analysis data. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purification of biofuels becomes a challenging issue because of the harmfulness of remaining phenolic molecules for human health and engines. To this end, protonic Y zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were explored as effective adsorbent materials to remove phenol from isooctane solution by using a dual experimental/computational strategy. Phenol was selectively removed from isooctane over HY and USY zeolites with a maximal adsorption capacity of 2.2 mmol·g-1, which corresponds to 3-4 phenol molecules per zeolitic supercage. The adsorption equilibrium was reached faster over dealuminated zeolites, due to the presence of large pores at the expense of microporosity as well as a low density of acidic sites. We further evidence that the presence of acid sites limits the regeneration capacity since phenol was strongly adsorbed on both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. USY zeolite with the highest Si/Al ratio presents the best regeneration capacity since it has the lower aluminum loading. A fundamental understanding of these performances was obtained by coupling characterization (infrared spectroscopy, breakthrough curves, and desorption experiments) and modeling tools (Grand Canonical Monte Carlo and Density Functional Theory). © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Among lignocellulosic materials, chestnut shells (CNS) are a rejected feedstock from agro-food industry with promising possibilities as a suitable raw material to be used in a biorefinery scheme. The aim of this work was to optimize the alkaline delignification of CNS for the co-production of lignin and bio-ethanol. Under the optimal conditions (7.2% NaOH, 80 °C and 30 min), 92.6% of delignification was achieved, and 60.5% of glucan was recovered. This delignified solid was subjected to a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, reaching an ethanol production of 14.6 g/L (ethanol conversion of 97%). Furthermore, the lignin extracted from CNS was characterized for the first time in terms of the chemical composition (pyrolysis-GC/MS), molecular weight distribution (HPSEC), thermal stability (TGA), structural properties and functional groups (FTIR and NMR) and total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu). A preliminary economic analysis demonstrated that the co-production of lignin is the key factor in the profitability of the CNS biorefinery, and that alkaline delignification could be a suitable revalorization strategy of this unexploited residue. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The recalcitrant structure of lignocellulosic biomass made it challenging for their bioconversion into biofuels and biochemicals. Pretreatment was required to deconstruct the intact structure by the removal of hemicellulose/lignin, improving the cellulose accessibility of enzyme. Combinatorial pretreatments with liquid hot water/H2SO4 and ethanol/NaOH of sugarcane bagasse were developed to improve enzymatic hydrolysis under mild conditions. Results: After one-step 60% ethanol containing 0.5% NaOH pretreatment with solid to liquid ratio of 1/10, the glucose yield after hydrolysis for 72 h with enzyme dosage of 20 FPU/g substrate was enhanced by 41% and 205% compared to that of NaOH or 60% ethanol pretreated solids, respectively. This improvement was correlated with the removal of hemicellulose and lignin. However, using combinatorial pretreatments with 1% H2SO4 followed by 60% ethanol containing 0.5% NaOH, the highest glucose yield with Tween 80 reached 76%, representing 84.5% of theoretical glucose in pretreated substrate. While retaining similar glucose yield, the addition of Tween 80 capacitated either a reduction of enzyme loading by 50% or shortening hydrolysis time to 24 h. However, the enhancement with the addition of Tween 80 decreased as hydrolysis time was extended. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a combinatorial pretreatment with 1% H2SO4 followed by 60% ethanol containing 0.5% NaOH had significant effects on improving the enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse. The addition of Tween 80 enabled reducing the enzyme loading or shortening the hydrolysis time. This study provided an economically feasible and mild process for the generation of glucose, which will be subsequently converted to bioethanol and biochemicals. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This study presents the optimized hydrothermal gasification (HTG) and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of Cattle Manure (CM) and Cattle Feed (Canola Stalks) for hydrogen-rich gas, bio-oil and porous carbonaceous catalyst support production as a potential procedure to handle cattle wastes and produce valuable energy carriers. Our main objective in the present research was to produce H2-rich gas from the wastes of dairy cattle in the presence of the efficient catalyst supported on a support that was prepared from the cattle feed. Therefore, with the aim of improving one of the momentous dimensions in the sustainable development that is the environmental protection, considerable efforts were focused on the maximum exploration of dairy cattle waste materials. Three operating parameters of temperature (380–440 °C), reaction time (5–30 min), and feed concentration (2.5–3.5 wt%) were examined and their optimized levels were found to be 440 °C, 20 min, and 2.5 wt%, respectively. The hydrothermal gasification was performed using Ni catalyst supported on activated carbon canola stalks (ACCs), CM hydrochar that was produced via the HTC and further ZnCl2 chemical activation of canola stalks, and the combination of ACCS and hydrochar (called blend) catalysts under the optimized conditions. The impact of catalyst supports on the distribution of gaseous products was assessed by various techniques and accordingly, the blend catalyst increased the H2 and total gas yields by the factors of 1.73 and 1.66, respectively. Furthermore, the bio-oil of the HTG process was also collected and analyzed using GC/MS analysis and it was found that the CM bio-oil is rich in phenol and its derivatives, furans, Nitrogen-containing compounds, and aromatic molecular structures. © 2018

AB  - In this study, a method for assessing the costs of biodiesel production from waste frying oils in Beirut, Lebanon, was investigated with the aim of developing an economic evaluation of this alternative. A hundred restaurant and hotel enterprises in Beirut were surveyed for promoting them in participating in the biodiesel supply chain, and for data collection on waste frying oils generation, disposal methods and frequency, and acquisition cost. Also, waste frying oils were collected and converted into biodiesel using a one-step base catalyzed transesterification process. Physicochemical characteristics of the produced biodiesel were conforming to international standards. Data produced from laboratory scale conversion of waste frying oils to biodiesel, as well as data collected from the only biodiesel plant in Lebanon was used to determine the production cost of biodiesel. Geographic Information System was used to propose a real-time vehicle routing model to establish the logistics costs associated with waste frying oils collection. Comparing scenarios of the configuration collection network of waste frying oils, and using medium-duty commercial vehicles for collection, a logistics cost of US$/L 0.08 was optimally reached. For the calculation of the total cost of biodiesel production, the minimum, average, and maximum values for the non-fixed cost variables were considered emerging 81 scenarios for possible biodiesel costs. These were compared with information on the commercialization of diesel in Lebanon for the years 2011 through 2017. Although competitive with petroleum diesel for years 2011 to 2014, the total biodiesel cost presented less tolerance to declining diesel prices in the recent years. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the acquisition cost of waste frying oils is the key factor affecting the overall cost of biodiesel production. The results of this study validate the economic feasibility of waste frying oils' biodiesel production in the studied urban area upon enforcement of low waste frying oils' acquisition costs, and can help spur food service enterprises to become suppliers of biodiesel production feedstock and support a healthy development of the biodiesel industry in Lebanon. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article presents the findings of our research regarding the supercritical water gasification of a real biomass, olive mill wastewater, with Ni/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. The experiments were performed at five reaction temperatures between 400 and 600 °C, for five reaction times ranging from 30 to 150 s and at a constant pressure of 25 MPa. It was seen that the employment of catalysts enhanced the gasification and biofuel production yield, which mainly involved methane and hydrogen. Ni/Al2O3 was selective for hydrogen formation, whereas Ru/Al2O3 favored the formation of methane. The highest calorific value of the produced biofuel was obtained as 56123 kJ/m3 with Ru/Al2O3 at 600 °C and 60 s. Apart from biofuel production, the simultaneous treatment of the wastewater was also accomplished. At elevated temperatures and times, treatment efficiencies greater than 97% based on total organic carbon conversion were reached. Moreover, the kinetic evaluation of the catalytic supercritical water gasification of olive mill wastewater was performed based on first order reaction kinetics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New catalyst for promoting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) performance is suggested. The catalyst consist of laccase (LAC) and gold nanoparticle (GNP)-naphthalenethiol (NPT), which are linked to polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotube (CNT) (CNT/PEI/[GNP-NPT]/LAC). Its onset potential and ORR rate are improved due to adoptions of PEI and GNP-NPT. Namely, CNT/PEI induces more immobilization of LACs and GNP-NPT acts as electron relay between CNP and NPT by thiol-gold bond and between CNT/PEI and LACs by electron collection effect. Even in EBC measurement, maximum power density of EBC using CNT/PEI/[GNP-NPT]/LAC is highest as 13 μW cm−2. © 2018 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - This study examines that a non-edible dairy waste scum and Hydnocarpus Wightiana oil is claimed to be a highly potential feed stock for biodiesel production. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in aggregation with Central Composite Design (CCD) is employed to evaluate the best potential combination of catalyst concentration, methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time and temperature for higher yield of biodiesel content. A statistical model predicted that the highest conversion yield of scum oil methyl ester (SOME) and Hydnocarpus Wightiana oil methyl ester (HWOME) would be 91.636% and 94.091% at the following optimized reaction conditions: Methanol to oil molar ratio of 7.5:1 and 6.526:1, Catalyst Concentration of 0.961 wt% and 0.934 wt%, Reaction Time 49.529 min and 45 min and temperature 63.46 °C and 64.386 °C respectively. Experiments were conducted for SOME and HWOME at the predicted optimum conditions in three independent replicates, an average biodiesel yield of 90.89 ± 5% and 93.68 ± 4% was achieved which was in reasonable agreement with the predicted value. This study shows that the quality of biodiesel production from SOME and HWOME at optimum process conditions satisfies the ASTM D-6751 and EN14214 Standards. The physio-chemical properties of SOME and HWOME were determined and compared with that of diesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of a paraffinic biofuel (farnesane) obtained from sugar cane, a gas to liquid (GTL) fuel, and a biodiesel fuel on performance and emissions of a light duty engine were evaluated. Similar engine performance is obtained with all fuels maintaining the default electronic control unit (ECU) configuration. Clear reductions in total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions were observed with all alternative fuels, and, comparing both paraffinic fuels, farnesane was more beneficial. Reductions were also obtained with these fuels in particle emissions, with the exception of the mode G, which is not an operating mode included in the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), where particle number concentration of paraffinic fuels was higher compared with diesel and biodiesel fuels. This behavior could be explained by the nonoptimization of ECU at this engine work condition. The benefits in terms of pollutant emission obtained with farnesane make it a potential biofuel for use in diesel engines. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sunn hemp fibre – a cellulose-rich crystalline non-food energy crop, containing 75.6% cellulose, 10.05% hemicellulose, 10.32% lignin, with high crystallinity (80.17%) and degree of polymerization (650) – is identified as a new non-food substrate for lignocellulosic biofuel production. Microwave irradiation is employed to rapidly rupture the cellulose's glycosidic bonds and enhance glucose yield to 78.7% at 160 °C in only 46 min. The reactants – long-chain cellulose, ionic liquid, transition metal catalyst, and water – form a polar supramolecular complex that rotates under the microwave's alternating polarity and rapidly dissipates the electromagnetic energy through molecular collisions, thus accelerating glycosidic bond breakage. In 46 min, 1 kg of Sunn hemp fibres containing 756 g of cellulose produces 595 g of glucose at 160 °C, and 203 g of hydroxymethyl furfural (furanic biofuel precursor) at 180 °C. Yeast mediated glucose fermentation produces 75.6% bioethanol yield at 30 °C, and the ionic liquid is recycled for cost-effectiveness. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The oxidative pyrolysis of mallee wood, cellulose and lignin was performed and the bio-oil products were analysed to understand how the externally added oxygen react with the pyrolysis products. Both wood cylinders of diameter 8 mm and fine particles (90–300 μm) were pyrolysed in this study to understand the combined effects of biomass particle size and the presence of oxygen. The results revealed that, at a low oxygen concentration, the gas-phase oxidation of volatiles would improve the yields of levoglucosan and syringaldehyde, as well as unsaturated hydroxyl ketones/aldehydes for small wood particles through the oxygen-induced radical reactions. Although oxygen could facilitate the production of some compounds in bio-oil through the gas-phase reactions, it did lead to decreases in the heavy bio-oil yield due to the over-oxidation of some pyrolysis products (e. g. aromatics, lactones, unconjugated alkyl aldehydes/esters and carboxylic acids). The effects of oxygen on the pyrolysis of wood cylinders were more complicated than mallee wood particles due to the secondary reactions of volatiles and the reactions involving the pyrolysing particle surface. The interactions between the polysaccharide-derived and lignin-derived products in gas phase might affect the oxidation of volatiles, changing the formation of pyrolytic products (e.g. levoglucosan and syringaldehyde). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial electrosynthesis cells, fabricated using different electrode materials, were operated using different electrolytes and mixed anaerobic culture as biocatalysts in the cathodic chamber under an applied cathode potential of 0.7 V vs standard hydrogen electrode. The rate of production of acetate, isobutyrate, propionate and 2-piperidinone from reduction of CO2 in the cathodic chamber of the MES was 0.81 mM/day, 0.63 mM/day, 0.44 mM/day and 0.53 mM/day, respectively. As CH4 was also present in the biogas, methyl derivatives of these acids were also found in traces in catholyte. It was observed that the use of nickel foam as an anode, 1 M NiSO4 solution as anolyte, graphite felt as a cathode, phosphate buffer solution as catholyte at a pH of 5.2 proved to be the best possible combination for MES for this study to get enhanced product yield at higher energy efficiency.

AB  - Lipid extraction is a critical step in the downstream processing of biodiesel production from microalgae. Solvent extraction using mixtures of non-polar and polar solvents is one of the most well-known processes for this purpose. Hexane is the most common solvent of choice for large-scale lipid extractions due to its technical and economic advantages, especially its high selectivity toward lipids and low cost. In this study, extractions using mixtures of hexane and polar solvents were evaluated for their performance in order to develop a more efficient method for large-scale lipid extraction from microalgae. The combination of hexane and methanol resulted in the highest fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield for lipids from Tetraselmis sp. The effects of extraction conditions, including proportions of methanol to hexane, ratios of total solvent volume to dry biomass, and extraction time, on extraction yields were evaluated to determine optimum conditions providing higher lipid and FAME yields. The optimal conditions were as follows: proportion of hexane to methanol of 1:1, ratio of total solvent volume to dry biomass of 10 mL/g, and extraction time of 120 min. Finally, the selected solvent mixture and optimal conditions were applied to larger scale extraction experiments with scale-up factors of 10, 50, and 100. FAME yields of large-scale extractions were almost completely consistent with increasing scale-up factors. The results of this study suggest that a hexane and methanol mixture is a promising solvent for large-scale lipid extraction from microalgae. © 2018, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A novel hybrid biocatalyst is synthesized by the enzyme composite consisting of silver nanoparticle (AgNP), naphthalene-thiol based couplers (Naph-SH) and glucose oxidase (GOx), which is then bonded with the supporter consisting of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotube (CNT) (CNT/PEI/AgNPs/Naph-SH/GOx) to facilitate glucose oxidation reaction (GOR). Here, the AgNPs play a role in obstructing denaturation of the GOx molecules from the supporter because of Ag-thiol bond, while the PEIs have the AgNPs keep their states without getting ionized by hydrogen peroxide produced during anodic reaction. The Naph-SHs also prevent ionization of the AgNP by forming self-assembled monolayer on their surface. Such roles of each component enable the catalyst to form (i) hydrophobic interaction between the GOx molecules and supporter and (ii) π-conjugated electron pathway between the GOx molecules and AgNP, promoting electron transfer. Catalytic nature of the catalyst is characterized by measuring catalytic activity and performance of enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) using the catalyst. Regarding the catalytic activity, the catalyst leads to high electron transfer rate constant (9.6 ± 0.4 s −1 ), low Michaelis-Menten constant (0.51 ± 0.04 mM), and low charge transfer resistance (7.3 Ω cm 2 ) and high amount of immobilized GOx (54.6%), while regarding the EBC performance, high maximum power density (1.46 ± 0.07 mW cm −2 ) with superior long-term stability result are observed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, the efficiency of extracting algae from culture medium using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), converting the algal/particle slurry to biocrude using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and successfully recycling the MNPs from the char phase was fully demonstrated for the first time. MNPs were synthesized by coprecipitation and used to extract algae from aqueous phase at a separation efficiency (SE) of 99%. The SE was optimized at pH 4. Liquefaction of algal/MNPs slurry gave a biocrude yield of 37.1% while algae only yielded 23.2%. The percentage areas in the GC-MS chromatogram corresponding to hydrocarbons (HCs) in Zn-ferrite catalyzed and uncatalyzed biocrude were 46.5% and 19.9%, respectively, while the percentage areas of heptadecane from Zn-ferrite catalyzed and uncatalyzed biocrude were 37.8% and 10%, respectively. Furthermore, the percentage area of heteroatom compounds in biocrude reduced substantially when liquefaction was done in the presence of Zn/Mg ferrites. The nanoparticles were recovered from biochar by sonication and recycled at a SE of 96.1%. Recycling of MNPs for magnetic separation of algae and catalytic HTL could lower the cost of microalgae harvesting and improve the yield and quality of biocrude. This could potentially reduce the cost of advanced biofuel processing from microalgae, making them more affordable in comparison to petroleum-derived fuels. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Here we tested the bioconversion of biodiesel-derived crude glycerol by the oleaginous red yeast Sporidiobolus pararoseus KM281507 in two bioreactors types (stirred-tank and airlift). High production yields (biomass, 10.62 ± 0.21 g/L; lipids, 3.26 ± 0.13 g/L; β-carotene, 30.64 ± 0.05 mg/L; total carotenoids, 46.59 ± 0.07 mg/L) were achieved in a 3.0 L airlift bioreactor under uncontrolled pH regimes (initial pH 5.63). Under optimized conditions (6.0 vvm aeration rate; 60 ± 5% constant dissolved oxygen [DO] maintained by flushing pure oxygen [O2] into the vessel; 10,000 Lux light irradiation) volumetric production in the airlift bioreactor was further increased (biomass, 19.30 ± 1.07 g/L; lipids, 6.61 ± 0.04 g/L, β-carotene, 109.75 ± 0.21 mg/L; total carotenoids 151.00 ± 2.71 mg/L). Production was also recorded at a S. pararoseus KM281507 growth rate of 0.16 ± 0.00 h−1 (lipids, 0.94 ± 0.04 g/L/d; β-carotene, 15.68 ± 0.40 mg/L/d; total carotenoids, 21.56 ± 0.20 mg/L/d). Lipids from S. pararoseus KM281507 had a high unsaturated fatty acid content, with oleic acid (C18:1) accounting for 80% of all fatty acids. This high oleic acid content makes S. pararoseus KM281507 well-suited as a third generation biodiesel feedstock. Our findings show that airlift bioreactors are suitable for bioconversion of crude glycerol into lipids and carotenoids using S. pararoseus KM281507. This approach is advantageous because of its ease of operation, cost efficiency, and low energy consumption. © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Syngas and biochar production are mainly influenced by temperature, feedstock properties, gasifying agent, pressure, and the mass ratio between gasifying agent and feedstock with temperature being the most significant factor. Increasing temperature generally promotes syngas production while suppressing biochar production. The selection of gasifiers (fixed bed, fluidized bed, and entrained flow) is highly dependent on scale requirement (e.g., volume of feedstock and energy demand), feedstock characteristics (e.g., moisture and ash content), and the quality of syngas and biochar. Updraft fixed bed gasifiers are suitable for the feedstocks with a moisture content up to 50wt.%. High ash feedstocks such as Indian coal, dried sewage sludge, and municipal solid waste that are not suitable for fixed bed gasifiers, have been successfully gasified in bubbling fluidized bed reactors. Woody biomass is not suitable for entrained flow gasifiers unless specialized feeding methods are employed such as wood torrefaction and grinding followed by the existing feeding methods for pulverized coals, biomass-oil biochar slurry preparation followed by pumping, wood or torrefied wood slurry preparation followed by pumping, etc. Syngas and biochar can potentially be contaminated by NH 3 , H 2 S, and tar, which can be removed using catalysts (e.g., Ni-based), metal oxides-based sorbents, and thermal and catalytic cracking methods. Existing syngas and biochar upgrading methods suffered from various problems such as economic infeasibility, limited productivity, and fouling, and future syngas and biochar upgrading methods should be aimed to have the features of reliability, security, affordability, and sustainability, towards the practical, large-scale production of syngas- and biochar-based products. One potential solution is to develop integrated systems by combining biochar upgrading and application with syngas upgrading, which warrants an integrated perspective based on both life cycle assessment and economic analysis. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) was used as a source for biobutanol production via acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Organosolv pretreatment was used for simultaneous extraction of inhibitors, particularly tannins, and pretreatment of lignocellulosic fraction prior to hydrolysis. The hydrolysates of the pretreated MSW contained appreciable amounts of sugars and soluble starch together with a tolerable amount of inhibitors for Clostridium acetobutylicum. The hydrolysate obtained from MSW pretreated with 85% ethanol at 120 °C for 30 min fermented to the highest ABE concentration of 13.06 g/L with the yield of 0.33 g/g carbon source. Through this process, 102.4 mg butanol, 40.16 mg acetone, and 13.14 mg ethanol were produced from each g of organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW). The pretreatment at mild conditions with higher ethanol concentration accompanied with the lowest glucose yield (0.145 g/g) and the highest starch recovery resulted in the uppermost ABE yield of 0.16 g/g OFMSW. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) was performed to investigate the end effects on mass transfer in a packed bed for Reynolds number (Re) ≤ 100. The system considered in this study was naphthalene-air with a Schmidt number (Sc) ∼ 2.52. The location of the spheres’ centers in a randomly packed bed were obtained from Discrete Element Method – Computational Fluid Dynamics (DEM-CFD) simulations. The influence of the confining wall on how packed bed ends affect mass transfer was studied by examining the axial void fraction profile with varying ratio of the column diameter to the particle sphere diameter (D/d). Overall, it was found that the confining wall has a significant impact. The ‘local’ mass transfer coefficient was calculated based on the obtained DNS results and the probability distribution curve and the spatial distribution of the computed ‘local’ Sherwood numbers as function of the ratio X/L (ratio of the height of the active part of the bed to the total height of the bed) were developed to quantify the end effects on mass transfer within packed beds. For a packed bed with no wall effects (D/d = 11), it was found that the end effects can be eliminated by replacing the active particles located at ∼2 sphere diameters from the entrance and ∼1 sphere diameter from the exit by inert particles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The extensive use of biodiesel as an alternate fuel has resulted in the oversupply of glycerine, leading to an increased demand to look for the use of glycerine as an alternate fuel. In this paper, multiple blends of diesel-biodiesel and their glycerine emulsions were compared to investigate the performance and emissions in a modern small diesel engine. A direct injection diesel engine was tested at different loads and speed conditions. Biodiesel was produced onsite and crude glycerine obtained as a by-product was purified using an orthogonal test method. Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance was formulated using two surfactants: Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan Monooleate and Sorbitan Monooleate, which were used in the emulsification process to attain desired stability of glycerin emulsion. Emulsion stability, mean particle droplet size, fuel properties, engine performance, and emissions were examined. Test results show that with the increase in glycerine concentration, brake-specific fuel consumption and brake-thermal efficiency increased. In terms of emissions, it was seen that carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon increased, and reductions in exhaust gas temperature and oxides of nitrogen were observed. In addition, there was a significant decrease in smoke (approximately 80%) with an increased concentration of glycerine at 3000 rpm, at high load. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, biodiesel production using heterogeneous catalysts has been of great concern. However, simple separation of these catalysts from product mixtures is a problem of the process. In this study, series of magnetic KOH/Fe3O4@Al2O3 core–shell nanocatalysts were synthesized via the incipient wetness impregnation method and the effect of weight ratio of Fe3O4-to-Al2O3 (0.15–0.35) on the catalytic performance was assessed. The samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, BET-BJH, VSM, SEM, TEM, and EDX analyses and their basicity was measured by the Hammett indicator method. The results revealed that although the magnetic KOH/Fe3O4@Al2O3 nanocatalyst with 25 wt% of Fe3O4 showed less activity as compared to those with 15 wt% of Fe3O4, it exhibited higher surface area and appropriate magnetic properties. The sample presented superparamagnetic properties with the magnetic strength of 1.25 emu/g that was simply recovered by using an external magnetic field. The nanocatalyst converted 98.8% of canola oil to biodiesel under reflux condition at the best operational conditions of 12 M ratio of methanol/oil, 4 wt% of catalyst and 6 h of reaction time. Moreover, the nanocatalyst showed high reusability such that it was reused several times without appreciable loss of its catalytic activity. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Regardless of fragile biodiesel market of the present day, it is foreseen that biodiesel will draw a lot of public interest throughout the world in the not too distant future. Among different feed stocks available for biodiesel production, waste cooking oil is under a major prospective for large-scale biodiesel production as it can cut down the fuel costs than other alternative feed stocks. However, there are several barriers that hinder large-scale biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. Also, there might be contextual relationships among those barriers. In this perspective, this paper aspires to identify the most influential barrier and to describe the interactions among different barriers influencing biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. For this reason, an interpretive structural modeling approach is employed to determine relationships among barriers. MICMAC analysis has additionally been carried out to classify the barriers based on dependence and driving power. The results indicate that vehicle access problem, lack of processing technology, inconsistent supply quantity and inadequate production facilities are the top-level barriers. Also, the results show that lack of political will, lack of incentives and lack of policy implementation play a very important role in the effective implementation of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A combined Lewis-Brønsted acid ethanolysis of sugars was thoroughly investigated with the aim of producing ethyl levulinate (EL) in a single step. Ethanolysis carried out at 453 K for 4 h using H2SO4 (1 wt%) and AlCl3·6H2O (30 mol % with respect to sugars) produced a yield of 60 mol % of EL respect to glucose and starch. Such optimised conditions were positively applied directly on different food waste, preliminarily characterised and found to be mainly composed by simple (10–15%) and relatively complex sugars (20–60%), besides proteins (6–10%) and lipids (4–10%), even in their wet form. The catalytic system resulted robust enough to the point that the copresence of proteins, lignin, lipids and mineral salts not only did not negatively affect the overall reactivity, but resulted efficiently converted into soluble species, and specifically, into other liquid biofuels of different nature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the effect of temperature and catalyst on hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass was investigated. At the end of the experiments, prosopis farcta plant was transformed to solid residue (bio-char) and liquid products (heavy bio-oil, light bio-oil) at temperatures of 250, 300 and 350 °C with catalyst (H3BO3, Na2B4O7·10H2O, NaOH) and without catalyst by hydrothermal liquefaction. The liquid and solid products obtained at the end of the experiments were analyzed by GC–MS, FT-IR, 1 H NMR, SEM and elemental analysis methods. The highest liquid product yield was obtained at 350 °C with sodium tetraborate catalyst as 35.69%. According to the elemental analysis results, the HHV values of the liquid products range from 19.75 to 29.54 MJ kg−1 for 300 °C and from 18.06 to 30.02 MJ kg−1 for 350 °C. HHV values of all obtained liquid products were found to be higher than raw materials. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel functionalized MOF heterogeneous catalyst (MIL-101(Cr) @MBIAILs), 2-Mercaptobenzimidazole ILs with electron-rich –SH groups immobilized onto the surface of the well-defined MIL-101(Cr) frameworks, was constructed and fabricated by the S–Cr coordination bond on the basis of the facile post-synthetic modification strategy. The heterogeneous catalyst was measured by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, TGA, EA and N2 adsorption–desorption, and the catalytic behavior of the catalyst was assessed by the esterification about oleic acid and methanol as a model reaction. The results showed that MBIAILs have been successfully immobilized onto the surface of MIL-101(Cr) frameworks by S–Cr coordinate bonds. More importantly, the conversion of oleic acid just decreased from 91.0% to 82.1% when the catalyst had been reused six times. This exhibited the prepared catalyst had superior catalytic behavior and excellent reusability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to produce high quality bio-oil by microwave co-pyrolysis of torrefied biomass (rice straw) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) using ZSM-5 as a catalyst. A central composite experimental design was used to optimize the reaction condition by response surface methodology analysis. The effects of reaction temperatures and catalyst dosages on the product yield and chemical selectivity of bio-oil were investigated. Results suggested that bio-oil obtained from torrefied biomass contained a lower water content compared with the control.The major chemical compounds of bio-oil were hydrocarbons, ketones, phenols, esters and alcohols (∼80%).Bio-oils with high hydrocarbon content (∼40% in the bio-oil) were obtained in the development of this experiment. Quadratic models were used to predict the bio-oil yield and chemical selectivity of the bio-oil obtained during the reactions. © 2018

AB  - Replacement of fossil fuels with renewable sources has been studied as a strategy to mitigate the environmental impacts of energy production. These concerns have encouraged the use of alternative sources of cost-competitive and sustainable biofuels, such as lignocellulosic biomass, for second-generation ethanol production. As the enzymes required for biomass hydrolysis are costly, the development of less expensive enzyme mixtures for the hydrolysis of sugarcane biomass is important. The efficient conversion of biomass to fermentable sugars requires a critical pretreatment step to increase enzyme accessibility to the substrates during hydrolysis. Ionic liquids (ILs) have recently emerged as interesting solvents for biomass pretreatment. Extensive research has been conducted, showing that IL pretreatment can increase fermentable sugar productivity and biomass hydrolysis yields in comparison with conventional pretreatments, such as dilute sulfuric acid (DSA). The objective of this work was to evaluate changes in the chemical composition of a sugarcane biomass mixture composed of straw and bagasse in a 1:1 (w/w) ratio after pretreatment with the IL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][Ac]) or with diluted sulfuric acid and determine the effect of the pretreatments on the interaction between commercial enzymes for the production of fermentable sugars by enzymatic hydrolysis. Pretreatments with IL were more efficient in the removal of lignin than pretreatments with DSA. Cellulase and endo-1,4-xylanase had a higher contribution to the release of glucose and xylose for both pretreated samples. The highest values of glucose and xylose yields, 99.96% and 86.52%, respectively, were achieved with the enzymatic hydrolysis of the biomass pretreated with IL. © 2018

AB  - The production of carbon-neutral, renewable, and environment-friendly biofuels is currently being implemented worldwide to mitigate the excessive use of petroleum-based fuels. Fast-growing lipid-producing microalgae, such as Scenedesmus obliquus, are considered ideal feedstocks for biofuel production. In this study, the separation of lipids from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae was done through ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction (UASE) process using various solvent mixtures. The effects of resonance amplitude, n-hexane and isopropanol (HIP) ratio, and reaction time on lipid yield were evaluated. Lipid yield optimization was done through central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM). Lipid yield of 26.63% was obtained at 50 μm resonance amplitude and 4 v/v HIP ratio. The extracted lipids, mainly composed of fatty acids and esters, had a high heating value (HHV) of 35.38 MJ kg−1. Overall, the results of the study validate the effectiveness of the UASE process for microalgal lipid extraction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Unrecycled wastes such as rice straw must be responsibly disposed to prevent environmental issues and it would be even better if it makes a profit. Pyrolysis as a thermal conversion process is one option to convert wastes into biochar, which can be used as a catalyst support for bio-oil catalytic upgrading, electrochemical material, and pollutant adsorbent after biochar activation. In the study, KOH chemical activation was applied to have high surface areas (1330 m2/g). For the first application, the nickel impregnated on the activated carbon was used to upgrade the microalgae distilled bio-oil fraction. The upgraded bio-oil was deoxygenated by 42% and desulfurized by 86%. The H/C and O/C ratios of upgraded bio-oil showed close ratios of the petro-based fuels and HHV was obtained as about 42 MJ/kg. Most olefin and nitrile groups were cracked or converted into smaller carbon chains whereas the amount of paraffin and aromatic groups increased. Also, the activated carbon was evaluated as an electrochemical material, a supercapacitor, which showed both the properties of EDLC (electrical double layer capacitor) and pseudocapacitance. The highest specific capacitance was obtained at 93 F/g, which showed a modest specific capacitance. Last, the activated carbon was used as an adsorbent material to remove pharmaceutical pollutions and almost 95% of them were removed in a 24 h contact time. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Beech wood has been converted into a mixture of oxygen-free naphtha and diesel boiling point range hydrocarbons by using catalytic hydropyrolysis in a fluid bed reactor with a CoMoS/MgAl2O4 catalyst, followed by deep hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) in a fixed bed reactor loaded with a NiMoS/Al2O3 catalyst. The effect of varying the temperature (365-511 °C) and hydrogen pressure (1.6-3.6 MPa) on the product yield and organic composition was studied. The mass balance closed by a mass fraction between 90 and 101% dry ash free basis (daf). The yield of the combined condensed organics and C4+ varied between a mass fraction of 17 and 22% daf, corresponding to an energy recovery of between 40 and 53% in the organic product. The yield of the non-condensable gases varied between a mass fraction of 24 and 32% daf and the char yield varied between 9.6 and 18% daf. The condensed organics contained a mass fraction of 42-75% aromatics, based on GC × GC-FID chromatographic peak area, and the remainder was primarily naphthenes with minor amounts of paraffins. The condensed organics were essentially oxygen free (mass fraction below 0.001%) when both reactors were used. Bypassing the HDO reactor increased the oxygen concentration in the condensed liquid to a mass fraction of 1.8%. The results show that catalytic hydropyrolysis may be a viable way to process solid biomass into liquid and gaseous fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of Chromolaena odorata (C. odorata) and soybean soapstock with HZSM-5 as an ex-situ catalyst was investigated. Effects of catalytic temperature, feedstock: catalyst ratio and C. odorata: soybean soapstock ratio on the yield and composition of the bio-oil were discussed. Results showed that catalytic temperature greatly influenced the bio-oil yield. Co-pyrolysis of C. odorata and soybean soapstock improved the bio-oil yield, and the maximum bio-oil yield of 55.14% was obtained at 250 °C. However, the addition of HZSM-5 decreased bio-oil yield but improved the quality of bio-oil. Moreover, the proportion of oxygen-containing compounds decreased dramatically with the addition of soybean soapstock. The C. odorata: soybean soapstock ratio of 1:2 and feedstock: catalyst ratio of 2:1 were the optimal condition to upgrade the bio-oil. In addition, the resulted biochar contained various essential elements and could be used as soil repair agent. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, liquid hot water pretreatment was combined with disk milling for pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse. Sugarcane bagasse was pretreated using liquid hot water (LHW) at 140–180 °C for 10 min (20% w/w solids content) and then disk milled. Disk milling improved glucose release 41–177% and ethanol production from glucose/xylose cofermentation by 80% compared to only using LHW pretreatment. The highest ethanol conversion efficiency achieved was 94%, which was observed when bagasse was treated at 180 °C with LHW and disk milled. However, a small amount of residual xylose (3 g/L) was indicative that further improvement could be achieved to increase ethanol production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study presented an approach to introduce Mg-based additives into cotton stalk for strengthening deoxygenation effect during torrefaction. Then catalytic pyrolysis of torrefied feedstock with Mg-based additives residue as catalyst was performed at 550 °C for 10 min in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of torrefaction temperature (200, 230, 260, 290, 320, 350 °C), type of Mg-based additive (MgO and MgO-K2CO3), mass ratio of additive to biomass (0.5, 1 and 2) on pyrolysis were investigated. The results indicated that yields of bio-char and bio-oil significantly increased and decreased with torrefaction temperature rising to 350 °C. MgO inhibited pyrolysis bio-char yield increase with torrefaction severity. MgO-K2CO3 increased H2 yield a lot from 1.39 to 3.67 mmol/g. It also effectively improved the aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil and the reduction of acids. A maximum aromatic hydrocarbons yield of 16.05% was obtained with MgO-K2CO3 (the mass ratio of 0.5:1) at torrefaction temperature of 320 °C. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of the microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa was examined with a catalyst mixture of Ru/C and Rh/C in a mass ratio of 1:1. The influences of temperature (380–600 °C), water density (0–0.197 g/cm3), and catalyst loading (0–20 wt%) on the yields and composition of the gaseous products and the gasification efficiency were examined. The temperature and water density significantly affected the SCWG of the microalgae. The hydrogen gasification efficiency was more dependent on the temperature, while the carbon gasification efficiency was more dependent on the water density. The gaseous products mainly consisted of CH4, H2, CO, and CO2, with smaller amounts of C2-C3 hydrocarbons. CH4 made up half of the mole fraction of the gaseous products under most reaction conditions. A synergistic effect between Ru/C and Rh/C existed during the SCWG of the microalgae, and this effect favored the production of CH4. The role of the catalyst mixture became indistinct at higher temperatures. Hydrogen atoms from the water were transferred to the gaseous products during the SCWG, leading to hydrogen gasification efficiencies that exceeded 100%. The main components of the bio-oil were aromatics and nitrogen-containing compounds, and the main aromatics consisted of azulene and anthracene. The nitrogen-containing compounds are potential poisons to the catalyst mixture. © 2018

AB  - Soybean, rapeseed, and palm oil are the main raw materials for biodiesel production worldwide. However, there are other potential feedstocks for biodiesel production. Speculations swirl around the agreements signed at the 21st Conference of the Parties to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector and stimulate the biofuel blending. As an increase in the biodiesel demand is expected, Brazil can be an important player in the international market because of the availability of land and the diversity of raw materials. This paper discusses current global oil and biodiesel scenarios and reviews several potential feedstocks focusing on the prospects, limitations, food–fuel nexus, and opportunities to develop added-value products. Despite the variety of potential feedstocks, the biodiesel sector is likely to pursue its development based on large-scale economically competitive alternatives. Animal fat and waste frying oil are options for a short-term scenario. Palm oil is a promising choice for medium term, while algae and second generation routes may contribute to the biodiesel supply in the long term. Development of competitive chains, investment in technologies, processes and logistics, and domestication of species are essential to guarantee the inclusion of such feedstocks in the world biofuel mix. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sargassum tenerrimum has been used for the production of bio-oil by hydrothermal liquefaction in water sub-critical conditions at a temperature range of 260–300 °C for reaction time 15 min. Maximum bio-oil (16.3 wt%) was obtained at 280 °C and maximum conversion was observed (75.8 wt%) at 300 °C. The solid residue yields decreased continuously from 61.2 wt% to 24.2 wt% as the temperature increased from 260 to 300 °C. The liquid products obtained upon hydrothermal liquefaction were characterized with the help of 1H NMR, GC–MS and FT-IR techniques and bio-residue using FT-IR and XRD. Analysis of bio-oil showed that their components and functional structure of bio-oils were greatly distinguished and consisted of many compounds including phenols, ketones, aldehydes, acid, esters, alcohols, nitrogen-containing compounds, and hydrocarbons. From the GC–MS analysis it has been seen that, organic acid content in the bio-oils were decreased with the increasing temperature from 260 to 300 °C. The band at 1083 cm−1 only appeared in the absorption profile of S. tenerrimum feed, which could be C-O connected with hydroxyl groups and were dehydrated after liquefaction. All the bio-oils showed higher percentages of aliphatic protons in the spectral region from 0.5 to 3.0 ppm. The analysis of bio-residue obtained at various temperatures showed typical amorphous nature that indicated richness of carbon content in the residue. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ever increasing demand on top quality solid biofuel in form of biopellets is limited by the sources and properties of raw materials. The best quality biopellets are suitable for burning in small scale boilers up to 100 kWt. The most limiting factor of this fuel is the ash melting temperature. Therefore the use of cheaper and readily available phytomass as a raw material is considerably restrictive. The research in this paper is based on the theory of the chemical process of ash creation and on the effect of additives on this process. The objective of the study is to find and apply an effective and available additive to produce the best quality phytomass-based fuel pellets, suitable for small scale boilers. A by-product of the paper recycling process, papermaking sludge was used as the most effective additive to wheat straw. This is due to the high content of calcite and kaolin in the sludge. It was also confirmed by experiments that the composition of sludge including cellulose fibres very positively affects the physical and mechanical properties of the composite pellets. Our research deals with an experiment concerning an appropriate production process of composite fuel based on wheat straw. Different weight proportions of papermaking sludge were added and the effect of the sludge on the fuel parameters, especially on the ash melting behaviour, was observed. The final quality of the composite fuel was thoroughly tested by physical, mechanical and thermal methods, and its properties were compared to European and International Standards for Biofuels. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the composite pellets produced by the above-mentioned process have a high level of fuel quality and, due to high ash melting temperature, they are suitable for small scale boilers. The results have shown that the appropriate range of papermaking sludge content for producing high quality wheat straw composite pellets ranges from 10% to 20%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, we report for the first time the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of Pavlova sp. microalgae, which has been performed in a fixed-bed reactor in presence of Ce/Al2O3-based catalysts. The effects of pyrolysis parameters, such as temperature and catalyst were studied on the products yield distribution and bio-oil composition, among others. Results showed that all catalysts increased the bio-oil yield with respect to the non-catalytic runs and reduced the O/C ratio from 0.69 (Pavlova sp.) to 0.1–0.15, which is close to that of crude oil. In terms of bio-oil oxygen content, MgCe/Al2O3 presented the best performance with a reduction of more than 30%, from 14.1 to 9.8 wt%, of the oxygen concentration in comparison with thermal pyrolysis. However, NiCe/Al2O3 gave rise to the highest aliphatics/aromatics fractions. The elemental and gas analysis indicates that N was partially removed from the catalytic bio-oils in the gas phase in forms of NH3 and HCN. © 2017

AB  - Multiphase flows in porous and granular media are widely encountered in many research and engineering fields. Due to the complexity and limited accessibility of real facilities, it can often be difficult to obtain information with measurements. Thus, accurate numerical models are desired tools for design and optimization purposes. In this work, a coupled CFD (computational fluid dynamics)–DEM (discrete element method) model is presented to study multiphase flows in densely packed beds. The well-known VOF (volume of fluid) method is used to describe an arbitrary number of continuous phases and DEM to model the disperse, solid phase. Since the porosity is directly calculated from the particle configuration, a dynamic, spatially resolved description of the granular medium is obtained in contrast to the widely used fixed-porosity-field Eulerian approaches. We discovered that artificial pressure fluctuations inherent to the CFD–DEM coupling method are critical in terms of stability when simulating particle beds with a solid-to-fluid density ratio less than unity. To make the calculations more robust, a novel smoothing model based on temporal relaxation was developed. Experimental validation was performed on an in-house measurement setup, where water was drained through sitting and floating beds, which we were able to successfully reproduce with our simulations. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities and the advantages of our model by employing it on a complex multiphase application, the drainage of liquid iron and slag from a blast furnace hearth. A possible strategy to capture the large spatial and temporal scales of real plants is outlined for future work. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) is a bulk platform chemical with various potential applications such as aviation fuel. 2,3-BD has three optical isomers: (2R, 3R)-, (2S, 3S)- and meso-2,3-BD. Optically pure 2,3-BD is a crucial precursor for the chiral synthesis and it can also be used as anti-freeze agent due to its low freezing point. 2,3-BD has been produced in both native and non-native hosts. Several pathogenic bacteria were reported to produce 2,3-BD in mixture of its optical isomers including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca. Engineered hosts based on episomal plasmid expression such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis are not ideal for industrial fermentation due to plasmid instability. Results: Pichia pastoris is generally regarded as safe and a well-established host for high-level heterologous protein production. To produce pure (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD enantiomer, we developed a P. pastoris strain by introducing a synthetic pathway. The alsS and alsD genes from B. subtilis were codon-optimized and synthesized. The BDH1 gene from S. cerevisiae was cloned. These three pathway genes were integrated into the genome of P. pastoris and expressed under the control of GAP promoter. Production of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD was achieved using glucose as feedstock. The optical purity of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD was more than 99%. The titer of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD reached 12 g/L with 40 g/L glucose as carbon source in shake flask fermentation. The fermentation conditions including pH, agitation speeds and aeration rates were optimized in batch cultivations. The highest titer of (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD achieved in fed-batch fermentation using YPD media was 45 g/L. The titer of 2,3-BD was enhanced to 74.5 g/L through statistical medium optimization. Conclusions: The potential of engineering P. pastoris into a microbial cell factory for biofuel production was evaluated in this work using (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD as an example. Engineered P. pastoris could be a promising workhorse for the production of optically pure (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Alginate, the most abundant carbohydrate presents in brown macroalgae, has recently gained increasing attention as an alternative biomass for the production of biofuel. Oligoalginate lyases catalyze the degradation of alginate oligomers into monomers, a prerequisite for bioethanol production. In this study, two new oligoalginate lyase genes, oalC6 and oalC17, were cloned from Cellulophaga sp. SY116, and expressed them in Escherichia coli. The deduced oligoalginate lyases, OalC6 and OalC17, belonged to the polysaccharide lyase (PL) family 6 and 17, respectively. Both showed less than 50% amino acid identity with all of the characterized oligoalginate lyases. Moreover, OalC6 and OalC17 could degrade both alginate polymers and oligomers into monomers in an exolytic mode. Substrate specificity studies demonstrated that OalC6 preferred α-L-guluronate (polyG) blocks, while OalC17 preferred poly β-D-mannuronate (polyM) blocks. The combination of OalC6 and OalC17 showed synergistic degradation ability toward both alginate polymers and oligomers. Finally, an efficient process for the production of alginate monomers was established by combining the new-isolated exotype alginate lyases (i.e., OalC6 and OalC17) and the endotype alginate lyase AlySY08. Overall, our work provides new insights for the development of novel biotechnologies for biofuel production from seaweed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel produced form waste cooking oil (WCO) has increasingly attracted the attentions as an alternative fuel due to lower particulate emissions and other beneficial factors such as low cost. The present study investigated the production of biodiesel (BFD) as one of the effective methods in solving energy crises and environmental pollution. To increase the consumption of biofuels, a high yield biodiesels (96%) was produced as an alternative to fossil fuels by electrolysis method using graphite electrodes through trans-esterification reaction of WCO and KOH in presence of methanol. This reaction was done in 2 h without side saponification reaction. Biodiesel decreases the environmental effects of waste oil and can cause a new application for using the waste oil. The effect of the catalysis amount, oil/alcohol molar ratio, the amount of co-solvent, water amount, reaction temperature, voltage and the reaction time on biodiesel production were investigated confirming this method as a highly effective way for obtaining high yields. Increasing the catalyst beyond a known level decreases the reaction yield due to saponification side reactions; in consequence, an optimum amount of the catalyst should be used. Without inserting the electricity current in the environment temperature, trans-esterification reaction is done slightly in a long time but proper voltage should be used to obtain high yield, complete the reaction and decrease the reaction time. The purpose of this study is to show that the rheology of the biodiesel is a strong function of the shear history. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels synthesized from lignocellulose-derived platform chemicals are very attractive for sustainable development. Here we reported a new and facile route to synthesize multi-substituted cycloalkanes with a high density and low freezing point using isophorone and furanic aldehydes (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural), by solvent-free aldol condensation, followed by hydrodeoxygenation. Catalysts were screened and NaOH showed good performance. The reaction conditions including catalyst dosage, isophorone/furanic aldehyde ratio, temperature and solvent were optimized, and finally the yields of 70.0% for isophorone/furfural and 72.8% for isophorone/5-hydroxymethylfurfural were obtained. Pt/HZSM-5 was prepared as the bifunctional catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation of the condensed product. The resultant multi-substituted cyclohexanes derived from isophorone/furfural and isophorone/5-hydroxymethylfurfural have a density of 0.813 g mL -1 and 0.846 g mL -1 respectively and both have a freezing point lower than -75 °C, and are very promising as stand-alone fuels or additives of other biofuels. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Coffee bean tegument (silverskin) is a by-product derived from the coffee roasting process. This residue has been discarded, which constitutes a serious environmental problem. The depletion of oil reserves and environmental issues promoted by the combustion of fossil fuels has generated interest in the use of biomass to obtain fuel and chemicals products. The liquid product obtained by biomass pyrolysis is commonly called bio-oil. Bio-oil is a complex mixture of compounds, and its detailed chemical characterization is necessary to prospect its potential uses. Therefore, this study optimized the final temperature of pyrolysis and N2 flow rate parameters for the pyrolysis of silverskin in a fixed bed reactor, by using a central composite design and response surface. The bio-oil chemical composition was evaluated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to rapid-scanning quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC × GC/qMS), combined with the use of standards and linear temperature-programmed retention indices (LTPRI). The optimal values ​​calculated were 560 °C for the final pyrolysis temperature and 49 mL min−1 for the N2 flow rate. The organic phase yield was 15.2% under these conditions. At the optimal conditions, 228 compounds were identified (90.1% of the sample chromatographic volume) in the organic phase. The major chemical class, in terms of volume percentage, were the phenols (26.70%), followed by nitrogen compounds (18.51%). In addition, it is worth mentioning the high representability of the saturated hydrocarbons (8.28%), unsaturated aliphatic (6.69%), and aromatics (7.77%), which together account for 22.74% of the sample chromatographic volume. These results showed that the silverskin bio-oil may have the potential use as a source of chemical inputs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae are an attractive feedstock organism for sustainable production of biofuels, chemicals, and biomaterials, but the ability to rationally engineer microalgae to enhance production has been limited. To enable the evolution-based selection of new hyperproducing variants of microalgae, a method is developed that combines phase-transitioning monodisperse gelatin hydrogel droplets with commercial flow cytometric instruments for high-throughput screening and selection of clonal populations of cells with desirable properties, such as high lipid productivity per time traced over multiple cell cycles. It is found that gelatin microgels enable i) the growth and metabolite (e.g., chlorophyll and lipids) production of single microalgal cells within the compartments, ii) infusion of fluorescent reporter molecules into the hydrogel matrices following a sol–gel transition, iii) selection of high-producing clonal populations of cells using flow cytometry, and iv) cell recovery under mild conditions, enabling regrowth after sorting. This user-friendly method is easily integratable into directed cellular evolution pipelines for strain improvement and can be adopted for other applications that require high-throughput processing, e.g., cellular secretion phenotypes and intercellular interactions. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Fractional catalytic pyrolysis is an updated pyrolysis method, in which the biomass can be converted into higher quality bio-oil by upgrading the pyrolysis vapor in fluidized bed. In this study, the fast pyrolysis of tulip tree (Liriodendron) was performed in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor under various reaction conditions (pyrolysis temperature, flow rate of fluidizing medium, and biomass particle size) to investigate the effects of these parameters on product yield and bio-oil quality. The system used silica sand and dolomite as the fluidizing bed material, and nitrogen as the fluidizing medium. When the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 °C to 550 °C, the bio-oil yield was between 40.07 wt% and 49.03 wt% compared to those of 28.38 and 44.83 wt% using dolomite catalyst. Deoxygenation of bio-oil mostly produced water, and produced lower amounts of CO and CO2, but higher amounts of H2 and hydrocarbons gas. The catalytic process obtaineda high ratio of H2/CO in the gas product. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article aims investigating the solvo and hydrothermal liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse. Reaction temperature and solvents play an important role on the yield and physico-chemical properties of the liquefaction products. This study reports the effect of different temperatures, 240 °C, 260 °C and 280 °C and two different solvents, water and ethanol on yield and properties of bio-oil and char. The higher conversion was obtained at the higher temperatures with ethanol. The bio-oil yield ranged from 46.0% to 51.8% in presence of water and it ranged from 54.6% to 62.3% with ethanol solvent by changing reaction temperature from 240 °C to 280 °C. The char yield decreased from 36.3% to 28.2% and from 39.3% to 24.7% in presence of water and ethanol respectively by varying reaction temperature from 240 °C to 280 °C. The carbon content and HHV were increased and oxygen content was decreased in the products resulting in improved heating and combustion performance. The GC-MS results suggested that the all the bio-oils were mainly composed of phenols and its derivatives, alcohols, esters, hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes and other compounds. The TGA results proposed that the thermal stability of char was improved which is attributed to the reaction temperature of the liquefaction process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass electrolysis enables hydrogen (H2) production at onset voltages of less than 1 V, depending on the fuel species. However, biofuel derived from biomass not categorized as food and produced from environmentally friendly processes is needed for the development of sustainable strategies. In addition, the biofuel should not require special and expensive procedures for processing. The present report describes the direct electrolysis of waste newspaper for H2 production. Cellulose and lignin included in the newspaper were subject to dissolution and hydrolysis in a phosphoric acid solvent at the anode in a temperature range of 100–175 °C. The resulting decomposition products were electrolyzed to H2 and carbon dioxide (CO2), at low onset voltages (ca. 0.2 V) and high current efficiencies (H2: 1.0, CO2: 0.9). Carbon black functionalized with carbonyl groups showed greater catalytic activity than a Pt/C catalyst for the anode reaction. H2 yield reached ca. 0.2 g per 1 g of newspaper in a batch cell. H2 was produced continuously in a current-density range of 0.15–0.25 A cm−2 while maintaining plateau-like voltage behavior in a flow cell. The energy consumed for electrolysis at a current density of 0.15 A cm−2 was as low as 1.27 kWh (Nm3)−1. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Entrained flow gasification of black liquor combined with downstream-gas-derived synthesis of biofuels in Kraft pulp mills has shown advantages regarding energy efficiency and economic performance when compared to combustion in a recovery boiler. To further increase the operation flexibility and the profitability of the biofuel plant while at the same time increase biofuel production, black liquor can be co-gasified with a secondary feedstock (blend-in feedstock). This work has evaluated the prospects of producing biofuels via co-gasification of black liquor and different blend-in feedstocks (crude glycerol, fermentation residues, pyrolysis liquids) at different blend ratios. Process modelling tools were used, in combination with techno-economic assessment methods. Two methanol grades, crude and grade AA methanol, were investigated. The results showed that the co-gasification concepts resulted in significant increases in methanol production volumes, as well as in improved conversion efficiencies, when compared with black liquor gasification; 5–11 and 4–10 percentage point in terms of cold gas efficiency and methanol conversion efficiency, respectively. The economic analysis showed that required methanol selling prices ranging from 55 to 101 €/MWh for crude methanol and 58–104 €/MWh for grade AA methanol were obtained for an IRR of 15%. Blend-in led to positive economies-of-scale effects and subsequently decreased required methanol selling prices, in particular for low cost blend-in feedstocks (prices below approximately 20 €/MWh). The co-gasification concepts showed economic competitiveness to other biofuel production routes. When compared with fossil fuels, the resulting crude methanol selling prices were above maritime gas oil prices. Nonetheless, for fossil derived methanol prices higher than 80 €/MWh, crude methanol from co-gasification could be an economically competitive option. Grade AA methanol could also compete with taxed gasoline. Crude glycerol turned out as the most attractive blend-in feedstock, from an economic perspective. When mixed with black liquor in a ratio of 50/50, grade AA methanol could even be cost competitive with untaxed gasoline. © 2018

AB  - In the present work, catalytic cracking of waste cooking oil (WCO) for the production of liquid fuels has been studied in a semi batch reactor under N2 atmosphere. Catalytic cracking was performed at a temperature range of 400–500 °C using zirconium oxide (ZrO2) as a catalyst. The influence of temperature, heating rate, residence time and catalyst loading on the product yield has been studied. The physicochemical properties such as calorific value, density, flash point and kinematic viscosity of organic liquid product (OLP) was analysed for its suitability for fuel application. The chemical compositions and functional groups present in OLP were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From the overall study, the optimal ZrO2 load, reaction temperature, residence time and heating rate were found to be 4 wt%, 475 °C, 120 min and 10 °C/min, respectively at which 83 wt% of OLP was obtained. From the results of catalyst characterization, it was confirmed that the catalyst can be regenerated after use. © 2018

AB  - Bioethanol production from biomass must be sustainable for providing a real solution to the use of bioethanol as an alternative transportation fuel. In this work, we succeed in using Salicornia Bigelovii (halophyte plant) as a raw material for bioethanol production. The characterization studies indicate a biomass composition comparable to traditional lignocellulosic biomasses: about 46.22 ± 1.20 of cellulose, 14.93 ± 0.37 of hemicellulose and, a low lignin content (1.96 ± 0.21). The highest cellulose content (75.4%) without the presence of furfural aldehyde is obtained employing the wet oxidation pretreatment method, it is performed at 200 °C with test cycles of 10 min applying 1.0 MPa of oxygen pressure. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is improved employing a dilute-acid hydrolysis after the pretreatment cycle, reaching an overall glucose yield of 91%. Moreover, inhibition of cellulose enzymatic conversion by filtrates is not observed during this process. The simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (employing Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast for 120 h) of the pretreated material (using wet oxidation followed by dilute-acid hydrolysis), shows a higher ethanol production yield of 98%. These results demonstrate that there is no need of additional nutrients for the fermentation of Salicornia Bigelovii hydrolysates. Additionally, the electrochemical evaluation demonstrate that bioethanol has a similar energetic capability than analytical ethanol, presenting a current density of ∼0.23 mA cm−2. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymes are promising electrocatalysts for electron transfer (ET) in many biological processes. Strategies to enhance ET between enzymes and electroactive surfaces include orientation and immobilization of the enzymes and electron mediation. Here, we develop a strategy to couple orientation and electron mediation on electrodes based on carbon nanotubes. This is achieved by the synthesis of a redox mediator that contains an enzyme-orientation site (pyrene), an electron-carrier redox mediator (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS)) and an electropolymerizable monomer (pyrrole). The coupling of an enzymatic orientation and a mediated ET in the same chemical structure (pyrrole-ABTS-pyrene (pyrr-ABTS-pyr)) provides a much-improved performance in the bioelectrocatalysis. We demonstrate two fuel cells for the synthesized redox mediator. In a proton-exchange membrane hydrogen/air fuel cell and in a membraneless fuel cell, the pyrr-ABTS-pyr biocathode provides a power density of 1.07 mW cm-2 and 7.9 mW cm-2, respectively. The principle of coupling an enzyme orientation and a redox mediator allows a great variety of mediators to be engineered and provides vast possibilities for the development of fuel cells. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - To defossilize the current liquid energy backbone a sustainable renewable substitute for fossil crude oil is required. The long–term aim is to increase the co-feed of renewables beyond the current level. However, technical constrains and certain properties limit the conventional biogenic co-feed level to less than 10%. The potential of identifying refinery compatible entry points to directly co-feed bio-based refinery intermediates and further co-process in existing petroleum crude oil refineries is investigated in the current study. The studied pyrolysis bio-oil has been upgraded via mild hydrotreatment (HDT) in order to fulfil specifications and become a “drop-in” biofuel in compatible refinery “location”. The properties of HDT-Bio-oil as well as fossil-based refinery intermediates were compared and five fossil-based refinery intermediates have been concluded as potential candidates for co-processing. The miscibility of the aforementioned renewable and conventional fuels has been investigated. Among all refinery streams, Fluid Catalytic Cracking Light Cycle Oil (FCC LCO) and secondly Light Vacuum Gas Oil (LVGO) have been concluded to be the most promising candidates for co-processing, resembling HDT-Bio-oil's properties. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Abstract: A kind of mesoporous Al–Mo mixed oxides as solid acid catalysts was designed and prepared through a facile and low-cost approach using stearic acid as a soft modifier, and investigated by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric, fourier transform infrared spectra, N2 adsorption–desorption, ammonia temperature programmed desorption and scanning electron microscopy. By using this catalyst, an environmentally benign process for esterification of free-fatty acids in non-edible Euphorbia lathyris crude oil with methanol was developed. It was shown that the activity of the catalysts for the esterification reaction is closely related to their mesoporous structures, surface area and acid properties. The Al–Mo solid acid catalyst exhibited an optimal esterification performance with 80.9% esterification efficiency under the optimum synthesis conditions. Moreover, the conversion remained over 73.2% after the catalyst being used for three times. These results showed that the catalysts have promising viability in esterification for biodiesel production in industry. Graphical Abstract: Mesoporous Al–Mo oxides catalysts were prepared via a facile and low-cost modified approach and exhibited excellent catalytic activity and reusability in esterification reaction of high value acid non-edible oil and methanol. This material has great potential in the future production of biofuels used as the solid acid catalyst. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Negative emission (NE) technologies are recognized to play an increasingly relevant role in strategies limiting mean global warming to 1.5 °C as specified in the Paris Agreement. The potentially significant contribution of pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS) is, however, highly underrepresented in the discussion. In this study, we conduct the first quantitative assessment of the global potential of PyCCS as a NE technology based on biomass plantations. Using a process-based biosphere model, we calculate the land use change required to reach specific climate mitigation goals while observing biodiversity protection guardrails. We consider NE targets of 100-300 GtC following socioeconomic pathways consistent with a mean global warming of 1.5 °C as well as the option of additional carbon balancing required in case of failure or delay of decarbonization measures. The technological opportunities of PyCCS are represented by three tracks accounting for the sequestration of different pyrolysis products: Biochar (as soil amendment), bio-oil (pumped into geological storages) and permanent-pyrogas (capture and storage of CO2 from gas combustion). In addition, we analyse how the gain in land induced by biochar-mediated yield increases on tropical cropland may reduce the pressure on land. Our results show that meeting the 1.5 °C goal through mitigation strategies including large-scale NE with plantation-based PyCCS may require conversion of natural vegetation to biomass plantations in the order of 133-3280 Mha globally, depending on the applied technology and the NE demand. Advancing towards additional bio-oil sequestration reduces land demand considerably by potentially up to 60%, while the benefits from yield increases account for another 3%-38% reduction (equalling 82-362 Mha). However, when mitigation commitments are increased by high balancing claims, even the most advanced PyCCS technologies and biochar-mediated co-benefits cannot compensate for delayed action towards phasing-out fossil fuels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Continuous transesterification of linseed oil was examined in order to maximize the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) yield. The continuous process was conducted in a packed bed reactor using calcium oxide as a heterogeneous catalyst. In addition, the impact of three variables, namely the molar ratio of diethyl ether (DEE) to methanol, the molar ratio of methanol to oil and the flow rate (ml/min), on the FAMEs yield were studied. The effectiveness of DEE will reveal after comparing transesterification yield in the presence and absence of the co-solvent. The optimum conditions for in continuous method were reported as follows: a molar ratio of DEE to methanol of 1.19:1, a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 9.48:1, a flow rate of 1.37 ml/min, and temperature of 30 °C. Under the optimum conditions, a FAMEs yield of 98.08% was achieved. All the properties such as flash point, pour point, cloud point, and viscosity of the biodiesel from linseed oil were measured by the related specific standards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We have studied hydrogen gas production using photocatalysis from C2-C5 carbon chain polyols, cyclic alcohols and mono and di-saccharides using palladium nanoparticles supported on a TiO2 catalyst. For many of the polyols the hydrogen evolution rate is found to be dictated by the number of hydroxyl groups and available α-hydrogens in the structure. However the rule only applies to polyols and cyclic alcohols, while the sugar activity is limited by the bulky structure of those molecules. There was also evidence of ring opening in photocatalytic reforming of cyclic alcohols that involved dehydrogenation and decarbonylation of α C–C bond. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate in-situ transesterification study of linseed with methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH) for the production of biodiesel. The influence of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a co-solvent was also investigated. The effect of solvent to solid ratio or solvent and co-solvent to solid ratio (SSR) (1–15 (v/w)), co-solvent to solvent (C-S/S) ratio (0.25–2.25 (v/v)), catalyst concentration (1–13 wt% oil content (w/w)), agitation rate (600–900 rpm), reaction temperature (40–60 °C) and reaction time (90–150 min) was examined to obtain the optimum biodiesel yield and biodiesel quality. The SSR, C-S/S ratio and catalyst concentration were investigated by a set of experiments that designed by “Design Expert” software in responsive surface central composite design (CCD) method with duplication of each test to improve confidence limits. The maximum methyl ester content with using the THF as a co-solvent was 93.15% when: 6.8 wt% as catalyst KOH, 10 as solvent and co-solvent to solid ratio, 0.3 as C-S/S ratio, 40 °C as the reaction temperature, 90 min as the reaction time and 700 rpm as the agitation rate were used. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the rapidly diminishing fossil fuel resources, development of a new strategy for synthesis of biofuels from renewable resources can provide a sustainable alternative to our energy demand. We present the design, synthesis, and characterization of a new porous organic network (TpPON) through acid-catalyzed condensation of 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) and triphenylamine (TPA). Ru0 nanoparticles are successfully fabricated at the porous surface of TpPON to obtain a novel catalytic system Ru@TpPON, which exhibits excellent catalytic performance together with outstanding stability for the hydrodeoxygenation of various vegetable oils to long-chain alkanes in water, and thus TpPON has wide potential for large-scale biodiesel production from renewable resources. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fractionation of bio-oil is in favor of upgrading bio-oil to transport fuel or chemicals. The microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta was hydrothermally liquefied to form a bio-oil, which was split into two layers during cooling: the lower layer contained organics with relatively high molar mass from 78 to 389 g mol−1, while the super layer with relatively low molar mass from 44 to 121 g mol−1. The lower layer of hydrothermally liquefaction (HTL) bio-oil was further fractionated into ethanol phase (oil 1) and dichloromethane phase (oil 2), and the super layer yielded 1 or 3-4 fractions of extracts (oil 3) via single-stage or multistage liquid-liquid extraction respectively. The compositions of each fraction were analyzed by GC-MS in detail. Dichloromethane, chloroform, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, iso-octanol, petroleum ether, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, ethyl acetate were compared in terms of their extraction capabilities to organics of bio-oil. The results indicated the chloroform and dichloromethane have the highest comprehensive extraction capabilities. In multistage extraction, when dichloromethane was used as extractant, the extraction distribution ratio (calculated using COD, chemical oxygen demand) was 0.66 in first-stage, then sharply dropped with an increase in stage number, 2nd∼3rd stage extractions achieved the maximum extraction percentage (approximately 53%). That the optimum combination of chloroform, benzene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane fractionated the super layer of HTL bio-oil can obtain very low oxygen content fraction: hydrocarbons (purity of hydrocarbons: relative content 97.9%) from the 2nd stage of multistage extraction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding the pyrolysis mechanism of lignin is of great importance for improvement of thermochemical conversion processes and upgrading of biofuels. In this work, the pyrolysis of lignin model compound, guaiacol, at atmospheric pressure has been studied in a flow reactor by synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry. Over 50 species were detected and identified in guaiacol pyrolysis, including alkanes, alkenes, cyclic alkenes, dienes, alkynes and aromatics. Major pathways proposed, including homolytic cleavage of O-CH3 bond, isomerization, dehydrogenation and hydrogenation, were evaluated using quantum chemical calculations. In the proposed pathways, homolytic cleavage of O-CH3 bond is regarded as an important route for the formation of catechol. H-atom and CH3-radical assisted demethoxylation mechanisms were proposed to interpret the formation of phenol and cresol, respectively. Furthermore, an energetically advantageous route including intramolecular H-immigration, ring-opening and decarbonylation was proposed to account for the formation of C4 products. A series of aromatic products were detected in this work, which is helpful to understand the coking mechanism during pyrolysis of lignin. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a novel two-step enzymatic process was firstly established to produce microalgae biodiesel using wet Chlorella biomass. In the first hydrolysis step, to reduce energy consumption and effectively disrupt microalgal cell wall, among cellulase, hemicellulase, papain, lysozyme and pectinase, the highest hydrolysis efficiency (67.52%) was obtained by cellulase at pH 5.0 with enzyme dosage of 200 U/g dry biomass at 40 °C for 12 h. In the second transesterification step, compared with liquid CAL-A/B from Candida antarctica and PLA from Aspergillus oryzae, liquid lipase TL from Thermomyces lanuginosus achieved the highest biodiesel conversion at 81.15:1 (v/w) ethanol/g TFAs ratio in 78–83% water content with 100 PLU/g TFAs lipase loading at 25 °C for 48 h. Moreover, similar results were obtained with three Chlorella species by this process. Overall, this two-step enzymatic process was a green, low-energy and efficient method for cost-effective biodiesel production using wet microalgal biomass. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to explore the influence of inherent hierarchical porous char with alkali and alkaline earth metallic species (AAEMs) during pyrolysis of lignin derived from agricultural crop residues in a laboratory fixed-bed at 550 °C. A catalytic strategy was implemented to investigate volatile-char interactions based on ex situ lignin pyrolysis. The physico-chemical properties of the AAEMs-loaded char were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDX and N2 nitrogen adsorption analyses. Results indicated that AAEMs-loaded char had a large specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, amorphous carbon structure, surface-active functional groups and highly dispersed metal species. Specifically, the specific surface area of AAEMs-loaded char was significantly reduced owing to coke deposition after interaction with pyrolysis vapours. Bio-oil composition revealed substantial increases in phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol and catechol. These increases were mainly attributed to demethylation, demethoxylation, or alkyl substitution reaction. The experimental results confirmed the occurrence of significant volatile-char interactions during lignin pyrolysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, microalgae are widely discussed as a promising feedstock for biofuel production. For higher crude bio-oil yield with good quality, microalgal biomass productivity and bio-oil characteristics are essential parameters. However, the same microalgal species has different chemical compositions at different growth phases. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the best growth phase for high biomass productivity and optimal bio-oil production from the green microalga Micractinium conductrix via Py-GC/MS and TGA/MS analysis. M. conductrix was grown in a tubular photobioreactor and harvested at early exponential phase (EEP), middle exponential phase (MEP), late exponential phase (LEP) and stationary phase (STP). LEP showed the maximum significant (P ≤ 0.05) biomass productivity of 0.058 ± 0.004 g L−1 d-1, with maximum significant lipid and carbohydrate contents (28.7 ± 1.1 and 42.9 ± 1.2%dw, respectively). TGA/MS results confirmed that biomass harvested at MEP and LEP showed higher extent of conversion or mass loss reaction via thermal degradation with the lowest residual solid products. In addition, the hydrocarbon fragments in gaseous products (H2, C2H6, CH4, C2H4) from TGA/MS analysis were found to be released more abundantly at LEP. Moreover, Py-GC/MS results revealed that thermal decomposition of biomass harvested at LEP resulted in the highest significant relative contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons (41.2%) with lowest nitrogen-containing compounds (6.3%). The present study showed the significant impact of harvest time of microalgae on products characteristics of thermal decomposition and nominated LEP as the optimum growth phase to harvest M. conductrix for upgraded bio-oil production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oil production from renewable sources has been seen as suitable alternative to supply future energy demand. Perennials grasses are currently being developed as a suitable second-generation biofuel feedstock. It has advantages such as rapid growth rate, easy to grow, minimal maintenance and utilise marginal land without competing with food supply. Taking into account of the various challenges attributed to the transformation of second-generation biomass for energy production, this work systematically looks at the ecological perspective and the availability for bioenergy production from Imperata Cylindrica in Brunei Darussalam. Biomass characterisation was carried out to determine the properties and energy content, meanwhile py-GC/MS study was conducted to identify building blocks of value-added chemical from I. cylindrica. The physicochemical properties of feedstock was thoroughly evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis, proximate analysis, elemental analysis, compositional analysis, calorific value, and analytical pyrolysis interfaced with gas chromatograph (Py-GC/MS). Characterisation results indicate that Imperata Cylindrica has a calorific value of 18.39 MJ/kg, with low ash content and high percentage of volatile matter. Py-GC/MS analysis revealed the presence of furfural, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, 4-vinylguaiacol, propenylguaiacol, guaiacol and 4-ethylphenol. The fixed-bed pyrolysis experiment of imperata cylindrica showed that the yield of bio-oil increases with the increase of temperature and it reached a peak of 37.16% at 500 °C. These results show that Imperata Cylindrica is suitable as feedstock for bio-oil production via pyrolysis process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass is a wide-spread resource that have been studied for decades to realize energy utilization is a renewable and sustainable way. It was reported that there is a synergistic interaction during co-pyrolysis of different biomasses such as algae and terrestrial plants, but the mechanism is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the heterogeneous interactions between rice husk (HU) volatile and Enteromorpha clathrate (EN) bio-coke during co-pyrolysis using a sectional tubular pyrolysis furnace. Physical and chemical properties of the interacted bio-coke were studied using N2 isothermal absorption method, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the obtained bio-oil was also characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The changes in specific surface area of the pyrolyzed bio-coke indicated the significant effect of HU volatiles on EN bio-coke microstructure. After flew through by rice husk volatiles, the adsorption capacity of EN bio-coke improved. Owing to the free radicals in HU volatile, polycondensation and aromatization reactions were enhanced in EN bio-coke resulting in aromatic compounds with higher cyclization of nitrogenous compounds. On the other hand, EN bio-coke participated the decomposition of carbohydrates in HU volatiles to increase the content of aldehydes and furans in the produced bio-oil. In addition, the significant Maillard reaction accelerated the production of ketones and phenols in the bio-oil and reduced the content of N in EN bio-coke at 400 °C. The present study confirmed that there is a significant interaction between seaweed bio-coke and rice husk volatiles during co-pyrolysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acidic bentonite clay was obtained through surface modification of bentonite clay using hydrochloric acid as acidic precursor to increase the acidity of the bentonite. The modified catalyst was examined via X-ray fluorescence (XRF), XRD analysis, Brunauer Emmett and Teller surface area (BET), FTIR analysis and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis. XRF analysis showed that the acid modification of bentonite clay results in an increase in the silica content and lower abundance of metal oxides, due to the dissolve of Fe2O3, MnO, CaO, Na2O. Ca2+, Na+ cations from the interlayer and octahedral sheets. FTIR spectroscopy showed that the acid activation decreased the intensity of the absorption bands at 915, 875 and 836 cm−1 which arise from the binding modes of OH groups. NH3-TPD analysis showed a considerable increase in the moderate and strong Bronosted acid cites on the modified bentonite compared to the native clay. The modified bentonite was evaluated as economic and efficient heterogeneous catalyst in catalytic cracking process of two nonedible vegetable oils to obtain the corresponding biofuels at moderate processing temperature of 250–280 °C. It was observed that the catalytic conversion was preceded under mild temperature and obtained efficient biofuels with approved physical and fuel properties according to ASTM specifications. The role of the catalyst ratio was considerable on the yield percent and the properties of the obtained biofuels. The catalytic activity-reaction mechanism was discussed based on NH3-TPD analysis. © 2018

AB  - Research on utilization of abundant rice residue for valuable bioenergy products is still not explored completely. A simple, robust, cheap, and one-step fast pyrolysis reactor is still a key demand for production of bioenergy products, ie, high quality bio-oil and biochar. Bio-oil extracted from fast pyrolysis does not have adequate quality (eg, acidic and highly oxygenated). Catalytic fast pyrolysis using zeolites in the fast pyrolysis process effectively reduces the oxygen content (no H2 required). In this paper, the zeolites with different pore sizes and shapes (small pore, SAPO-34 (0.56) and ferrierite (30); medium pore, ZSM-5 (30), MCM-22 (30), and ITQ-2 (30); and large pore zeolite, mordenite (30)) were tested in a drop-type fixed-bed pyrolyzer. Catalytic deoxygenation is conducted at 450°C at the catalyst/biomass ratio of 0.1. Zeolite catalysts, its pore size and shape, could influence largely on deoxygenation. It was found that the small pore zeolites did not produce aromatics as compared to higher amount of aromatics formed in case of medium pore zeolites. ZSM-5 and ITQ-2 zeolites were especially efficient for the higher deoxygenation of biomass pyrolysis vapors due to better pore dimension and higher acidity. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The present work was aimed at assessing the possible use of ripe plantain fruit peel as a green-base catalyst in synthesizing Azadirachta indica oil methyl esters (AIOME). The free fatty acid content of the oil (5.81 wt %) was initially reduced to 0.90 wt % using methanol: oil at 2.19 v/v, Fe2(SO4)3 at 6 wt %, time of 15 min and temperature of 65 °C. The pretreated oil was converted to AIOME in a transesterification process with calcined ripe plantain peel ash (CRPPA) at 700 °C as catalyst. The process was modeled by artificial neural network and optimized using genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the developed CRPPA is ascribable to its high K content and microstructural transformation. The reliability of the model obtained was confirmed with a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.996 and a low mean relative percentage deviation (MRPD) of 8.10%. The best operating variables combination for the process was methanol:oil of 0.73 v/v, CRPPA of 0.65 wt % and time of 57 min while the temperature was kept constant at 65 °C with a corresponding AIOME yield of 99.2 wt %. The results of this work demonstrated the potentials of ripe plantain peels and neem oil as cheap feedstocks for biodiesel production. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Treatment of wet algal biomass in hot compressed water produces crude bio-oil that spontaneously separates from the aqueous phase upon cooling. Additional bio-oil (water-soluble biocrude) can be obtained via solvent extraction of the aqueous phase coproduct. The present study is the first to examine the supercritical water upgrading (both with and without catalysts) of these two biocrude types independently. Of the catalysts tested, Pt/C had the best effect on upgrading the water-insoluble biocrude from algae liquefaction. It provided the highest C (80.9 wt%) and H content (10.6 wt%) and heating value (41.6 MJ/kg), and the lowest N (2.47 wt%), S (0.26 wt%), and O contents (4.80 wt%). The use of process water from liquefaction for supercritical water upgrading leads to higher quality upgraded oils. Hydrothermal upgrading of the water-soluble biocrude from algae liquefaction significantly improved its quality as the C content increased from 61.0 to 75.1 wt%, heating value increased from 29.3 to 35.4 MJ/kg, and the combined N, S and O content decreased from 30 wt% to 16 wt%. The material produced by upgrading the water-soluble biocrude from algae HTL contained aromatic hydrocarbons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Triglycerides and fatty acid derivatives can be converted to hydrocarbon-grade green diesel that are entirely fungible to the fossil fuels. In the present study, deoxygenation (DO) process of triolein was studied by using mesoporous SiO2-Al2O3 supported Co-Ca catalyst. The presence of active metals (Co-Ca) showed high DO activity exclusively via decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) pathways with maximum hydrocarbon n-(C8-C20) yield of 73%, and high selectivity of n-C15 and n-C17 fractions. This results suggested the acid-base active sites of catalyst provide selective deCOx pathway of triglycerides structure. In additional, the presence of high surface area of Co-Ca/ SiO2-Al2O3 enhance the metal dispersion for better accessment of large molecular reactant with catalyst during DO process. An optimum Co metal content (10 wt.%) for deCOx reaction was observed, while an excess Co content is not preferable due to tendency of cracking effect. The efficiency of Co-Ca/SiO2-Al2O3 was investigated by using non-edible feedstock (e.g. Ceiba oil and Sterculia oil) along with catalyst stability study were carried out. Resulst also indicated that degradation of DO activity was due to the formation of coke. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biocatalysts consisting of bi-enzyme of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and terephthalaldehyde (TPA) as cross-linker ([(TPA/HRP/GOx)]/PEI/CNT) that have different GOx and HRP mass ratio are developed and their catalytic activity about glucose oxidation reaction and electrical performance evaluated via biofuel cell are characterized. To gain the optimal catalytic structure, current density peak of flavin adenine dinucleotide redox reaction, electron transfer rate, Michaelis-Menten constants, sensitivity and catalytic stability are measured. As a result, [(TPA/HRP/GOx)]/PEI/CNT whose HRP and GOx ratio is 2:5 is determined as the best catalyst. It is ascribed to superior catalytic activity of GOx and H2O2 reduction reaction ability of HRP. Regarding electrical performance, polarization curves of enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs) using the associated catalysts indicate that maximum power density (MPD) of EBC using [(TPA/HRP/GOx)]/PEI/CNT (HRP and GOx ratio of 2:5) is 2.0 ± 0.1 mW·cm−2, which is the highest of all the tested EBCs. Based on that, it is obvious that the optimal [(TPA/HRP/GOx)]/PEI/CNT induces improvements in catalytic activity and EBC performance due to proper removal of toxic H2O2 molecules by HRP, excellent glucose reactivity by GOx and stable bonding of the catalytic structure by TPA. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Biofuels from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of abundantly available forest residues in British Columbia (BC) can potentially make great contributions to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector. A life-cycle assessment was conducted to quantify the GHG emissions of a hypothetic 100 million liters per year HTL biofuel system in the Coast Region of BC. Three scenarios were defined and investigated, namely, supply of bulky forest residues for conversion in a central integrated refinery (Fr-CIR), HTL of forest residues to bio-oil in distributed biorefineries and subsequent upgrading in a central oil refinery (Bo-DBR), and densification of forest residues in distributed pellet plants and conversion in a central integrated refinery (Wp-CIR). Results: The life-cycle GHG emissions of HTL biofuels is 20.5, 17.0, and 19.5 g CO2-eq/MJ for Fr-CIR, Bo-DBR, and Wp-CIR scenarios, respectively, corresponding to 78-82% reduction compared with petroleum fuels. The conversion stage dominates the total GHG emissions, making up more than 50%. The process emitting most GHGs over the life cycle of HTL biofuels is HTL buffer production. Transportation emission, accounting for 25% of Fr-CIR, can be lowered by 83% if forest residues are converted to bio-oil before transportation. When the credit from biochar applied for soil amendment is considered, a further reduction of 6.8 g CO2-eq/MJ can be achieved. Conclusions: Converting forest residues to bio-oil and wood pellets before transportation can significantly lower the transportation emission and contribute to a considerable reduction of the life-cycle GHG emissions. Process performance parameters (e.g., HTL energy requirement and biofuel yield) and the location specific parameter (e.g., electricity mix) have significant influence on the GHG emissions of HTL biofuels. Besides, the recycling of the HTL buffer needs to be investigated to further improve the environmental performance of HTL biofuels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The pyrolysis of oil palm mesocarp fiber (OPMF) was catalyzed with a steel slag-derived zeolite (FAU-SL) in a slow-heating fixed-bed reactor at 450 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C. The catalytic pyrolysis of OPMF produced a maximum yield of 47 wt% bio-oil at 550 °C, and the crude pyrolysis vapor (CPV) of this process yielded crude pyrolysis oil with broad distribution of bulky oxygenated organic compounds. The bio-oil composition produced at 550 °C contained mainly light and stable acid-rich carbonyls at a relative abundance of 48.02% peak area and phenolic compounds at 12.03% peak area. The FAU-SL high mesoporosity and strong surface acidity caused the conversion of the bulky CPV molecules into mostly light acid-rich carbonyls and aromatics through secondary reactions. The secondary reactions mechanisms facilitated by FAU-SL reduced the distribution of the organic compounds in the bio-oil to mostly acid-rich carbonyls and aromatic in contrast to other common zeolite. © 2017

AB  - Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML), as a kind of eukaryotic protein catalyst, plays an important role in the food, organic chemical, and biofuel industries. However, RML retains its catalytic activity below 50°C, which limits its industrial applications at higher temperatures. Soluble expression of this eukaryotic protein in Escherichia coli not only helps to screen for thermostable mutants quickly but also provides the opportunity to develop rapid and effective ways to enhance the thermal stability of eukaryotic proteins. Therefore, in this study, RML was engineered using multiple computational design methods, followed by filtration via conservation analysis and functional region assessment. We successfully obtained a limited screening library (only 36 candidates) to validate thermostable single point mutants, among which 24 of the candidates showed higher thermostability and 13 point mutations resulted in an apparent melting temperature (Tappm) of at least 1°C higher. Furthermore, both of the two disulfide bonds predicted from four rational-design algorithms were further introduced and found to stabilize RML. The most stable mutant, with T18K/T22I/E230I/S56C-N63C/V189C-D238C mutations, exhibited a 14.3°C-higher Tappm and a 12.5-fold increase in half-life at 70°C. The catalytic efficiency of the engineered lipase was 39% higher than that of the wild type. The results demonstrate that rationally designed point mutations and disulfide bonds can effectively reduce the number of screened clones to enhance the thermostability of RML. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The present work evaluated the growth potential, lipid productivities and the fatty acids methyl esters profiles of 6 chlorophytes and 6 cyanobacteria isolated from the northeast of Brazil, aiming to predict the quality of the biodiesel that could be produced from these microalgae. Among the chlorophytes, Chlorella sp. (D101Z) stood out as having the greatest daily cell division rate (2.42 d−1). Among the cyanobacteria examined, the species Synechocystis sp. (M3C) and Synechococcus nidulans (D109WC) showed elevated lipid (54.2 and 93.8 mg L−1 d−1 respectively) and biomass productivities (0.39 and 0.69 g L−1 d−1 respectively). The lipids produced by the chlorophytes were mainly saturated, monounsaturated, and tri-unsaturated esters, while the cyanobacteria produced high levels of saturated esters and fatty acids with different degrees of unsaturation. Statistical analyses indicated D101Z and D109WC as promising species, as they showed high lipid productivity and the biodiesel produced from their lipids demonstrated low cold filter clogging point values, with a low iodine index for D101Z; the rather high iodine index of D109WC, however, disqualified it for biodiesel production purposes. Among the species studied, only the chlorophyte Monoraphidium contortum (D173WC) and the cyanobacteria D109WC did not meet all of the quality specifications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the effect of single and split injection strategy on combustion, performance and emissions characteristics of biodiesel was experimentally investigated on a common rail direct injection assisted diesel engine. In single injection strategy, Nozzle opening pressure and fuel injection timing was varied from 200 to 600 bar and 19°–27° CA bTDC respectively. Experimental results revealed that B100 had the maximum brake thermal efficiency of 35.74% at 500 bar and 25° CA bTDC. Engine exhaust emissions of unburned hydrocarbon and smoke were decreased, whereas nitric oxide emission increased in B100 fuel at higher nozzle opening pressure and advanced fuel injection timing. In split injection strategy, start of main injection timing and post injection timing was varied from 19° to 25° CA bTDC and −5° CA bTDC to 5° CA aTDC respectively. The results exhibited that the B100-90%-10% has the maximum brake thermal efficiency of 34.43%. Minimum unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emissions were obtained in B100-75%-25%. Maximum nitric oxide emission was obtained in B100-90%-10%. Thus, the experimental studies clearly states that advanced injection strategy reduces the exhaust emissions and improves the engine performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass has a great potential for production of syngas and chemicals; however, it has stood in the shadow of natural gas (NG) and coal due to technical problems and issues such as tar formation. In this paper, syngas production from catalytic air–steam gasification of biomass in a fluidized bed was investigated. To enhance the yield of produced syngas and reduce its tar content by cracking, limestone, calcined dolomite, and olivine were used as catalyst. The maximum mole fraction of H2 was found to be 49.1 vol% at 1000 °C and a steam/biomass ratio (S/B) of 1.0 with dolomite present. Compared to olivine and dolomite, calcined dolomite was proved to be more effective for gas production and tar destruction. The results also showed that the particle size has a weak influence on gasifier performance, with only a slight decrease in tar content with decreasing biomass particle size. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel bifunctional bamboo charcoal-based magnetic solid base catalyst (K/BC-Fe2O3) was successfully prepared by an in-situ synthesis-impregnation-calcination method. Scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller results show that the synthesized bamboo charcoal-based magnetic catalyst possesses a mesoporous structure and high specific surface area. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that after calcination of the precursor at 500 °C, the magnetic particles were finely fixed to the carbon skeleton of the bamboo charcoal, and the iron oxide was present as γ-Fe2O3. The vibrating sample magnetometer results demonstrate that the superparamagnetic catalyst could be easily separated and recovered after reaction with the aid of an external magnetic field. The possible formation mechanism of the alkaline site (K2O species) on the catalyst surface can be summarized as a transverse activation at low temperature and a radial activation at high temperature. It was determined that the following are the optimum conditions for biodiesel production: an amount of added catalyst 2.5 wt%, a molar ratio of methanol/oil of 8:1, a reaction time of 1 h, and a reaction temperature 60 °C with a maximum yield of 98.0%. Regeneration experiments reveal that the magnetic catalyst can maintain high catalytic activity even after being reused four times. This study presents a novel bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst with potential applications in biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study was devoted to an exergetically investigation and optimization of the operating conditions of an easy-to-scale-up continuous reactor applied for solketalacetin synthesis as a green fuel additive from glycerol-derived monoacetin in the presence of Purolite PD 206 catalyst. The process consisted of two steps, i.e., monoacetin synthesis by glycerol esterification with acetic acid followed by solketalacetin synthesis through reaction of the produced monoacetin with acetone. The main goal of this research was to assess the effects of reaction temperature (20–80 °C), acetone to monoacetin molar ratio (1–5), catalyst loading (0.5–2.5 g), feed flow rate (0.2–1 mL/min), and pressure (0–120 bar) on the exergetic performance parameters of the second stage of the process. Response surface methodology (RSM) was also used to optimize the operating conditions of the reactor by maximizing functional exergetic efficiency (FEE) and minimizing normalized exergy destruction (NED), simultaneously. Overall, feed flow rate had the highest impact on the exergetic performance parameters of the reactor while these indicators were not significantly influenced by pressure. RSM successfully modeled both exergetic parameters with an R2 higher than 0.99. Reaction temperature of 30.8 °C, acetone to monoacetin molar ratio of 2.7, catalyst loading of 1.6 g, feed flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and pressure of 14.5 bar yielding FEE of 20.39% and NED of 0.90 were determined as the best operating conditions of the reactor. According to the results archived, process yield alone could not stand as the primary objective for making decisions on the optimal operating conditions of the chemical reactors, further highlighting the significance of taking energetic parameters into account in parallel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the combined effect of alumina nanoparticles into the Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel blend and exhaust gas recirculation on the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a diesel engine was investigated. The alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles with the mass fraction of 40 ppm were dispersed into the C. inophyllum biodiesel blend (20% of C. inophyllum biodiesel + 80% of diesel (CIB20)) by the ultrasonication process. Further, the exhaust gas recirculation was adopted to control the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions of a diesel engine. The experiments were conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine with the diesel, CIB20, 20% of C. inophyllum biodiesel + 80% of diesel + 40 ppm Al2O3 nanoparticles (CIB20ANP40), CIB20 + 20% exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and CIB20ANP40 + 20% EGR fuel samples at different load conditions. The results reveal that brake thermal efficiency of CIB20ANP40 fuel increased by 5.04 and 7.71% compared to the CIB20 and CIB20ANP40 + 20% EGR fuels, respectively. The addition of alumina nanoparticles to the CIB20 fuel, CO, and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were was reduced compared to the CIB20 fuel. The smoke opacity was decreased with the addition of alumina nanoparticles to the CIB20 fuel by 7.3% compared to the CIB20 fuel. The NOx emissions for the CIB20ANP40 + 20% EGR fuel was decreased by 36.84, 31.53, and 17.67% compared to the CIB20, CIB20ANP40, and CIB20 + 20% EGR fuel samples at full load condition. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present study, the production of sweet potato bioethanol was conducted at a small industrial plant in Brazil and integrated in biodiesel production through ethanolysis. The specific objectives were: (i) monitor bioethanol production at a small industrial plant, considering production yield; (ii) study the ethanolysis of sunflower oil using sweet potato bioethanol with different grades (98, 99 and 99.4 °GL), with focus on biodiesel yield and purity. Bioethanol was produced under the following conditions: Sweet potato dilution in water (1:1 in wt.%); enzymatic hydrolysis with alpha-amylase (90 °C) and glucoamylase (60 °C) enzymes (700 mL/t); and, fermentation (30 °C) with saccharomyces cerevisiae (3.3 kg/t). Ethanolysis was performed as follows: 6:1 ethanol:oil molar ratio; 1.0 wt% NaOH; 45 °C; 1 h. The average yield of bioethanol was 161.4 L/t, corresponding to 10 598 L/ha. Biodiesel synthesis using bioethanol of different grades showed that both the yield and purity of the product increased with the grade of the ethanol used, with values ranging from 63 to 83 wt%, and 50 to 94 wt% for yield and purity, respectively. Results show that a high alcohol grade is required to make viable integrated production of biodiesel and bioethanol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of phytohormones in microalgal biofuel production is gaining interest due to their substantial effect on biomass and lipid enrichment under standard and nitrogen-limited conditions. In the present study, the collaborative effect of combination of selected phytohormones viz. zeatin (Z), indole acetic acid (IAA), and gibberellic acid (GA) was studied to optimize biomass and lipid production in microalga Acutodesmus obliquus under nitrogen-limitation using response surface methodology (RSM). Significantly higher biomass and lipid productivity was obtained with the supplementation of combination of Z (0.5 mg L−1), IAA (1.0 mg L−1), and GA (5.0 mg L−1) under nitrogen-limitation with 49.07% and 77.20% increase respectively as compared to optimized nitrogen control (ON). Zeatin was found to be the most significantly influencing phytohormone followed by GA in RSM data analysis. Present study elucidated the synergistic effect of combination of exogenous phytohormones in enhancing biomass and lipid productivity under nitrogen-limitation for microalgal biofuel production. © 2018

AB  - A lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis unit with the feeding rate of 100–500 g h−1 was designed and manufactured with a fluidized bed reactor. The effects of reaction temperature, catalyst weight and catalyst position on the properties of pyrolysis products were investigated. Subsequently, the mechanism of biomass pyrolysis was studied through Py-GC/MS analysis. The optimal pyrolysis temperature for a higher yield and quality of bio-oil was 500 °C. The highest bio-oil yield was 46.9 wt% with biochar, and non-condensable gas yields of 30.0 wt% and 23.1 wt%, respectively at 500 °C. The minimum value of the water content of bio-oil samples was 13.39 ± 0.22% under 500 °C. The catalyst can significantly increase the water content of bio-oil and reduce the ash content, HHV, solid content and viscosity of bio-oil. In the process of biomass fast pyrolysis, the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were pyrolyzed to monomers. Then some chemicals were produced from these monomers through a series of reactions: isomerization reaction, dehydration reaction, retro-aldol reaction, esterification, carbonyl reaction and so on. In catalytic pyrolysis, the active site of catalyst acts as deoxidizer. Hydrocarbon radicals’ pool was formed through monomers thermal cracking. Then some relatively stable chemicals were formed through reactions among those radicals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of microalgae to bio-oil by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is considered an effective method to obtain environmentally friendly energy. However, the heteroatomic organic species, mainly nitrogen and oxygen-containing chemicals, in bio-oil hamper its practical utilization. A low-temperature liquefaction pretreatment process (150–225 °C, 10–50 min) was performed to improve the quality of bio-oil from low-lipid microalgae. After the pretreatment, 11–61% of the nitrogen content was removed from the microalgae. Then, the algae were converted via HTL at 340 °C for 120 min into bio-oil with lower heteroatom content and higher conversion yield compared to those obtained by direct HTL. Specifically, when algae were pretreated at 225 °C for 10–50 min, the yield and higher heating value of the bio-oil reached 26.5–34.3 wt% and 34.9–37.1 MJ/kg, respectively, while the nitrogen and oxygen contents were reduced by 37% and 36%, respectively. Furthermore, GC–MS, FT-IR and elemental analyses revealed that the bio-oil derived from pretreated algae contained a lower level of N-containing compounds and that the content of desired long-chain hydrocarbons had increased to 30%. These findings demonstrate that great improvements in the quality of bio-oil can be achieved by pretreatment of the algae. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We investigated the feasibility of bioethanol production from hydrolysate of green seaweed Ulva rigida. The pretreatment of the green macroalgae was optimized using thermal acid hydrolysis to obtain a high reducing sugars yield. The dry seaweed biomass, (5 to 15% w/v) was hydrolyzed with two different acid catalysts, H2SO4 and HCl at a concentration of 0 to 10.0% (v/v). The hydrolysis times ranging from 30 to 60 min were investigated when the mixture was autoclaved. A condition of 4% (v/v) sulfuric acid, 10% (w/v) biomass loading and 1 h of incubation time was optimum to obtain maximum total fermentable reducing sugar concentration of 34 ± 0.25 mg/ml and 0.50 ± 0.02 mg/ml of phenolic compounds. Fermentation of the hydrolysate using adapted and non-adapted Pachysolen tannophilus produced 0.12 g/g and 0.09 g/g (ethanol to dry seaweed), respectively. These preliminaries results indicate a potential use of the macroalgae U. rigida for bioethanol production. © 2017 South African Association of Botanists

AB  - A series of Ni/CeO2 catalysts were synthesized via a simple one-pot hydrothermal method and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, EDX mapping, Raman, H2-TPR, BET, XPS, TGA and ICP-MS. Their catalytic performances were systematically evaluated in hydroliquefaction of rice straw. The impact of reaction temperature, reaction time, H2 pressure and Ni/Ce molar ratios on product yields and distribution was also investigated. The conversion (89.08%) of rice straw and bio-oil yield (66.7%) obtained over Ni/CeO2 catalyst with a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 2/10 are superior to those over no catalyst (conversion of 73.65%, bio-oil yield of 47.96%) and pure CeO2 catalyst (conversion of 77.79%, bio-oil yield of 56.67%) under the optimum condition (290 °C, 1.0 h, and 2.0 MPa H2 pressure). GC–MS results show that the main components of bio-oil are phenols, which are high-value-added, important and useful chemicals in transportation and chemical industries. It is worth noting that the highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles and their stronger interaction between Ni and CeO2 with more oxygen vacancies facilitate high conversion of rice straw and bio-oil yield. In addition, a possible catalytic mechanism of Ni/CeO2 catalyst for hydrogenation of rice straw is accordingly proposed. This work thus offers an effective approach to improve the conversion of rice straw and bio-oil yield over Ni/CeO2 catalysts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The SCG water content has a positive effect on the DCE hydrolysis up to 60 wt% due to the bimolecular substitution mechanism. The hydrolysis gives an acidic environment favorable for cellulose decomposition, SCG particle size reduction and lipid conversion. The optimal fatty acid ethyl ester yield was 11.8 wt% based on the mass of dried SCG with 3.36 ml ethanol and 3.16 ml DCE at 196.8 °C through the response surface methodology. Using the solvo-thermal effect, direct utilization of wet SCG as a biodiesel feedstock provides not only economic feasibility without using drying process and additional acid catalyst but also environmental advantage of recycling the municipal waste. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, rubber seed oil (RSO) has been considered as a promising potential oil source for biodiesel production. However, RSO is a non-edible feedstock with a significant high free fatty acid (FFA) content which has an adverse impact on the process of biodiesel production. In this study, ultrasonic-assisted esterification process was conducted as a pre-treatment step to reduce the high FFA content of RSO from 40.14% to 0.75%. Response surface methodology (RSM) using central composite design (CCD) was applied to the design of experiments (DOE) and the optimization of esterification process. The result showed that methanol to oil molar ratio was the most influential factor for FFA reduction whereas the effect of amount of catalyst and the reaction were both insignificant. The kinetic study revealed that the activation energy and the frequency factor of the process are 52.577 kJ/mol and 3.53 × 108 min−1, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis of bamboo sawdust was conducted by a tandem bubbling fluidized bed/fixed bed reactor. Effect of pyrolysis and catalyst temperatures on product yield was studied. In addition, synergistic effect of HZSM-5 and base catalysts (including CaO, MgO, and SrO) for the promotion of aromatic hydrocarbons was revealed. Experimental results illustrated that both pyrolytic and catalytic reactor temperatures played pivotal roles in the yield of bio-oil, and the optimal pyrolysis and catalytic reactor temperatures were 550 °C and 500 °C, respectively. Ex-situ catalytic trial decreased the yield of bio-oil compared to in-situ run, while it facilitated the formation of phenol and alkylphenols. Mixed catalytic upgrading modes exhibited more significant aromatization and deoxygenation activities than sequential ones. In particular, ex-situ run using CaO mixed with HZSM-5 increased the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons to 31.34%, which was ∼11.48% higher than that derived from CaO and HZSM-5 sequentially processed mode. The dominated products in alkylphenols were cresol isomers and ethylphenols, and compared to sequential cases, mixed catalytic upgrading trials promoted the relative selectivity of phenol. Synergistic effect of base catalysts and HZSM-5 contributed to the production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and CaO mixed with HZSM-5 mode showed the most prominent synergistic effect for the enhanced relative selectivity to xylenes and toluene. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated three different types of catalysts: Ni/HMS-ZSM5, Fe/HMS-ZSM5, and Ce/HMS-ZSM5 in the thermochemical decomposition of green microalgae Spirulina (Arthrospira) plantensis. First, non-catalytic pyrolysis tests were conducted in a temperature ranges of 400–700 °C in a dual-bed pyrolysis reactor. The optimum temperature for maximized liquid yield was determined as 500 °C. Then, the influence of acid washing on bio-products upgrading was studied at the optimum temperature. Compared to the product yields from the pyrolysis of raw spirulina, a higher bio-oil yield (from 34.488 to 37.778 %wt.) and a lower bio-char yield (from 37 to 35 %wt.) were observed for pretreated spirulina, indicating that pretreatment promoted the formation of bio-oil, while it inhibited the formation of biochar from biomass pyrolysis. Finally, catalytic pyrolysis experiments of pretreated-spirulina resulted that Fe as an active phase in catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity, toward producing hydrocarbons and the highest hydrogen yield (3.81 mmol/gr spirulina). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The aim of this paper is to improve the conversion of sugarcane bagasse to pyrolytic sugar levoglucosan through its pretreatment with acetic acid (10 wt.%) at 90 °C for 10 min under 200 rpm. Then, acid treated biomass was rinsed with deionized water to a neutral pH and dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C up to constant weight. After acid treatment, the samples were subjected to fast pyrolysis in a Py-GC/MS. Thus, the impact of the acetic acid on the levoglucosan yield as well as other pyrolytic compounds released during pyrolysis process at different temperatures (from 350 to 600 °C) is reported. The best results respect to levoglucosan yield were attained when pyrolysis was performed at 400 °C resulting in around nine folds levoglucosan production from sugarcane bagasse after biomass treatment with acid compared to the control (untreated biomass samples) while the yield of some undesirable lignin derived compounds decreases in acid washed samples. The effect observed is due to the removal of the catalytic activity of alkali and alkaline earth metals. The attained results are very attractive because this pyrolytic sugar exhibits great potential as renewable feedstock for biofuels production and other bioproducts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wet Scenedesmus obliquus biomass into bio-crude was carried out. Initially, the biochemical composition of S. obliquus biomass was examined, and it indicated high protein (56.1%) followed by carbohydrate (22.3%) and lipid (11.5%) contents. The ultimate analysis unveiled the presence of high carbon (48.1%) and oxygen (36.1%) in the biomass. This study had shed light on the selection of ideal reaction conditions such as temperature (200, 250, 300 °C), pressure (100, 200, 300 bar), and residence time (30, 60 min) for producing maximum bio-crude with/without catalyst aid. In the absence of the catalyst, a bio-crude yield of 35.7% was obtained at 300 °C temperature, 200 bar pressure, and 60 min residence time. On an interesting note, bio-crude yield was increased from 35.7 to 45.1% by adding homogeneous acid catalyst CH3COOH at 300 °C reaction temperature, which was higher than the other acid catalysts HCOOH (40%), H2SO4 (38%), HCl (39%), H3BO3 (37%), and the base catalysts NaOH (38%), KOH (37%), Na2CO3 (40%), K2CO3 (36%), Ca(OH)2 (37%). Elemental analyses of bio-crudes indicated a higher heating value of 35–40 MJ/kg, carbon-74%, nitrogen-5.86%, hydrogen-10.9%, sulfur &lt;0.5 and oxygen content of 8.85%, which is comparable with petro-crude. Using CH3COOH as a catalyst in HTL led to reducing the oxygen content and simultaneously increased the higher heating value of bio-crude. In addition, GC-MS characterization of bio-crude indicated the presence of mono-aromatics, nitrogen heterocycles, phenols, indole and fatty acids. Thus, based on the yield and characteristics, the bio-crude produced from S. obliquus biomass could be used in petroleum refinery for fuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The catalytic fast pyrolysis of cellulose, cellobiose and glucose with the zeolite catalyst of NaY was carried out using thermogravimetric analyzer (TG) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Results from TG showed that all samples presented significant mass loss at low temperature and exhibited high residual chars with NaY. The activation energies of cellulose, cellobiose and glucose were significantly decreased with NaY. PY-GC/MS showed that saccharides were significantly decreased or even completely eliminated and converted into furans, aromatics, phenols and light oxygenates with NaY. The contents of furans of cellulose, cellobiose and glucose with NaY were increased from 17.48%, 18.79% and 28.77% to 46.71%, 52.11% and 67.81%, respectively. Pyrolysis of cellulose and cellobiose presented high selectivity of BTX (Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene). The furans are mainly formed on the surface of NaY by dehydration, fragmentation/retro-aldol condensation, decarbonylation, or decarboxylation. The pyrolysis intermediates of anhydro-oligosaccharides dominated the formation of aromatics and phenols during the catalytic fast pyrolysis of cellulose in the zeolite catalyst pores at the active sites. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil is considered among the most promising techniques for upgrading pyrolysis bio-oils to biofuels. However, its commercial application is challenging because of the complexity of the reaction. In particular, minimizing the hydrogen consumption in HDO is a main concern. In this study, ruthenium supported on mesoporous TiO2 (Ru/meso-TiO2) catalysts were prepared with various Fe loadings for this reaction, using anisole as a model substrate. Analytical techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy, CO chemisorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, revealed that the addition of Fe increased the number of oxygen vacancies, reaching a maximum when the Fe loading was 1 wt.%. H2 consumption can be reduced by performing HDO reaction at high temperatures. The Ru/meso-TiO2 without Fe converted anisole mainly to methoxycyclohexane, indicating that hydrogenation (HYD) is the dominant reaction pathway. The addition of Fe remarkably promotes the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst. The reaction path could be drastically changed from HYD to direct deoxygenation (DDO) by the addition of a proper amount of Fe. This change can be assigned to the synergism between Ru particles and Fe species on the surface of meso-TiO2 support. The catalyst with 1 wt.% Fe exhibited the highest conversion and benzene selectivity due to its largest number of oxygen vacancies, indicating that it utilized a minimum amount of H2. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oils require the elimination of most of the oxygen they contain to stabilize them before their use as fuels. The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process consists on eliminating oxygen from the bio-oil at high hydrogen pressures over a solid catalyst. However, catalysts often suffer from prompt deactivation due to extensive coke deposition. Therefore, searching more stable catalysts for HDO is still a challenge for biorefiners. In this work, the HDO of guaiacol as a model compound from bio-oil was carried out in a batch reactor at 523 K, pH2 = 5.5 MPa over potassium modified γ-Al2O3 supported CoMo and NiMo catalysts. Potassium was shown to be an effective activity and selectivity modifier. It led to an increase in the yields to products that may hinder catalysts coking by shifting selectivity from demethylation and methyl substitution reactions to direct CAromatic–OH bond scission and hydrogenation reactions. Changes on selectivity were accompanied by a decrease in guaiacol conversion. The effect produced by potassium was shown to be related to: a reduction in acidity, a decrease in the relative number of Mo species in octahedral coordination, and to an increase in the relative concentration of catalytically inactive NiAl2O4 and CoAl2O4 species. Results of this work contribute to design more stable HDO catalysts from a rather simple modification of conventional hydrotreatment catalysts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Waste Sedum plumbizincicola, a zinc (Zn) hyperaccumulator during phytoremediation, was recycled via a subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) reaction into multiple streams of products, including hydrochar, bio-oil, and carboxylic acids. Results show approximately 90% of Zn was released from the S. plumbizincicola biomass during HTL at an optimized temperature of 220 °C, and the release risk was mitigated via HTL reaction for hydrochar production. The low-Zn hydrochar (∼200 mg/kg compared to original plant of 1558 mg/kg) was further upgraded into porous carbon (PC) with high porosity (930 m2/g) and excellent capability of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture (3 mmol/g). The porosity, micropore structure, and graphitization degree of PCs were manipulated by the thermal recalcitrance of hydrochar. More importantly, results showed that the released Zn2+ could effectively promote the production of acetic acid via the oxidation of furfural (FF) and 5-(hydroxymethyl)-furfural (HMF). Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) with negative electrospray ionization analysis confirmed the deoxygenation and depolymerization reactions and the production of long chain fatty acids during HTL reaction of S. plumbizincicola. This work provides a new path for the recycling of waste hyperaccumulator biomass into value-added products. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass offers a series of challenges for biochemical processing into biofuels and bio-products. For the first time, we address these challenges with a biomimetic system via a mild yet rapid Fenton reaction and lignocellulose-degrading bacterial strain Cupriavidus basilensis B-8 (here after B-8) to pretreat the rice straw (RS) by mimicking the natural fungal invasion process. Here, we also elaborated the mechanism through conducting a systematic study of physicochemical changes before and after pretreatment. Results: After synergistic Fenton and B-8 pretreatment, the reducing sugar yield was increased by 15.6-56.6% over Fenton pretreatment alone and 2.7-5.2 times over untreated RS (98 mg g-1). Morphological analysis revealed that pretreatment changed the surface morphology of the RS, and the increase in roughness and hydrophilic sites enhanced lignocellulose bioavailability. Chemical components analyses showed that B-8 removed part of the lignin and hemicellulose which caused the cellulose content to increase. In addition, the important chemical modifications also occurred in lignin, 2D NMR analysis of the lignin in residues indicated that the Fenton pretreatment caused partial depolymerization of lignin mainly by cleaving the β-O-4 linkages and by demethoxylation to remove the syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G) units. B-8 could depolymerize amount of the G units by cleaving the β-5 linkages that interconnect the lignin subunits. Conclusions: A biomimetic system with a biochemical Fenton reaction and lignocellulose-degrading bacteria was confirmed to be able for the pretreatment of RS to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis under mild conditions. The high digestibility was attributed to the destruction of the lignin structure, partial hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and partial surface oxidation of the cellulose. The mechanism of synergistic Fenton and B-8 pretreatment was also explored to understand the change in the RS and the bacterial effects on enzymatic hydrolysis. Furthermore, this biomimetic system offers new insights into the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In the present work, different types of castor biodiesels were synthesized by using slow pyrolysis process of raw castor oil in the presence of different types of catalysts. These catalysts as anhydrous sodium hydroxide (NaOH), alumina (Al2O3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and molecular sieve catalyst zeolite (ZMS-5) combined with anhydrous sodium hydroxide (ZMS-5 combined with NaOH) were used for yielding these biodiesels. So, the effects of variation of the catalyst type and its concentration on both yield of castor biodiesels and the pyrolysis temperature ranges were investigated. It was noticed that through the pyrolysis process, two grades of synthesized biodiesels were obtained in the presence of different types of catalysts. The first at the start of the pyrolysis was yellowish one, termed as Castor Biodiesel Number 1 (CBD1). And the second type was brownish biodiesel, called as Castor Biodiesel Number 2 (CBD2), while the rest was the black and heaviest, termed as bio-mazot. It was found that the highest total yields of biodiesels were obtained in the presence of 1% by volume of both NaOH and ZMS-5 combined with NaOH. Thus, four biodiesels were yielded and termed as CBD1h, CBD2h, CBD1hz, CBD2hz. And the different physical properties of these four biodiesels were measured according to American Society of Testing Material (ASTM). Also, the chemical compositions of these four biodiesels were determined by using Gas Chromatography Mass (GC-Ms) spectrum as well as the functional groups using Infra-Red (IR) spectrum. In addition, the performance of a single cylinder four stroke direct injection compression ignition engine fueled by two different blends as 5 and 10% by volume of CBDh and CBDhz with gas oil was measured. Thus, the main conclusion was derived from both physical and chemical investigations as well as engine performance that these synthesized biodiesels could be used as a good alternative of gas oil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production can be the solution to the problem of how to deal with waste cooking oils (WCO) and the associated problem of environmental contamination. Every year, tonnes of WCO are poured into toilets and drains, contaminating water supplies and creating serious problems in waste water treatment plants. WCO is a waste material that can be used to produce biodiesel. The main aim of this study is to determine how the type of WCO (and how much it has been used) affect the quality of the biodiesel obtained. Four types of WCO (sunflower, maize, olive and a blend of soybean, palm and sunflower) with two different levels of degradation were used to produce biodiesel. The WCO were subjected to a transesterification process, using NaOH and methanol as reagents, reaction temperatures of between 50 and 67.5 °C, a 60 min reaction time and magnetic stirring. The quality of the biodiesel that was obtained was measured on the basis of four parameters as set out in the UNE-EN 14214 standard: density at 15 °C, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C, acid number and iodine value. This characterisation forms part of the second aim of this research, namely to determine which types of WCO can produce a quality biodiesel via a single stage transesterification process. The results show that the biodiesel quality is closely related to that of the WCO, and that the transesterification method can be recommended for WCO with densities (at 15 °C) of up to 930 kg/m3, kinematic viscosity (at 40 °C) of up to 38.46 mm2/s, and acid numbers of up to 4.19 mg KOH/g. The production method used is a simple, economic and effective way of adding value to a hazardous and difficult to manage waste material like WCO. © 2018

AB  - Grease trap waste has been considered as a cost-effective feedstock for biodiesel production due to its high lipid content and relatively low cost for collection. However, the costly pre-treatment of this contaminated resource is currently the barrier to the commercialization of biodiesel. This study analyses the economic feasibility of biodiesel production from grease trap waste collected in Adelaide (South Australia), focussing on the environmental service providers as the potential biodiesel producers. Based on the experimental results, two different production routes with the same capacity of around 4400 t/year were simulated using Aspen Plus® V8.8, these being; esterification without using acetone as a co-solvent (1); and esterification using a co-solvent of acetone-ethanol (2). The best production price of biodiesel obtained was US$1337.5/t which would indicate that grease trap waste may be a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper establishes a membraneless, co-laminar flow-based approach to develop a cost-effective microfluidic paper-based analytical device for enzymatic biofuel cell (μ PAD-EBFC). The developed μ PAD-EBFC supporting the self-capillary fluid transport action consists of Y-shaped paper microchannel with the fuel (glucose) and oxidant (O2) streaming in parallel over carbon nanotube-based bucky paper electrodes modified with biocompatible electrocatalytic enzymes, such as glucose oxidase and laccase without any additional redox cofactor. The electrochemical performance for the modified bioelectrodes, i.e., electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction reaction, was carried out using linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, and open circuit potential. The overall performance of μ PAD-EBFC was evaluated using the polarization studies. Subsequently, the catalytic activity of enzymes on the electrode surface was validated by the scanning electron microscope. This simple and portable μ PAD-EBFC can generate the maximum power density to the order of 100μ{W} /cm2 (600text{A} /cm2) at 0.505 V over prolonged durations of around 50 h. Hence, the presented μ PAD-EBFC shows good power density and stability, leading to its strong potential to power miniaturized microelectronics devices and sensors. © 2002-2011 IEEE.

AB  - In this study, the effects of reaction temperature, holding time, algae/water ratio and catalyst dosage on the yield and quality of bio-oil produced via the HTL of Spirulina were investigated. The maximum bio-oil yield (43.05 wt%) and energy recovery (ER) value (64.62%) were obtained at 260 °C for 30 min, with an algae/water ratio of 1/4 and a catalyst dosage of 5 wt%. The bio-oil samples were characterized by elemental analysis, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Fourier Transform Infrared (FI-IR), and Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). Results indicated that higher heating values (HHVs) of bio-oils were in the range of 27.28-36.01 MJ/kg, and main compounds of bio-oil were amides, esters, nitriles, hydroperoxide and alkanes. Adding of the Ni/TiO2 catalyst can decrease the contents of oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds and promote the formation of desirable components such as esters and alkanes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae can not only purify and recover the nutrients from wastewater, but also be harvested as wet biomass for the production of biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Chlorella sp. cultivated in the ultrafiltration (UF) membrane treated anaerobic digestion (AD) liquid digestate of chicken manure was used as the feedstock in this study. The present study characterized the products and investigated the elemental migration during HTL of Chlorella sp. fed with AD effluent wastewater (WW) and BG11 standard medium (ST) in 100 mL and 500 mL reactors under different operational conditions. Results showed that the highest oil yield of WW (38.1%, daf) was achieved at 320 °C, 60 min and 15% TS in 500 mL reactor, which was 14.1% higher than that of ST (33.4%, daf) at 320 °C, 30 min and 20% TS in the same reactor. WW had a similar carbon and hydrogen distribution in the four product fractions under HTL conditions compared with ST. 43.4% and 32.4% of carbon in WW11 and ST11 were released into the biocrude and aqueous phase in 500 mL reactor, respectively. As much as 64.5% of the hydrogen was transferred to the aqueous phase. GC–MS results showed that the chemical compounds in the biocrude oil from WW consist of a variety of chemical constituents, such as hydrocarbons, acids, alcohols, ketones, phenols and aldehydes. These two biocrude oils contained 17.5% wt. and 8.64% wt. hydrocarbons, and 63.7% wt. and 79.8% wt. oxygen-containing compounds, respectively. TGA results showed that 69.3%–66.7% of the biocrude oil was gasified in 30 °C–400 °C. This study demonstrates the great potential for biocrude oil production from microalgae grown in biogas effluent via HTL. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effect of coupling leaching with torrefaction pretreatment process on bio-oil production from catalytic fast pyrolysis using ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was evaluated by Py-GC/MS. During coupling leaching with torrefaction pretreatment, the fuel characteristics and structural characteristics of rice husk samples were changed, which were evaluated using proximate, ultimate, and calorific analyses, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) techniques. The experimental results of catalytic fast pyrolysis indicated that coupling leaching with torrefaction pretreatment further improved the relative contents of BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene) compounds in bio-oil compared to that of raw rice husk sample. It was mainly ascribed to the effective removal of metallic species during leaching process. In addition, the selective removal of hemicellulose fraction and the increasing lignin fraction and changes in the structure of lignin (cleavage of ether linkages and demethoxylation) during torrefaction process also plays positive roles. Severe torrefaction process resulted in the cross-linking and charring of sample, thus reducing the formation of BTX compounds. Thus, coupling leaching with middle torrefaction pretreatment process was the optimum pretreatment conditions for catalytic fast pyrolysis of rice husk samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herein, we report on a combined process that incorporates hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and supercritical water gasification (SCWG) to improve energy recovered from algal biomass. Eight algal biomasses, including four microalgae and four macroalgae with a large difference in biochemical compositions, were screened for this dual process. The algal biomass feedstocks significantly affected the carbon and energy distribution in the product fractions (crude bio-oil, solid, gas, and water-soluble products). 62.50–71.34% energy of microalgae and 6.03–41.06% energy of macroalgae could be recovered as crude bio-oil. 11.86–21.55% carbon of the microalgae and 8.01–15.82% carbon of the macroalgae was distributed in the HTL process water in form of water soluble products after the HTL process. 14.3–33.7% energy of microalgae and 30.18–36.34% energy of macroalgae was retained in the HTL process water. SCWG could convert the organics in the HTL process water into fuel gases consisting mainly of H2 and CH4. 54–91% carbon of the HTL process water was transformed into the fuel gases, which correspond 5.53–18.30% energy of the algal biomass. Thus, this work shows that the integration of HTL and SCWG could improve energy recovery from algal biomass relative to the HTL process alone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of the first step pyrolysis temperature (T1) and residence time (RT1) on the two-step pyrolysis (TSP) were investigated by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with FTIR spectrophotometer (TG-FTIR) was used to analyze the pyrolysis characteristics of corncob. T1 was classified into low temperature (T1-L: 250 °C, 300 °C and 350 °C), medium temperature (T1-M: 400 °C and 450 °C) and high temperature (T1-H: 500 °C and 550 °C). Compared with one-step pyrolysis (OSP), T1-M was the optimal condition in TSP to increase the selectivities of value-added chemicals such as acetic acid, furfural, 4-vinylphenol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and guaiacol, etc. Few acids and more hydrocarbons with content of 10.54% were acquired in the second step at T1-M, which was conducive to improving the quality of bio-oil. Different RT1 at T1-M could further increase the selectivities of specific products such as furfural at T1 of 450 °C with 10 s, toluene at T1 of 450 °C with 20 s, and acetic acid, 4-vinylphenol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and vanillin at T1 of 450 °C with 5 s, etc. Based on the results, a new polygeneration approach of TSP for efficient utilization of biomass was proposed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The behaviors of a biofuel and a fossil fuel were evaluated by different techniques, namely thermal analysis (Thermogravimetry-TG and Differential Thermal Analysis-DTA) and engine performance tests. From TG and DTA curves, two decomposition phases were identified for diesel fuel with ignition temperature (IT) at 250 °C and three phases for biodiesel fuel with IT at 300 °C. Combining conversion (α) versus temperature and a model-free kinetics method, the range of activation energies (Ea) values were determined for both diesel (from 48.5 kJ mol−1 up to 61.0 kJ mol−1) and biodiesel (from 58.6 kJ mol−1 up to 55.0 kJ mol−1) fuels. At the initial phase of combustion, diesel fuel presents lower Ea and IT than biodiesel fuel. At the final phase of combustion, an opposite behavior is observed. These results provide subsides to predict that the behavior of diesel-biodiesel blends is the best option due to the lowering of Ea along the entire combustion process. As regards the engine tests, the B20 blend showed improvements compared with diesel fuel. In average, B20 presented increases of 1.2% in power, 1.0% in torque and 1.2% in thermal efficiency. In terms of soot, B20 presented 8.9% lower emissions than diesel fuel. Although thermal analysis and engine performance tests are executed under very different conditions, the results from both techniques showed the same trend, i.e., the best option for the combustion performance is a diesel-biodiesel blend. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nowadays, finding a talented lipase with high potency in biodiesel production has been attracted to researchers. In this study, an extracellular salt tolerant, cold-active and organic solvent-stable lipase producing bacterium was isolated from oil-contaminated environments located in Kerman province (Iran) and identified as Bacillus licheniformis KM12. Lipase was purified by 36.0% recovery and molecular weight was estimated about 33 kDa by SDS–PAGE. The optimal pH and temperature for lipase activity were found to be 8.0 and 35 °C, respectively. Lipase activity was remarkably increased about 37% after 20 min incubation at 20 °C. Km value of KM12 lipase was 0.53 mM for p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) and maximum activity was detected for pNP-decanoate and glyceryl-decanoate substrates. KM12 lipase displayed significant stability in different organic solvents after 7 and 21 days of incubation, especially in polar organic solvents. Biodiesel production with 78% yields was achieved with the one-step addition of methanol at around 18 h by using Myrtus oil (as a non-edible oils feedstocks). These unique properties of KM12 lipase make it talented as a potential biocatalyst for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been considered as a promising technical route to upgrade fast pyrolysis oil to liquid transportation fuels. In this work, a series of active and inexpensive catalysts were synthesized for bio-oil HDO, i.e., activated carbon (AC)-supported nickel phosphide and cobalt phosphide catalysts, with a metal/P molar ratio varying from 5/2, 3/2, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3. For comparison, AC-support pure metal catalysts without P were also prepared. Effects of phosphorus content on HDO performance of the catalysts were investigated on a 100 mL bench-scale reactor system using a wood-derived pyrolysis oil at 300 °C and initial hydrogen pressure of 50 bar for 3 h. The results showed that the properties of the upgraded bio-oils were greatly affected by the phosphorus content in both Ni and Co catalysts. The best performance seemed to be achieved with the catalysts at a metal/P molar ratio of about 3/2. Moreover, 0.5 wt% of Ru was further added to the catalysts at a metal/P molar ratio of 3/2 and to the pure metal catalysts. The addition of a small amount of Ru was found to markedly decrease the relative molecular weight of the upgraded bio-oils, and achieved high quality bio-oil products similar to that obtained with an expensive commercially available 5 wt% Ru/C catalyst. © 2017

AB  - Sustainable process and efficient heterogeneous acid catalyst for the preparation of platform chemicals like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) from renewable source is much in demand in the context of heterogeneous catalysis. Commercially available solid acid catalyst, H-USY zeolite was modified by treating with aqueous solution of H3PO4 and H2SO4 (10-30 wt %). Modified H-USY was completely characterized by XRD, NH3-TPD, energy dispersive analysis X-ray (EDAX), FT-IR, pyridine-IR, and NMR. Its catalytic performance was evaluated for the fructose conversion to 5-HMF in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK)-water system. Modified H-USY zeolite was identified to have potential in enhancement of 5-HMF yield up to 65% from 32% (parent H-USY) with minimum formation of furfural (8%). H-USY modified with 10 wt % H3PO4 (10P-Y) was found to be the best compared to other studied catalysts, namely, H-USY modified with 20 and 30 wt % H3PO4 (20 and 30P-Y) or 10-30 wt % H2SO4 (10- to 30S-Y). Best performance of 10P-Y is associated with the optimum combination of moderate acidity (both weak as well as strong), moderate dealumination of Al from extra-framework sites as well as from framework sites of H-USY, formation of new Al-O-P bonds between framework Al and elemental monomeric phosphorus, presence of Brønsted as well as Lewis acidity, and creation of mesopores. This gives new insight on a potential heterogeneous acid catalyst for the synthesis of 5-HMF. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-MACFP) of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and waste agricultural plastic mulching films (WAPMFs) with SiC as microwave absorbent and hierarchical ZSM-5/MCM-41 as catalyst are implemented in a microwave-induced reactor. MCM-41 mesoporous structure is formed in hierarchical ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst as the outer shell layer coupled with ZSM-5 as the inside core. Experimental results show that the use of both microwave absorbent and hierarchical ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst significantly increase the carbon yield of hydrocarbons in bio-oil. The influence of co-MACFP temperature and the mass ratio of WAPMFs to DDGS (W/D ratio) on product distribution and hydrocarbon composition is investigated. The total liquid yield and total hydrocarbon carbon yield in bio-oil first increase with the augment of temperature from 500 to 650 °C, and then decrease when temperature continues to rise. Besides, a higher W/D ratio can favor bio-oil production and retard coke formation, and a significant synergy between DDGS and WAPMFs is observed during co-MACFP. Additionally, from the perspective of hydrocarbon carbon yield in bio-oil, W/D ratio of 1.0 is the best option. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The susceptibility of untreated and sulfuric-acid-pretreated aspen, birch, and spruce to analytical enzymatic saccharification was studied in relation to their chemical composition and physical-structural features. The analytical data collected covered the mass fractions of lignin, carbohydrates, and extractives, the release of acetic acid, formic acid, and uronic acids by acid and alkaline hydrolysis, crystallinity and crystallite size, syringyl: guaiacyl (S:G) ratio of lignin, cellulose accessibility, FTIR spectra, images from SEM and fluorescence microscopy, and susceptibility to enzymatic saccharification using enzyme mixtures with and without supplementary xylanase.In the absence of pretreatment the mass fraction yield of Glc on the original dry wood in the analytical enzymatic saccharification increased in the order birch (16 g kg−1) &lt; spruce (35 g kg−1) &lt; aspen (150 g kg−1). After acid pretreatment, the order changed to spruce (170 g kg−1) &lt; aspen (290 g kg−1), birch (290 g kg−1). The relatively high recalcitrance of untreated birch was not possible to relate to mass fraction of lignin, S:G ratio, cellulose crystallinity, or mass fraction of acetyl, but rather to structural features, such as a more compact surface structure with high density and low cellulose accessibility. The relatively high sugar yields from both untreated and pretreated aspen suggest that aspen wood is well suited as feedstock for production of liquid biofuels and green chemicals in forest-based biorefineries. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the sustainability of producing synthetic fuels from biomass using thermochemical processing and different upgrading pathways. Life cycle assessment (LCA) models consisting of biomass collection, transportation, pre-treatment, pyrolysis and upgrading stages were developed. To reveal the environmental impacts associated with greater post-processing to achieve higher quality fuels, six different bio-oil upgrading scenarios were analysed and included esterification, ketonisation, hydrotreating and hydrocracking. Furthermore, to take into account the possible ranges in LCA inventory data, expected, optimistic and pessimistic values for producing and upgrading pyrolysis oils were evaluated. We found that the expected carbon dioxide equivalent emissions could be as high as 6000 gCO2e/kg of upgraded fuel, which is greater than the emissions arising from the use of diesel fuel. Other environmental impacts occurring from the fuel production process are outlined, such as resource depletion, acidification and eutrophication. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Generation 4 PAMAM-OH dendrimers were employed as templating agent for the synthesis of dendrimer-encapsulated Ru and Pt nanoparticles (Ru- or Pt-DENs). These DEN catalysts were then immobilized onto preformed mesoporous support materials (TiO2 and SiO2) using wet-impregnation method to produce heterogeneous catalysts. Ru- and Pt-DENs were characterized prior to immobilization using UV–vis (UV-vis) spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM). The average particle sizes for Ru- and Pt-DENs were determined to be 1.4 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.3 nm, respectively. Supported solid catalysts were characterized using various techniques such N2 adsorption-desorption physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and HRTEM. Inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used for the determination of metal loading on the support. The catalytic performance of these catalysts was investigated in the selective hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) to produce γ-valerolactone (GVL). The highest conversion was observed when unsupported catalysts (Ru-DENs and Pt-DENs) were used for all systems studied. The Ru catalyst displayed excellent activity as compared to Pt catalysts. All catalysts showed selectivity to γ-valerolactone up to 100%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A process where power and biomass are converted to Fischer-Tropsch liquid fuels (PBtL) is compared to a conventional Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL) process concept. Based on detailed process models, it is demonstrated that the carbon efficiency of a conventional Biomass to Liquid process can be increased from 38 to more than 90% by adding hydrogen from renewable energy sources. This means that the amount of fuel can be increased by a factor of 2.4 with the same amount of biomass. Electrical power is applied to split water/steam at high temperature over solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC). This technology is selected because part of the required energy can be replaced by available heat. The required electrical power for the extra production is estimated to be 11.6 kWh per liter syncrude (C5+). By operating the SOEC iso-thermally close to 850 °C the electric energy may be reduced to 9.5 kWh per liter, which is close to the energy density of jet fuel. A techno-economic analysis is performed where the total investments and operating costs are compared for the BtL and PBtL. With an electrical power price of 0.05 $/kWh and with SOEC investment cost of the 1000 $/kW(el), the levelized cost of producing advanced biofuel with the PBtL concept is 1.7 $/liter, which is approximately 30% lower than for the conventional BtL. Converting excess renewable electric power to advanced biofuel in a PBtL plant is a sensible way of storing energy as a fuel with a relatively high energy density. © 2018

AB  - Hydrogenases with Ni- and/or Fe-based active sites are highly active hydrogen oxidation catalysts with activities similar to those of noble metal catalysts. However, the activity is connected to a sensitivity towards high-potential deactivation and oxygen damage. Here we report a fully protected polymer multilayer/hydrogenase-based bioanode in which the sensitive hydrogen oxidation catalyst is protected from high-potential deactivation and from oxygen damage by using a polymer multilayer architecture. The active catalyst is embedded in a low-potential polymer (protection from high-potential deactivation) and covered with a polymer-supported bienzymatic oxygen removal system. In contrast to previously reported polymer-based protection systems, the proposed strategy fully decouples the hydrogenase reaction form the protection process. Incorporation of the bioanode into a hydrogen/glucose biofuel cell provides a benchmark open circuit voltage of 1.15 V and power densities of up to 530 µW cm−2 at 0.85 V. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Physical adsorption preserving activity and support reusability was used to directly bond lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus on citric acid (CA) modified Fe3O4/Au magnetic nanoparticles. A new faster approach has been used for CA ligand exchange, which ensures an high payload of stable enzyme. The immobilized lipase was tested for the biodiesel production from spent coffee ground in a solvent free system. It retains, after 60 days, more than 90% of its initial activity. Biodiesel yield of 51.7%, after 3 h of synthesis, which increases up to ∼100% after 24 h indicating an enzymatic fast kinetic, was measured. No significant decrease, during the first three cycles of use, of the lipase activity occurs. The biodiesel presents an ester content of 98.4 ± 0.23 in agreement with the EN14214. The iodine value of 76.67 (g iodine/100 g) is in agreement with the European standard. © 2018

AB  - This paper examines alternative strategies for eliminating the use of oil for passenger transportation in light duty vehicles (LDVs: cars, SUVs and light trucks) by 2060, namely, deep reductions in the energy intensity (MJ/vkm) of LDVs combined with a shift to hybrid and/or all-electric vehicles, or combined with a shift of the residual fuel requirements to C-free fuels (either renewable biofuels or hydrogen produced from C-free energy sources, and used in a fuel cell). Different combinations of these measures have dramatically different implications concerning land area requirements (for biofuels), additional electricity requirements (for electric vehicles or to produce hydrogen electrolytically), and in the demand for potentially limiting metals (Pt, Ru, Li and Nd in particular). Recent estimates of battery, fuel cell and motor sizes in advanced vehicles, and corresponding material loadings, are combined with scenarios for the growth of the global vehicle fleet and recycling potential to estimate future material requirements. For any of the alternative to fossil fuels to be sustainable over the next century, it is essential that LDV energy intensity be pushed to the lowest technically achievable potential, that significant reductions in precious metal loadings be achieved, and that 90% or better recycling efficiency be achieved. Even then, longer term sustainability is not guaranteed, which implies that the primary emphasis in urban development and redevelopment over the next century should be to create cities with little to no dependence on the private automobile for transportation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using waste cooking oil for biofuel production is potentially beneficial to food safety and energy supply. However, the lack of waste cooking oil as a feedstock for biofuel production is one of the main reasons mentioned by the biofuel industry for the illegal reprocessing of cooking oil for secondary use. Thus, it is necessary to acquire information and knowledge about how to inspire restaurants to submit their wasted cooking oil to formal collectors such as biofuel manufacturers, rather than to informal channels. We carry out random sampling surveys on restaurants in Beijing's urban districts through internet questionnaires and face-to-face investigations to explore the behaviours, awareness, and willingness of restaurants to submit their waste cooking oil for biofuel production. The results show that the total quantity of waste cooking oil generated by restaurants is 90.14 thousand tonnes in 2016. Additionally, 24% of restaurants do not submit waste cooking oil to formal collectors, and approximately 21.63 thousand tonnes of waste cooking oil is unaccounted for. We find that mandatory regulations and economic incentives are the dominant factors that affect restaurants’ disposal decisions. With a subsidy value of 4 yuan RMB/kg, all the restaurants are willing to submit waste cooking oil to formal collectors. Governmental departments should also consider building economic incentives, enhancing the mandatory regulation, designing different methods to manage different types of restaurants, and strengthening supervision and education to ensure the safe disposal of waste cooking oil and promote its use for biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The steam reforming of pyrolysis bio-oil is one proposed route to low carbon hydrogen production, which may be enhanced by combination with advanced steam reforming techniques. The advanced reforming of bio-oil is investigated via a thermodynamic analysis based on the minimisation of Gibbs Energy. Conventional steam reforming (C-SR) is assessed alongside sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SE-SR), chemical looping steam reforming (CLSR) and sorption-enhanced chemical looping steam reforming (SE-CLSR). The selected CO2 sorbent is CaO(s) and oxygen transfer material (OTM) is Ni/NiO. PEFB bio-oil is modelled as a surrogate mixture and two common model compounds, acetic acid and furfural, are also considered. A process comparison highlights the advantages of sorption-enhancement and chemical looping, including improved purity and yield, and reductions in carbon deposition and process net energy balance. The operating regime of SE-CLSR is evaluated in order to assess the impact of S/C ratio, NiO/C ratio, CaO/C ratio and temperature. Autothermal operation can be achieved for S/C ratios between 1 and 3. In autothermal operation at 30 bar, S/C ratio of 2 gives a yield of 11.8 wt%, and hydrogen purity of 96.9 mol%. Alternatively, if autothermal operation is not a priority, the yield can be improved by reducing the quantity of OTM. The thermodynamic analysis highlights the role of advanced reforming techniques in enhancing the potential of bio-oil as a source of hydrogen. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In this study, a novel modified nickel/H-beta (Ni/DeAl-beta) catalyst, which has active acidic sites and hydrogen binding sites, was prepared and used to produce liquefied fuel from lignin. The bifunctional Ni/DeAl-beta catalyst efficiently converted kraft lignin into liquefied fuel due to the synergistic effect of aluminum Lewis acid sites and nickel hydrogen binding sites. At a nickel content of 0.6 mmol/gzeolite, the Ni/DeAl-beta catalyst gave a high liquid product yield of 88.6% at 300 °C for 36 h. Most of the liquid product was dissolved in petroleum ether (73% of 88.6%), which was mainly composed of monomeric and dimeric degradation products. Under these conditions, the higher heating values (HHV) increased from 24.9 MJ/kg for kraft lignin to 32.0 MJ/kg for the liquid product. These results demonstrated the bifunctional Ni/DeAl-beta catalyst could be an efficient catalyst for lignin to liquefied fuel conversion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae cultivation in wastewaters has been identified as the solution for economical microalgae cultivation. This study investigated the feasibility of using POME for Chlorella sp. cultivation to yield biomass and lipids, as it generates massively in Malaysia which ranked world palm oil exporter. The optimal POME concentration and pretreatment strategy were applied to promote biomass and lipid productivities. Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 attained maximal of 11.21% of lipid content with 2.12 g L−1 of biomass concentration when cultivation in acid-heat pretreated 30% (v/v) POME. This provides relatively higher yield than those reported values on POME. Pretreatment was found effective to enhance biomass productions, as it converts lignin in POME into reducing sugars to serve as the supplement. The pollutants removal efficiencies were 62.07% for TN, 47.09% for COD, and 30.77% for TP. This contributes towards greater feasibility in microalgae cultivation for biofuel productions and as well towards environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Globally, as societies urbanize and demand for energy increases, the need to manage mounting quantities of municipal solid waste (MSW), produce renewable energy, and insure clean water supplies becomes more pressing each year. These issues could be addressed by integrating pyrolysis of MSW to recover liquid and gaseous biofuels and a solid biochar, with CO2 activation of the latter to produce activated biochars for water treatment. This potential conversion pathway is experimentally demonstrated by pyrolyzing a model MSW stream at 408 °C, the peak mass loss rate pyrolysis temperature and compared to pyrolysis at 900 °C. As pyrolysis temperature increases, we see conversion of plastic intermediaries into paraffins and polycyclic aromatic compounds, though the desirable gas components (methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide) of the pyrolysis gas increase substantially. The CO2 activated biochars (activated at 600 °C and 900 °C) show surface areas over 300 m2/g, with the lower pyrolysis temperature and higher activation temperature yielding the highest areas. Adsorption experiments were performed with methylene blue to determine the ability of the activated MSW-biochar to remove organic pollutants from water. Adsorption is well described by the Langmuir isotherm, with equilibrium adsorption capacities upwards of 250 mgdye/g for all activated biochars. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effect of different mixed solvents (methanol–water (MeOH–H2O), n-hexane–water (HEX–H2O)) on liquefaction of municipal wet sewage sludge (WSS) was investigated in this study. The highest bio-oil yield of 46.5 wt% was achieved in MeOH–H2O, of which ester content was 38.1% and methyl ester comprised 37.4%. The lowest solid residue yield of 10.3 wt% was achieved in HEX–H2O. The highest fatty acid compounds content was 54.9% of bio-oil obtained in HEX–H2O, of which were in saturated state. The highest calorific value and the lowest oxygen content of bio-oil were achieved in HEX–H2O: 36.45 ± 0.38 MJ/kg and 7.65 ± 0.26 wt%, respectively. The thermal stability of solid residue was enhanced in HEX–H2O. The formation of esters was promoted in MeOH–H2O, whereas aliphatic compounds could be efficiently extracted in HEX–H2O. © 2018

AB  - Currently, biomass transformation to produce high value-added chemicals and liquid biofuels is attracting more and more interest by the virtue of its importance in the sustainable development of human society. Herein, we reported the conversion of furfural (FFA) into cyclopentanone (CPO) in water over high performing and stable Cu/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by our developed one-pot reduction-oxidation method. It was demonstrated that surface structures and catalytic performances of catalysts could be delicately adjusted by varying the calcination temperatures for catalyst precursors. Especially, an appropriate calcination temperature of 500 °C could significantly enhance the interactions between surface Cu species and the ZrO2 support, thus greatly facilitating the formation of Cu+-O-Zr-like structure at the metal-support interface, and the resulting Cu/ZrO2 catalyst showed a superior catalytic performance with a high CPO yield of 91.3% under mild reaction conditions (i.e. a low hydrogen pressure of 1.5 MPa and 150 °C) to other metal oxides supported copper catalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation. It was revealed that in addition to surface acidic sites, surface Cu+/(Cu°+Cu+) ratio also played a key role in promoting the formation of CPO in the present Cu/ZrO2 catalytic system. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalysts based on Ni supported on alumina were studied for steam reforming (SR) of a synthetic bio-oil/bio-glycerol mixture and a real bio-oil. Catalyst tests were carried out in a continuous fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure and steam to carbon (S/C) ratio of 5.0. In the case of experiments with the bio-oil/bio-glycerol mixture the initial temperature was 1073 K, then it was successively changed to 973 K and 1073 K again to assess catalyst deactivation. Experiments with the bio-oil sample were run at 1073 K. First, the effect of modifications to the alumina support with CeO2 and La2O3 was studied in monometallic catalysts. Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 was identified as the catalyst more resistant to deactivation, likely due to its higher oxygen mobility, and selected for further tests. Then, bimetallic catalysts were produced by impregnation of noble metals (Pd, Pt or Rh) on the Ni catalyst supported on CeO2–Al2O3. Co-impregnation of Rh and Ni on the CeO2–Al2O3 support represented a further improvement in the catalytic activity and stability respect to the monometallic catalyst, leading to stable gas compositions close to thermodynamic equilibrium due to the favourable Rh–Ni interactions. Rh–Ni/CeO2–Al2O3 is therefore a promising catalyst to produce a hydrogen-rich gas from bio-oil SR. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This paper aims to analyse the characteristics and properties of the fractions obtained from slow pyrolysis of non-edible seed cake of Calophyllum inophyllum (CI). The gas, bio-oil and biochar obtained from the pyrolysis carried out at 500 °C in a fixed bed batch type reactor at a heating rate of 30 °C/min were characterized by various analytical techniques. Owing to the high volatile content of CI biomass (72.61%), it was selected as the raw material in this present investigation. GC-MS and FT-IR analysis of bio-oil showed the presence of higher amount of oxygenated compounds, phenol derivatives, esters, acid and furans. The physicochemical properties of the bio-oil were tested as per ASTM norms which imply that bio-oil is a highly viscous liquid with lower heating value as compared to that of diesel fuel. The chemical composition of evolved gas was analysed by using GC testing which revealed the presence of combustible components. The FT-IR characterization of biochar showed the presence of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons whereas the elevated amount of carbon in biochar indicates its potential to be used as solid fuel. The performance and emission characteristics of CI engine were assessed with different CI bio-oil blends and compared with baseline diesel fuel. The results showed that addition of bio-oil leads to decreased brake thermal efficiency and increased brake specific energy consumption. Meanwhile, increase in blend ratio reduces harmful pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and smoke in the exhaust. From the engine testing, it is suggested to employ 20% of CI bio-oil blends in CI engine to obtain better operation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The cost of biodiesel production as a renewable source is always an obstacle in industry. In order to overcome this problem, another renewable source, solar collector was used to investigate and optimize the transesterification reaction of rapeseed oil for methyl ester production. Three main factors, which include catalyst (NaOH) concentration, reaction temperature and time, were varied according to a central composite design. The yield of methyl ester as the first response was determined by using NMR method. The second response was the commercial cost of production. In order to reduce fossil energy consumption for electric power as a main part of cost, the solar collector was used to provide heat. The results based on response surface method showed that the best conditions for producing biodiesel in the constant molar ratio of 1:6 oil:methanol were the temperature of 60 °C, NaOH concentration of 0.3% wt/wt and reaction time of 60 min. In these optimum conditions, the yield of methyl ester and the cost of production for one-liter biodiesel were 78.6% and 0.706$, respectively. Also, some chemical and physical properties of biodiesel were compared with those of petro-diesel fuel and biodiesel production without solar collector has been done for achieving price differences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of cellulose from renewable biomass into the key platform chemical, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), is of fundamental importance to the production of numerous bioproducts and biofuels. Various acidic catalysts have been developed for this process; however, most systems suffer from low efficiency and poor sustainability. Here, we report an acid-free conversion of cellulose into HMF in a biphasic system of tetrahydrofuran/concentrated seawater. The yield of HMF reached 48.6%, and this system has excellent reusability and sustainability. We found that the chloridions (Cl-) can promote the isomerization of glucose via a 1,2-hydride shift path and accelerate the dehydration of fructose, thus driving the selective formation of HMF. This simple system is capable of converting raw biomass to furfural and HMF with the lignin residues transformed into useful alkanes via a sequential catalytic upgrading, paving a new economic-viable pathway for the full valorization of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: 2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BDO) is a synthetic chemical compound that also can be produced by biomass fermentation, which is gaining share in the global market as an intermediate product for numerous applications, i.e. as liquid fuel or fuel additive. Several metabolic engineering fermentation strategies to enhance the production of 2,3-BDO were developed. However, the recovery of 2,3-BDO from its fermentation broth remains a challenge due to its low concentration and its solubility in water and other components. Thus, a cost-effective recovery process is required to deliver the required purity of 2,3-BDO. This paper presents a new process development and techno-economic analysis for 2,3-BDO purification from a fermentation broth. Results: Conventional distillation and hybrid extraction-distillation (HED) processes are proposed in this study with detailed optimization and economic analysis. Particularly, a systematic solvent selection method was successfully implemented to determine a good solvent for the proposed HED configuration based on numerous experimental data obtained with each solvent candidate. NRTL and UNIQUAC property methods were evaluated to obtain binary interaction parameters of 2,3-BDO through rigorous Aspen Plus regression and validated using experimental data. Total annual cost (TAC)-based optimization was performed for each proposed configuration. Even though the HED configuration required 9.5% higher capital cost than conventional distillation, placing an extraction column before the distillation column was effective in removing water from the fermentation broth and significantly improved the overall process economics. Conclusions: Oleyl alcohol was found to be the most suitable solvent for the HED of 2,3-BDO due to its high distribution coefficient and high selectivity. The proposed HED drastically reduced reboiler duty consumption and TAC by up to 54.8 and 25.8%, respectively. The proposed design is expected to be used for the commercial scale of 2,3-BDO production from fermentation process. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel is seen as an alternative fuel to diesel fuel due to its many advantages such as higher density, cetane number and flash point. Although several methods are available for estimating fuel properties of biodiesel-diesel fuel blends, there is still the lack of works on the comparison of regression models and artificial neural networks (ANN) in predicting viscosities of the blends. Therefore, in this work, (1) optimum reaction parameters providing the lowest viscosity were determined for methanolysis of waste cooking oil, (2) waste cooking oil methyl ester was synthesized based on the determined optimum parameters, and it was mixed with diesel fuel on different volume ratios (3) viscosity measurements of the prepared blends were made at the temperature ranges between 273.15 K and 373.15 K, (4) changes in viscosity versus temperature and biodiesel fraction in blend were investigated and the rational model was proposed, finally (5) the predictive capability of rational model was compared to the three-term Vogel model, Bingham model and ANN by fitting to viscosity data measured by the authors and by Geacai et al. According to results, the measured values by the authors and Geacai et al. are the most accurately predicted by the rational model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the development of biofuel cells great effort is dedicated to achieving outstanding figures of merit, such as high stability, maximum power output, and a large open circuit voltage. Biofuel cells with immobilized redox mediators, such as redox polymers with integrated enzymes, show experimentally a substantially higher open circuit voltage than the thermodynamically expected value. Although this phenomenon is widely reported in the literature, there is no comprehensive understanding of the potential shift, the high open circuit voltages have not been discussed in detail, and hence they are only accepted as an inherent property of the investigated systems. We demonstrate that this effect is the result of a Nernstian shift of the electrode potential when catalytic conversion takes place in the absence or at very low current flow. Experimental evidence confirms that the immobilization of redox centers on the electrode surface results in the assembled biofuel cell delivering a higher power output because of charge storage upon catalytic conversion. Our findings have direct implications for the design and evaluation of (bio)fuel cells with pseudocapacitive elements. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The present research work deals with the bio-waste valorisation approach for the catalyst development and then its use in the low cost biodiesel production. The sulfonated carbon catalyst, a solid acid is prepared from waste orange peels (WOP) through carbonization followed by sulfonation treatment. WOP is one of the bio-wastes of food industries. The developed catalyst was characterized using elemental, spectral and thermal analysis. Surface area and pore volume is measured using Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The synthesized catalyst exhibits 44 m2/g surface area and 1.57 mmol/g acid density. To demonstrate the catalytic performance, the sulfonated carbon catalyst was used to esterify corn acid oil (CAO), a low cost feed stock containing 127.21 mg KOH/g acid value, to generate cost effective biodiesel. 91.68% biodiesel conversion is obtained under optimized conditions using Box-Behnken Design (BBD). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This manuscript presents the impact of addition of antioxidant additives to rice bran biodiesel blend on the performance and emission characteristics of compression ignition (C.I) engine. Rice bran methyl ester (RBME) was produced from rice bran oil by transesterification using sodium hydroxide as catalyst. An experimental investigation was conducted on a single-cylinder four-stroke C.I engine to analyze the performance and emission characteristics of rice bran methyl ester (RBME) blended with diesel at 20% by volume (B20) with and without addition of 1000 ppm of two monophenolic antioxidant additives, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The results showed that the BHA- and BHT-treated B20 blend decreased the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 2.1 and 1.2% and increased the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 1.04 and 0.5% compared to B20. The BHA- and BHT-treated B20 blend produced mean reductions in NOx emission of 12.2 and 9.6%, respectively, compared to B20. The carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of BHA- and BHT-treated B20 were increased by 14.8–16.6% and 10.6–11.2%, respectively, compared to B20. However the emission levels were lower than those of diesel. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Upgrading of bio-oil through catalytic hydrotreating was investigated with guaiacol as a model compound. A nickel supported on red mud (Ni/RM) hydrotreating catalyst was developed and compared to the standard Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts under similar experimental conditions. The Ni/RM catalyst was characterized by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET specific surface area, and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The effects of reaction temperature (300, 350, 400 °C) and initial hydrogen pressure (4.83 MPa (700 psi), 5.52 MPa (800 psi), and 6.21 MPa (900 psi)) on products distribution were investigated. The major products of hydrotreating process were catechol, anisole, phenol, cyclohexane, hexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene. Increasing the reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure improved HDO reactions. Complete HDO was achieved at reaction temperature of 400 °C and initial hydrogen pressure of 6.21 MPa (900 psi). Under these conditions, the selectivity to cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene over Ni/RM catalyst were 38.8, 24.5, 18.1, and 7.9% respectively, whereas these values were 62.2, 15.9, 8.4, and 4.5% respectively over Ni/SiO2-Al2O3. Reaction network and the kinetics of guaiacol HDO were proposed according to analysis of the products. The Ni/RM catalyst was more effective for deoxygenation reactions than hydrogenation while commercial Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 was more effective for hydrogenation than deoxygenation. Thus, hydrogen consumption per gram of bio-oil was lower for the Ni/RM catalyst compared to the Ni/SiO2-Al2O3. There was less hydrocracking and coke formation for the Ni/RM compared to the commercial catalyst and this resulted in higher liquid yield for the new catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The contribution of diesel exhaust to atmospheric pollution is a major concern for public health, especially in terms of occurrence of lung cancers. The present study aimed at addressing the toxic effects of a repeated exposure to these emissions in an animal study performed under strictly controlled conditions. Rats were repeatedly exposed to the exhaust of diesel engine. Parameters such as the presence of a particle filter or the use of gasoil containing rapeseed methyl ester were investigated. Various biological parameters were monitored in the lungs to assess the toxic and genotoxic effects of the exposure. First, a transcriptomic analysis showed that some pathways related to DNA repair and cell cycle were affected to a limited extent by diesel but even less by biodiesel. In agreement with occurrence of a limited genotoxic stress in the lungs of diesel-exposed animals, small induction of γ-H2AX and acrolein adducts was observed but not of bulky adducts and 8-oxodGuo. Unexpected results were obtained in the study of the effect of the particle filter. Indeed, exhausts collected downstream of the particle filter led to a slightly higher induction of a series of genes than those collected upstream. This result was in agreement with the formation of acrolein adducts and γH2AX. On the contrary, induction of oxidative stress remained very limited since only SOD was found to be induced and only when rats were exposed to biodiesel exhaust collected upstream of the particle filter. Parameters related to telomeres were identical in all groups. In summary, our results point to a limited accumulation of damage in lungs following repeated exposure to diesel exhausts when modern engines and relevant fuels are used. Yet, a few significant effects are still observed, mostly after the particle filter, suggesting a remaining toxicity associated with the gaseous or nano-particular phases. Only limited effects are observed on biological endpoints related to genotoxicity in the lung of rats repeatedly exposed to diesel exhaust, with a few exceptions suggesting a toxicity of the gaseous and nano-particular phase. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new method has been developed for the deoxygenation of vanillin to produce 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) as a promising liquid fuel over a heterogeneous non-noble metal catalyst. Cobalt nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Co/N-C-600) exhibit high activity and stability for the deoxygenation of vanillin into MMP under mild conditions (150 °C, 10 bar H2). Nearly quantitative MMP yield is obtained in isopropanol after 8 h at 150 °C and 10 bar H2 pressure. According to the distribution of products with time, the deoxygenation of vanillin into MMP mainly proceeds through the hydrogenation of vanillin into vanillyl alcohol and the subsequent hydrogenolysis of vanillyl alcohol into MMP, of which the latter is the rate-determining step, owing to a much higher activation energy. Moreover, after being recycled several times, the loss of catalytic activity is negligible, which demonstrates that the Co/N-C-600 catalyst shows good resistance to deactivation. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - As the demand for energy continuously increases, alternatives to fossil resources must be found to both prevent fossil source depletion and decrease overall environmental impact. One solution is increasing contributions from renewable, biological feedstock, and from wastes. This paper presents an analysis of the current methods of biomass conversion, to extract biofuels and biologically produced gases to then be used in fuel cells. Pathways for converting biomass feedstock into fuel cell fuels selected here were anaerobic digestion, metabolic processing, fermentation, gasification, and supercritical water gasification, which were compared to natural gas and fossil hydrogen reference cases. These thermochemical and biological conversion pathways can also make use of residues from agriculture, forestry, or some household and industry wastes, producing hydrogen and hydrogen-rich gases. Solid oxide fuel cells were also found to be the preferred technology for such bio-derived fuel gases, due to their wide range of fuel options, wide scalability from single kW to multi 100 kW, and high efficiency. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - Date palms are predominately produced in arid regions and the date pits, or seeds, produced from them are sometimes considered to be a waste. Date pits, ground to powder following an oil extraction, were used to synthesize a renewable heterogeneous catalyst. The green carbon catalyst was modified by an alkaline earth metal oxide (CaO). The oil extracted from date pits was transformed into biodiesel. The biodiesel process was optimized and the optimal yield was 98.2 wt% at a reaction temperature of 70 °C, reaction time ∼120 min, methanol to oil molar ratio of 12 and catalyst loading of 4.5 wt%. The quality of the produced biodiesel meets the standard limits set by regulating agencies (ASTM, EU) which indicates its suitability to be used as a fuel. Thus, it can be concluded that the green carbon catalyst synthesized from waste date pits has a high potential for biodiesel production. © 2018

AB  - This paper studied the KOH-catalyzed pyrolysis of rice husk (RH) and its pellet (RHP) at a high temperature (750 °C) for activated bio-carbons production. The mass ratio of KOH and biomass greatly impacted the pyrolysis kinetic and biochar property. The KOH catalysis (mass ratio: 1) reduced significantly the activation energy to 41 kJ/mol. During carbonization with KOH, the in-situ generated K2CO3 tailored the morphology and size of the self-template (SiO2 nanoparticles), giving rise to the chars with the open foam-like porous architectures enrich in micro- and meso-pores. Thus, the KOH activation via one-step pyrolysis could produce the micro-mesoporous carbons (e.g., RH-char 1 and RHP-char 1) with high specific surface areas and high content of oxygen-functionalities. Furthermore, the hierarchical porous carbons have high potential applications in adsorption process and electrochemical energy storage (e.g., supercapacitor) because of their unique physicochemical properties. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microwave-assisted degradation of alkaline lignin in methanol/formic acid media was investigated, concerning the effect of formic acid (FA) amount, reaction temperature, and reaction time on lignin depolymerization. The highest bio-oil yield of 72.0 wt% including 6.7 wt% monomers was achieved at 160 °C and a FA-to-lignin mass ratio of 4 after a reaction time of 30 min. Among the monomers, the yield of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran was the highest (3.00 wt%), followed by p-coumaric acid (1.59 wt%). Formic acid acted mainly through acid-catalyzed cleavage of the linkages in lignin. Oligomers in bio-oil were mainly composed of dimers (molecular weight: 253–378) and trimers (molecular weight: 379–510) according to the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. A possible mechanism about microwave-assisted depolymerization of lignin in methanol/formic acid media was proposed. This study will provide an efficient approach for lignin depolymerization. © 2018

AB  - In this study, nitrogen was used to replace oxygen through biomass N-enriched pyrolysis in a fixed-bed reactor to obtain N-containing chemicals and N-doped biochar. Influence of NH3 concentration on the formation mechanism of N-species and electrochemical performance of N-doped biochar was investigated in depth. Results showed that increasing NH3 concentration promoted bio-oil and gas generation, and increased H2, CH4 and CO yield at the diminishing of CO2. Simultaneously, bio-oil showed lower oxygen content with non-methoxy phenols and N-heterocyclics as the main components, and the maximums were 57.73% and 16.21% at 80 vol% NH3 concentration, respectively. With regard to solid N-doped biochar, nitrogen content (4.85 wt%), N-containing groups and specific surface area (369.59 m2/g) increased greatly, and excellent electrochemical property (120 F/g) was shown with NH3 concentration increasing. However, NH3 conversion efficiency decreased gradually with NH3 increasing, and 40 vol% may be the optimum NH3 concentration for biomass N-enriched pyrolysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper examines the conversion of barley straw to bio-crude oil (BO) via hydrothermal liquefaction. Response surface methodology based on central composite design was utilized to optimize the conditions of four independent variables including reaction temperature (factor X1, 260–340 °C), reaction time (factor X2, 5–25 min), catalyst dosage (factor X3, 2–18%) and biomass/water ratio (factor X4, 9–21%) for BO yield. It was found that reaction temperature, catalyst dosage and biomass/water ratio had more remarkable influence than reaction time on BO yield by analysis of variance. The predicted BO yield by the second order polynomial model was in good agreement with experimental results. A maximum BO yield of 38.72 wt% was obtained at 304.8 °C, 15.5 min, 11.7% potassium carbonate as catalyst and 18% biomass (based on water). GC/MS analysis revealed that the major BO components were phenols and their derivatives, acids, aromatic hydrocarbon, ketones, N-contained compounds and alcohols, which makes it a promising material in the applications of either bio-fuel or as a phenol substitute in bio-phenolic resins. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize various process variables such as methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time, catalyst concentration (sodium phosphate) and temperature for biodiesel production. The optimum conditions obtained were as follows: 11:1 M ratio of methanol to oil, 45 min reaction time, 2.96 wt% catalyst concentration and 74 °C temperature. At these conditions, the obtained bauhinia variegata methyl ester (BVME/biodiesel) yield was 95.1%. Fatty acid composition of oil was categorized by using gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The biodiesel product was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR). The fuel properties of the biodiesel were determined as per ASTM test method. The performance, combustion and emission characteristics of test samples (diesel, biodiesel test blends such as B10, B20, B30, B40 and B100) on a single cylinder diesel engine were studied. The test data were generated by varying the load (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). Variations in the engine emissions were recorded using AVL DIGAS 444 analyser. The engine performance was slightly reduced and combustion characteristics had slightly changed when engine was fueled with biodiesel test blends. The CO and HC emissions were less for biodiesel test blends (except B100) but NOx emissions increased with closer engine performance when compared with diesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) and Catalytic Hydrothermal Gasification (CHG) proof-of-concept bench-scale tests were performed to assess the potential of hydrothermal treatment for handling municipal wastewater sludge. HTL tests were conducted at 300 to 350 °C and 20 MPa on three different feeds: primary sludge, secondary sludge, and digested solids. Corresponding CHG tests were conducted at 350 °C and 20 MPa on the HTL aqueous phase output using a ruthenium-based catalyst. Biocrude yields ranged from 25 to 37%. Biocrude composition and quality were comparable to biocrudes generated from algae feeds. Subsequent hydrotreating of biocrude resulted in a product with comparable physical and chemical properties to crude oil. CHG product gas methane yields on a carbon basis ranged from 47 to 64%. Siloxane concentrations in the CHG product gas were below engine limits. The HTL-CHG process resulted in a chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction of > 99.9% and a reduction in residual solids for disposal of 94 to 99%. © 2018 Water Environment Federation.

AB  - We present a transparent and flexible self-charging biosupercapacitor based on an optimised mediator- and membrane-free enzymatic glucose/oxygen biofuel cell. Indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles were spray-coated on transparent conducting ITO supports resulting in a flocculent, porous and nanostructured electrode surface. By this, high capacitive currents caused by an increased electrochemical double layer as well as enhanced catalytic currents due to a higher number of immobilised enzyme molecules were obtained. After a chemical pre-treatment with a silane derivative, bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria was immobilized onto the ITO nanostructured electrode surface under formation of a biocathode, while bioanodes were obtained by either immobilisation of cellobiose dehydrogenase from Corynascus thermophilus or soluble PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The latter showed a lower apparent KM value for glucose conversion and higher catalytic currents at µM glucose concentrations. Applying the optimised device as a biosupercapacitor in a discontinuous charge/discharge mode led to a generated power output of 0.030 mW/cm2 at 50 µM glucose, simulating the glucose concentration in human tears. This represents an enhancement by a factor of 350 compared to the power density obtained from the continuously operating biofuel cell with a maximum power output of 0.086 µW/cm2 under the same conditions. After 17 h of charging/discharging cycles a remarkable current enhancement was still measured. The entire device was transferred to flexible materials and applied for powering a flexible display showing its potential applicability as an intermittent power source in smart contact lenses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algae have emerged as a sustainable feedstock for gaseous biofuel production (such as hydrogen and methane). Fermentative sugars and amino acids can be obtained after suitable pretreatment and hydrolysis of algae. However, binary interactions between the carbonyl group (–C[dbnd]O) in sugars and the amino group (–NH2) in amino acids possibly occur during thermal pretreatment, resulting in deficient hydrolysis and fermentation performance. In this study, algae-derived glucose and glycine as model substrates were subjected to thermochemical treatment (135 °C for 15 min) under neutral, acid and alkaline conditions to assess their decomposition routes and the associated implications on sequential biohydrogen and biomethane fermentation. Acid treatment mainly resulted in direct decomposition of glucose into 5-methylfurfural (C6H6O2, 34.4% of peak area). While thermal treatment with deionized water and alkaline led to the formation of nitrogen-containing Maillard compounds, namely 1-azido-4-dimethylaminobenzene (C8H10N4, 33.1%) and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine (C7H10N2, 49.0%), respectively. Untreated glucose/glycine yielded a biohydrogen production of 171.9 mL/g, while alkaline treatment exhibited a biohydrogen yield of only 5.9 mL/g due to the great loss of fermentable substrate. The total energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 71.1% was achieved through the second-stage biomethane fermentation of untreated glucose/glycine. Comparatively, alkaline treatment significantly inhibited the total energy recovery with an ECE of 31.9%. The findings of this study suggested that optimised pretreatment strategy for algae needs to be developed to avoid fermentable compounds loss and achieve a higher ECE. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was synthesized in an enzymatic transesterification process from Hevea brasiliensis, crude non-edible oil, using lipase immobilized on spherical silica aerogels. Enzymatic transesterification is preferred to chemical methods as it is milder and is more environmentally friendly. Lipase based transesterification of Hevea brasiliensis under optimal conditions provided high FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) yields up to 93%. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process for maximum FAME yield. The maximum yield was obtained at a temperature of 35 °C, water content of 15% (v/v %) and methanol/oil molar ratio of 8:1. Percent yields of FAME from the transesterification process followed second order model. Even after 10 cycles of reuse, lipase immobilized on spherical silica aerogel showed only 10.7% reduction in percentage yield of FAME. The results from this study demonstrate the viability of economical biodiesel production using waste products as both source and catalyst. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Due to the increasing demands of energy and depletion of fossil fuel, bamboo is considered to be one of the most important renewable biological resources on the basis of its advantages of rapid growth ability and rich reserves. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three most important constituents in moso bamboo. Their concentrations and, especially, their microscopic distributions greatly affect their utilization efficiency and other physical properties as a biomass resource. However, no studies have achieved a quantitative visualization of the distribution of lignocellulose concentrations in transverse sections of bamboo. Therefore, this study proposed the use of quantitative multivariate spectral analysis to reveal the micro-chemical distribution of lignocelluloses in bamboo based on an integration of FTIR macro-and micro-spectroscopic imaging techniques. Results: Multivariate calibration models for the quantitative determination of lignocelluloses of bamboo were developed based on FTIR macro-spectroscopy, and the quantitative calibration models based on the FTIR character-istic bands showed an excellent performance with determination coefficients of 0.933, 0.878, and 0.912 for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively. These quantitative models were then utilized to the FTIR micro-spectroscopy of bamboo transverse sections which were corrected using a direct standardization algorithm. Subsequently, the micro-chemical distributions of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were obtained based on the integration of the multivariate calibration models and corrected FTIR micro-spectroscopy. The combination of the multivariate calibration models and calibration transfer algorithm resulted in a final quantitative visualization of the chemical distributions of lignocelluloses in moso bamboos. Conclusions: Integration of the FTIR macro-and micro-spectroscopic imaging techniques can provide comprehensive information that can be used to exploit the resource of moso bamboo to develop biofuels and biosynthetic materials. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Enzymatic bioelectrocatalysis often requires an artificial redox mediator to observe significant electron transfer rates. The use of such mediators can add a substantial overpotential and obfuscate the protein's native kinetics, which limits the voltage of a biofuel cell and alters the analytical performance of biosensors. Herein, we describe a material for facilitating direct electrochemical communication with redox proteins based on a novel pyrene-modified linear poly(ethyleneimine). This method was applied for promoting direct bioelectrocatalytic reduction of O2 by laccase and, by immobilizing the catalytic subunit of nitrogenase (MoFe protein), to demonstrate the ATP-independent direct electroenzymatic reduction of N2 to NH3. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this study, the experimental optimization of ultrasound assisted biodiesel production in presence of heterogeneous catalyst was investigated. Three catalysts namely; CaO, calcined dolomite and calcium diglyceroxide (CaDG) were taken into account for comparative purpose. D-optimal experimental plan was applied to obtain regression models which were subsequently used for the detection of optimum process conditions. Maximum biodiesel yields were calculated as 98.7%, 95.9% and 86.3% for CaO, calcined dolomite and CaDG respectively. Furthermore, supplemental experiments were conducted around optimum process conditions to test the validity of the regression models and to refine the optimum results. Finally, in the case of CaO catalyst, maximum biodiesel yield (99.4%) was obtained at the following conditions; catalyst loading: 5.35% (wt.of oil), methanol/oil ratio: 7.48, ultrasonic power: 40 W, time: 150 min, and reaction temperature: 60 °C. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolysis of several Tunisian Date Palm Wastes (DPW): Date Palm Rachis (DPR), Date Palm Leaflets (DPL), Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB) and Date Palm Glaich (DPG) was run using a fixed-bed reactor, from room temperature to 500 °C, with 15 °C/min as heating rate and −5 °C as condensation temperature, in order to produce bio-oil, biochar and syngas. In these conditions, the bio-oil yield ranges from 17.03 wt% for DPL to 25.99 wt% for EFB. For the biochar, the highest yield (36.66 wt%) was obtained for DPL and the lowest one (31.66 wt%) was obtained from DPG while the syngas production varies from 39.10 wt% for DPR to 46.31 wt% DPL. The raw material and pyrolysis products have been characterized using elemental analysis thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The syngas composition has been characterized using gas analyzer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Among the new technologies developed for the heavy-duty fleet, the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) aftertreatment system in standard Diesel engines associated with biodiesel/diesel mixtures is an alternative in use to control the legislated pollutants emission. Nevertheless, there is an absence of knowledge about the synergic behaviour of these devices and biodiesel blends regarding the emissions of unregulated substances as the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and Nitro-PAHs, both recognized for their carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on humans. Therefore, the goal of this study is the quantification of PAHs and Nitro-PAHs present to total particulate matter (PM) emitted from the Euro V engine fuelled with ultra-low sulphur diesel and soybean biodiesel in different percentages, B5 and B20. PM sampling was performed using a Euro V – SCR engine operating in European Stationary Cycle (ESC). The PAHs and Nitro-PAHs were extracted from PM using an Accelerated Solvent Extractor and quantified by GC–MS. The results indicated that the use of SCR and the largest fraction of biodiesel studied may suppress the emission of total PAHs. The Toxic Equivalent (TEQ) was lower when using 20% biodiesel, in comparison with 5% biodiesel on the SCR system, reaffirming the low toxicity emission using higher percentage biodiesel. The data also reveal that use of SCR, on its own, suppress the Nitro-PAHs compounds. In general, the use of larger fractions of biodiesel (B20) coupled with the SCR aftertreatment showed the lowest PAHs and Nitro-PAHs emissions, meaning lower toxicity and, consequently, a potential lower risk to human health. From the emission point of view, the results of this work also demonstrated the viability of the Biodiesel programs, in combination with the SCR systems, which does not require any engine adaptation and is an economical alternative for the countries (Brazil, China, Russia, India) that have not adopted Euro VI emission standards. © 2018

AB  - Hydrogen is one of the most promising alternatives for fossil fuels. However, the power output of hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells is often restricted by mass transport limitations of the substrate. Here, we present a dual-gas breathing H 2 /air biofuel cell that overcomes these limitations. The cell is equipped with a hydrogen-oxidizing redox polymer/hydrogenase gas-breathing bioanode and an oxygen-reducing bilirubin oxidase gas-breathing biocathode (operated in a direct electron transfer regime). The bioanode consists of a two layer system with a redox polymer-based adhesion layer and an active, redox polymer/hydrogenase top layer. The redox polymers protect the biocatalyst from high potentials and oxygen damage. The bioanodes show remarkable current densities of up to 8 mA cm -2 . A maximum power density of 3.6 mW cm -2 at 0.7 V and an open circuit voltage of up to 1.13 V were achieved in biofuel cell tests, representing outstanding values for a device that is based on a redox polymer-based hydrogenase bioanode. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The excessive oxygen content in biomass obstructs the production of high-quality bio-oils. In this work, we developed a tandem catalytic bed (TCB) of CeO2 and HZSM-5 in an analytical pyrolyzer to enhance the hydrocarbon production from co-pyrolysis of corn stover (CS) and LDPE. Results indicated that CeO2 could remove oxygen from acids, aldehydes and methoxy phenols, producing a maximum yield of hydrocarbons of 85% and highest selectivity of monocyclic aromatics of 73% in the TCB. The addition of LDPE exhibited a near-complete elimination of oxygenates, leaving hydrocarbons as the overwhelming products. With increasing LDPE proportion, the yield of aliphatics and the selectivity of BTX kept increasing. An optimum H/Ceff of 0.7 was superior to that reported in literature. Mechanisms consisting of deoxygenation, Diels-Alder reactions, hydrocarbon pool and hydrogen transfer reactions were discussed extensively. Our findings provide an efficient method to produce high-quality biofuels from renewable biomass resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In February 2018, the United States enacted significant financial incentives for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) that will make capture from the lowest-capture-cost sources economically viable. The largest existing low-capture-cost opportunity is from ethanol fermentation at biorefineries in the Midwest. An impediment to deployment of carbon capture at ethanol biorefineries is that most are not close to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) fields or other suitable geological formations in which the carbon dioxide could be stored. Therefore, we analyze the viability of a pipeline network to transport carbon dioxide from Midwest ethanol biorefineries to the Permian Basin in Texas, which has the greatest current carbon dioxide demand for EOR and large potential for expansion. We estimate capture and transport costs and perform economic analysis for networks under three pipeline financing scenarios representing different combinations of commercial and government finance. Without government finance, we find that a network earning commercial rates of return would not be viable. With 50% government financing for pipelines, 19 million tons of carbon dioxide per year could be captured and transported profitably. Thirty million tons per year could be captured with full government pipeline financing, which would double global anthropogenic carbon capture and increase the United States’ carbon dioxide EOR industry by 50%. Such a development would face challenges, including coordination between governments and industries, pressing timelines, and policy uncertainties, but is not unprecedented. This represents an opportunity to considerably increase CCUS in the near-term and develop long-term transport infrastructure facilitating future growth. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Tungsten oxide promoted platinum catalysts (Pt-WOx/Al2O3) of varying composition were prepared by wet impregnation method and reduced in hydrogen atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that Pt is completely reduced to metallic state while tungsten is in +6 and +5 oxidation states. Pt crystallite and particle sizes increased (from 1.2 to 1.4 nm and 2.5 to 3 nm, respectively) in presence of WOx (CO-chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy). Tungsten addition augmented strong acid sites. It enhanced significantly the catalytic activity of Pt/Al2O3 in deoxygenation of fatty acids and their methyl esters. Tungsten altered the reaction pathway from decarbonylation/decarboxylation to hydrodeoxygenation. A catalyst with 4 wt% Pt and 8 wt% W exhibited high catalytic performance. Complete conversion of oleic acid and octadecane product selectivity in the range 67.1–80.8% was obtained. Pt-WOx/Al2O3 is a stable and reusable fatty acid deoxygenation catalyst. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To provide a carbon source for the growth of the green microalgae, two forest biomasses (Norway spruce and silver birch) were pretreated with a hybrid organosolv-steam explosion method, resulting in inhibitor-free pretreated solids with a high cellulose content of 77.9% w/w (birch) and 72% w/w (spruce). Pretreated solids were hydrolyzed using commercial cellulolytic enzymes to produce hydrolysate for the culture of algae. Results: The heterotrophic growth of A. protothecoides was assessed using synthetic medium with glucose as carbon source, where the effect of sugar concentration and the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio were optimized, resulting in accumulation of lipids at 5.42 ± 0.32 g/L (64.52 ± 0.53% lipid content) after 5 days of culture on glucose at 20 g/L. The use of birch and spruce hydrolysates was favorable for the growth and lipid accumulation of the algae, resulting in lipid production of 5.65 ± 0.21 g/L (66 ± 0.33% lipid content) and 5.28 ± 0.17 g/L (63.08 ± 0.71% lipid content) when grown on birch and spruce, respectively, after only 120 h of cultivation. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of using organosolv pretreated wood biomass hydrolysates for the growth and lipid production of microalgae in the literature. The pretreatment process used in this study provided high saccharification of biomass without the presence of inhibitors. Moreover, the lipid profile of this microalga showed similar contents to vegetable oils which improve the biodiesel properties. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel has the potential to replace the conventional diesel fuel, thus the increasing interest and research in the use of biodiesel fuels for transport applications to improve the emisions. In this work, the spray characteristics of diesel with hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel (HCB) fuel blends were investigated in a constant volume combustion chamber to provide an accessible tool to predict spray behavior based on cheap and off-engine condition measurements for applying HCB in diesel engines. As two important indexes of spray characteristics, the liquid penetration and vapor penetration were researched using Mie-scattering and Schlieren methods under non-reacting conditions to avoid the influence of combustion on the mixing and vaporization processes. Besides, the liquid length of blended fuel under reacting conditions is measured by a laser system to figure out the effect of combustion on atomization process. The results show that the liquid length decreases with increasing HCB ratio in the blends and the fuel density has greater influence on the liquid length than the fuel viscosity. By comparing the liquid length result, a slight difference between the different blends on vapor penetration was observed under the same boundary condition. The spray characteristics of blends indicate that HCB is a good blending component for blended fuel which can be applied in diesel engine directly in large-scale. Moreover, the liquid length of laser Mie-scattering method is higher than that of LED Mie-scattering and the liquid length under reacting conditions is shorter than that of inert conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae biodiesel has been considered ​as a clean renewable fuel for diesel marine engines. This is due to its optimistic characterizations such as ​rapid growth rate, high productivity, and its ability to convert CO2 into fuel. In this study, the use of microalgae biodiesel, obtained from Botryococcus braunii, as an alternative fuel for diesel marine engines has been investigated. The diesel engine is verified experimentally using Ni-Doped ZnO nano additive blends with algae biodiesel and neat diesel fuel. The results showed that doped nano additive blends​ produce less emission compared to B20. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - High-energy-density enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are urgently needed not only as green energy conversion devices but also as energy generators for medical devices. Low enzyme loading efficiency and insufficient direct electron transfer (DET) between enzymes and electrodes greatly hamper the development of EBFCs. Herein, we fabricated nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres with large pores (pNHCSs) via a green microwave-assisted hydrothermal method (MWHM). Due to their three-dimensional structure and the incorporation of nitrogen, the pNHCS-functionalized electrode not only efficiently enriched the load of enzyme (ca. 8.65 × 10−10 mol cm−2) but also significantly facilitated DET rate (ca. 10.73 s−1). Thus, the pNHCS-based EBFCs exhibited an outstanding maximum power output (Pmax), which achieved to 325 ± 0.6 µW cm−2. Then, based on a dual-fuel-driven EBFC, we developed an innovative self-powered biosensor to sense two kinds of cancer-related microRNAs, miR-21 and miR-141, at the same time. The detection limits were as low as 0.1 fM for miR-21 and 4.0 fM for miR-141 (S/N = 3). This material has excellent potential in the development of superior green bio-batteries as well as economical and portable self-powered biomedical sensors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, one-pot synthesis of biofuel γ-valerolactone (GVL) and valeric acid (VA) from biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) are highly selectively produced on a series of robust Pdnanoparticle catalysts. These fine Pd nanoparticles are controllably synthesized and confined in the mesoporous channel of MCM-41-derived supports via a green solvent CO2-assited method. A combination analysis tools are used to study physical properties and elucidate the relationship between the structure and performances. The catalytic results display 5 wt% Pd/AlMCM-41 exhibits the best performances of 88.5% GVL yield at the perfect conversion of LA. Moreover, without the isolation of GVL intermediate, it can also efficiently catalyze the one-pot conversion of LA to VA with 45.1% yield. Besides, Pd nanoparticle catalysts maintain stable structure and good catalytic performances over several runs. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - There is an urgent need to address environmental problems caused by our transportation systems, which include the reduction of associated CO2 emissions. In the short term, renewable drop-in fuels are ideal, as they allow a direct integration into the existing infrastructure. However, preferably they would perform better than current alternatives (for example, bioethanol) and be synthesized in a more efficient way. Here we demonstrate the production of biogasoline with a direct upstream integration into processes in existing petrorefinery facilities that targets the 10% bio-based carbon in accordance with the current European Union directives (for 2020) for biofuels. To achieve this goal, we show the valorization of (hemi)cellulose pulp into light naphtha using a two-phase (H2O:organic) catalytic slurry process. A C5–C6 alkane stream, enriched with bio-derived carbon and compatible with further downstream petrorefinery operations for (bio)gasoline production, is automatically obtained by utilizing fossil light straight run naphtha as the organic phase. The ease of integration pleads for a joint petro/bio effort to gradually produce bio-enriched gasolines, wherein the chemical compounds of the bio-derived fraction are indistinguishable from those in current high-quality gasoline compositions. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Graphene and carbon nanotubes have drawn interest across many disciplines due to their remarkable properties. We investigated the effects of graphite oxide (GO), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles on the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a four-stroke single cylinder light-duty diesel engine under various engine loads. Shortened ignition-delay (ID) by up to 10.3%, advanced combustion phasing (up to 18.5%), shortened combustion duration (up to 14.6%), improved brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by up to 15.2%, reduced CO emission (up to 23.4%), and lowered UHCs emissions (up to 24.1%) were achieved with the addition of SWCNTs nanoparticle at 25 ppm dosing ratio. SWCNTs and GO additives could be effective approach for lowering emissions in diesel engine applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recycling waste cooking vegetable oils by reclaiming and using these oils as biodiesel feedstocks is one of the promising solutions to address global energy demands. However, producing these biodiesels poses a significant challenge because of their poor physicochemical properties due the high free fatty acid content and impurities present in the feedstock, which will reduce the biodiesel yields. Hence, this study implemented the following strategy in order to address this issue: (1) 70 vol% of waste cooking vegetable oil blended with 30 vol% of Calophyllum inophyllum oil named as WC70CI30 used to alter its properties, (2) a three-stage process (degumming, esterification, and transesterification) was conducted which reduces the free fatty acid content and presence of impurities, and (3) the transesterification process parameters (methanol/oil ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst concentration) were optimized using response surface methodology in order to increase the biodiesel conversion yield. The results show that the WC70CI30 biodiesel has favourable physicochemical properties, good cold flow properties, and high oxidation stability (22.4 h), which fulfil the fuel specifications stated in the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. It found that the WC70CI30 biodiesel has great potential as a diesel substitute without the need for antioxidants and pour point depressants. © 2018

In this study, wheat straw was used as a candidate lignocellulosic biomass to produce hydrogen fuel through hydrothermal gasification. The fluid phases of water investigated for gasification included subcritical (300 and 370°C) and supercritical (450 and 550°C) phases. Along with the effects of temperature (300-550°C), the influences of feed concentration (20-35 wt%) and reaction time (40-70 minutes) were comprehensively studied for wheat straw gasification in subcritical and supercritical water. To maximize hydrogen and total gas yields, the effects of two metal catalysts (eg, Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3) were examined. Hydrogen and total gas yields, as well as lower heating values of the gas products, were comparatively evaluated during the subcritical and supercritical water gasification of wheat straw. Supercritical water gasification of wheat straw at 550°C with 20 wt% feed concentration for 60 minutes of reaction time resulted in higher yields of hydrogen (2.98 mmol/g) and total gases (10.6 mmol/g). When compared to noncatalytic gasification, catalytic gasification using 5 wt% loading of Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/Si-Al2O3 enhanced the hydrogen yields up to 4.18 and 5.1 mmol/g, respectively, along with respective total gas yields of 15 and 18.2 mmol/g. Nonetheless, wheat straw-derived biochar produced at high supercritical water temperatures also retained high carbon content and calorific value. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Cell wall disruption is an essential downstream processing step for improving the efficiency of lipid extraction from microalgae. Enzyme-assisted extraction of lipid from microalga Scenedesmus sp. with cellulase, xylanase and pectinase, using various parameters, such as enzyme concentration, temperature, pH and incubation time, was optimized by central composite design (CCD) coupled with response surface methodology (RSM). Both the lipid extraction from microalgae and the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) production under optimal conditions showed a ∼twofold in the yields compared to the control group with no enzymatic treatment. SEM images, FTIR measurement, XPS and HPLC analysis showed that the enzymatic pretreatment caused significant alterations in the cell wall structure of microalgae. And the disruption of microalgal cell walls was primarily attributed to the breakage of β-glucosidic linkages in cellulose and hemicellulose. The study showed a promising approach can lead to an improvement in the lipid extraction yield from microalgae and further provide valuable information for the use of enzymes in microalgal processes. © 2018

AB  - Bio-Oils derived from biomass pyrolysis are promising feedstock for the direct production of valuable platform chemicals, fuels and energy from renewable and sustainable resources. Among the numerous technologies utilized for biomass pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis technologies are chosen for liquid products yield maximization, and characterized by short residence times for solids and vapors, operating temperatures in above ≥500 °C and very high heating rates. Inspired by the vast potential of biomass pyrolysis bio-oils, a thermochemical conversion (fast pyrolysis) and characterization of cocoa pod husks, an abundant agricultural biomass waste from Ghana, West Africa, has been investigated and their potential as renewable feedstock for the production of high-value added chemicals determined by analyzing chemical components of the derived bio-oil. GC–MS analysis of the bio-oil indicated that major constituents were 9, 12-octadecadienoic acid and hexadecanoic acid”. Product distributions revealed 58%wt. of bio-oil, 30%wt. of bio-char and 12%wt. of Non-condensable gas (obtained by difference). Ultimate, proximate, structural composition, calorific value and thermogravimetry analyses were also performed on the cocoa pod husks. Elemental analysis showed that the recovered milled cocoa pod husks contained about 7 elements potentially essential for plant growth. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work introduces biodiesel production from wet spent coffee grounds (SCGs) with supercritical methanol without any pre-drying process. Supercritical methanol and subcritical water effectively produced biodiesel via in situ transesterification by inducing more porous SCG and enhancing the efficiency of lipid extraction and conversion. It was also found that space loading was one of the critical factors for biodiesel production. An optimal biodiesel yield of 10.17 wt% of dry SCG mass (86.33 w/w% of esterifiable lipids in SCG) was obtained at reaction conditions of 270 °C, 90 bars, methanol to wet SCG ratio 5:1, space loading 58.4 ml/g and reaction time 20 min. Direct use of wet SCG waste as feedstock for supercritical biodiesel production eliminates the conventional dying process and the need of catalyst and also reduces environmental problems caused by landfill accumulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An efficient scheme was developed for the conversion of wheat straw (WS) into bioethanol, silica and lignin. WS was pre-extracted with 0.2 mol/L sodium hydroxide at 30 °C for 5 h to remove about 91% of initial silica. Subsequently, the alkaline-pretreated solids were subjected to alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment with 40 mg hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/g biomass at 50 °C for 7 h to prepare highly digestible substrate. The results of enzymatic hydrolysis demonstrated that the sequential alkaline-AHP pretreated WS was efficiently hydrolyzed at 10% (w/v) solids loading using an enzyme dosage of 10 mg protein/g glucan. The total sugar conversion of 92.4% was achieved. Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) was applied to produce ethanol from the two-stage pretreated substrate using Saccharomyces cerevisiae SR8u strain. Ethanol with concentration of 31.1 g/L was produced. Through the proposed process, about 86.4% and 54.1% of the initial silica and lignin were recovered, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report the oriented immobilization of [NiFeSe] hydrogenases on both covalently and noncovalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) electrodes. A specific interaction of the [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum with hydrophobic organic molecules was probed by electrochemistry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and theoretical calculations. Taking advantage of these hydrophobic interactions, the enzyme was efficiently wired on anthraquinone and adamantane-modified CNTs. Because of rational immobilization onto functionalized CNTs, the O2-tolerant [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase is able to efficiently operate in a H2/air gas-diffusion enzymatic fuel cell. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - α-Pinene is a natural and active monoterpene, which is widely used as a flavoring agent and in fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and biofuels. Although it has been successfully produced by genetically engineered microorganisms, the production level of pinene is much lower than that of hemiterpene (isoprene) and sesquiterpenes (farnesene) to date. We first improved pinene tolerance to 2.0% and pinene production by adaptive laboratory evolution after atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis and overexpression of the efflux pump to obtain the pinene tolerant strain Escherichia coli YZFP, which is resistant to fosmidomycin. Through error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling, we isolated an Abies grandis geranyl pyrophosphate synthase variant that outperformed the wild-type enzyme. To balance the expression of multiple genes, a tunable intergenic region (TIGR) was inserted between A. grandis GPPSD90G/L175P and Pinus taeda Pt1Q457L. In an effort to improve the production, an E. coli-E. coli modular co-culture system was engineered to modularize the heterologous mevalonate (MEV) pathway and the TIGR-mediated gene cluster of A. grandis GPPSD90G/L175P and P. taeda Pt1Q457L. Specifically, the MEV pathway and the TIGR-mediated gene cluster were integrated into the chromosome of the pinene tolerance strain E. coli YZFP and then evolved to a higher gene copy number by chemically induced chromosomal evolution, respectively. The best E. coli-E. coli co-culture system of fermentation was found to improve pinene production by 1.9-fold compared to the mono-culture approach. The E. coli-E. coli modular co-culture system of whole-cell biocatalysis further improved pinene production to 166.5 mg/L. © Copyright © 2018 Niu, He, Wu and Liu.

AB  - The microwave-assisted fast co-pyrolysis of chlorella and tire with additive under N2 and CO2 atmospheres were investigated. The pyrolysis profiles, yields of three-phase, the chemical composition of liquid and the ultimate analyses of solid residues were gained. With the tire ratio increasing, all the characters had the changes. The finial temperature had a wave change. The yield of liquid decreased and the chemical composition obtained in liquid of oxygenates compounds decreased, while hydrocarbon compounds increased, among which aromatic hydrocarbons had the highest content. The yield of solid increased, the HHV had a wave change and the values of H/C decreased. Under CO2 atmosphere, the final temperatures were lower with 70% and 100% chlorella ratios, the yield difference of liquid reached the minimal with 70% and 30% chlorella ratios. According to the quantity and quality of liquid and solid, and the former results, 50% percentage of tire was the suitable ratio. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Currently, renewable biomass-derived energy sources and related transformation technologies are attracting numerous attentions due to the rapid consumption of fossil fuels and resulting increasing environmental pollution. Herein, a new dandelion-like cobalt oxide (CoOx) microsphere-supported bimetallic RuCo catalyst was fabricated by a simple one-pot embedding method and employed for the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) hydrogenolysis to produce liquid 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) biofuel. It was found that bimetallic RuCo nanoparticles (NPs) with the average size of about 2.5 nm could homogeneously disperse on flower-like CoOx microspheres possessing abundant surface defects (i.e. oxygen vacancies and Co2+ species) simultaneously constructed. As-fabricated RuCo/CoOx catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance in above reaction, along with a quite high DMF yield of 96.5% at a high HMF/Ru molar ratio of 252.7, which was corelated with the unique synergy between bimetallic RuCo NPs and abundant surface defects at the metal-support interface, as well as the enhanced hydrogen spillover effect and the dandelion-like superstructure of the catalyst. Additionally, the strong interactions between RuCo species and the CoOx matrix in the RuCo/CoOx significantly prevented RuCo NPs from migration, aggregation, and leaching during the reaction. The present findings offer a new approach for designing other highly efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts applied in a variety of heterogeneous catalytic systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, a continuous fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis system was developed to produce bio-oil, gas, and biochar from rice straw and Camellia oleifera shell. The effects of different pyrolysis temperatures (400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C) and feed rates (rice straw: 25, 45, and 66 g/min; C. oleifera shell: 100, 200, and 400 g/min) on bio-oil production were investigated. Experimental results showed that the yields of bio-oil (31.86 wt%) and gas (54.49 wt%) produced by the microwave-assisted pyrolysis of rice straw increased with increasing temperature. By contrast, the yields of bio-oil (27.45 wt%) and biochar (35.47 wt%) produced by the pyrolysis of C. oleifera shell decreased with increasing temperature. The contents of phenols, aldehydes, and alcohols in bio-oil produced from the shell were higher than those in bio-oil derived from rice straw. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dark fermentation may be hindered by insufficient bioavailable carbon and nitrogen sources as well as recalcitrant cell wall structures of substrates. Protein-rich microalgae and carbohydrate-rich rice residue with various mix ratios can optimise biohydrogen and volatile fatty acids production. Optimal pretreatment of the microalgae with 1% H2SO4 and the rice residue with 0.5% H2SO4 under hydrothermal heating (140 °C, 10 min) achieved reducing sugar yields of 187.3 mg/g volatile solids (VS) (hydrolysis efficiency: 54%) and 924.9 mg/g VS (hydrolysis efficiency: 100%), respectively. Multiscale physiochemical characterisations of solid hydrolytic residues confirmed considerable damage to both substrates. Co-fermentation of pretreated rice residue and microalgae at a mix ratio of 5:1 exhibited the maximum hydrogen yield of 201.8 mL/g VS, a 10.7-fold increase compared to mono-fermentation of pretreated microalgae. The mix ratio of 25:1 resulted in the highest carbon to volatile fatty acids conversion (96.8%), corresponding to a maximum energy conversion efficiency of 90.8%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae is projected as a promising third generation biomass feedstock for the production of biofuel and fine chemical intermediates. This study is focused on the selective production of chemicals from Nannochloropsis oculata microalga via catalytic fast pyrolysis technique using Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Non-catalytic and catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) experiments were conducted in an analytical micropyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer to study the effects of temperature, catalyst-to-algae ratio, and metal loading on support on pyrolysate composition. The catalyst, Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3, was prepared using wetness incipient impregnation method, and characterized for its structure and pore size distribution. Catalyst-to-algae mass ratios used to study the pyrolysate composition and quality were 1:3, 1:1 and 2:1. The major organic compounds from both non-catalytic fast pyrolysis and CFP of the microalga were long chain nitriles, long chain alkanes and alkenes, polyaromatic and monoaromatic hydrocarbons. The optimum fast pyrolysis temperature under non-catalytic conditions that promoted the selectivity of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons was 500 °C. The incorporation of Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst promoted the formation of specific organic compounds like 1‑isocyanobutane and dimethylketene to the tune of 35% selectivity. The formation pathways for these compounds are proposed to involve dehydration, isomerization, ketonization and CH addition reactions of the amide and carboxylic acid moieties generated from the protein and lipid fractions of the alga. Owing to the low oxygen content in the pyrolysates from CFP, the estimated calorific value of organics in the pyrolysates was higher (33–39 MJ kg−1) than that of the microalga (18 MJ kg−1). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapor from rape straw was performed in a vacuum pyrolysis system over La/HZSM-5 with hierarchical structure. When 3M Na2CO3 was used for alkali treatment, the desilication process of HZSM-5 zeolite was highly controllable and the hierarchical porous HZSM-5(Hi-ZSM-5) zeolite was formed. After that, Hi-ZSM-5 was modified by impregnation with lanthanum ion, the acid sites of Lewis increased and the concentrations ratio of Brönsted acid and Lewis acid of the catalyst was improved. The highest hydrocarbons selectivity (49.86%), the lowest carbonyl compounds content (11.06%), and reasonable catalytic stability were obtained by the La/Hi-ZSM-5 catalyst. In addition, La/Hi-ZSM-5 further reduced the coke content of the catalyst to 11.05%, while increasing the selectivity of high value aromatic hydrocarbons. Obviously, La/Hi-ZSM-5 zeolite had high catalytic activity, and exhibited good potential and a beneficial nature for efficient preparation of high-valued bio-oil from rape straw. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae was investigated. The impact of pressure on the yield and composition of pyrolysis products were studied. The results showed that the concentration of H2 in bio-gas increased sharply with increasing pyrolysis pressure, while those of CO, CO2, CH4, and C2H6 were dramatically decreased. The concentration of H2 reached 88.01 vol% in bio-gas at 900 °C and 4 MPa. Higher pressures promoted the hydrogen transfer to bio-gas. The bio-oils derived from pressurized pyrolysis were rich in nitrogen-containing compounds and PAHs. The highest concentration of nitrogen-containing compounds in bio-oil was achieved at 800 °C and 1 MPa. Increasing pyrolysis pressure promoted the formation of nitrogen-containing compounds such as indole, quinoline, isoquinoline and phenanthridine. Higher pyrolysis pressures led to increased sphericity, enhanced swelling, and higher carbon order of bio-chars. Pressurized pyrolysis of biomass has a great potential for poly-generation of H2, nitrogen containing compounds and bio-char. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass by catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) is a promising route to producing green aromatics and sustainable biofuels. The zeolite catalysts present a strong ability to produce light aromatics but also heavy products. In this work, these heavy products are monitored by a well-established petroleomic approach. The selectivity toward the heavy bio-oil components of both a common HZSM-5 zeolite and a hierarchical zeolite was investigated. Part of the molecular species from lignin derivatives is still present in the upgraded bio-oils. Deoxygenation and aromatization are the main modifications of the heavy compounds caused by zeolites, especially for the sugar derivatives. These effects are stronger for the hierarchical zeolite for which numerous heavy hydrocarbons (not oxygenated) are generated due to enhanced mass transfers within the crystallites. Moreover, this catalyst demonstrates a better stability upon an increase in the biomass-to-catalyst ratio. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Currently, there are mainly two pathways of the biodiesel production from wastewater sludge including 1) directly extracting the lipid in sludge and then converting the lipid to biodiesel through trans-esterification, and 2) employing sludge as medium to cultivate oleaginous microorganism to accumulate lipid and then transferring the lipid to biodiesel. So far, the study was still in research stage and its cost feasibility was not yet investigated. In this study, biodiesel production from wastewater sludge was designed and the cost was estimated with SuperPro Designer. With consideration of converting the lipid in raw sludge to biodiesel, the unit production cost was 0.67 US $/kg biodiesel (0.59 US $/L biodiesel). When the sludge was used as medium to grow oleaginous microorganism to accumulate lipid for producing biodiesel, the unit production cost was 1.08 US $/kg biodiesel (0.94 US $/L biodiesel). The study showed that sludge has great potential in biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is effective for upgrading bio-oil to biofuel. However, the upgrading cost increased due to the high consumption of external hydrogen. In this paper, the hydrogen generated from cheap water using zinc hydrolysis for in situ bio-oil HDO was reported. The effect of different temperatures (200 °C, 250 °C and 300 °C) on bio-oil HDO over Pd/C catalyst was investigated in a batch reactor. The results show that 250 °C yielded biofuel with the highest heating value at 30.17 MJ/kg and the highest hydrocarbons content at 24.09%. Physicochemical properties including heating value, total acid number and chemical compositions of the produced biofuels improved significantly in comparison with that of the original bio-oil. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - A novel three-dimensional (3D) carbon composite of PANI1600@CNTs with rhizobium-like structure is prepared by in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers around and along the functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and then carbonized at 1600 °C for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). The SEM and TEM images clearly show that the carbonized PANI grew seamlessly on the surface of CNTs and presented the rhizobium-like structure. The carbonized PANI acts like conductive “glue” and connects the adjacent tubes together, which can assemble the CNTs into a 3D network. The PANI1600@CNTs composite modified glassy carbon electrodes based on glucose oxidase (GOx) and laccase (Lac) exhibit high electrochemical performance. A glucose//O2 EBFC constitutes of the fabricated anode and cathode performs a maximum power density of 1.12 mW cm−2 at 0.45 V. Furthermore, three of the fabricated EBFCs in series are able to lightening up a yellow light-emitting diode (LED) whose turn-on voltage is about at 1.8 V. This work may be helpful for exploiting novel substrates by carbonizing the composites of conducting polymer with nano materials at high-temperature for immobilization of enzymes in the EBFCs or biosensor fields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) have recently been shown to significantly enhance the degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides and are of interest for the production of biochemicals and bioethanol from plant biomass. The copper-containing LPMOs utilize electrons, provided by reducing agents, to oxidatively cleave polysaccharides. Here, we report the development of a β-glucosidase-assisted method to quantify the release of C1-oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides from cellulose by two C1-oxidizing LPMOs from Myceliophthora thermophila C1. Based on this quantification method, we demonstrate that the catalytic performance of both MtLPMOs is strongly dependent on pH and temperature. The obtained results indicate that the catalytic performance of LPMOs depends on the interaction of multiple factors, which are affected by both pH and temperature. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Transfer-hydrogenation (TH) has attracted great attention because it does not require the use of high pressure H2. In this work, we report a facile ultrasound-assisted impregnation method with the aid of carbothermal reduction property of activated carbon (AC) to synthesize AC supported copper catalyst (Cu/AC) for efficient TH of bio-derived unsaturated oxygenated compounds such as furfural (FAL) and levulinic acid (LA). In the presence of 2-propanol as the hydrogen donor, within 5 h under 200 °C, the resultant Cu/AC catalyst can convert FAL into 2-methylfuran (2-MF, a high-value fuel additive) with a superior selectivity of 91.6%. The Cu/AC catalyst can also covert LA into γ-valerolactone (GVL) with a high selectivity of 89.9% under 220 °C for 5 h. The superior TH catalytic performance of the Cu/AC catalyst could be attributed to the uniform size and well dispersed Cu nanoparticles supported on the high surface area AC with the suitable proportion of Cu2+, Cu0 and Cu+. Cycling test results confirm the reusability of the Cu/AC catalyst. Additionally, the reported Cu/AC catalyst is cheap and massive producible, advantageous for large-scale conversion of bio-derived platforms to value-added chemicals and bio-fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil from low-cost and renewable lignocellulosic biomass is a complex mixture of organic compounds and water. It is necessary to selectively control the biomass pyrolysis pathways to obtain specific bio-oils rich in value-added chemicals. Microporous and mesoporous catalysts can be good candidates for the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass leading to the production of valuable components such as aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolics. In this study, in-situ catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapours from acid pre-treated walnut shell was carried out in a lab scale fixed bed reactor with microporous nickel or cobalt impregnated Zeolite Socony Mobil–5 and mesoporous aluminum or iron impregnated Santa Barbara Amorf-15 catalysts. The effects of catalyst modification on product yields, bio-oil quality and the variation of the phenolic compounds in pyrolytic-oil were examined using elemental analysis, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major improvement in the bio-oil quality by the catalyst addition was the reduction of the oxygen content of the bio-oil's organic fraction and the increase in valuable chemicals (aromatics and phenolics), while the total liquid yield (bio-oil) decreased. Catalysts also increased the gaseous product yields. In comparison to non-catalytic experiments, all the Proton-exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalysts decreased both the total liquid and the total organic content yield due to the H+-form zeolite catalysing hydrocarbon conversion reactions. Compared to Proton-exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5, the metal impregnated catalysts yielded less water, but favoured the formation of gas products. It was evident that impregnation with metals changed the mechanism of oxygen removal. Cobalt/Proton-exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 favoured the formation of carbon dioxide over carbon monoxide, while nickel/Proton-exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 favoured the formation of carbon monoxide over carbon dioxide. When using Proton-exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 instead of silica sand, the guaicols and syringol that are formed from the thermal decomposition of the lignin fraction in the sulphuric acid treated walnut shell are significantly reduced and are mainly converted to alkylated phenols and aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. With the impregnation of metals on the Santa Barbara Amorf-15, the selectivity of the Santa Barbara Amorf-15 exhibited a shift from catechol- and pyrogallols-type compounds to alkylated phenols, especially at 10% aluminum, 30% and 50% iron metal loadings. As a result, the bio-oil composition and quality can be improved by utilizing different metals and metal impregnation ratios during catalytic upgrading. According to the preliminary economic analysis, pyrolysis oil production cost predicted from catalytic pyrolysis of walnut shell is higher than catalytic pyrolysis of woody biomass because of lower pyrolysis oil yield of walnut shell. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a general agreement about the consideration that the fossil fuels are a limited resource and the emission of carbon dioxide and other harmful products are the main cause of the global warming and climate change. The interest for decreasing the fossil fuels dependence and reducing the greenhouse gases emissions represents a top priority. The biomass is a renewable resource useful for biodiesel and bioethanol production. The latter, most plentiful, is currently considered as green ethanol produced from biomass by biological processes. Meanwhile, membrane reactors represent an innovative and intensified technology for the production and the simultaneous recovery of high-grade hydrogen in only one stage. Here, we describe an efficient medium-temperature (T = 400 °C) bioethanol steam reforming process in a thin (∼5 μm of metallic layer) supported Pd-based membrane reactor packed with a not commercial Co(10%)Pt (3%)/CeO2-ZrO2-Al2O3 bi-metallic catalyst at space velocity between 1900 h−1 and 4800 h−1 and reaction pressure between 1.5 and 2.0 bar. A real bioethanol mixture coming from industry is supplied to the membrane reactor for producing high grade hydrogen, reaching 60% of ethanol conversion (versus ∼ 40% of the equivalent conventional reactor) at 400 °C, 2.0 bar and 1900 h−1, meanwhile recovering almost 70% of the hydrogen produced during the bioethanol steam reforming reaction with a purity higher than 99%. This would make the delivery of hydrogen for PEM fuel cells supplying – and hence the use of green bioethanol as a practical hydrogen carrier – feasible. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of renewable microalgae is a potential promising technology for liquid biofuel production. This paper investigated the effect of ultrasonic pre-treatment of microalgae (Spirulina platensis) on HTL products distribution and oil quality. Cell disruption was enhanced with increasing of ultrasonic power and time. Liquefaction was promoted by larger ultrasonic power, but restrained by prolonged pre-processing time. Such promotion was found more pronounced at relatively lower liquefaction temperature. Combined with FT-IR, GC–MS and TG analysis, the ultrasonic pre-treatment increased the compounds at lower boiling point within the biocrude oil. The distillation characters of the hydrothermal oils were more near to the heavy Iraqi crude, with only 22 wt% in distillation zone of diesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ex-catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and polypropylene (PP) with HZSM-5 was investigated with microwave assistance. The influences of catalytic temperature, feedstock/catalyst ratio, and bamboo/PP ratio on the product yields and chemical components of bio-oil from the co-pyrolysis were studied. When the catalytic temperature, feedstock/catalyst ratio, and bamboo/PP ratio were 250 °C, 1:2, and 2:1, respectively, the bio-oil yield reached its maximum value at 61.62 wt%. The oxygenate proportion compounds decreased with increasing catalyst content. The PP addition improved the proportions of aromatics and naphthenic hydrocarbons. The bio-oil was upgraded significantly from the jet fuel perspective. A synergistic effect also existed between bamboo and PP. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is produced by transesterification of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from oleaginous microalgae feedstock. Biodiesel fuel properties were studied and compared with biodiesel standards. Qualitative analysis of FAME was done while cultivating mixed microalgae consortia under three concentrations of coal fired flue gas (1%, 3.0% and 5.5% CO2). Under 1% CO2 concentration (flue gas), the FAME content was 280.3 μg/mL, whereas the lipid content was 14.03 μg/mL/D (day). Both FAMEs and lipid contents were low at other CO2 concentrations (3.0 and 5.5%). However, mixed consortia in the presence of phosphate buffer and flue gas (PB + FG) showed higher saturated fatty acids (SFA) (36.28%) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) (63.72%) versus 5.5% CO2 concentration, which might be responsible for oxidative stability of biodiesel. Subsequently, higher cetane number (52) and low iodine value (136.3 gI2/100 g) biodiesel produced from mixed consortia (PB + FG) under 5.5% CO2 along with 50 mM phosphate buffer were found in accordance with European (EN 14214) standard. Results revealed that phosphate buffer significantly enhanced the biodiesel quality, but reduced the FAME yield. This study intended to develop an integrated approach for significant improvement in biodiesel quality under surplus phosphorus by utilizing waste flue gas (as CO2 source) using microalgae. The CO2 sequestration from industrial flue gas not only reduced greenhouse gases, but may also ensure the sustainable and eco-benign production of biodiesel. © 2018

AB  - The production of bio-oil and bio-char by fast pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction of Enteromorpha clathrata, rice husk and their mixtures have been compared. The results indicated that hydrothermal liquefaction produced higher yield of bio-oil and lower yield of bio-char for the same raw samples. There were more macromolecules (hexadecanoic acid, cyclopenten and esters), small-molecule hydrocarbons and N-containing compounds in hydrothermal liquefaction bio-oil, while more aromatic substances were observed in fast pyrolysis bio-oils. There was significant difference between E. clathrata bio-oils from these two thermochemical methods C[dbnd]O, CH/CH2/CH3 and N–H functional groups in E. clathrata bio-oil from hydrothermal liquefaction showed stronger absorption strength than bio-oil from fast pyrolysis. However, the only difference between rice husk bio-oil from hydrothermal liquefaction and fast pyrolysis was aromatic ring signal in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy curves. In addition, synergistic effect was investigated during the co-pyrolysis and co-hydrothermal processes. Such synergistic effect led to the improvement recorded in the bio-oil quality by deoxidation reaction to increase the H/C ratio in bio-oil from co-pyrolysis of E. clathrata/rice husk blends, and reduces the O/C ratio in bio-oil from co-hydrothermal process, and also enhances the calorie value of bio-oil. The synergistic effect, however, lowered the co-pyrolysis and co-hydrothermal bio-oils yields. Moreover, the addition of rice husk into E. clathrata promoted the bio-oil conversion efficiency of protein and increased the content of aromatic substances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Detailed investigation on the physicochemical characterization of Malaysian crop and agro-industrial biomass residues has been carried out to identify promising feedstock for thermochemical and biochemical energy yield. This study covered a wide range of biomass residues including oil palm frond (OPF), oil palm trunk (OPT), empty fruit bunches (EFB), palm kernel shell (PKS), rice husk (RH), rice straw (RS) and kenaf biomass (K). From the detailed characterization studies based on proximate composition, CHNS/O analysis, calorific value and lignocellulosic content determination, physicochemical properties of biomass residues were correlated with their potential for bioenergy generation. In addition, various analytical techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TG) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) were used to study various microscopic properties of biomass residues such as functional groups, crystallographic structure, thermal degradation and mineralogical composition, respectively. Results showed that in terms of volatile matter, the order followed was; EFB (83.42%) ˃ K (82.70%) ˃ OPT (81.46%) ˃ OPF (76.98%) ˃ RS (76.42%) ˃ PKS (69.66%) ˃ RH (66.65%). Proximate analysis revealed that RH has the highest ash content (18.82%). Notably, minimum undesirable ash material was generated by K (5.73%), EFB (6.56%) and OPT (7.71%) containing high fractions of catalytic species. PKS presented maximum thermochemical potential with higher heating value of 17.32 MJ/kg followed by K (16.66 MJ/kg), OPT (16.34 MJ/kg), RS (16.15 MJ/kg), EFB (16.07 MJ/kg), OPF (14.49 MJ/kg) and RH (14.37 MJ/kg). Due to highest apparent density and maximum content of fixed carbon as well as lignin, PKS can be an interesting energy resource in thermochemical processes. Compositional analysis revealed that OPF, OPT and K were rich in polysaccharide content with much less quantity of lignin. Based on XRD measurements, it was found that EFB and K would be more susceptible to enzymatic digestion due to lower crystallinity index (CrI) compared to other residues. We believe that these investigations could decisively contribute to a better understanding of the influence of different factors related to lignocellulosic biomass feedstock on the efficiency of conversion and biofuel potential. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work describes the use of an ultrasound system for the enzymatic transesterification of oils using combi-lipases as biocatalyst. The reactions were carried out evaluating the individual use of waste oil and fresh soybean oil, and the immobilized lipases CALB, TLL, and RML were used as biocatalysts. It was performed in a mixture design of three factors to obtain the ideal mixture of lipases according to the composition of fatty acids present in each oil, and the main reaction variables were optimized. After 18 h of reaction, ultrasound provided a biodiesel yield of about 90% when using soybean oil and 70% using the waste oil. The results showed that ultrasound technology, in combination with the application of enzyme mixtures, known as combi-lipases, and the use of waste oil, could be a promising route to reduce the overall process costs of enzymatic production of biodiesel. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To improve the methane yield and digestate utilization of anaerobic digestion (AD), low-cost composited accelerants consisting of urea (0.2-0.5%), bentonite (0.5-0.8%), active carbon (0.6-0.9%), and plant ash (0.01-0.3%) were designed and tested in batch experiments. Total biogas yield (485.7-681.9 mL/g VS) and methane content (63.0-66.6%) were remarkably enhanced in AD systems by adding accelerants compared to those of control group (361.9 mL/g VS, 59.4%). Composited accelerant addition led to the highest methane yield (454.1 mL/g VS), more than double that of control group. The TS, VS, and CODt removal rates (29.7-55.3%, 50.9-63.0%, and 46.8-69.1%) for AD with accelerants were much higher than control group (26.2%, 37.1%, and 39.6%). The improved digestate stability and enhanced fertilizer nutrient content (4.95-5.66%) confirmed that the digestate of AD systems with composited accelerants could safely serve as a potential component of bioorganic fertilizer. These findings open innovative avenues in composited accelerant development and application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, Mahua seed oil was transesterified with methanol using acid and alkaline catalyst process to obtain Mahua Methyl Ester. The chemical composition and physical properties of MME were tested. Experimental tests were investigated to study the performance, combustion and emission on computerized single cylinder CI diesel engine fueled with diesel and B20 (20% (vol.) of MME biodiesel + 80% (vol.) of diesel) along with each of the three nozzles has 3 injection holes, with the aperture of Ø = 0.20 mm (modified), Ø = 0.28 mm (base), and Ø = 0.31 mm (modified). The engine performance, combustion and emission is examined by measuring BSFC, BTE, In-cylinder pressure, MGT, HRR, CO, HC, NOx and smoke opacity. The authentic results were observed by using B20 and smaller orifice NHD. It is observed that smaller orifice NHD improves the air-fuel mixing, atomization, and vaporization which leads to shorter combustion duration. The B20 fuel showed better results such as performance at lower side of partial loads, combustion and emissions than the baseline diesel. The combination of B20 with smaller orifice NHD has shown appreciable results in performance, combustion and emissions. But, the only drawback was NOx is found to be increased. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ketonization of various renewable biomass-derived oxygenated feedstocks such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, and esters is presented. As most previous ketonization reports focused on carboxylic acids, this overview extends the scope to homo-, cross-, and cyclo-ketonization of not only carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric, lactic, valeric, levulinic, dicarboxylic, and higher acids), but also of lesser reported aldehydes (e.g., acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and butyraldehyde), alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol, diols, and higher alcohols), and esters (e.g., small, intermediate, and large alkanoate chain length esters) aiming at obtaining more stable products, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Ketonization of carboxylic acids (e.g., catalysts, mechanisms) is presented to provide the basis for understanding the ketonization of aldehydes, alcohols, and esters over metal oxides including ceria, titania, and zirconia, which have been the most active and studied catalysts for this reaction. Whenever possible, examples of ketonization of biomass-derived oxygenated compounds are presented to highlight the utility of the reaction and its practical application. As biomass product streams can contain a large number of different oxygenated compounds (e.g., more than 350 compounds in bio-oil), ketonization examples in the presence of more than one oxygenated molecule have also been considered. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for biofuel production and treatment of wastewater sludge. The current study investigates a novel utilization of biomass-assisted filtration of primary sludge to obtain high dry matter (DM) content sludge. Drastic improvements in filtration speed are achieved using different types of lignocellulosic biomass filter aids prepared via mechanical pre-treatment. The combined sludge-biomass filter cake is subsequently used as a feedstock for HTL and shows superior bio-crude yields and properties compared to their individual counterparts. The chemical energy recovery to bio-crude is increased to 75% compared to 46% for biomass and 67% for sludge on its own. The increased DM content of filter cakes (∼25%) compared to primary sludge (5%) increases the energy efficiency of HTL of primary sludge by a factor of 4.5. Introducing a biomass filteraid-HTL combination to a wastewater treatment plant would reduce the organic carbon load to treat by 62%. By combining sludge with lignocellulosic biomass the use of alkali catalyst can be avoided entirely which represents a major cost factor in HTL of lignocellulosics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and waste tyres was performed in a fixed-bed reactor using calcined calcite as a catalyst. The organic phase obtained was analysed for its further application as a potential and stable drop-in fuel. Remarkable positive effects were achieved after the joint incorporation of both waste tyres and calcined calcite to grape seeds in the process. More specifically, the addition of considerable amounts of waste tyres (between 20 and 40 wt%) with a constant ratio of feedstock to calcined calcite of 1 were considered the optimal experimental conditions to promote positive synergistic effects on bio-oil yields and its characteristics as a fuel. Thus, when the proportion of waste tyres in the feed reached 40 wt%, the organic phase yield was considerable improved, reaching up values higher than 73 wt%, significantly greater than those obtained from conventional pyrolysis (61 wt%). Moreover, oxygen content was reduced to 4.2 wt%, minimizing any problems related to corrosivity and instability. HHV was enlarged from 15.3 up to 27.3 MJ/kg, significantly increasing the value of the resulting bio-oil. pH values and specially total acid number were also improved reaching values down to 1 mg KOH/gbio-oil in all cases. Additionally, a more valuable chemical composition was achieved since the production of aromatic and cyclic hydrocarbons was maximized, while a significant reduction in phenolic compounds was achieved. Moreover, bio-oil sulphur content was drastically reduced in comparison with the pyrolysis of waste tyres by itself from 0.6 down to 0.2 wt%. The role of calcined calcite was directly related to the promotion of dehydration reactions of acids and phenols in order to generate hydrocarbons. On the other hand, radical interactions between the biomass and waste tyres pyrolysis products played a fundamental role in the production of more valuable compounds. Finally, the CO2 capture effect produced a more environmentally friendly gas while maintaining its calorific value. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from castor oil has been investigated. Five independent variables including; methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, time and stirring rate have been chosen to investigate their effect on biodiesel yield. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) via Rotatable Central Composite Design (RCCD) has been used to evaluate the influence of the independent variables on the reaction response. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been used to investigate the adequacy of the predicted model. The optimum conditions for 97.82% biodiesel yield have been achieved at M:O molar ratio of 5.4:1, potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst concentration of 0.73%, temperature of 64 °C, time of 2.5 h and stirring rate of 320 rpm. The predicted optimum conditions have been validated with 0.59% relative error from experimental results. The kinetic calculations concluded that reaction is pseudo second order with reaction rate constant, activation energy and frequency factor of 0.16 M−1 min−1, 21.95 kJ/mol and 6.02 M−1 min−1, respectively. Finally, a case study investigating the performance and emissions on a direct injection (DI) diesel engine fuelled by biodiesel/petro-diesel blends (5, 10, 15 and 20% v:v) has been performed concluding significant reduction of greenhouse and toxic gases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of modified hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) supported by various Ni loading (5 wt% Ni, 10 wt% Ni, 40 wt% Ni and 100 wt% Ni) have been synthesized and systematically characterized. The resultant Ni catalysts improved the performance of the deoxygenation (DO) of triolein at a reaction temperature of 380 °C in a simple glass batch reactor under a solvent-free condition and are hydrogen-free. The incorporation of Ni loading into the HMS framework casued the catalytic activity to increase when compared to that of HMS. Surprisingly, 10 wt% Ni/HMS catalyst exhibited the highest conversion. It was observed that 10 wt% Ni loading was highly dispersed on the HMS which is capable of achieving 92.5% and 95.2% of conversion and selectivity, respectively. This is due to the synergistic effect of Si-O-Ni bonding and high dispersion of NiO on HMS. In this respect, the nature of catalyst support such as pore size and the high surface areas of HMS play an important role in enhancing the catalytic performance of DO reaction. This study has revealed that Ni/HMS catalyst is a promising catalyst that can be applied to the development of sustainable biofuel from non-edible oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The green macroalga Enteromorpha clathrata was pyrolyzed with or without catalysts at the temperature of 550 °C for producing high-quality bio-oil. The ZSM-5 and 1,2,3 mmol Mg-Ce/ZSM-5 catalysts were introduced to investigate the yields and components distribution of bio-oil. Increase of bio-oil production was obtained with the use of ZSM-5 and 1,2,3 mmol Mg-Ce/ZSM-5 catalysts. The 1 mmol Mg-Ce/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited more promising property for promoting the relative content of C5–C7 compounds, and decreasing the relative content of acids in bio-oil. The results suggested that E. clathrata had potential as pyrolysis feedstocks for producing the high-quality bio-oil with large amounts of C5–C7 compounds and low relative content of acids when the 1 mmol Mg-Ce/ZSM-5 catalyst was used. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of ZSM-5 and 1 mmol Mg-Ce/ZSM-5 catalysts were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A continuous fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis system was designed, fabricated, and tested with sewage sludge. The system is equipped with continuous biomass feeding, mixing of biomass and microwave absorbent, and separated catalyst upgrading. The effect of the sludge pyrolysis temperature (450, 500, 550, and 600 °C) on the products yield, distribution and potentially energy recovery were investigated. The physical, chemical, and energetic properties of the raw sewage sludge and bio-oil, char and gas products obtained were analyzed using elemental analyzer, GC–MS, Micro-GC, SEM and ICP-OES. While the maximum bio-oil yield of 41.39 wt% was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C, the optimal pyrolysis temperature for maximum overall energy recovery was 500 °C. The absence of carrier gas in the process may be responsible for the high HHV of gas products. This work could provide technical support for microwave-assisted system scale-up and sewage sludge utilization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study performed microwave-assisted acid pretreatment on pure lignin. The effects of microwave temperature, microwave time, and hydrochloric acid concentration on characteristics and pyrolysis behavior of lignin were examined. Results of ultimate analysis revealed better properties of all pretreated samples than those of raw lignin. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed breakage of β–O–4 bond and aliphatic side chain, decrease in –OH groups, and formation of C[dbnd]O groups in pretreatment. Microwave temperature exerted more significant influence on lignin structure. Thermal stability of treated lignin was improved and insensitive to short microwave time and acid concentration under mild conditions. Resulting from improved alkyl-phenols and decreased alkoxy-phenols, microwave-assisted acid pretreatment of lignin yielded bio-oil with excellent quality. Total yield of phenols in pyrolysis vapors (200 °C) improved to 14.15%, whereas that of guaiacols decreased to 22.36%. This study shows that microwave-assisted acid pretreatment is a promising technology for lignin conversion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A biorefinery strategy for the coproduction of ethanol and 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), which can be used as polyester and polyurethane component, from lignocellulosic biomass is proposed. This strategy integrates biomass fractionation with simultaneous conversion of hemicellulose and cellulose constituents into 1,5-PDO and ethanol, respectively. An experimentally-based process model is developed to determine the economic potential of the integrated strategy. The coproduction strategy becomes competitive with the ethanol-only strategy when 1,5-PDO can be sold at $1140/ton, which is well below the market price of 1,5-PDO. The most important process parameters include biomass loading for biomass fractionation, enzyme loading for enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation, and overall achievable yields from C5 sugars to 1,5-PDO. © 2017

AB  - Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu-containing enzymes that facilitate the degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides by the oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds. They are gaining rapidly increasing attention as key players in biomass conversion, especially for the production of second-generation biofuels. Elucidation of the detailed mechanism of the LPMO reaction is a major step toward the assessment and optimization of LPMO efficacy in industrial biotechnology, paving the way to utilization of sustainable fuel sources. Here, we used density functional theory calculations to study the reaction pathways suggested to date, exploiting a very large active-site model for a fungal AA9 LPMO and using a celloheptaose unit as a substrate mimic. We identify a copper oxyl intermediate as being responsible for H-atom abstraction from the substrate, followed by a rapid, water-assisted hydroxyl rebound, leading to substrate hydroxylation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cellulose could be effectively hydrolyzed into reducing sugars with a novel sulfonated carbonaceous solid acid. The catalyst bearing both cellulose catalytic sites (–SO3H) and binding sites (–Cl) was synthesized by one-pot carbonization of sucralose with p-toluenesulfonic acid, bypassing the use of concentrated sulphuric acid and without any post-modification. Influences of reaction time and temperature, water content in ionic liquid, dosage of catalyst and substrate on the yield of total reducing sugars (TRS) from cellulose were investigated. A maximum TRS yield of 67.6% was obtained in the 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride at 130 °C in 60 min, which was much higher than that hydrolyzed by the –Cl free solid acid (36.1%). The excellent catalytic performance of the prepared solid acid can be attributed to the synergic effect of –SO3H and –Cl groups. This work provided a green method to synthesize sulfonated carbonaceous solid acid for efficient conversion of biomass into biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The dry and hydrothermal torrefacation of on Camellia Shell (CS) was carried on three different devices- batch autoclave, quartz tube, and auger reactor. The torrefied bio-char products were investigated via TGA, elemental analysis and industrial analysis. Moreover, the pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis properties of torrefied bio-char were investigated. The results showed torrefaction significantly influenced the content of hemicellulose in CS. And hydrothermal torrefaction via batch autoclave and dry torrefaction via auger reactors promoted the hemicellulose to strip from the CS. Quartz tube and auger reactor were beneficial for devolatilization and improving heat value of torrefied bio-char. The result showed that the main products were phenols and acids. And hydrothermal torrefaction pretreatment effectively reduced the acids content from 34.5% to 13.2% and enriched the content of phenols (from 27.23% to 60.05%) in bio-oil due to the decreasing of hemicellulos in torrefied bio-char. And the catalyst had slight influence on the bio-oil distribution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High moisture herbaceous residues (HR) cause a series of environment problems. Torrefaction has proven to be a promising technology for upgrading the fuel properties of biomass. In this study, a typical HR, Licorice residue (LR), was torrefied in a tubular reactor under nitrogen at 210, 240 and 280 °C. The effect of temperature on the fuel properties and the decomposition characteristic of the torrefied samples, as well as the pyrolysis products, were investigated. The mass and energy yield were altered in the range of 91.8–52.3% and 99.3–72.9%, respectively. The higher heating value (HHV) value of the torrefied sample increased by 8.1–39.5% from light to severe torrefaction, compared to untorrefied LR, and reached up to 23.3 MJ/kg at 280 °C. Torrefaction decreased the content of oxygenated organic compounds and the acidity of bio-oil from pyrolysis. The increase in alkanes from torrefied sample pyrolysis implies that torrefied LR has the potential for use in liquid fuel production. The present findings revealed that torrefaction turns industrial LR with poor energy content into a more easily exploitable solid fuel. © 2018

AB  - Biomass has emerged as an abundant and relatively low cost carbon resource alternative to fossil fuel resources in the sustainable production of specialty chemicals and biofuel. Levulinic acid is an attractive platform chemical. Upgrading of levulinic acid produces levulinate esters, which serve as a transportation fuel and fuel additive. The present review focuses on the development of sustainable conversion of biomass into levulinic acid and levulinate esters via ionic liquids dual solvent-catalysts. The synthesis routes of levulinic acid and levulinate esters and the corresponding ionic liquids are introduced. The biomass pretreament, as well as the conversions of lignocellulosic biomass and their derivatives into levulinic acid and levulinate esters, are detailed in relation to the catalytic role, properties, and performance of acidic ionic liquids. Finally, the operating conditions affecting the ionic liquids catalytic conversions are discussed as part of a comprehensive review of this topic. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We reported a facile, economic and green method based on biomimetic mineralization to acquire lipase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower, which was then employed as a biocatalyst for biodiesel production. In the hybrid nanoflower, enzyme molecules and Cu2+ ions were utilized as the organic and inorganic components, respectively. The morphology of nanoflower and the distribution and loading of proteins were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, which indicated the successful encapsulation of lipase in the hybrid nanoflower. Using the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl caprylate as a model, lipase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower was observed to possess favorable catalytic activity and stability in the ester hydrolysis. Further, the hybrid nanoflower was used as a catalyst for biodiesel production, in which it could convert sunflower oil to biodiesel with 96.5% conversion and remain 72.5% conversion after being used for 5 cycles. Thus, the lipase-inorganic hybrid nanoflower is potential to be used as an economically viable biocatalyst for the production of biofuel as the future petrol-fuel replacement. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Upgrading of bio-oil obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae is necessary for it to be used as a fuel. In this study, bio-oil obtained from HTL of Nannochloropsis sp. was upgraded using five different catalysts (Ni/C, ZSM-5, Ni/ZSM-5, Ru/C and Pt/C) at 300 °C and 350 °C. The upgraded bio-oil yields were higher at 300 °C; however, higher quality upgraded bio-oils were obtained at 350 °C. Ni/C gave the maximum upgraded bio-oil yield (61 wt%) at 350 °C. However, noble metal catalysts (Ru/C and Pt/C) gave the better upgraded bio-oils in terms of acidity, heating values, and nitrogen values. The higher heating value of the upgraded bio-oils ranged from 40 to 44 MJ/kg, and the nitrogen content decreased from 5.37 to 1.29 wt%. Most of the upgraded bio-oils (35–40 wt%) were in the diesel range. The major components present in the gaseous products were CH4, CO, CO2 and lower alkanes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of Gracilaria gracilis (G. gracilis) and Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) macro-algae species harvested from Caspian Sea for biocrude oil production under Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) reaction at 350 °C and 15 min has been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of using recycled aqueous phase as the HTL reaction solvent was studied. The biocrude yield for G. gracilis and C. glomerata was 15.7 and 16.9 wt%, respectively with higher heating value (HHV) of 36.01 and 33.06 MJ/kg. The sources of each existing component in bio-oil were identified by GC–MS based on their suggested reaction pathways. Moreover, after two series of aqueous solution recycling, experiments showed that the bio-oil yield significantly increased compared with the initial condition. This increasing directly relates with recovery of carbon content from the aqueous solution residue. © 2017

AB  - Dairy cattle treated wastewaters are potential resources for production of microalgae biofuels. A study was conducted to evaluate the capability of Arthrospira platensis cultivated in dairy farm wastewater for biodiesel production. The biomass of Arthrospira platensis was found to be 4.98 g L−1 and produced 30.23 wt% lipids to dry biomass cultivated in wastewater which was found nitrogen stressed in photo bioreactor. The extracted lipid displayed a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel, although the content of linolenic acid was found a little higher than the standard EN14214. It was found that nitrogen stressed medium increase the total lipid content but temperature and intensities of light were the most important factors to control the quantity of linolenic acid and hence the quality of biodiesel, while the optimum CO2 helped to achieve maximum biomass and triacylglycerols. The Arthrospira platensis offer a good option for the treatment of wastewater before final discharge. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential application of bio-oil production from nitrogen-containing biomass via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) may be limited due to high nitrogen content, making this product oil unsuitable for fuel-related uses. The Maillard reaction is expected to play a most significant role in the interaction between proteins and carbohydrates during the hydrothermal treatment. To evaluate the Maillard reaction network in this process, lactose, maltose, and lysine were employed as model substances and tested individually and in binary mixtures. HTL experiments were conducted at temperatures between 250 and 350 °C and at 20 min reaction time. When treated individually, conversion of lysine leads to higher bio-oil yields (5–17 wt.%) than the model carbohydrates (6–10 wt.%) during HTL. In mixtures with carbohydrates, the measured bio-oil yields exceeded those obtained from conversion of the single substances (10–39 wt.%). Both yields and the relative nitrogen content of the bio-oil, increase with rising reaction temperature. The composition of the bio-oils obtained through HTL experiments was investigated in more detail: cyclopentenes and furfurals were obtained from disaccharide decomposition, piperidines and quinolines in the bio-oil originate from lysine, pyrazine and its derivatives are obtained from the mixture of lysine and disaccharides. A reaction scheme based on key chemical compounds accompanied with functional groups identified by FT-IR and NMR was developed to provide a better understanding of the Maillard reaction and its impact during HTL of protein-containing biomass. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An Enzyme (glucose/O2) BioFuel Cell (EBFC) was developed using glucose oxidase (GOx)-based bioanode and a laccase (Lac)-based biocathode with carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (c-MWCNTs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-modified bacterial cellulose (BC) electrode as the substrate. The open circuit potential (OCP) of the EBFC was inhibited and later activated by the self-powered electrochemical device. The device not only provided high power density (345.14 µW cm−3), but also exhibited an unprecedented broad linear dynamic range from 0 to 50 mM with a lower detection limit of 2.874 μM for glucose concentrations in biological media. This result was attributed to a synergistic mechanism between the enzymes, c-MWCNTs, and AuNPs in which direct electron transfer (DET) was facilitated from the catalytic centers of enzymes to the electrode surface. The BC-based nanocomposites may have great promise as flexible electrodes in the field of self-powered biosensors. © 2018

AB  - Electronic structures of conducting polymers could change in the presence of other conjugated materials. Poly(N-methylthionine) (PNMTh) has a lower conductivity and a slower polymerization rate at conventional electrodes as compared to polyaniline. Here, we present a novel enhanced electroactive and electrochromic PNMTh/electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) composite by the combination of electrochemical reduction and catalytic polymerization: ERGO acts as both the efficient template and catalyst for the NMTh polymerization, and also offers both the high conductivity and large surface area to enhance the electrochemical and electrochromic behaviors of the pure PNMTh. The morphology and composition of the obtained composite was characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), UV–Visible (UV–Vis) spectra, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained PNMTh/ERGO composite has a good potential to be used in (bio-) sensors, biofuel cells, electrochromic devices, and other electrochemical applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Converting lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and bioproducts is significantly hindered by the innate recalcitrance of biomass to chemical and biological breakdown, and it usually requires a pretreatment stage in order to improve conversion yields. A promising novel pretreatment named Cosolvent Enhanced Lignocellulosic Fractionation (CELF) involving dilute acid treatment of biomass in a THF-water mixture was recently developed to overcome biomass recalcitrance. Detailed elucidation of physicochemical structures of the fractionated lignin that is precipitated from CELF pretreatment of hardwood poplar, also called CELF lignin, reveals transformations in its molecular weights, monolignol composition, and hydroxyl group content. Isolated CELF lignin revealed dramatic reductions in its molecular weight by up to ∼90% compared with untreated native lignin. Furthermore, CELF lignin's β-O-4 interunit linkages were extensively cleaved after CELF pretreatment as indicated by a semiquantitative HSQC NMR analysis. This is further evidenced by a 31P NMR analysis showing a significant decrease in aliphatic OH groups due to the oxidation of lignin side chains, whereas the content of total phenolic OH groups in CELF lignin significantly increased due to cleavage of interunit linkages. In conclusion, the CELF process generated a uniquely tunable and highly pure lignin feedstock of low content aryl ether linkages, low molecular weight, and high amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups, suitable for its development into fuels, chemicals, and materials. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The ZnO/Fe3O4/activated carbon (ZnO/Fe3O4/AC) composite was produced via microwave heating with one-pot in the existence of the zinc chloride and iron nitrate to remove the methylene blue (MB), using crofton weed as the precursor. And the produced pyrolysis exhaust can collect the by-products of the bio-oil and bio-gas. The ZnO/Fe3O4/ACs were characterized and analyzed by several techniques. The analysis results show that the ZnO/Fe3O4/AC can be used as the photocatalyst and adsorbent. The photocatalytic experiment indicates that the ZnO/Fe3O4/AC has a good photocatalytic performance for MB under UV light irradiation. The maximum monolayer of MB via adsorption is as high as 267.79 mg/g without UV light irradiation. Moreover, the ZnO/Fe3O4/AC can be easily recyclable from MB wastewater under the external magnetic field owe to the existence of Fe3O4. The bio-oil and bio-gas mainly contain the pyrazole, lkane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which would be used as chemical materials and fuel via further processing. The above-mentioned analyses show that the production method of the ZnO/Fe3O4/AC is feasible, and can obtain three useful productions. © 2018

AB  - Different kinds of catalysts have a great influence on the characteristics and products of the biomass catalytic pyrolysis. Catalysts of Cu/C, Pd/C, Pd–Ag and H-Zeolites socony mobil #5 (HZSM-5) were selected and characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Decomposition behaviors of the larch catalytic pyrolysis were studied by the thermogravimetric analyzer (TG). The total carboxylic acids (TCAs) and total phenolic compounds (TPCs) in bio-oil were determined using the non-aqueous potentiometric titration method. The chemical distribution of bio-oil was investigated by the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results showed that the temperature of the maximum weight loss rate of larch was decreased by adding these four catalysts. The carbon residue rate was increased by using HZSM-5. The content of GC-detected phenols increased from 25.28% to 35.11% (area) by adding Pd/C. However, TCAs in bio-oil were decreased sharply with Pd–Ag and Pd/C. HZSM-5 promoted the formation of phenols and enhanced TPCs in bio-oils (26.56 wt%), which increased by approximately 35% compared to that from the non-catalytic pyrolysis process. This phenol-rich bio-oil can be used to replace the traditional phenol for the manufacturing of high-value biomaterials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper reports the microwave assisted intensification of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using heterogeneous base catalyst - calcium diglyceroxide. Initially, experiments were carried out by varying various parameters such as reaction temperature, catalyst loading, and methanol to waste cooking oil (WCO) molar ratio using one factor at a time (OFAT) approach, to estimate the best condition. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the process variables, using the Box-Behnken model with three level and three factor. Under the optimized reaction conditions of methanol (MeOH) to WCO molar ratio of 7.46:1, catalyst loading of 1.03% (w/w of WCO) and temperature of 62 °C in the presence of microwave, a maximum biodiesel yield of 94.86% was obtained, whereas in the conventional heating method showed 42.59% yield for the similar reaction time of 15 min. Reusability of the catalyst was also tested, after the first run catalytic activity of calcium diglyceroxide was decreased for consecutive cycles. The transesterification of WCO followed pseudo first-order kinetics model. The activation energy and per-exponential factor were found to be 26.56 kJ mol−1 and 1.65 × 103 min−1, respectively. The fuel properties of biodiesel matched with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM-D6751) standards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel generation. Economical and effective mass cultivation is essential for greater feasibility in microalgal-based biofuel full applications. The present study reported on cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 in palm oil mill effluent (POME) under photoautotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation. Enhancement of biomass and lipid productions were carried out by using glucose, urea and glycerol supplementations. Mixotrophic cultivation was more effective than photoautotrophic condition. Glycerol addition exhibited greater microalgae growth performance compared to supplementing glucose or urea. Biomass (1.68 g L−1) and lipid (15.07%) production were highest in POME medium with combinations of 200 mg L−1 urea, glucose and glycerol supplementation. Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 grown in POME with glucose and glycerol supplementation gave considerably comparable yields as in all supplements-added POME medium. Ideal fatty acids compositions shown in urea and glycerol supplemented-POME medium though lower biomass production obtained. The pollutant remediation efficiencies attained were 63.85% COD, 91.54% TN and 83.25% TP in all supplements-added medium. The estimated net energy ratio was 0.55 and nutrient cost could be reduced up to 76%. Cheap and effective carbon and nutrients supplementation is essential to minimize the economic impact and maximize yields in commercial scale microalgae cultivation for biofuel production and environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquefaction of sewage sludge (SS) is a promising technology for the preparation of bio-oil (target product) and biochar (by-product). The liquefaction of SS in ethanol-water cosolvent were preliminarily investigated in this study. There existed synergetic effects between ethanol and water on the liquefaction of SS. Higher bio-oil yield (33.5–36.1 wt%) were obtained in ethanol-water cosolvent, compared to those in pure water (32.2 wt%) and pure ethanol (26.8 wt%). Furthermore, the bio-oil obtained in ethanol-water cosolvent contained higher content of ester components, suggesting higher bio-oil quality. The addition of Na2CO3 further increased the yield of bio-oil (37.5 wt% versus 34.9 wt%), but lowered the quality of bio-oil. The main two types of coke oils in bio-oils were diesel oils and lubricating oils. Elemental, proximate and micromorphology analyses of biochars further indicated that ethanol-water cosolvent had better degradation/transformation effects on SS. The biochars obtained from the liquefaction of SS in ethanol-water cosolvent possessed similar specific surface area (23.0–26.0 m2/g) and pore volume (0.118–0.141 cm3/g) to SS pyrolysis biochar. In view of the yield and quality of liquefaction products, ethanol-water cosolvent may be more proper for the liquefaction of SS, compared to pure water/ethanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to minimize coke formation during microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) of poultry litter for bio-oil production, hierarchical ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst samples are synthesized and employed in this work, and the effect of NaOH concentration used during catalyst preparation on MACFP of poultry litter is investigated. The catalyst characterization results demonstrate that MCM-41 mesoporous structure is formed in hierarchical ZSM-5/MCM-41 catalyst as the outer shell layer coupled with ZSM-5 as the inside core. For product distribution, when the NaOH concentration increases from 1.5 to 3.0 mol/L, the coke yield decreases, the oil fraction yield first decreases and then increases, and the yields of water and gas first increase and then decrease. For chemical compositions in oil fraction, the relative contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing aromatic compounds first increase and then decrease, whereas the relative content of oxygen-containing aliphatic compounds first decrease and then increase. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The performance of HZSM-5 and low cost catalysts, such as the spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst, bentonite, dolomite, and olivine, on the production of high-quality bio-oil during the catalytic pyrolysis of empty fruit bunches (EFBs) was compared in a bench scale fixed bed reactor. The spent FCC and HZSM-5 catalysts showed higher cracking performance than bentonite, dolomite, and olivine. The catalytic pyrolysis of EFB over the spent FCC catalyst showed higher selectivity to phenol (31.5%) and alkyl phenols (26.0%) due to the effective dealkoxylation of guaiacols and syringols, whereas HZSM-5 provided the higher selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons (40.4%). The catalytic pyrolysis of EFB over the spent FCC catalyst and HZSM-5 produced bio-oil with a higher heating value (28.44–31.18 MJ/kg) than other bio-oils obtained over bentonite (27.89 MJ/kg) and olivine (16.83 MJ/kg). The bio-oils obtained from the catalytic pyrolysis of EFB over the spent FCC and HZSM-5 catalysts also had a lower viscosity (7.0–13.5 mm2/s) than those (13.8–22.1 mm2/s) over the other catalysts, even after accelerated aging at 80 °C for 1 day. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil, a promising candidate to replace fossil fuels, has received considerable attention for its sustainability, resource diversity and environmental benefits. Industrial production of bio-oil is urgently needed. In this study, a downdraft circulating fluidized bed reactor commercial-scale fast pyrolysis plant with biomass throughput of 1–3 t h− 1 is studied. Rice husk was processed at a fast pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C to evaluate the plant operation status. The system was continuously operated for 80.42 h. The thermal properties of the feedstock (rice husk), dust (separated from feedstock), char and heat carrier were analyzed and the bio-oil properties such as water content, pyrolytic water content, viscosity, density, pH, heating value, solid content and ash content were analyzed and presented. All the tested properties of the bio-oil meets the pyrolysis liquid biofuels standards in ASTM D7544-12 for Grade G biofuels, except for the water content of the bio-oil, which is slightly higher than that of Grade G biofuels. In energy balance analysis, the potential recovered energy of the three main products was 8.0 ± 1.1, 2.1 ± 0.1 and 5.3 ± 0.7 MJ kg− 1 for bio-oil, char and non-condensable gas, respectively, which shows that the largest portion of the energy in biomass was recovered in the bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Raw kaolinite mineral was modified by alkaline potassium hydroxide solution at 373.15 K for 8 h and calcinated at about 573.15 K to produce a new low cost and eco-friendly heterogeneous catalyst for efficient transformation of commercial waste cooking oil into biofuels (biodiesel). The synthetic catalyst was defined as K+-trapped kaolinite (Kaol/K+) and characterized by XRD, TEM, SEM, BET, and FT-IR in addition to the investigation of other properties as ion exchange capacity and total basicity. Different operating parameters were involved for the transesterification system for waste cooking oil in the presences of Kaol/K+ as a basic catalyst. 343.15 K temperature, 14:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 180 min conversion time, and 15 wt% catalyst loading were defined as the best conditions for maximum production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil with yield percentage of 94.76%. The basicity and catalytic activity of kaolinite/K+ enhanced greatly with increasing the concentration of KOH solution up to 30% and then decreased again with the studied higher concentrations (35% and 40%). The catalyst can be reused for five runs using distilled water, methanol and acetone as washing reagents with clear preferences for organic solvents. The properties of the produced biodiesel in this study match the requirements of ASTM D-6571 specification and EN 14214 specification as the international standards for biodiesel in the world. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is one of the most economical and efficient technologies to convert biomass to bio-oil and valuable chemical products. Co-pyrolysis with hydrogen rich materials such as plastics over zeolite catalysts is one of the significant solutions to various problems of bio-oil such as high oxygen content, low heat value and high acid content. This paper studied pyrolysis of cellulose and polypropylene (PP) separately and co-pyrolysis of cellulose and PP over MCM-41 and Al-MCM-41. The pyrolysis over different heating rates (10 K/min, 20 K/min, 30 K/min) was studied by Thermogravimetry Analysis (TGA) and kinetic parameters were obtained by Coats-Redfern method and isoconversion method. TG and DTG data shows that the two catalysts advance the pyrolysis reaction of PP significantly and reduce its peak temperature of DTG curve from 458 °C to 341 °C. The activation energy of pyrolysis of PP also has a remarkable reduction over the two catalysts. Py-GC/MS method was used to obtain the product distribution of pyrolysis of cellulose and PP separately and co-pyrolysis of cellulose and PP over MCM-41 and Al-MCM-41 at constant temperature of 650 °C. Experiment results proved that co-pyrolysis with PP bring significant changes to the product distribution of cellulose. Oxygenated compounds such as furans are decreased, while yields of olefins and aromatics increase greatly. The yield of furans increases with the catalysis of MCM-41 as for the pyrolysis of cellulose and co-pyrolysis, while the yield of olefins and aromatics both experience significant growth over Al-MCM-41, which can be explained by the abundant acid centers in Al-MCM-41. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wet torrefaction (WT) possesses some advantages over dry torrefaction (DT). In this study, a comparative analysis of torrefied corn stalk from WT and DT was conducted along with an investigation of their pyrolysis properties under optimal conditions for biomass pyrolysis polygeneration. Compared with DT, WT removed 98% of the ash and retained twice the amount of hydrogen. The impacts of DT and WT on the biomass macromolecular structure was also found to be different using two-dimensional perturbation correlation infrared spectroscopy (2D-PCIS). WT preserved the active hydroxyl groups and rearranged the macromolecule structure to allow cellulose to be more ordered, while DT removed these active hydroxyl groups and formed inter-crosslinking structures in macromolecules. Correspondingly, the bio-char yield after WT was lower than DT but the bio-char quality was upgraded due to high ash removal. Furthermore, higher bio-oil yield, higher sugar content, and higher H2 generation, were obtained after WT. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigates the feasibility of synthesis of environmentally benign heterogeneous carbonaceous catalyst and biodiesel production from a single source i.e. Mesua ferrea Linn (MFL) seeds. The study primarily focuses on the optimisation of biodiesel synthesis process considering four parameters viz. reaction time, temperature, catalyst loading and methanol to oil ratio (M/O). The parametric influence on the free fatty acid (FFA) conversion has been studied to evaluate the most significant parameters. The contribution factor and analysis of variance results reveal that temperature is the most significant parameter influencing the FFA conversion followed by reaction time and catalyst content. The optimum conditions observed for maximum FFA conversion of 95.57% were: temperature 55 °C, time 2 h, catalyst content 10 wt% and M/O 6:1. The physico-chemical properties of the produced Mesua ferrea oil methyl ester (MFOME) were analysed following ASTM standard methods and found to be within limit; and compatible with the conventional diesel. Thus, the study suggests that the MFL seeds could be a promising source for the synthesis of an effective heterogeneous catalyst; and eco-friendly energy efficient sustainable fuel through the concept of green chemistry by converting waste into valuable commodity towards mitigation of increased energy demand. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The zirconium-based metal organic framework, UiO-66 (Zr), was successfully synthesized via solvothermal method, followed by various characterization including XRD, thermal analysis, N2 physisorption, and TEM. As-synthesized UiO-66 (Zr) was employed in the transformation of methyl levulinate (ML) to γ-valerolactone (GVL) via catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) under continuous flow and various reaction conditions, which gave superior catalytic performance and efficiency as compared to reported catalysts. The obtained results show great potential of applying UiO-66 (Zr) in upgrading biomass derivatives to useful biofuel/chemical products, paving the way for green energy production from renewable resources. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A set of fixed-bed biomass pyrolysis reactor incorporated with three-stage condensation columns was constructed in this study, and the effects of pyrolysis temperature, carrier gas flow rate and condensation temperature on biomass pyrolysis products were discussed systematically. Results show that as the pyrolysis temperature increased, the yield of liquid products initially increased with a maximum yield at 550 °C and then decreased. When the temperatures of the three-stage condensers were 110 °C, 0 °C, and −196 °C, the highest yields of bio-oil in each condenser were accordingly obtained at 550 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C, respectively. Carrier gas flow rate and fractional condensation temperature indicated minimal influence on the total yield of liquid products. However, fractional condensation temperature had an obvious effect on the yields of the fractions. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that the first fraction contained abundant phenolic compounds, the second fraction contained medium-boiling compounds with relatively high concentrations of water, acids, and ketones and the last fraction contained a minimal amount of hydrocarbons and water. Furthermore, higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in a higher yield of phenol products, whereas higher condensation temperature led to a higher concentration of phenols and dehydrated carbohydrates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic cracking of Swida wilsoniana oil over non-catalyst and various Cu-modified ZSM-5 catalysts doped with different concentration of Cu (0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 wt%) was studied. The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) analysis. Results showed that the introduction of Cu did not change the crystalline structure of ZSM-5 and CuO might deposit on the surface or inside the pores. The numbers of ZSM-5 total acidic sites were increased after it was loaded with 5 wt% and 10 wt% concentration of Cu. The overall hydrocarbon biofuels yields obtained from Cu-modified ZSM-5 catalysts were improved relative to parent ZSM-5. Determination of composition of the hydrocarbon biofuels showed that the hydrocarbon fractions were the main components produced. The optimum Cu concentration used for ZSM-5 modification was 10 wt%, which obtained the highest hydrocarbon biofuels yield (68.20 wt%) and percentage of hydrocarbon fractions content (89.07 wt%). The reuse of Cu-modified ZSM-5 catalysts results showed acceptable levels of reusability after three times regeneration. In addition, the physical properties of the Cu-modified ZSM-5 catalysts produced hydrocarbon biofuels were improved compared to non-catalytic cracking of S. wilsoniana oil. This work showed that the newly developed 10 wt% concentration Cu-modified ZSM-5 was an efficient catalyst for cracking of S. wilsoniana oil for the production of hydrocarbon biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The liquid phase hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol (GUA), a model compound of bio-oil, was studied on bimetallic (PtPd) and monometallic (Ru) catalysts supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate of Al-HMS(X) type with different Si/Al (X) ratios and on mesoporous zirconia modified with silica (m-ZrO2-SiO2) in the presence of methanol as a solvent. The catalysts were characterized by NH3-TPD, TEM, XPS, 27Al and 29Si solid-state NMR and N2 adsorption–desorption methods. The inﬂuence of сatalyst loading, temperature, solvent/guaiacol ratio and contact time on the catalytic performance was investigated. It was established that, decreasing the Si/Al ratio and, correspondingly, increasing the acidity of the catalysts based on Al-HMS led to increasing conversion of guaiacol. Phenol, catechol, and their methylated derivatives were the main products of guaiacol HDO reaction in methanol at low catalyst loading (guaiacol/metal ratio, 800). It was found that the fraction of completely hydrodeoxygenated products (cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane) greatly increased as the catalyst loading grew (guaiacol/metal ratio, 160). Conversion of guaiacol on PtPd/m-ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst was higher than that on PtPd/Al-HMS(10), in accordance with the larger number of acid sites on the catalyst surface; however, the undesirable heavy fraction of methylated by-products was also higher. Ru-based catalysts exhibited the highest catalytic activity and showed unusually high selectivity toward fully hydrodeoxygenated products (cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane) in the HDO of guaiacol in the presence of methanol. Guaiacol can be efficiently converted into alkanes, with quantitative conversion and selectivity to cyclohexanes of 78% over Ru/Al-HMS(10) catalyst under relatively mild conditions (200 °C, 5 MPa H2). Methylation under the influence of methanol, deoxygenation on acid sites and aromatic ring hydrogenation on metal sites proceeded in a parallel way according to the suggested reaction pathways. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present paper, laboratory produced, animal origin biofuels (swine lard and turkey lard had been used as raw material for biofuel production) were evaluated in terms of physicochemical parameters and compared with commercial mineral diesel fuel and its mixture with rapeseed oil methyl esters. Basing on the results of physicochemical parameters assessment, mixtures containing 75% share of bio-component were preselected for further engine tests. The engine tests were performed on a medium-duty, turbocharged, Common Rail, Direct Injection (CRDI) diesel engine, using factory control maps. The scope of experiments included steady state measurements for two rotational speeds (1500 and 3000 RPM), for which full load sweep had been performed. Two injection strategies were utilized: single pulse (for 3000 RPM) and multi-pulse injection (1500 RPM). The research covered evaluation of engine performance parameters and full exhaust emissions. Furthermore, detailed combustion analysis was performed. The study confirmed that high quality fuel can obtained from waste fatty material. The mixtures containing up to 75% of bio-component are suitable for modern CRDI combustion engines, though slight deterioration of engine performance parameters can be expected. An average brake specific fuel consumption increased by 13% compared to reference, for biodiesel mixtures derived from animal fatty material. At the same time a 3% increase against rapeseed oil/diesel mixture was recorded. This was correlated with a minor reduction of brake fuel conversion efficiency, but the average drop didn't exceed 2% for all examined biodiesels. A significant reduction in exhaust gas emissions was observed, when comparing biofuel operation to reference diesel. The use of swine lard methyl ester/diesel mixture caused average reduction of hydrocarbon concentration (THC) by 13%, carbon monoxide (CO) by 22% and carbon dioxide (CO2) by 7%. The turkey biodiesel emission results were respectively: 9%, 20% and 6% reduced. NOx emission increased on average by 7% for both animal origin biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for crude bio-oil production from a variety of biomass, however, there is a lack of prediction models for the yield of products and the reaction pathways is not well understood. Prediction models for biocrude yield and solid residue (SR) yield were developed by using a mixture design of five model components, including xylan (hemicellulose), crystalline cellulose, alkaline lignin, soya protein and soybean oil in this study. The model predictability was verified by using actual feedstock as well as a mixture of model components based on the chemical composition of the feedstock of concern. The biocrude yield, solid residue yield and quantitative chemical yields obtained from bio-oil were used to explore the reaction pathways as well as possibly existing synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions between two studied model components. It was found that both hemicellulose and lipid (H∗Lip) and cellulose and lipid (C∗Lip) interactions had synergistic effect on the biocrude yield, while SR yield was antagonistically decreased by the cellulose and lignin (C∗Lig) interaction. Maillard reactions between protein and carbohydrates and amide formation between protein and lipid were observed. The carbohydrates and lipid interactions had effects on the acid yield (in H∗Lip), hydrocarbon yield and ketone yield (in C∗Lip), but lignin and lipid (in Lig∗Lip) behaved independently in the HTL processes. The findings of this research can be used to assess the potential of various kinds of biomass, provide guidance for using mixed biomass (co-liquefaction) and tailor the chemical composition of feedstock for a desirable product distribution in HTL processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of moso bamboo with the activated carbon-supported iron(III) ion catalyst was carried out with the aim of obtaining high quality and quantity syngas(H2 + CO). The effect of the catalyst on moso bomboo pyrolysis involving the temperature-rising characteristics, product distribution, tar conversion and gas compositions were investigated. The results indicated that the catalyst improved the microwave-absorption capability and increased the maximum reaction temperatures. The formation of gases was promoted by the catalyst mainly at the expense of the tar, indicating the catalyst had an excellent activity for the tar conversion.The catalyst had the positive influence on the formation of syngas with the maximum content reaching up to 81.14 vol% with H2/CO being 1.04 and inhibited the production of CH4 and CO2. The loading of iron(III) ion into activated carbon exerted a significant influence on bamboo pyrolysis. The addition of the catalyst increased the thermal efficiency of the reaction system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of carbonaceous solid acid catalysts were prepared by facile carbonization and sulfonation of biorenewable feedstocks (i.e., glucose, sucrose, starch and cellulose), and employed for directly converting carbohydrates in ethanol medium to synthesize 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF). The carbonization temperature of cellulose and starch (500 °C) was required to be higher than that of glucose and sucrose (400 °C) to realize high –SO3H density and EMF yield. Based on rich exploitability of cellulose and good activity of its derived carbonaceous catalyst, magnetic cellulose-derived carbonaceous solid acid (MCC-SO3H) was subsequently synthesized, which possessed a porous structure with BET surface area of 35.34 m2 g–1, high –SO3H density (1.28 mmol g–1) and sufficient magnetism for separation (1.99 emu g–1). By optimizing the process variables, a maximum EMF yield of 63.2% could be achieved from fructose at 120 °C, and ethyl levulinate formation was favored at elevated temperature. The MCC-SO3H catalyst could be readily separated from the reaction mixture by an external magnet with recovery rate of 92.6% after six successive runs, and reused repeatedly with little deactivation. Besides, this catalyst was efficient for the one-pot transformation of fructose-based polysaccharides into EMF, affording yields of 51.3% and 32.5% from inulin and sucrose, respectively. With glucose as the substrate, instead ethyl glucoside with a high yield of 86.5% was obtained. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lithium doped ceria loaded SBA-15 has been synthesised under normal atmospheric condition (without using hydrothermal treatment) and following wet impregnation route. The catalyst has been characterised by using different techniques viz., BET method for surface area measurements, FE-SEM for surface morphology study, XPS for the determination of catalyst composition and element oxidation state. The catalyst was found to possess both acidic and basic sites and hence, successfully employed for the simultaneous esterification and transesterification of waste cottonseed oil. Under optimized reaction conditions of catalyst concentration 10 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 40:1 at 65 °C, the catalyst was able to give &gt;98% fatty acid methyl ester yield within 4 h of reaction time. The catalyst was recovered and reused during 5 successive runs without any significant loss of activity. The activation energy (Ea) for the reaction was found to be 57.7 kJ mol−1, while ΔH‡, ΔG‡ and ΔS‡ were found to be 59.4 kJ mol−1, +95.9 kJ mol−1and - 0.108 kJ mol−1, respectively. On the basis of thermodynamic parameters, the reaction is expected to be endothermic, non spontaneous and following an associative pathway. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesels derived from microalgae oil promise to be an alternative for the conventional diesel fuel due to their similarity in properties. In this present work, Ce–Ru–O catalysts are used as an additive to the NOME in the form of an emulsion. A single-cylinder, four-stroke direct injection compression ignition engine is made to run on B20+CeO2, and B20 dozed with different dosage levels of Ce0.95Ru0.05O2, Ce0.9Ru0.1O2, and Ce0.8Ru0.2O2 microemulsions. Ce–Ru–O at different concentrations is used to study the effect of metal oxide on emission characteristics of the fuel. Experimental results show that addition of microemulsion has a positive effect on emission characteristics and also acts as an oxidation catalyst. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) can chemically convert sewage sludge (SS) into a crude bio-oil (biocrude) and other by-products. This work systematically elucidates how the yields and compositions of different products (e.g., gases, biocrude and solids) vary with temperature (260–350 °C) in SS HTL with 10 min of residence time. The results show that increasing temperature improved the biocrude quality and the gas yield, declined the water-soluble substance yield, the solid yield, and the TOC (total organic carbon) content in aqueous phase, while the biocrude yield and the NH3-N (ammonia nitrogen) content in the aqueous phase first raised and then decreased, and reached the maximum values at 340 °C. After SS HTL at 340 °C, light biocrude, light solids, water-soluble organic matters accounted for about 54.4, 50.5, 88.9 wt% of total biocrude, solids and water-soluble substances, respectively. The N and S contents in the light biocrude almost halved compared with those in the heavy biocrude. The light solids contained a higher C content but lower Al, Si, Ca and Fe contents than did the heavy solids. &gt;93.0 wt% of Cu, Zn and Cr remained in the solids in contrast to 0.5–1.0 wt% in the aqueous phase and 0.2–4.7 wt% in the biocrude. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel cell (BFC)-based self-powered biosensors have attracted substantial attentions because of their unique merits such as having no need for power sources (only two electrodes are needed). More importantly, in case it can also work in a homogeneous system, more efficient and easy-to-use bioassays could come true. Thus, herein, we proposed a novel homogeneous self-powered biosensing strategy via the integration of BFCs and a homogeneous electrochemical method, which was further utilized for ultrasensitive microRNA (miRNA) detection. To construct such an assay protocol, the cathodic electron acceptor [Fe(CN)6]3- was entrapped in the pores of positively charged mesoporous silica nanoparticles and capped by the biogate DNAs. Once the target miRNA existed, it would trigger the controlled release of [Fe(CN)6]3-, leading to the dramatic increase of the open circuit voltage. Consequently, the "signal-on" homogeneous self-powered biosensor for the ultrasensitive miRNA assay was realized. Encouragingly, the limit of detection for the miRNA-21 assay was down to 2.7 aM (S/N = 3), obviously superior to those of other analogous reported approaches. This work not only provides an ingenious idea to construct the ultrasensitive and easy-to-use bioassays of miRNA but also exhibits a successful prototype of a portable and on-site biomedical sensor. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Raw bio-oil was produced from fast pyrolysis of pine sawdust in a fluidized-bed boiler at 550 °C. Then the raw bio-oil is partially mixed with kitchen waste oil (100:0, 50:50, 0:100 by weight) and subsequently subjected to off line co-catalytic cracking process for upgrading over HZSM-5. The raw bio-oil mixed with kitchen waste oil test shows that the co-catalytic cracking improves the organic bio-oil yield and inhibits the coke formation. The oxygen content of organic bio-oil decreased significantly after upgrading. The reaction pathway of co-upgrading is proposed, which shows that kitchen waste oil, as a hydrogen supplier, transform hydrogen from high saturation degree to the unsaturation oxygenated compounds to form hydrocarbons. Co-catalytic cracking process of raw bio-oil and kitchen waste oil not only can be used in raw bio-oil upgrading but also can recycle kitchen waste oil with relatively low cost. Moreover, the deactivation catalysts are analyzed by TG-FTIR (Thermogravimetric-Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The thermal cracking of waste cooking oil (WCO) via pyrolysis was performed using a laboratory scale fixed-bed reactor. The effects of the final pyrolysis temperature (from 550 °C to 800 °C) and the heating rate (5 °C/min, 15 °C/min, 20 °C/min, 25 °C/min) on pyrolysis products distribution has been investigated and a maximum bio-oil yield of 80 wt% has been obtained at 800 °C and 15 °C/min. The bio-oil fuel properties shows that this pyrolytic oil has high caloric value (HHV around 8843 kg/Kcal) promoting its use as a liquid fuel but some other properties (high acidity index around 126.8 mg KOH/g sample and high viscosity about 8.95 cSt) need to be upgraded. The GC/MS characterization of the bio-oil highlights its high molecular complexity allowing it to be used as source of chemical products and of active molecules. The syngas heating value (reaching 8 MJ/kg) is suitable for its application as source of energy for the pyrolysis reactor. The remaining biochar is suitable for application as fertilizer since it is rich of iron and organic carbon. The stochiometric model of WCO pyrolysis has been established basing on the pyrolysis products yields, the CHNS-O composition of raw material and remaining biochar, and the syngas chemical composition. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drop-in fuels have aroused great interest for automotive and aeronautical use, constituting the newest area of biofuel research. These fuels do not contain oxygen, like fossil fuels, and require no modifications to engines and distribution infrastructure. In this work, biohydrocarbons were obtained in the distillation ranges of gasoline, diesel and aviation kerosene from palm kernel oil and palm olein in the form of triglycerides or their hydrolysates. A 15% ratio of the thermally activated HBeta zeolite catalyst to the mass of the fatty material was used. Deoxygenation reactions (5 h, 800 rpm, batch reactor) occurred at 350 °C under 10 bar H2 atmosphere to furnish as much as 96% conversion to liquid hydrocarbons. The products were analyzed by FTIR for a rapid quantification of the deoxygenation efficiency using a method developed for this purpose. These products were also characterized by thermal analysis and GC–MS. The freezing temperatures of the biohydrocarbons and their mixtures with fossil aviation kerosene were determined by DSC. The results obtained were very promising, especially considering the relatively mild process conditions as low H2 pressure and catalyst without noble metal and with high reusability. © 2018

AB  - This study investigates the use of combination of metal and solid-base catalysts for effective depolymerization of lignin into monophenol-rich bio-oil in supercritical ethanol through a synergy of base-catalyzed solvolysis and metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis. The results showed that a combined catalyst of Ru/C and MgO/ZrO2 resulted in a significant decrease in the molecular weight of bio-oil, an increase in the yield of phenolic monomers, and the improved deoxygenation degree of bio-oil compared to the single catalyst condition. The synergic role of metal and base catalysts during lignin depolymerization was examined through comprehensive analysis of reaction products. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Activated carbon is known to enhance methane formation in anaerobic reactors via interspecies electron transfer between fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Biochar, a by-product of biomass pyrolysis process, could also perform similar functions due to its conductive properties and the presence of redox active moieties. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of activated carbons and biochars on anaerobic digestion. Biochars obtained from canola meal, switchgrass and Ashe juniper were tested for methane production from both glucose and aqueous phase of bio-oil generated via hydrothermal liquefaction of algae. The results suggested that absorbents enhanced methane production. Furthermore, biochars synthesized at intermediate temperatures significantly increased methane yield and reduced the lag time required for methane formation. In addition, the results suggested that the redox active moieties such as quinones and phenazines in biochars are responsible for electron transport, which ultimately enhanced methane production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ever-increasing energy requirements coupled with the desire to cope with global warming have motivated researchers to look for alternative energy resources. Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable energy resource which can be exploited to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel resources. Acacia cincinnata and Acacia holosericea are fast-growing tree species which produce large quantities of biomass within short span of time and does not require major agricultural inputs to grow. This study is aimed at the intermediate pyrolysis process of Acacia cincinnata and Acacia holosericea species to produce biofuels such as bio-oil, biochar and gaseous product. Mass balance was done to calculate the yields of different products along with the characterisation of bio-oil and biochar produced. Experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at the pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, heating rate of 25 °C/min and nitrogen gas flowrate of 100 cm3/min for the biomass feedstock having particle size between 0.5 and 1 mm. Comprehensive thermochemical characterisation of biomass samples was carried out prior to pyrolysis experiments. The chemical composition of bio-oil samples produced was determined using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) technique. Ultimate analysis, calorific values, pH values and the ash contents in the bio-oil samples were also determined. Bio-oil produced were reported to be complex mixtures of heterocyclic and phenolic compounds resulting from the thermal degradation of basic components of biomass with the calorific values obtained in the range of 23.46–30.65 MJ/kg. Biochar samples produced in the study were characterised with the help of ultimate analysis, FTIR analysis, calorific values, pH values and SEM and EDX analysis. Properties of biochars indicated suitability for energy as well as other applications such as soil remediation and adsorption purposes. Study revealed a decent potential of Acacia cincinnata and Acacia holosericea species as biofuels resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, energy is the most challenging issue in the world. Although nanotechnology has been promising in offering huge developments in various fields, there are still concerns about the potential threats of nanotechnology products and applications. The concerns are mostly about the possible entrance of nanoparticles into body and their toxicity. As metallic and metal oxide nanoparticles might have toxic effects on living organisms, the use of biocompatible nanoparticles can considerably reduce these concerns. In this research, a combination of diesel-biodiesel-water-biodegradable nanoparticles was used to optimize fuel consumption, reduce pollutants, and enhance diesel engine performance for first time. Carbon quantum dot nanoparticles were synthesized through the hydrothermal method using orange peel and were then characterized thoroughly. Water and quantum dot nanoparticles were added to the B15 fuel (diesel fuel containing 15% biodiesel) in various concentrations. Then, engine performance experiments were performed using a single cylinder engine to investigate functional parameters and assess exhaust pollutants. The obtained results showed that the addition of water and quantum dot nanoparticles to the B15 fuel causes an increase in engine torque and power and decreases the brake specific fuel consumption. This is due to the better mixing of the fuel and air in combustion chamber and provision of more oxygen. It was also revealed that the use of emulsion nanofuels decreases the emission of unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx). By employing the B15W5-CQD60 fuel (B15 fuel containing 5% water and 60 ppm carbon quantum dots), diesel engine power at the rate of 2700 rpm was increased by 21% compared with the B15 pure fuel. Furthermore, using the B15W10 fuel (B15 fuel containing 10% water), NOx emission was decreased by 25% on average compared with the B15 pure fuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The photoenzymatic decarboxylation of fatty acids to alkanes is proposed as an alternative approach for the synthesis of biodiesel. By using a recently discovered photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) we demonstrate the irreversible preparation of alkanes from fatty acids and triglycerides. Several fatty acids and their triglycerides are converted by CvFAP in near-quantitative yield and exclusive selectivity upon illumination with blue light. Very promising turnover numbers of up to 8000 were achieved in this proof-of-concept study. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

AB  - Waste chicken eggshells were used to derive two catalysts labeled in this study as Eggshell-CaOC-H-D and Eggshell-CaDG. Both these catalysts were characterized by FTIR, XRD, BET, SEM, and basic strength was determined by the Hammett indicator method. The transesterification of waste cooking oil was carried out to compare the catalytic activity of Eggshell-CaDG and Eggshell-CaOC-H-D. The effect of various reaction parameters-methanol molar ratio, temperature, speed of agitation, and catalyst loading on the progress of the reaction was also tested to produce higher biodiesel yield. Eggshell-CaDG catalyzed reaction produced 96.07% biodiesel under the optimized reaction conditions of methanol molar ratio 10:1, catalyst loading 1.50 wt%, temperature 60 °C and speed of agitation 300 rpm with a reaction time of 50 min. Whereas, Eggshell-CaOC-H-D was yielded 93.10% biodiesel for the optimized operating parameters-methanol molar ratio 12:1, 400 rpm, 65 °C, catalyst loading of 3 wt% in the reaction time of 90 min. The reusability for both the catalysts was tested up to five cycles and found that biodiesel yield was decreased with successive cycles. The activation energies of the Eggshell-CaDG and Eggshell-CaOC-H-D were found to be 31.39 and 54.05 kJ mol−1, respectively. The physicochemical properties of the biodiesel were also found as per the ASTM standard range. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A sequential two-stage pretreatment process comprising alkaline pre-extraction and alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment (AHP) was investigated to convert bamboo carbohydrates into bioethanol. The results showed that mild alkaline pre-extraction using 8% (w/w) sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 100 °C for 180 min followed by AHP pretreatment with 4% (w/w) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was sufficient to generate a substrate that could be efficiently digested with low enzyme loadings. Moreover, alkali pre-extraction enabled the use of lower H2O2 charges in AHP treatment. Two-stage pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis with only 9 FPU/g cellulose led to the recovery of 87% of the original sugars in the raw feedstock. The use of the pentose-hexose fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae SR8u strain enabled the utilization of 95.7% sugars in the hydrolysate to reach 4.6% w/v ethanol titer. The overall process also enabled the recovery of 62.9% lignin and 93.8% silica at high levels of purity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomasses such as banana pseudostem are attractive cellulose sources for bioenergy production, and for the use in biorefinery processes. However, pretreatment of lignocellulosic material is required to remove hemicellulose and lignin, while increasing cellulose accessibility to enzymatic hydrolysis (i.e., decreasing biomass recalcitrance). The effect of different concentrations of acid (H2SO4), alkaline (NaOH) and peroxide (H2O2) pretreatments on the chemical composition, cellulose accessibility, and enzymatic digestibility of banana pseudostem were studied. The water insoluble solids (WIS) recovery was low (∼30%) for the severe pretreatment conditions applied, indicating high material solubilization. Acid pretreatment completely removed the hemicellulose content, whereas alkaline and peroxide pretreatments reduced its amount to 4.38 and 8.68%, respectively. In contrast, the lignin content increased (from 17.26 to 39.99%) after severe acid pretreatment, while alkaline and peroxide pretreatments reduced the lignin content to 7.65% and 7.17%, respectively. In line with hemicellulose and lignin removal, the cellulose content increased from 60.84 to 75.48 and 74.37%, respectively for alkaline and peroxide pretreatments, with no alteration for acid. Dye adsorption assays showed that alkaline and acid pretreatments resulted in high internal and external specific surface areas – indicative of high cellulose accessibility – when compared with peroxide pretreatments. Overall, alkaline and acid pretreatments resulted in the highest glucose yields from enzymatic hydrolysis of banana pseudostem, compared with peroxide pretreatment. In conclusion, concentrations of each pretreatment that led to the highest glucose yields was identified, confirming that the banana pseudostem is a great source of fermentable sugars, with high potential for biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fabrication and performance of a flexible and stretchable microbial fuel cell (MFC) monolithically integrated into a single sheet of textile substrate are reported. The single-layer textile MFC uses Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) as a biocatalyst to produce a maximum power of 6.4 µW cm−2 and current density of 52 µA cm−2, which are substantially higher than previous textile-MFCs and are similar to other flexible paper-based MFCs. The textile MFC demonstrates a stable performance with repeated stretching and twisting cycles. The membrane-less single-chamber configuration drastically simplifies the fabrication and improves the performance of the MFC. A conductive and hydrophilic anode in a 3D fabric microchamber maximizes bacterial electricity generation from a liquid environment and a silver oxide/silver solid-state cathode reduces cathodic overpotential for fast catalytic reaction. A simple batch fabrication approach simultaneously constructs 35 individual devices, which will revolutionize the mass production of textile MFCs. This stretchable and twistable power device printed directly onto a single textile substrate can establish a standardized platform for textile-based biobatteries and will be potentially integrated into wearable electronics in the future. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Supported bimetallic catalysts have been demonstrated to enhance catalytic activity, product selectivity, and catalyst stability over supported monometallic catalysts for a range of catalytic reactions. However, the surface structure and composition of bimetallic particles can differ significantly from the bulk due to variations in surface energies and interactions with adsorbates, making the design of bimetallic catalysts with targeted properties and reactivities challenging. We report here the influence of catalyst support (Al2O3 and TiO2) on the surface composition and structure of bimetallic Cu-Ni nanoparticles with varying Ni weight loading (0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, and 10 wt %) at a constant Cu loading of 5 wt % and a correlation to catalytic reactivity and stability in furfural (FF) hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Analysis via depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that over a range of Ni compositions in Cu-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, Cu and Ni were distributed evenly within bimetallic particles, although Cu and Ni segregated into contiguous monometallic domains at the particle surfaces. In contrast, on Cu-Ni/TiO2 catalysts near surface alloys formed, which were enriched in Cu at the particle surfaces and exposed only dispersed Ni species. The difference in compositional structure of the Cu-Ni particles on TiO2 and Al2O3 was attributed to strong and specific interactions between Ni and TiO2. On both supports the addition of Ni to Cu catalysts resulted in enhancements in the rate of FF HDO, although Al2O3 supported bimetallic catalysts promoted hydrogenation of the furan ring, forming mostly furfural alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, while TiO2 supported catalysts mostly resulted in carbonyl hydrogenolysis to form methyl furan (MF). Through optimization of support and bimetallic compositions, low-cost bimetallic catalysts were developed that demonstrated &gt;90% MF yields in FF HDO with good stability and regenerability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the study, to improve the efficiency of acid-catalyzed biodiesel production process, three acidic imidazolium ionic liquids were synthesized and employed to the production of biodiesel from palm oil under microwave irradiation. The prepared ionic liquids were characterized by NMR, FT-IR and TG-DTG. Among the three ionic liquids, ([HSO3-BMIM]HSO4) was proved to be the most suitable catalyst because of the excellent catalytic performance. Single factor experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) were conducted to investigate various reaction conditions to obtain the optimal condition, and the results indicated that ionic liquid dosage was the most significant variable. A maximal yield of 98.93% was obtained while mole ratio of methanol to oil, ionic liquid dosage, microwave power and reaction time were 11:1, 9.17%, 168 W and 6.43 h, respectively. We also studied the kinetic of transesterification under microwave irradiation, which could be appropriately expressed by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Compared with conventional experiments, microwave irradiation can be regarded as an efficient process intensification method for biodiesel production which has the capacity to shorten reaction time and save energy up to more than 44%. In addition, the ionic liquid catalyst showed excellent operational stability with biodiesel yield of 84.76% after six cycles. © 2017

AB  - Here, the potential use of herbal residues of Akebia as feedstock for ethanol production is evaluated. Additionally, five deep eutectic solvents from hemicellulose-derived acids were prepared to overcome biomass recalcitrance. Reaction temperatures had more significant influences on solid loss and chemical composition than the molar ratios of choline chloride (ChCl) to derived acids. Glycolic acid resulted in the maximum levels of lignin, xylan and glucan removal, which were 60.0%, 100% and 71.5%, respectively, at 120 °C with a 1:6 M ratio of ChCl-glycolic acid. In contrast, ChCl-formic acid resulted in the greatest level of glucan retention, at 97.8%, with a lignin removal rate of 40.7% under the same pretreatment conditions. Moreover, ChCl loading could significantly enhance the selectivity of carboxylic acid for lignin dissolution. A 98.0% level of subsequent enzymatic saccharification and a 100% ethanol yield were achieved after ChCl-formic acid pretreatments of Akebia’ herbal residues. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A simple, noncovalent modification strategy was proposed to synthesize poly-l-lysine-black phosphorus (pLL-BP) hybrid. BP nanoflakes were prepared with a water-phase exfoliation method. pLL can adhere to the surface of BP via hydrophobic interaction between butyl chains of pLL and the BP surface as well as the electrostatic interaction between the protonated amino groups on pLL and the negative charge on deprotonated PxOy groups remaining on BP. The as-synthesized pLL-BP hybrid turns out to be an ideal matrix for hemoglobin immobilization and direct electron transfer. Good conductivity and biocompatibility of BP maintain the native structure and the bioactivity of hemoglobin (Hb), facilitating the direct electron transfer between the electroactive center of Hb and electrode. The rate constant (kET) for direct electron transfer of Hb@pLL-BP is calculated to be 11.24 s-1. The constructed Hb-pLL-BP based enzymatic electrochemical biosensor displays excellent catalytic activity toward the reduction of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The electrochemical response toward H2O2 exhibits a linear dependence on hydrogen peroxide concentration ranging between 10 μM and 700 μM. The results demonstrate that the pLL-BP hybrid can act as a biocompatible building block for the construction of novel biofuel cells, bioelectronics, and biosensors. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) has emerged as an attractive process for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into renewable fuels and products. Considerable research and development has focused on using circulating-bed reactors with zeolite catalysts (e.g., HZSM-5) for CFP because of their propensity to form gasoline-range aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the high selectivity for aromatics comes at the expense of low carbon yield, a key economic driver for this process. In this contribution, we evaluate non-zeolite catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor configuration for an integrated CFP process to produce fuel blendstocks from lignocellulosic biomass. These experimental efforts are coupled with technoeconomic analysis (TEA) to benchmark the process and guide research and development activities to minimize costs. The results indicate that CFP bio-oil can be produced from pine with improved yield by using a bifunctional metal-acid 2 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor operated with co-fed H2 at near atmospheric pressure, as compared to H-ZSM5 in a circulating-bed reactor. The Pt/TiO2 catalyst exhibited good stability over 13 reaction-regeneration cycles with no evidence of irreversible deactivation. The CFP bio-oil was continuously hydrotreated for 140 h time-on-stream using a single-stage system with 84 wt% of the hydrotreated product having a boiling point in the gasoline and distillate range. This integrated biomass-to-blendstock process was determined to exhibit an energy efficiency of 50% and a carbon efficiency of 38%, based on the experimental results and process modelling. TEA of the integrated process revealed a modelled minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $4.34 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE), which represents a cost reduction of $0.85 GGE-1 compared to values reported for CFP with a zeolite catalyst. TEA also indicated that catalyst cost was a significant factor influencing the MFSP, which informed additional CFP experiments in which lower-cost Mo2C and high-dispersion 0.5 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized and evaluated. These materials demonstrated CFP carbon yield and oil oxygen content similar to those of the 2 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalyst, offering proof-of-concept that the lower-cost catalysts can be effective for CFP and providing a route to reduce the modelled MFSP to $3.86-3.91 GGE-1. This report links foundational science and applied engineering to demonstrate the potential of fixed-bed CFP and highlights the impact of coupled TEA to guide research activities towards cost reductions. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microwave pyrolysis of moso bamboo over bamboo-based biochar catalyst was conducted to achieve the bio-oil upgrading and high quality syngas production. The influence of the biochar on bamboo pyrolysis involving the temperature rise, product yield, and bio-oil and gas compositions was studied. The gas production was facilitated by the biochar mainly at the cost of the bio-oil, indicating the biochar had an excellent activity for the bio-oil cracking. The main compositions in bio-oil were acetic acid and phenol with the total contents ranging from 73.145% to 82.84% over the biochar catalysts, suggesting the upgrading of the bio-oil were achieved. The biochar exerted a positive effect on the syngas (CO + H2) production with the maximum content reaching up to 65.13 vol% at the 20 wt% addition amount of biochar under microwave condition. The biochar became more effective on the bio-oil upgrading and syngas production under microwave heating than conventional heating. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The thermal degradation behaviour and kinetic parameter of non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of rice husk (RH) using rice hull ash (RHA) as catalyst were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis at four different heating rates of 10, 20, 50 and 100 K/min. Four different iso conversional kinetic models such as Kissinger, Friedman, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW) were applied in this study to calculate the activation energy (EA) and pre-exponential value (A) of the system. The EA of non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis was found to be in the range of 152–190 kJ/mol and 146–153 kJ/mol, respectively. The results showed that the catalytic pyrolysis of RH had resulted in a lower EA as compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis of RH and other biomass in literature. Furthermore, the high Gibb's free energy obtained in RH implied that it has the potential to serve as a source of bioenergy production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study conducted the updated simulations to depict a life cycle analysis (LCA) of the biodiesel production from soybeans and other feedstocks in the U.S. It addressed in details the interaction between LCA and induced land use change (ILUC) for biodiesel. Relative to the conventional petroleum diesel, soy biodiesel could achieve 76% reduction in GHG emissions without considering ILUC, or 66–72% reduction in overall GHG emissions when various ILUC cases were considered. Soy biodiesel's fossil fuel consumption rate was also 80% lower than its petroleum counterpart. Furthermore, this study examined the cause and the implication of each key parameter affecting biodiesel LCA results using a sensitivity analysis, which identified the hot spots for fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions of biodiesel so that future efforts can be made accordingly. Finally, biodiesel produced from other feedstocks (canola oil and tallow) were also investigated to contrast with soy biodiesel and petroleum diesel. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - In this paper, we have produced bio diesel from papaya and watermelon seed oil by trans-esterification process using methanol and KOH (catalyst) and a new biodiesel i.e. WP is produced which is a mixture of papaya seed oil biodiesel and watermelon seed oil biodiesel in 1:1 ratio is prepared. The blends (B0, B20, B30, B40, and B100) of WP with diesel and watermelon 100% and papaya 100% are used for further testing. The performance, combustion and emission test were conducted on single cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine using different blends of these biodiesels and the results showed that B20 is superior blend among other biodiesel blends. Further the performance and combustion characteristics of B20 is very close to diesel while the emission characteristics of B20 is better than that of diesel as the emission of CO, HC and smoke is 27.27%, 23.8%, 8.3% less for B20 than diesel respectively. Thus we concluded that B20 is the most suitable blend of WP for substitute of diesel which will reduce diesel consumption by 20%. © 2017

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae Nannochloropsis (NAS) over various transition metal M/TiO2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, and Mn) was investigated. Ni/TiO2 was the most effective catalyst to improve the yield and quality of biocrude and the liquefaction conversion. Ni/TiO2 was characterized by XRD, XRF, and XPS. The research of Effect of reaction temperature on HTL of NAS over Ni/TiO2 suggested that 300 °C led to a maximum biocrude yield of 48.23% and the highest liquefaction conversion of 89.28%. Adding Ni/TiO2 catalyst reduced the viscosity and provided more light-fraction in biocrude while brought a slight increase in total acid number (TAN). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis demonstrated that adding Ni/TiO2 considerably changed the composition of biocrude and the possible pathways were discussed. Reproduction test showed the Ni/TiO2 has an excellent reproduction ability in HTL of NAS. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - In this study, freshwater (Scenedesmus quadricauda, Sq) and marine water (Tetraselmis suecica, Ts) microalgae were used for the treatment of dairy wastewater (DWW). Sq and Ts showed the highest biomass productivity as 0.47 and 0.61 g/L, respectively. Removal efficiencies of total nitrogen (TN), phosphate (PO4 3−), and total organic carbon (TOC) were observed as 86.21, 89.83 and 64.47% by Sq and 44.92, 42.18 and 40.16% by Ts, respectively. After wastewater treatment, lipids were extracted from microalgal biomasses. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) analysis revealed that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are dominant in Sq and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in Ts. After lipid extraction, removal of tetracycline (TC) from water by microalgal biomasses was also investigated. Maximum adsorption capacities of Sq and Ts were found to be 295.34 and 56.25 mg/g, respectively. Results of this study revealed the versatile applications of microalgae for wastewater treatment, lipid production and TC removal from water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The catalytic conversion of Douglas fir sawdust into bio-phenols on activated carbons (AC) obtained by chemical activation of corn stover with H3PO4 was investigated. Taguchi experimental design was used to optimize the preparation of AC using microwave assisted pyrolysis. Based on an overall consideration of AC yield, bio-oil yield, and phenols content, the optimized conditions were phosphoric acid to biomass ratio of 0.8, microwave power of 600 W and reaction time of 20 min. The bio-oils were rich in phenolic compounds (up to 90 area %) that mainly comprised phenol, methyl and ethyl phenol. During the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass with AC, phenolic compounds could either be derived from decomposition of lignin, followed by deoxygenation, or derived from furfurals, which were degradation products of carbohydrates. The catalytic activities of ACs were mainly owing to the well-developed porosity and abundant acidic surface functional groups. The porous structures of ACs were characterized by N2 isotherms, showing a strong dependence on the acid impregnation ratio and microwave irradiation power. The presence of acidic phosphoric-containing surface functional groups was confirmed by SEM/EDX, FTIR and NH3-TPD. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Heavy fraction of bio-oil, the bottom-layer of biomass fast pyrolysis oil, is hard to be directly used due to its high molecular weight, complex components and deteriorate thermal stability. Here, a novel catalytic hydrotreating process for the heavy fraction of bio-oil, including depolymerization, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), is proposed with Ru/α-Al2O3 catalyst and super/subcritical ethanol. Results demonstrated that heavy fraction of bio-oil was depolymerized into monomeric phenolic compounds, and then was converted to hydrocarbons by hydrodeoxygenation in one-pot. The average molecular weight (Mw) of upgraded oil decreased drastically from 8941 g/mol to 937 g/mol during the catalytic hydrotreating process, and the formation of coke is suppressed. Under the optimal conditions, the total yield of hydrocarbons, which were comprised of alkyl-substituted cyclohexane and alkyl-substituted benzene, could be up to 23.15%. These hydrocarbons have a high octane number, would be the desirable components for fungible liquid transportation fuel. Furthermore, Ru/α-Al2O3 catalyst can be regenerated by calcination in the presence of O2. These results indicated high quality fuels could be obtained from heavy fraction of bio-oil over suitable catalytic system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Softwoods represent a significant fraction of the available lignocellulosic biomass for conversion into a variety of bio-based products. Its inherent recalcitrance, however, makes its successful utilization an ongoing challenge. In the current work the research efforts for the fractionation and utilization of softwood biomass with the organosolv process are reviewed. A short introduction into the specific challenges of softwood utilization, the development of the biorefinery concept, as well as the initial efforts for the development of organosolv as a pulping method is also provided for better understanding of the related research framework. The effect of organosolv pretreatment at various conditions, in the fractionation efficiency of wood components, enzymatic hydrolysis and bioethanol production yields is then discussed. Specific attention is given in the effect of the pretreated biomass properties such as residual lignin on enzymatic hydrolysis. Finally, the valorization of organosolv lignin via the production of biofuels, chemicals, and materials is also described. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, co-pyrolysis of five lignocellulosic biomass residues, viz. groundnut shell (G), bagasse (B), rice husk (RH), Prosopis juliflora (PJF) and mixed wood sawdust (MWSD), with two synthetic plastics, polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), was conducted to improve the quality of bio-oil. Equal composition of biomass and plastic was pyrolyzed at 450 W microwave power using graphite susceptor, and the yields of bio-oil, char and gas fractions were determined. The bio-oil yields from PS-biomass blends varied in the range of 51–60 wt%, with maximum yield obtained from PS-MWSD, while that from PP-biomass blends were 25–41 wt% with maximum yield obtained from PP-RH. The higher heating value of co-pyrolysis bio-oil was high (38–42 MJ kg−1) as compared to bio-oil obtained from only biomass pyrolysis (20–30 MJ kg−1). Energy yield of co-pyrolysis bio-oil was significantly higher with PS mixtures (73–81%) than PP mixtures (32–62%). Importantly, the bio-oil, char and gas yields, and organic composition of bio-oil were non-additive with respect to that obtained from pyrolysis of the individual feedstocks. The presence of PS boosted the production of aromatic hydrocarbons (48–54 wt%), while PP promoted aliphatic hydrocarbons (19–33 wt%) in co-pyrolysis bio-oil. Specifically, high selectivity towards alkanes in bio-oil was obtained from PP-RH mixture. Co-pyrolysis bio-oil contained less moisture with lower acidity compared to pyrolysis bio-oil. RH-PS and RH-PP mixtures were shown to be the better biomass-plastic combinations from the viewpoint of recovering high energy in bio-oil. The microwave co-pyrolysis process efficiency was also high (63–68%) and promising. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fuel derived from algae is a promising alternative that has been studied for supplying the global demand for fuels. The highly proteinaceous microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has some attributes that can make it an interesting organism for large-scale biomass generation such as: high growth rates, homogeneous biochemical characteristics, robustness and high adaptability, and it can grow both in the light and dark. Thus, in this work the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was characterized using several techniques, to analyze its potential as feedstock in fuel and chemical production. Analytical pyrolysis was performed with and without catalysts. The tests were performed at 450 °C, 550 °C, 650 °C, and 750 °C in a Pyroprobe CDS 5200. For the catalytic tests a ratio of 1:2 (catalyst:biomass) was used. Non-catalytic pyrolysis indicated that the increase in the temperature increased the amount of hydrocarbon compounds and decreased oxygenated compounds. The bio-oil produced from catalytic pyrolysis showed a decrease in the nitrogenated compounds, which indicate that the addition of a hydrotalcite catalyst that can improve the bio-oil composition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Present work demonstrates an easy route by sol-gel method, without using any template, for the synthesis of flower shaped tungsten (W) supported TiO2/SiO2catalyst for the triglyceride transesterification. The structure of the catalyst was established by powder X-ray diffraction and surface morphology and particle size by field emission scanning and high resolution transmission electron microscopy studies, respectively. The oxidation state of tungsten by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was found to be +6. Under the optimized reaction conditions of 5 wt% of 20-W/TiO2/SiO2-700 catalyst, 30:1 methanol to oil molar ratio and 65 °C reaction temperature, more than 98% fatty acid ethyl ester yield was obtained in 4 h. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameter of the reaction was also evaluated following the pseudo-first order equation. The catalyst was recycled in four consecutive runs and total metal contents in biodiesel was observed &lt;5 ppm to maintain the stability of the catalyst. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An attempt has been made to optimize biodiesel production from Bombax ceiba oil (BCO) through calcium oxide nanoparticles (CaO-NPs) catalyzed transesterification. Characterization of CaO-NPs synthesised by solution combustion method was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett Teller (BET) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The influence of reaction parameters was studied and optimized by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in combination with central composite design (CCD). Two-stage transesterification technique was employed for biodiesel production and 96.2% yield of Bombax ceiba methyl ester (BCME) was achieved under optimum conditions. The CaO-NPs were reused up to 5 cycles with appreciable loss of yield. From the kinetic study performed at different reaction temperatures (55 °C, 60 °C and 65 °C) Ea = 35.99 kJ/mol was obtained. Fuel properties of produced methyl ester were also determined and compared with ASTM standards for biodiesel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - ConspectusMetal nanoclusters containing a few to several hundred atoms with sizes ranging from sub-nanometer to ∼2 nm occupy an intermediate size regime that bridges larger plasmonic nanoparticles and smaller metal complexes. With strong quantum confinement, metal nanoclusters exhibit molecule-like properties. This Account focuses on noble metal nanoclusters that are synthesized within a single stranded DNA template. Compared to other ligand protected metal nanoclusters, DNA-templated metal nanoclusters manifest intriguing physical and chemical properties that are heavily influenced by the design of DNA templates. For example, DNA-templated silver nanoclusters can show bright fluorescence, tunable emission colors, and enhanced stability by tuning the sequence of the encapsulating DNA template. DNA-templated gold nanoclusters can also serve as excellent cocatalysts, which are integratable with other biocatalysts such as enzymes.In this Account, DNA-templated silver and gold nanoclusters are selected as paradigm systems to showcase their emergent properties and unique applications. We first discuss the DNA-templated silver nanoclusters with a focus on the creation of a complementary palette of emission colors, which has potential applications for multiplex assays. The importance of the DNA template toward enhanced stability of silver nanoclusters is also demonstrated. We then introduce a special class of activable fluorescence probes that are based on the fluorescence turn-on phenomena of DNA-templated silver nanoclusters, which are named nanocluster beacons (NCBs). NCBs have distinct advantages over molecular beacons for nucleic acid detection, and their emission mechanisms are also discussed in detail. We then discuss a universal method of creating novel DNA-silver nanocluster aptamers for protein detection with high specificity. The remainder of the Account is devoted to the DNA-templated gold nanoclusters. We demonstrate that DNA-gold nanoclusters can serve as enhancers for enzymatic reduction of oxygen, which is one of the most important reactions in biofuel cells.Although DNA-templated metal nanoclusters are still in their infancy, we anticipate they will emerge as a new type of functional nanomaterial with wide applications in biology and energy science. Future research will focus on the synthesis of size selected DNA-metal nanoclusters with atomic monodispersity, structural determination of different sized DNA-metal nanoclusters, and establishment of structure-property correlations. Some long-standing mysteries, such as the origin of fluorescence and mechanism for emission color tunability, constitute the central questions regarding the photophysical properties of DNA-metal nanoclusters. On the application side, more studies are required to understand the interaction between nanocluster and biological systems. In the foreseeable future, one can expect that new biosensors, catalysts, and functional devices will be invented based on the intriguing properties of well-designed DNA-metal nanoclusters and their composites. Overall, DNA-metal nanoclusters can add additional spotlights into the highly vibrant field of ligand protected, quantum sized metal nanoclusters. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, bio-oil was produced through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of C. vulgaris biomass cultivated in wastewater and was enriched into transportation fuels. Bio-oil yield was 29.37% wt at 300 °C, 60 min, at 15 g/200 mL biomass loading rate with 3% wt nano ZnO catalyst loading. Applying catalyst reduced oxygen and nitrogen content in bio-oil and increased its calorific value (19.6 ± 0.8 MJ/Kg). Bio-oil was enriched through liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and higher yield was obtained at 30 °C for dichloromethane solvent (18.2% wt). Compounds of enriched oil were within the petro-diesel range (C8–C21). Bio-char after HTL process was activated and used as adsorbent in wastewater treatment process to remove organic pollutants (COD, NO3, NH3 and PO4). Treated wastewater can be supplied as growth medium for microalgae cultivation in further experiments. Nearly 3–4 times the nanocatalyst can be reused in the HTL process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production using supercritical methanol in the absence of catalyst has been analysed by studying the main factors affecting biodiesel yield. A quadratic polynomial model has been developed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Box-Behnken Design (BBD) has been used to evaluate the influence of four independent variables i.e. methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio, temperature, pressure and time on biodiesel yield. The optimum biodiesel yield is 91% at M:O molar ratio, temperature, pressure and reaction time of 37:1, 253.5 °C, 198.5 bar and 14.8 min, respectively. Overall reaction kinetics has been studied at optimum conditions concluding a pseudo first order reaction with reaction rate constant of 0.0006s−1. Moreover, thermodynamics of the reaction has been analysed in the temperature range between 240 and 280 °C concluding frequency factor and activation energy of 4.05s−1 and 50.5 kJ/mol, respectively. A kinetic reactor has been simulated on HYSYS using the obtained kinetic data resulting in 91.7% conversion of triglycerides (TG) with 0.2% relative error from the experimental results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The successful synthesis of magnetic MgO/MgFe2O4 nanocatalyst via combustion method was achieved that has far less time and cost than the other methods. This catalyst was used in biodiesel production reaction from vegetable oil. By changing the fuel to nitrates ratio, proper structure of catalyst was obtained to produce biodiesel. Physiochemical analysis including XRD, FESEM, EDX dot-mapping, BET-BJH, FTIR and Surface Particle Size Distribution (SPSD) were used to define the characteristics of synthesized catalysts and optimum fuel ratio in combustion synthesis method. To evaluate the performance of the synthesized nanoceramics, all samples were used in the biodiesel production reaction. The results of XRD analyses showed the successful synthesis of MgFe2O4 crystals and also determined that other materials peaks (iron oxide phases) does not exist in the catalyst structure. BET-BJH analyses reveal the structures with large pore (more than 10 nm) and relatively good surface area (97.8 m2/g) for synthesized catalysts by combustion method. By biodiesel production reaction in the conditions of temperature = 110 °C, methanol-to-oil molar ratio = 12, catalyst concentration = 4 wt.% and reaction time = 4 h, it was found that the catalyst has great potential to produce biodiesel and also maximum conversion of 91.2% was obtained. For the stability test of catalyst, after convenient catalyst separation by magnet, it was used for five consecutive transesterification reactions that the results were very acceptable and finally the lowest conversion was achieved to be 82.4%. By the simultaneous consideration of analyses and reactor tests results, it was found that synthesized catalyst with fuel ratio of 1.5 has the best performance and it is very suitable for biodiesel production reaction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In-situ and ex-situ catalytic upgrading with HZSM-5 of vapors from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of lignin were studied. The in-situ process produced higher bio-oil and less char than ex-situ process. The gas yield was similar for both processes. The ex-situ process had higher selectivity to aromatics and produced more syngas and less CO2 than the in-situ process. Additional experiments on ex-situ process found that the bio-oil yield and coke deposition decreased while the gas yield increased at higher catalyst-to-lignin ratios and catalytic upgrading temperatures. The increased catalyst-to-lignin ratio from 0 to 0.3 reduced the selectivity of methoxy phenols from 73.7% to 22.6% while increased that of aromatics from 1.1% to 41.4%. The highest selectivity of alkyl phenols (31.9%) was obtained at 0.2 of catalyst-to-lignin ratio. Higher catalytic temperatures favored greater conversion of methoxy phenols to alkyl phenols and aromatics. Appropriate catalyst-to-lignin ratio (0.3) together with higher catalytic temperatures favored syngas formation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electrical communication between an enzyme and an electrode is one of the most important factors in determining the performance of biofuel cells. Here, we introduce a glucose oxidase-coated metallic cotton fiber-based hybrid biofuel cell with efficient electrical communication between the anodic enzyme and the conductive support. Gold nanoparticles are layer-by-layer assembled with small organic linkers onto cotton fibers to form metallic cotton fibers with extremely high conductivity (&gt;2.1×104 S cm−1), and are used as an enzyme-free cathode as well as a conductive support for the enzymatic anode. For preparation of the anode, the glucose oxidase is sequentially layer-by-layer-assembled with the same linkers onto the metallic cotton fibers. The resulting biofuel cells exhibit a remarkable power density of 3.7 mW cm−2, significantly outperforming conventional biofuel cells. Our strategy to promote charge transfer through electrodes can provide an important tool to improve the performance of biofuel cells. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of organic chemicals derived from renewable sources to synthesize functional solid materials for heterogeneous catalysis is of great significance. Herein, a new porous and acid-base bifunctional hybrid (FDCA-Hf) was designed and prepared by simple assembly of biomass-derived 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with hafnium (Hf) under template-free conditions. The resulting FDCA-Hf hybrid with mesopores centered at 6.9 nm, moderate surface area (365.8 m2/g) and acid-base couple sites (density: 0.51 vs 0.97 mmol/g, acid/base molar ratio: 0.53), could selectively catalyze the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of carbonyl compounds under mild reaction conditions (as low as 90 °C in a short time of 1 h), especially of ethyl levulinate to γ-valerolactone, in quantitative yields (95–100%) and relatively higher reaction rate (e.g., turnover frequency: 2.28 h−1) compared to other catalysts. Moreover, the efficient simultaneous (trans)esterification of Jatropha oils with high acidic values to biodiesel (up to 98% yield) could also be achieved over FDCA-Hf with robust acid-base catalytic sites. The FDCA-Hf hybrid was highly stable due to the presence of robust metal-organic framework and could be resued with no decline in activity. Further studies demonstrated that the synergistic role of Lewis acid-base couple species (Hf4+–O2−) and Brønsted acidic species (–OH) of FDCA-Hf contributed greatly to its pronounced catalytic activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass (bamboo waste) nitrogen-enriched pyrolysis was carried out in a fixed bed with NH3 atmosphere at 400–800 °C, and formation mechanism of N-containing species was explored in depth. Results showed that N-enriched pyrolysis greatly increased bio-oil and gas yields. H2 yield increased sharply to 130 mL/g (32.93 vol%) and became the main composition at higher temperature, while CH4 and CO yields deceased, and the lower heating value of gas reached ∼14 MJ/Nm3. For bio-oil, the content of phenols (main compositions) and N-containing species increased significantly, and the maximums reached 61.33% and 11.47%, respectively. While that of acetic acid (disappeared), O-containing species (aldehydes/ketones/furans/esters) and aromatics decreased largely accordingly. For biochar, Nitrogen content increased, and it contained abundant pyridininc-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridone-N-oxide. Possible reaction pathways of biomass N-enriched pyrolysis was proposed based on products evolution. In conclusion, biomass N-enriched pyrolysis could obtain high-valued N-containing chemical species and functional biochar. © 2017

AB  - Biodiesel, typically produced from non-food crops with heterogeneous catalysts, deems to be a promising and sustainable alternative biofuel to petroleum-derived fuels. In this study, to improve biodiesel production process efficiency by acids, biodiesel production were successfully developed using a series of magnetically acidic poly(ionic liquid) catalysts with varying hydrophobicity and controllable acidity. The detailed characterization results demonstrated that the FnmS-PIL (1a, C8) core-shell structure catalyst had large Bruner Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area (128.1 m2/g), uniform mesoporous structure (4.2 nm), strong magnetism (12.4 emu/g), a high number of acid sites (2.14 mmol/g), strong acid strength (strong electron-withdrawing anion CF3SO3 − effect, −8.2 &lt; H0 &lt; −5.6) and strong hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 115.4°). For the biodiesel production, high biodiesel yields could be achieved by the esterification of oleic acid (by response surface methodology, RSM) and (trans)esterification of crude Euphorbia lathyris L. oils with an acid value of 24.59 mg KOH/g (by single factor optimization). Furthermore, a relative kinetic study was conducted wherein the activation energy was calculated as 39.2 kJ/mol and a pseudo-first-order model was determined for esterification. More importantly, the FnmS-PIL (1a, C8) catalyst was separated simply using a magnet and exhibited constant activity with biodiesel yield of 87.5% after five cycles in (trans)esterification. In addition, the biodiesel yield was maintained above 90% even with a water content of 6 wt% with respect to crude Euphorbia lathyris L. oils, and the fuel properties of Euphorbia lathyris L. biodiesel were found to satisfy the EN 14212 and ASTM D6751 standards, highlighting its potential in industrial biodiesel production as derived from crude non-food oil resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Production of biodiesel from waste animal fats has a great potential since this feedstock does not compete with the food industry and leads to the global reduction of wastes. The type of feedstock as well as the presence of impurities highly influences the quality of biodiesel. Too high concentrations of glycerol and glycerides in biodiesel negatively influence the fuel quality and can generally reduce the engine durability, so crude biodiesel needs to be purified. One alternative method of purifying biodiesel is extraction with deep eutectic solvents. Biodiesels were synthesised from five types of waste animal fats: veal and beef tallow, lard, chicken and goose fat, by means of chemical transesterification catalysed by alkali catalyst. Due to the fact that the presence of impurities negatively influences the quality of biodiesel, crude biodiesels were purified. Liquid-liquid extraction with previously prepared deep eutectic solvent choline-chloride/ethylene-glycol (molar ratio 1:2.5) was selected as the purification method. Experiments were performed at different mass ratio solvent/biodiesel in a laboratory scale batch extractor equipped with mechanical stirrer and optimal mass ratio was defined. Biodiesels were characterised and their properties were compared with the standard specification. Free glycerol from animal fats biodiesels was efficiently removed by the selected solvent. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil, an oxygen-enriched precursor, is the liquid product from the fast pyrolysis of abundant and renewable biomass. Herein, nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (NPCS) with a unique interlinked architecture were synthesized successfully from bio-oil. The optimized sample shows a high specific surface area of 2566 m2 g-1, large pore volume (2.108 cm3 g-1), tunable hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure and considerable content of heteroatoms (∼5.83 at% N and ∼9.78 at% O). Benefitting from the favorable characteristics mentioned above, it exhibits a prominent specific capacitance of 289 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and excellent rate capability (84.1% capacitance retention at 10 A g-1) in 6 M KOH. In addition, the electrode demonstrates superb cycling stability with only 3% capacitance loss after 10 000 cycles. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor can deliver a superior energy density of 21.0 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 463.0 W kg-1. These results highlight that the as-prepared samples have considerable potential for low-cost and renewable energy storage devices. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this study, an inexpensive, environmental benign acid catalyst is prepared using coconut meal residue (CMR) and employed for biodiesel production from waste palm oil (WPO). The total acid density of the catalyst is found to be 3.8 mmolg−1. The catalyst shows a unique amorphous structure with 1.33 m2 g−1 of surface area and 0.31 cm3 g−1 of mean pore volume. Successful activation is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The highest biodiesel yield of 92.7% was obtained from WPO in an open reflux system using the catalyst. Results show that biodiesel yield increases with increasing methanol:oil (molar ratio) and reaction time up to an optimum value. It is found that the catalyst can be reused for at least four cycles for &gt;80% biodiesel yield. Fuel properties of the produced biodiesel meet international biodiesel standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents a preliminary assessment of biodiesel production from waste sources available in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for energy generation and solution for waste disposal issues. A case study was developed under three different scenarios: (S1) KSA population only in 2017, (S2) KSA population and pilgrims in 2017, and (S3) KSA population and pilgrims by 2030 using the fat fraction of the municipal solid waste. It was estimated that S1, S2, and S3 scenarios could produce around 1.08, 1.10 and 1.41 million tons of biodiesel with the energy potential of 43423, 43949 and 56493 TJ respectively. Furthermore, annual savings of US $55.89, 56.56 and 72.71 million can be generated from landfill diversion of food waste and added to the country's economy. However, there are challenges in commercialization of waste to biodiesel facilities in KSA, including waste collection and separation, impurities, reactor design and biodiesel quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conversion of biomass derived carbohydrates to alkyl levulinates is an important process due to the wide application of alkyl levulinates as chemicals and biofuel additives. Efficient conversion of cheap and abundant glucose to alkyl levulinates over easily separated and regenerated solid catalyst is highly desirable. Here, the transformation of glucose to methyl levulinate (MLE) was studied over dual solid acid catalysts. The synergistic effect of solid Brønsted (B) acid and solid Lewis (L) acid was observed. A combined catalyst system consisting of both B acid and L acid was found to be more efficient for the production of MLE from glucose. 62% yield of MLE was given over the combined catalyst of SO42−/ZrO2 and Sn-Beta prepared by postsynthesis method at 170 °C for 24 h. The roles of L acid sites of SO42−/ZrO2 and Sn-Beta, and B acid sites of SO42−/ZrO2 were discussed in detail. Alternative biomass-derived carbohydrates also gave moderate to good yields of MLE. Recyclability studies indicated that the combined catalyst system can be reused without significant change in the yield of MLE, proving its easy recovery and thermal stability during regeneration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The high concentration of oxygenated compounds in pyrolytic products prohibits the conversion of hemicellulose to important biofuels and chemicals via fast pyrolysis. Herein a dual-catalyst bed of CaO and HZSM-5 was developed to convert acids in the pyrolytic products of xylan to valuable hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, LLDPE was co-pyrolyzed with xylan to supplement hydrogen during the catalysis of HZSM-5. The results showed that CaO could effectively transform acids into ketones. A minimum yield of acids (2.74%) and a maximum yield of ketones (42.93%) were obtained at a catalyst to feedstock ratio of 2:1. The dual-catalyst bed dramatically increased the yield of aromatics. Moreover, hydrogen-rich fragments derived from LLDPE promoted the Diels-Alder reactions of furans and participated in the hydrocarbon pool reactions of non-furanic compounds. As a result, a higher yield of hydrocarbons was achieved. This study provides a fundamental for recovering energy and chemicals from pyrolysis of hemicellulose. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An experimental work has been performed to compare the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a compression ignition engine running with diesel and three different blends of diesel and biodiesel (castor oil methyl ester, COME). The biodiesel has been prepared by alkaline transesterification using NaOH as catalyst. The properties of the fuels, like viscosity, surface tension, heating value, flash point and elemental composition, have been measured following standard test procedures. The variation of viscosity and surface tension of the pure fuels and their blends with temperature are experimentally determined. Experiments have also been performed on a porous sphere to compare the mass burning rate and transition velocity from envelope to wake flame for the pure fuels and their blends. The porous sphere experiment results indicate that diesel has higher evaporation rate than COME while the chemical reactivity of the latter is more than the former. The originality of the work is in using the fundamental information from the porous sphere experiments to explain the combustion characteristics in the engine cylinder. Studies in the engine reveal that combustion starts earlier with the diesel-biodiesel blends and the rate of pressure rise during the rapid combustion phase is also faster with the blended fuels compared to that with diesel. However, not much difference has been noticed in the performance (brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature) and emission (CO, HC and NO) characteristics of the engine using the diesel fuel and diesel-biodiesel fuel blends. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (Jatropha curcas L.) seeds have been found to be an ideal sustainable and low-cost source of catalyst and oil feedstock for biodiesel production. Jatropha cake, remained dregs after jatropha curcas oil (JCO) extraction, has been treated by two different techniques; calcination and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation to be used as novel heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification reaction. The effect of calcination and KOH activation on the jatropha cake has been characterized. The basic strength and basicity of the catalysts have been determined as well. The effect of different operating conditions has been studied using JCO and waste cooking oil (WCO) to evaluate the efficiency of the catalysts. The catalysts produced higher biodiesel yield using JCO than WCO. In the case of using JCO, the two catalysts produced close biodiesel yield. Calcined jatropha cake (CJC) has been chosen as the optimum catalyst for its better reusability and lower preparation cost than KOH activated jatropha cake (KJC). The optimum operating conditions of the JCO transesterification process has been determined as 60 min reaction time, 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 1 wt.% catalyst loading, 400 rpm and 60 °C. Biodiesel production yield of JCO was achieved to 94 and 96% with CJC and KJC catalysts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the effects of adding graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) into jatropha methyl ester–diesel blended fuel (20% by volume jatropha methyl ester + 80% diesel; symbolized by JB20) on the performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of a diesel engine were experimentally investigated. The GNPs were added at different concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/L of JB20. These blends were investigated under various engine loads and speeds. The results showed that adding GNPs at 50–75 mg/L of JB20 achieved an increase of 25% in the thermal efficiency and a reduction of 20% in the brake specific fuel consumption compared to those of pure JB20. The peak cylinder pressure, highest rate of pressure rise, and maximum heat release rate were also increased by 6%, 5%, and 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the engine emissions of NOx, CO, and UHC were reduced by 40%, 60%, and 50%, respectively, at a GNP dosage of 25–50 mg/L. The results showed that the dose level of 50 mg/L had the optimum enhancement in the overall characteristics of engine performance and emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Four kinds of noble metal-like catalysts W2C/AC, W2N/AC, Mo2C/AC and Mo2N/AC were prepared and used for catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass to upgrade the fuel properties of biomass pyrolysis vapors. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) experiments were performed to analyze the volatile pyrolytic products in pyrolysis vapors. Effects of catalyst, pyrolysis temperature and catalyst-to-biomass ratio on the pyrolytic product distribution were examined thoroughly. Actual yields of major pyrolytic products were determined by an external calibration method. Results showed that tungsten-based catalysts performed better than molybdenum-based catalysts, and W2C/AC possessed comparable performance to Pd/AC catalyst. From the pyrolysis of biomass and its single component, W2C/AC and W2N/AC catalysts exhibited promising capability to promote the decomposition of lignin to generate monomeric phenolic compounds, especially stable phenolics. Meanwhile, they would also affect the holocellulose pyrolysis by decreasing anhydrosugars and linear aldehydes, while increasing furans, cyclopentanones and linear ketones. As for an overall effect, catalysis by W2C/AC and W2N/AC catalysts was capable to convert those undesirable pyrolytic products (containing aldehyde group, C[dbnd]C bond or carboxyl group) through decarbonylation, hydrogenation, decarboxylation and other reactions, and thus decrease the instability, acidity and oxygen content of pyrolytic products for obtaining high-grade bio-oil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of rice husk sample after combined washing-torrefaction pretreatment over Fe-modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst for bio-oil upgrading was investigated. This study shows the effects of Fe-modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst with different Fe loading and different pretreatment conditions from an integrated process of pretreatment and catalytic pyrolysis to improve the quality of bio-oil. The results indicated that with the increase of Fe loading, the yield of upgraded bio-oil decreased, while the relative content of hydrocarbons was enhanced obviously. The optimum Fe-modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst should be 4%Fe/ZSM-5 because excessive loading of Fe could affect the yield of upgraded bio-oil. Furthermore, it was found that during catalytic pyrolysis process with 4%Fe/ZSM-5, combined washing-torrefaction pretreatment had an obvious effect on promoting the production of hydrocarbons and further increasing the selectivity for BTX (benzene, toluene and xylenes), while severe torrefaction condition could significantly decrease the yield of upgraded bio-oil. Generally, combined washing-torrefaction pretreatment at mild torrefaction condition (210 and 240 °C in this study) was more suitable for upgrading of bio-oil from catalytic pyrolysis over Fe-modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Active research on biomass hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) continues to demonstrate its advantages over other thermochemical processes, in particular the interesting benefits that are associated with carbonaceous solid products, called hydrochar (HC). The areas of applications of HC range from biofuel to doped porous material for adsorption, energy storage, and catalysis. At the same time, intensive research has been aimed at better elucidating the process mechanisms and kinetics, and how the experimental variables (temperature, time, biomass load, feedstock composition, as well as their interactions) affect the distribution between phases and their composition. This review provides an analysis of the state of the art on HTC, mainly with regard to the effect of variables on the process, the associated kinetics, and the characteristics of the solid phase (HC), as well as some of the more studied applications so far. The focus is on research made over the last five years on these topics. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this study, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was constructed by depositing supercapacitor carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Co3O4 onto the anatase TiO2 coated ITO electrodes. Herein, supercapacitor Co3O4 was employed as a semiconductor with a band gap of ~2.07 eV, and the supercapacitor behavior of the PEC system was improved by introducing CNT into the electrode material. Furthermore, a self-empowering glucose biosensor operating at 0 V was constructed for the first time. Also, upon the formation of p-n junction, Co3O4 was rendered electron accepting material, unlike its usual use in photocatalytic systems. Co3O4-CNT-anatase TiO2 semiconductor hybrid was used to reduce recombination of exited electrons, and increasing the visible light absorption. Prior to enzyme immobilization, CNT containing electrode material was modified with 1-pyrene boronic acid via π-π interactions. The enzyme immobilization was carried out through covalent esterification between the boronic acid moiety and the carbohydrate part of GOx. Enzyme immobilization way enabled the close contact between FAD and electrode material, and the electron donor FADH2 forming after the enzymatic reaction can give electrons to the photogenerated holes of Co3O4 through CNT along with H2O2 by enhancing the photocurrent. The obtained PEC biosensor demonstrated acceptable reproducibility and decent stability with a linear measurement range of 0–4 mM, a sensitivity of 0.3 µA mM−1 cm−2, and lower detection limit of 0.16 µM. Thus, a self-powered biosensor was constructed by combining the PEC, and supercapacitor behavior of Co3O4 for the first time, and the utilization of the present PEC material can be extended to the other analytes detection through photoelectrochemistry. The supercapacitor materials led to the high current at direct electron transfer potential range, and this phenomenon implies that the PEC electrode can also be used in biofuel cells to obtain high power. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To evaluate the performance and emissions of a test engine fueled by biodiesel blends produced from fish processing by-products, the experimental and simulation methods were used to investigate the effects of injection pressure and timing on engine operation and correlation of these effects with varying fish-oil concentrations in the biodiesel blends. Consequently, commercial diesel fuel blended with different concentrations of fish-oil biodiesel including B0, B10, B20, B30, B40 and B50 (corresponding to 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of biodiesel in blend) were used for the test engine. Compared to B0, the average reduction in brake power of the biodiesel fuels was reduced proportionally with the biodiesel ratio in the fuel blends. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and NOx emissions increased together with a reduction in soot, HC and CO emissions as the percentage of biodiesel increases. Moreover, the engine characteristics depend on operating parameters such as injection timing and injection pressure as also mentioned in many previous studies. When increasing injection timing, the brake power initially increases until reaching a maximum value and then decreases slightly for all types of fuels tested. Meanwhile, the effect of injection pressure differs depending on the pressure range and biodiesel blends. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, a lignin-centered convergent approach to produce either aliphatic or aromatic bio-hydrocarbons is introduced. First, poplar or spruce wood was deconstructed by a lignin-first biorefining process, a technique based on the early-stage catalytic conversion of lignin, yielding lignin oils along with cellulosic pulps. Next, the lignin oils were catalytically upgraded in the presence of a phosphidated Ni/SiO2 catalyst under H2 pressure. Notably, selectivity toward aliphatics or aromatics can simply be adjusted by changes in H2 pressure and temperature. The process renders two distinct main cuts of branched hydrocarbons (gasoline: C6-C10, and kerosene/diesel: C14-C20). As the approach is H2-intensive, we examined the utilization of pulp as an H2 source via gasification. For several biomass sources, the H2 obtainable by gasification stoichiometrically meets the H2 demand of the deep converting lignin-first biorefinery, making this concept plausible for the production of high-energy-density drop-in biofuels. Heterogeneous catalysis is no longer limited to the conversion of lignin wastes from cellulosic-centric industries, but has expanded to offer innovative solutions for the deconstruction of lignocellulose by reductive processes. Such solutions are referred to as lignin-first biorefining. They are highly efficient at preventing the generation of recalcitrance in the lignin streams while yielding delignified pulps. Herein, a lignin-centered convergent approach rendering two main cuts of branched hydrocarbons (gasoline: C6-C10, and kerosene/diesel: C14-C20) is introduced. As the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin streams is H2-intensive, the utilization of pulp as an H2 source via gasification is proposed. The cellulosic H2 shows potential for covering the H2 demand for the production of drop-in lignin fuels. Importantly, the energy content of the lignin fuels relative to the energy content of the lignocellulose is approximately 2- to 2.5-times higher than that of cellulosic ethanol. Therefore, it is now timely to question whether cellulosic bioethanol is the most sensible target fuel from lignocellulose. Heterogeneous catalysis is no longer limited to the conversion of lignin wastes from cellulosic-centric industries, but has expanded to offer innovative solutions for the deconstruction of lignocellulose by reductive processes. This enables the creation of a deep converting lignin-first biorefinery, shifting paradigms. Lignin-biorefinery produces gasoline and kerosene/diesel drop-in fuels. The self-sufficiency in H2 is achieved through the gasification of the delignified holocelluloses. Notably, H2 surplus releases holocellulose for the production of platform chemicals, further monetizing the lignin-first process chains. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels can potentially address many of the energy and environment related challenges we face today. In this study, we have demonstrated a photochemical diode artificial photosynthesis system that can enable efficient, unassisted overall pure water splitting without using any sacrificial reagent. By precisely controlling charge carrier flow at the nanoscale, the wafer-level photochemical diode arrays exhibited solar-to-hydrogen efficiency ∼3.3% in neutral (pH ∼ 7.0) overall water splitting reaction. In part of the visible spectrum (400-485 nm), the energy conversion efficiency and apparent quantum yield reaches ∼8.75% and ∼20%, respectively, which are the highest values ever reported for one-step visible-light driven photocatalytic overall pure water splitting. The effective manipulation and control of charge carrier flow in nanostructured photocatalysts provides critical insight in achieving high efficiency artificial photosynthesis, including the efficient and selective reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The present study systematically investigated the combustion characteristics of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) using TG-MS (thermogravimetric/mass spectrometry) and TG-FTIR (thermogravimetric/Fourier transform infrared spectrometry) under five heating rates. The physicochemical characteristics and combustion index pointed to SMS as a promising biofuel for power generation. The high correlation coefficient of the fitting plots and similar activation energy calculated by various methods indicated that four suitable iso-conversional methods were used. The activation energy varied from 130.06 to 192.95 kJ/mol with a mean value of 171.49 kJ/mol using Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and decreased with the increased conversion degree. The most common emissions peaked at the range of 200–400 °C corresponding to volatile combustion stage, except for CO2, NO2 and NO. The peak CO2 emission occurred at 439.11 °C mainly due to the combustion of fixed carbon. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigates the experimental study to examine the operation characteristics of a neat neem oil methyl ester (BD100) along with silver oxide nano-particles as a metal-based additive in various mass fractions. Silver oxide nano-particle is mixed into 100% of BD100 at 5 and 10 ppm. The experimental investigation on diesel engine reveals that the addition of silver oxide nano-particles to BD100 resulted in enhancement of brake thermal efficiency (BTE) with a reduction in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). The tested emission parameters such as CO, HC, NOx, and smoke were decreased by 12.22, 10.89, 4.24, and 6.61% for BD100+ Ag2O (5 ppm) and 16.47, 14.21, 6.66, and 8.34% for BD100 respectively when compared to BD100. Overall, improvement in ignition characteristics of the engine was finer by adding 5 and 10 ppm of silver oxide nano-particle to BD100 on account of the enhanced surface area to volume ratio. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Bio-oil from the fast pyrolysis of biomass can be converted to solid carbon materials, chemicals and syngas by various thermochemical conversion methods. As a first step in all of these processes, bio-oil undergoes drastic components changes due to its exposure to the elevated temperature. Understanding the effects of heating rate on bio-oil transformation during its pyrolysis is therefore crucial for effective utilization of bio-oil. In this study, a bio-oil sample produced from the fast pyrolysis of rice husk at 500 °C was pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures between 300 and 800 °C at three different heating rates: fast (≈200 °C/s), medium (≈20 °C/s), and slow (≈0.33 °C/s). In addition to the quantification of coke and tar yields, the tar was characterized with an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence spectroscopy, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). Our results indicate that slow heating rates promote polymerization of bio-oil components, particularly at low temperatures (<500 °C), resulting in higher primary coke yields than that of the fast heating rates. Decomposition reaction was found to be pronounced at fast heating rates, causing decreases in the tar yields and abundance of light compounds. The increases in the yields of the secondary coke, the formations of more condensed aromatic structures and macromolecules (m/z > 500) were also promoted at fast heating rates via the more intense secondary reactions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles, as novel fuel additives, on the engine performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine. The GO nanoparticles were mixed with B0, B10, and B20 Ailanthus altissima biodiesel blends. The graphene oxide nanoparticles, at concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 ppm, were dispersed into each fuel blend by ultrasonication. Throughout this study, engine testing was performed at a constant speed of 2100 rpm and loads of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Performance and emission characteristics, including power, torque, specific fuel consumption (SFC), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), and CO, CO2, unburned-hydrocarbon (UHC), and NOx emissions, were investigated. study revealed that, under the same conditions, most performance characteristics, such as power, torque, and EGT, significantly increased through the addition of GO to fuel blends, while SFC significantly decreased. The GO-nanoparticle additives facilitated significant reductions in CO and UHC emissions (approximately 7–20% and 15–28%, respectively); however, under the same conditions, slight increases in CO2 and NOx emissions (approximately 6–10% and 5–8%, respectively) were observed. On the basis of the experimental results, we conclude that fuel blends composed of nanographene oxide, Ailanthus altissima biodiesel, and diesel can be introduced as environmentally friendly fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Currently, highly efficient transformation of abundant and low-cost renewable raw biomass into high-quality biofuels and important chemicals is one of the most promising solutions to the current energy crisis, rapid consumption of fossil resources, increasing emission of greenhouse gases and serious environmental pollution. Here, convertible production of promising 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) biofuels was achieved successfully via green catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)-decorated copper-based catalyst with cyclohexanol as hydrogen source. DMF or DMTHF with high yield of 96.1% or 94.6% was produced convertibly through simply modulating reaction time. Extensive characterizations revealed that appropriate surface base sites on the catalyst could efficiently promote the activation of alcohol hydroxyl in cyclohexanol and the subsequent release of active hydrogen species, while highly dispersed surface Cu0 nanoparticles and electrophilic Cu+ species were beneficial to the hydrogen transfer and the activation of both the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group in HMF, respectively. Moreover, as-fabricated NC-decorated Cu-based catalyst presented high stability without obvious loss of catalytic performance after five consecutive cycles, due to the strong interaction between the support and active metal species. Such non-noble metal catalyst has a promising industrial application in the production of valuable biomass fuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims at the development of magnetically recyclable solid catalysts for the production of biodiesel. To achieve this, the magnetically susceptible Fe3O4/MCM-41 composites with core-shell structure were prepared, and sodium silicate was then supported on the magnetic materials by using epichlorohydrin as a cross-linking reagent. The core-shell structured magnetic support and so-prepared solid catalyst were characterized by various techniques. Characterization results showed that the sodium silicate was chemically bridged onto the Fe3O4/MCM-41 composites without obvious damage to the structure of the magnetic support. The solid catalyst exhibited a strong magnetic response and displayed extraordinary catalytic activities in the transesterification of soybean oil for the production of biodiesel, with the oil conversion reaching 99.2% by using the methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 25:1 and catalyst loading of 3 wt% at reflux of methanol after 8 h of reaction. Moreover, the separation of the solid catalyst from reaction mixture was readily achieved by simple magnetic decantation without obvious mass loss, and the solid catalyst could be reused for five times for the heterogeneous transesterification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental pollution and the declining global supply of accessible fossil fuels are the key drivers of the search for alternative sources of energy. Biodiesel, a renewable liquid transport fuel, is commercially-produced using heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts obtained from seashells appeared as promising alternatives thanks to their low preparation cost and increased efficiency in transesterification. In this study, shells from Chicoreus brunneus (known as Adusta murex) were calcined, hydrated, and dehydrated to produce CaO heterogeneous nanocatalyst for the transesterification of rice bran oil into biodiesel. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, surface area measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method), and X-ray diffraction were used to characterise the seashell-derived catalyst. The properties of the rice bran oil-derived biodiesel (acid value, calorific value, density, oxidation stability, and flash point) conformed to the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751 and European EN 14214 biodiesel standards, except for kinematic viscosity. Therefore, the impact of the parameters used for production of the CaO heterogeneous nanocatalyst (calcination temperature and time) and the transesterification reaction (catalyst loading and methanol to rice bran oil ratio) on the kinematic viscosity of RBO-derived biodiesel were determined. A model for the transesterification process was developed using a combination of artificial neural networking with ant colony optimisation. The model predicted that C. brunneus-derived CaO catalyst prepared at 1100 °C for 72 min could be used to produce biodiesel from rice bran oil with a minimum kinematic viscosity (4.42 mm2 s−1) confirming to both the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards in a transesterification reaction operating with a 35:1 methanol to rice bran oil molar ratio and 0.5 wt% catalyst mass. © 2017

AB  - This article reviews the recent advances in the development of zeolite catalysts for biomass valorization processes to produce both biofuels and/or bio-based chemicals, which is an emerging and fast expanding field. The work deals with different types of feedstocks, including vegetable oils, lignocellulose and sugars, as well as with a number of relevant intermediates and platform molecules. Transformation of biomass into valuable products is hindered by a number of factors, mainly related to its complex composition, as biomass typically consists of bulky molecules with high oxygen content. Accordingly, biomass processing usually requires the combination of multiple steps and severe conditions, hence concepts like atom efficiency, product selectivity, and catalyst deactivation become of special relevance. A great progress has been achieved in the past years engineering the properties of zeolites for being adapted to the challenges associated to biomass valorization. The possibility of tailoring the main physicochemical properties of zeolites has become now a reality, being the major reason that explains the success achieved by this class of materials in a growing variety of biomass conversion pathways, as those described in this work: catalytic cracking and pyrolysis, hydrotreatments, with special relevance for hydrodeoxygenation processes, as well as in a high number of condensation, isomerization, and dehydration reactions. Thus, the development of hierarchical zeolites, exhibiting enhanced accessibility, and the possibility of introducing and combining in a controlled way different types of active sites (Brønsted and Lewis acid centers, basic sites, and metal phases) are the main basis of the excellent performance of zeolites in numerous biomass conversion routes. © 2017 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Until recently, most of energy and industrially produced chemicals were derived from fossil fuel-based resources. This along with the continued depletion of finite fossil resources and their attributed adverse environmental impacts, alternatively sourced and more sustainable resources are being pursued as feedstock replacements. Thus, biomass has been identified as an alternate renewable and more sustainable resource as a means to reduce this sector’s dependence on fossil fuel-based resources and to alleviate their environmental impacts. As such, lignocellulosic biomass has been further identified and demonstrated as an abundant renewable resource for the production of biofuels, platform chemicals, and their respective value-added products. This review article provides an overview of the techniques developed for the valorization of biomass in the production of platform chemicals within a biorefinery and the status for commercialization. © 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - This paper presents the main experiences gained and conclusions drawn from the demonstration of a first-of-its-kind wood-based biomethane production plant (20-MW capacity, 150 dry tonnes of biomass/day) and 10 years of operation of the 2–4-MW (10–20 dry tonnes of biomass/day) research gasifier at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. Based on the experience gained, an elaborated outline for commercialization of the technology for a wide spectrum of applications and end products is defined. The main findings are related to the use of biomass ash constituents as a catalyst for the process and the application of coated heat exchangers, such that regular fluidized bed boilers can be retrofitted to become biomass gasifiers. Among the recirculation of the ash streams within the process, presence of the alkali salt in the system is identified as highly important for control of the tar species. Combined with new insights on fuel feeding and reactor design, these two major findings form the basis for a comprehensive process layout that can support a gradual transformation of existing boilers in district heating networks and in pulp, paper and saw mills, and it facilitates the exploitation of existing oil refineries and petrochemical plants for large-scale production of renewable fuels, chemicals, and materials from biomass and wastes. The potential for electrification of those process layouts are also discussed. The commercialization route represents an example of how biomass conversion develops and integrates with existing industrial and energy infrastructures to form highly effective systems that deliver a wide range of end products. Illustrating the potential, the existing fluidized bed boilers in Sweden alone represent a jet fuel production capacity that corresponds to 10% of current global consumption. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Here we present the development of self-regulated "breathing" polymersome nanoreactors that show temporally programmable biocatalysis induced by a chemical fuel. pH-sensitive polymersomes loaded with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and urease were developed. Addition of an acidic urea solution ("fuel") endowed the polymersomes with a transient size increase and permeability enhancement, driving a temporal "ON" state of the HRP enzymatic catalysis; subsequent depletion of fuel led to shrinking of the polymersomes, resulting in the catalytic "OFF" state. Moreover, the nonequilibrium nanoreactors could be reinitiated several cycles as long as fuel was supplied. This feedback-induced temporal control of catalytic activity in polymersome nanoreactors provides a platform for functional nonequilibrium systems as well as for artificial organelles with precisely controlled adaptivity. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In connection with the threating environmental pollution and stringent emission norms, the present experimental research studies the effect of utilizing cerium oxide nanoparticle mixed with an emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel (ENOB) on a compression ignition (CI) direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The whole probe was persuaded using a mono-cylinder 4-stroke direct injection CI engine. A novel nerium olender biofuel was extracted and esterified. Later it was converted into the emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel, that ensued in diluted oxides of nitrogen and in reduced smoke opacity emission. However it produced a marginal penalty of CO and HC emission when equated with neat nerium oleander biofuel. Subsequently, the nano particle blended emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel depicted dramatic diminution in CO, smoke opacity, HC, and NOx emission when equated with standard fossil diesel, neat nerium oleander biofuel and an emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel at various power outputs. It was concluded that the nano emulsion of nerium oleander biofuel could be used in direct injection, compression ignition engines without any hardware alterations in the engine. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global warming due to excessive use of fossil fuels has driven researchers to focus on sustainable energy sources for the future. For clean production systems, biofuel is expanding the domain of renewable and sustainable energy supplies. An efficient and sustainable supply chain plays a pivotal role in ensuring this supply. In this research, crop residuals in different agricultural zones, transportation for shipment of residual biomass as well as biofuel, multiple biorefineries, and multiple market centers are considered. The expense of the resources, the yield of residual biomass in agricultural zones, and the demand of market centers are represented by fuzzy numbers as they are assumed to be uncertain. The carbon emissions cost at all stages of the supply chain was also incorporated into this model. This objective of this study is to develop a supply chain model that minimizes the total cost of a second generation biofuel supply chain and location-allocation for agricultural zones and biorefineries to meet the uncertain demand for market centers. Two numerical examples are analyzed, and the results proves that the cost of biofuel production in biorefineries contributed 52.16%, which is a major proportion of the total cost. In the entire supply chain, the transportation sector is the foremost source of carbon emissions in an environment with 88.50% of the total carbon emissions. The results confirms that the proposed model is viable for designing second generation biofuel supply chains under uncertainty. Significant managerial insights of this research are also described to better express the efficiency of the model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 have been employed as powerful genome engineering tools, heterologous CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 are often difficult to introduce into bacteria and archaea due to their severe toxicity. Since most prokaryotes harbor native CRISPR-Cas systems, genome engineering can be achieved by harnessing these endogenous immune systems. Here, we report the exploitation of Type I-B CRISPR-Cas of Clostridium tyrobutyricum for genome engineering. In silico CRISPR array analysis and plasmid interference assay revealed that TCA or TCG at the 5′-end of the protospacer was the functional protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for CRISPR targeting. With a lactose inducible promoter for CRISPR array expression, we significantly decreased the toxicity of CRISPR-Cas and enhanced the transformation efficiency, and successfully deleted spo0A with an editing efficiency of 100%. We further evaluated effects of the spacer length on genome editing efficiency. Interestingly, spacers ≤ 20 nt led to unsuccessful transformation consistently, likely due to severe off-target effects; while a spacer of 30–38 nt is most appropriate to ensure successful transformation and high genome editing efficiency. Moreover, multiplex genome editing for the deletion of spo0A and pyrF was achieved in a single transformation, with an editing efficiency of up to 100%. Finally, with the integration of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE1 or adhE2) to replace cat1 (the key gene responsible for butyrate production and previously could not be deleted), two mutants were created for n-butanol production, with the butanol titer reached historically record high of 26.2 g/L in a batch fermentation. Altogether, our results demonstrated the easy programmability and high efficiency of endogenous CRISPR-Cas. The developed protocol herein has a broader applicability to other prokaryotes containing endogenous CRISPR-Cas systems. C. tyrobutyricum could be employed as an excellent platform to be engineered for biofuel and biochemical production using the CRISPR-Cas based genome engineering toolkit. © 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - The present study was focused on detailed exergoeconomic analysis of a single cylinder DI diesel engine fueled with diesel/biodiesel blend (B5) emulsified with water at different concentrations, i.e., 3, 5, and 7 wt%. Aqueous cerium oxide nanoparticles were also used at two levels (0 and 90 ppm) as a combustion improver. The combustion experiments were conducted under four engine loads in the range of 25–100% of full load condition at a fixed engine speed of 1000 rpm. More specifically, this study was carried out to find the most thermodynamically and economically favorable fuel compositions and engine operating loads. Overall, engine load had a significant effect on the exergoeconomic variables, while fuel type only affected some exergoeconomic parameters. The cost per unit of exergy for the shaft work exergy was considerably decreased by elevating engine load for all the fuel blends investigated. The lowest cost per unit of exergy for the shaft work was determined at 48.81 USD/MJ for neat diesel at full load condition. Although B5W3m was found to be an exergetically and environmentally efficient fuel compared with the other blends, neat diesel was the most exergoeconomically attractive fuel as revealed throughout this study. This meant that one-dimensional criteria solely based on the conventional exergy analysis cannot be used as perfect decision-making paradigms on the efficiency and productivity of internal combustion engines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is evolving to be one of the most employed biofuels for partial replacement of petroleum based diesel fuel, especially in recent years. The most widely used feedstocks for biodiesel production are vegetable oils. In this work, biodiesel production from castor oil has been synthesized by homogenous alkaline transesterification. The influence of catalyst concentration, methanol:oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time in the methyl ester content reached by castor oil transesterification have been evaluated. A yield of 95 wt% biodiesel was achieved at 1 wt% KOH, 60 °C, 9:1 methanol:oil ratio and 30 min reaction time. Transesterification at temperature 30 °C gave a yield compatibles with that obtained at 60 °C. The composition of the fatty acid methyl ester was determined by Gas Chromatography. The castor oil biodiesel produced was blended with different concentrations of petrodiesel to obtain B5, B10 and B20. The biodiesel properties and its blends were determined according to the standard test methods of analysis. The results showed that Castor oil biodiesel in the blends could lower the cloud point value, but simultaneously, increases the viscosity of the diesel–biodiesel blends. Thus, castor oil biodiesel with its very low cloud and pour points is suitable for using in extreme winter temperatures. © 2018 Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute

AB  - In the present study, castor oil with high free fatty acid was used for biodiesel production using heterogeneous Ni doped ZnO nanocatalyst. Ni doped ZnO nanocomposite calcinated at 800 °C has shown better catalytic activity. Process parameters on heterogeneous catalysis of castor oil into biodiesel were optimized using conventional and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). RSM was found more accurate in estimating the optimum conditions with higher biodiesel yield (95.20%). The optimum conditions for transesterification was found to be oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:8, catalyst loading 11% (w/w), reaction temperature of 55 °C for 60 min of reaction time by response surface method. The reusability studies showed that the nanocatalyst can be reused efficiently for 3 cycles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is known that biodiesel and bioethanol are viable alternative fuels to replace diesel for compression ignition engines. In this study, an experimental investigation is carried out to evaluate the performance and exhaust emissions of a single cylinder diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends. The engine performance parameters evaluated are the brake speciﬁc fuel consumption and brake thermal efﬁciency whereas the exhaust emission parameters evaluated are carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and smoke opacity. Kernel-based extreme learning machine is used to predict the engine performance and exhaust emission parameters of the fuel blends at full throttle conditions. Based on the experimental results, the brake specific fuel consumption is lower while the brake thermal efficiency is higher for the biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends. The carbon monoxide emissions and smoke opacity are also lower for these fuel blends. The mean absolute percentage error of the brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and smoke opacity is 1.363, 1.482, 4.597, 2.224, and 2.090%, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that K-ELM is a reliable method to estimate the engine performance and exhaust emission parameters of a single cylinder compression ignition engine fuelled with biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapidly increasing global energy consumption has caused depletion of fossil fuels, leading to the search of alternative energy resources. One of the potential solutions is utilizing algae biomass as the source of bioenergy. To fulfil the high biomass demands for biofuel production, it is of pivotal importance to develop feasible technologies to enable economic, efficient and high density cultivation of algae. Algae can be cultivated in either open or closed systems in the presence of nutrients and light intensity. The maximum yield, growth rate and composition of algae can be optimized according to cultivation conditions, such as temperature, pH, light intensity and nutrient concentration. The potential types of algae in contributing carbohydrate and lipids to produce biofuel such as biodiesel, bioethanol and bio-gas are reviewed. Economic feasibilities of algae based fuel production are discussed based on Life Cycle Analysis. Current challenges and future prospective are also presented to realize the use of algae as a feedstock for commercial and cost effective fuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Highly efficient cell-free enzymatic systems are typically difficult to achieve in traditional immobilized enzyme systems because of the lack of optimal spatial control of enzyme localization, substrate and product diffusion, and enzyme and coenzyme accessibility. Here, we report a strategy for expanding the pore apertures (from 3.3 to 6.7 nm) of a series of Zr-based metallic-organic frameworks (MOFs) (termed NU-100x, x = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) with interconnected hierarchical pores by maintaining precise control of torsional angles associated with the linkers. As a proof of concept, we use the expanded NU-100x MOF structures to encapsulate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and demonstrate the use of the captured protein in a cell-free biosynthetic catalytic system. Remarkably, LDH immobilized in the large pores of the MOF is accessible to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzymes (NAD and NADH), allowing for in situ coenzyme regeneration leading to higher activity than that of the free enzyme. Cell-free synthetic biology is an emerging field of biotechnology that is expanding the capabilities of natural biological systems, as demonstrated by the rapid development of various systems for biofuel and biochemical production. To achieve large-scale industrial production of cell-free enzymatic systems, efficient immobilization strategies are needed to overcome challenges such as high production costs of enzymes and coenzymes. Here, we create a series of ideal enzyme carriers based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with interconnected hierarchical mesoporous channels. These MOF enzyme carriers show water stability, high enzyme-loading capacity, and coenzyme accessibility and demonstrate the use of the captured protein in a cell-free biosynthetic catalytic system. This work provides a strategy for constructing novel immobilized cell-free enzymatic systems for industrially relevant applications. Farha and colleagues have developed a strategy for expanding the pore apertures of csq-net Zr-based MOFs to obtain an isoreticular series of MOF structures with pore apertures ranging from 3.3 to 6.7 nm. Enzymes immobilized in the MOF are accessible to coenzymes and show higher activity than that of the free enzymes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant organic carbon source and has received a great deal of interest as renewable and sustainable feedstock for the production of potential biofuels and value-added chemicals with a wide range of designed catalytic systems. However, those natural polymeric materials are composed of short-chain monomers (typically C6 and C5 sugars) and complex lignin molecules containing plenty of oxygen, resulting in products during the downstream processing having low-grade fuel properties or limited applications in organic syntheses. Accordingly, approaches to increase the carbon-chain length or carbon atom number have been developed as crucial catalytic routes for upgrading biomass into energy-intensive fuels and chemicals. The primary focus of this review is to systematically describe the recent examples on the selective synthesis of long-chain oxygenates via different C-C coupling catalytic processes, such as Aldol condensation, hydroalkylation/alkylation, oligomerization, ketonization, Diels-Alder, Guerbet, and acylation reactions. Other integrated reaction steps including, for example, hydrolysis, dehydration, oxidation, partial hydrogenation, and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) to derive corresponding key intermediates or final products are also reviewed. The effects of catalyst structure/type and reaction parameters on the catalytic performance along with relevant reaction mechanisms are in detail discussed. Apart from this, the formation of other useful compounds containing C-X bonds (X = O, N, and S) derived from biomass-based substrates for producing fuel additives and valuable chemicals is also briefly reviewed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (mainly carbon dioxide) is one of the major threats of the modern era. Primary causes are the high reliance on fossil fuels for power generation, transportation, manufacturing and the intensive land usage (deforestation). The current share of renewable biofuel production in the overall fuel demand has been found insufficient to replace fossil fuels. Microalgae can deliver a sustainable and complementary biofuel platform with some important advantages. This review aims to offer a state-of-the art review of algal biomass conversion methods into various biofuel products, including biodiesel, syngas, biogas, bioethanol. Emerging more sustainable biofuel/bioenergy production technologies are highlighted. Attention is also paid to sustainable cultivation methods, including wastewater treatment and bioremediation to capture CO2 and fix nitrogen and phosphorus, produced from industrial, agricultural and municipal sources. Finally, a light is shed on the important role of algae metabolic engineering. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Water and energy are key sustainability issues that need to be addressed. Photocatalysis represents an attractive means to not only remediate polluted waters, but also harness solar energy. Unfortunately, the employment of photocatalysts remains a practical challenge in terms of high cost, low efficiency, secondary pollution and unexploited water matrices influence. This study investigated the feasibility of photocatalysis to both treat water and produce hydrogen with practical water systems. Polymeric carbon nitride foam (CNF) with large surface area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the bubble-template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal condensation. The reaction kinetics, mechanisms, and effect of natural water matrices and wastewater on CNF-based photocatalytic removal of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the efficiency of clean hydrogen energy from natural water matrices and wastewater was also evaluated. It was found that the photocatalytic performance of CNF for TC-HCl removal was principally affected by calcination temperature in the presence of NH4Cl. The degradation rates of CNF-4 (calcined at 550 °C) were approximately 1.84, 2.49 and 7.47 times than that of the CNF-2 (calcined at 600 °C), CNF-1 (calcined at 500 °C) and GCN (without NH4Cl), respectively. Results indicate that the improved photocatalytic performance was predominantly ascribed to the large specific surface area, increased availability of exposed active sites, and enhanced transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier. Based on electron spin resonance, chemical trapping experiment and density functional theory calculation, photoinduced oxidizing species (·O2− and holes) initially attacked the C-N-C fragment of TC molecules, which were finally mineralized to CO2, water and inorganic matters. Under the synergistic influence of water constituents (including acidity and alkalinity, ion species and dissolved organic substances), various water matrices greatly affected the degradation rate of TC-HCl, with the highest removal efficiency of 78.9% in natural seawater, followed by reservoir water (75.0%), tap water (62.3%), deionized water (49.8%), reverse osmosis concentrate (32.7%) and pharmaceutical wastewater (18.9%). Interestingly, low amounts of the emerging microplastics slightly improved TC-HCl removal, whereas high amounts (1.428 × 107 P/cm3) restricted removal due to light absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction. Moreover, the photocatalysts were able over repeated usage. Notably, the hydrogen yields rates of polymeric carbon nitride foam were 352.2, 299.8, 184.9 and 94.3 μmol/g/h in natural seawater, pharmaceutical wastewater, water from reservoir and tap water, respectively. This study proves the potential of novel nonmetal porous photocatalyst to simultaneously treat wastewater while converting solar energy into clean hydrogen energy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd
