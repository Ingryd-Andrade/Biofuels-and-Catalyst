AB  - The article looks at the inclusion of aviation in the European Union (EU) emissions trading scheme from the perspective of innovation. It argues that the initiative of the European Union to subject aviation to the scheme has functioned as a catalyst for innovation in the sector. Innovation has particularly manifested itself in the areas of air traffic management, aeronautics and biofuels. The article examines the EU mechanisms activated to foster innovation to draw conclusions on the existence and nature of an EU innovation policy. It approaches innovation as a means to achieve the objectives of the various EU policies rather than as an end in itself. Drawing upon the example of aviation it concludes that, although it docs not appear that the EU has developed an autonomous system of horizontal rules on innovation, it does have plenty of instruments, which, if well-orchestrated, could lead to an innovation concert. © 2013 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.

AB  - Pyrolysis of soybean oil was carried out in a ZnCl2-KCl molten salt. The effects of feed rate, flow rate of carrier gas, pyrolysis temperature and input quantity were studied. And the compositions of the bio-oil were analyzed by GC-MS. The results show that the feed rate and carrier gas flow rate have great influences on the pyrolysis by changing the reaction residence time of soybean oil. When the feed rate is 1.2 g/min and without the carrier gas, the soybean oil can be fully cracked with the longer residence time. The gasification of the primary pyrolysis products is enhanced with the increasing of temperature, which leads to the yield, the content of oxygenated compounds and the acid value of bio-oil increase. With the increasing of input quantity, the yield of bio-oil is near 70% and keeps stable, but the decarboxylation effect decreases. The properties of bio-oil are improved and its component distribution is similar to the 0# diesel after catalytic hydrogenation.

AB  - Esterification of pyrolytic rubber seed oil with SO42-/ZrO2 soild acid as catalyst was investigated; the effects of zirconium sources, calcination time and temperature on the catalytic performance were considered. The acidic properties of the SO42-/ZrO2 catalyst were characterized by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR). The results indicated that the SO42-/ZrO2 solid acid prepared by using ZrOCl2 as zirconium source and calcined at 550°C for 4 h exhibits high catalytic activity and stability in the esterification of the pyrolytic rubber seed oil. The esterification product obtained as a bio-oil was superior to those prepared via conventional methods; its properties are similar to those of 0# diesel oil.

AB  - The world's energy supply is mainly composed of fossil fuels, which are a non-renewable source of energy that is rapidly running out. To overcome this concern, industry has been focusing on the production of biofuels such as biodiesel. A range of approaches has been considered to transform oils into applicable biodiesel: dilutions, microemulsifications, pyrolysis and transesterification. The latter method consists of the conversion of triglycerides to a mixture of alkyl esters and glycerol, in the presence of an acyl acceptor and a catalyst. Due to high selectivity when using enzymes as catalysts, and mild operating conditions, biocatalytic transesterification has proven to be an efficient method. Cutinase, from the superfamily α/β hydrolases, is an enzyme with lipolytic activity that effectively catalyses transesterification reactions. This article highlights the use of cutinase microencapsulated in bis(2ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT)-reversed micelles to perform the biocatalytic transesterification of triglycerides, with low chain-length alcohols (e.g. methanol), in organic media to produce biodiesel. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - The extensive under-used area of roadsides along public highways could readily provide valuable environmental, economic, and cultural benefits for society. Furthermore, local food sources are an increasing priority as energy and environmental costs of long-distance transport increase. This article highlights the central goals and principles for introducing food production in roadsides. Seven types of roadside cultivation are considered: market vegetables, grain, fodder, orchard, biofuel, compost, and livestock. Principles important for incorporating food production into roadsides include: location relative to adjacent land uses; wildlife movement and biodiversity; site topography and hydrology; and arrangement of crops based on roadside pollutant concentrations. Potential problems and their solutions are examined, such as: a swale and remediation system for stormwater and aerial pollutants; a banded vegetation pattern with inedible crops close to the road and edible crops farther from the road; and strategically locating trees to narrow the perceived highway width for enhanced driver safety. Major benefits of roadside production include providing additional farmland for farmers, vegetation design that facilitates wildlife movement and reduces the effects of habitat fragmentation, a cultural symbol of productivity in a highly visible landscape, local food for markets and eateries, carbon sequestration, and multi-use right-of-way biodiversity and landscape management. A case study uses the goals and principles pinpointed to outline a specific design strategy for inserting diverse agriculture along 30km of highway (MA I-495) outside Boston, Massachusetts (USA). Now, widespread designs and pilot projects are needed to initiate the next generation of our roadsides, where public appreciation for local food production, multiple uses of infrastructure, and the landscape's wildlife heritage become the norm.

AB  - Gradual depletion of fossil fuels warmed the use of biodiesels as an alternative fuel source and a suitable way to minimize the usage of fossil fuels. Biodiesel is a renewable source of energy derived from plant oil or animal fats. They are mono alkyl ester of long chain fatty acids formed by seed oil.Efficiency of transesterification of oil from three sources(Jatropha, Karanjia and Simarouba DC)was determined in this experiment with methanol as a solvent and Paratoulene sulphonic and sodium methoxide as a catalyst. In this experiment we are concentrating on the factor that effect transesterification i.e. optimization of catalyst, molar concentration, effect of reaction time and temperature. The output characteristics may include certain physio-chemical properties that vary from plant to plant. These may be verified by Gas chromatography and NMR along with their molar ratio. © EM International Printed in India. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study was carried out to utilize waste frying oil for biodiesel production because it is cheap, easily available and renewable raw material. The used frying oil was analyzed for water contents (0.43 %), iodine value (52), sponification value (205), free fatty acids (8.7 %) and acid value (0.8 mg KOH/g). Esterification and transesterification were conducted to convert free fatty acids and triglycerides to methyl ester (biodiesel), respectively. One-step and two-step transeterification reactions were carried out to measure the efficiency of these processes for biodiesel production. The biodiesel produced from used frying oil was examined for flash point (185 °C), kinematic viscosity (4.86 mm2/s) and specific gravity (0.884 g/mL) that were meeting the limits of ASTM and Thai standards. Hence, it was proved to be a useful technique for biodiesel production at commercial scale.

AB  - The effect of different liquefaction condition and molecular sieve catalyst dosage on the products distribution under reaction temperature of 260-320°C and ethanol usage of 0-140 mL was discussed, and reaction mechanism for corn stalk in sub- and super-critical ethanol with or without molecular sieve catalyst was researched combining GC/MS analysis of liquefaction products. The results show that the yields of bio-oil and gases rise significantly with the increasing of temperature, when temperature was over 300°C, the main reaction was the secondary pyrolysis of bio-oil. The ethanol possesses the function of transferring heat, dissolving, providing free radicals, and can reform the constituent of bio-oil. The uniform tiny hole structure of molecular sieve catalyst and acidity catalyst reaction will promote the formation of water soluble organics, and increase the reaction rate and intensity. Comparing with the liquefaction without catalyst, the yield of water soluble organics was obtained with the increment of 6.01%.

AB  - It is well known that the used cooking oil (UCO) is responsible for the high pollution found in groundwater, fact that leads to increase treatment cost of wastewater, moreover, the environmental problems produced by the use of diesel fuel increase the need of seeking alternatives to decrease this problems by means of the reuse of UCO, finding a cleaner alternative fuel. Biofuel such as biodiesel is considered as one of this alternative having environmental advantage due to decrease of pollutant emissions in diesel engines. Biodiesel from UCO is produced throughout the transesterification reaction, using alcohol and a catalyst. This paper reports the effect of temperature, alcohol/oil molar ratio, and catalyst amount used over the yield of the transesterification reaction using oil from hotel industry. The homogeneous catalysts was based in NaOH from 0.5 and 0.7% by weight, the range operation temperatures were between 50 and 60 °C, with molar ratio alcohol / oil 6/1 and 9/1. Quite high yield values were shown, among 83 and 95%, with a statistical error of less than 0.5. © 2013, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - Choosing the methanol as the representative of low molecular weight alcohols, experimental research of the viscosity-temperature and thermal response characteristics of bio-oil mixed with low molecular weight alcohols was carried out, and the empirical formulas were established by the regression analysis depending on the Andrade equation and lumped heat capacity method, respectively. The experiment results indicated that the viscosity of the bio-oil/methanol mixtures decreased with increase of the methanol mass proportion and the mixtures' temperature, furthermore, the impact of temperature on the viscosity was reduced as the temperature rose. The thermal time constant of the bio-oil/methanol mixtures decreased at first, then increased with the higher mass proportion of methanol, the minimum constant appeared when the methanol proportion was up to around 30wt.%.

AB  - Human population explosion, progressive industrialization, automobiles and world energy requirements, particularly for the fossil fuel is likely to deplete limited natural resources over short period of time. Therefore, search for an alternative fuel resource is the only way to overcome the upcoming energy crisis. Biofuel, in this context seems to be a sustainable option. Biomasses so far used for biodiesel production include animal fats, vegetable oils like soybean, rapeseed, Jatropha, mahua, mustard, flax, sunflower, palm, hemp, field pennycress, Pongamia pinnata etc. which require agricultural land for their growth. In the present context, population explosion does not permit the use agricultural land for the cultivation of petro crops and therefore the scientists have to find an energy feedstock which does not require fertile land use. Keeping it in view, emphasis has been given to the autotrophic tiny organisms of algae for biodiesel production, the world over. Certain algal species contains oil producing substrate and are rapidly growing under normal conditions. This algal fat can be processed into biodiesel by trans esterification. Biodiesel production from algae involves identification of high fatty acid storing algal species, their cultivation in open or hybrid photobioreactors, harvesting, oil extraction and process standardization. Biodiesel production from algae had been emphasized by Bhatnagar et al. (2011) which need proper initiative to become energy sustainable. © 2013, Society for Plant Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - The oil palm presents a comparatively advantageous source of feedstock for biofuels production compared to other first-generation biofuel feedstocks. Among the sources of feedstocks for biofuel production currently available and developed in the world, the oil palm is the prime option which fulfills the sustainability criteria for high productivity, efficiency, competitive price discounts, and above all it is cost effective. Biofuels produced from oil palm biomass would be considered sustainable only when all the production chains from oil palm cultivation to biofuels production (including the production of input materials and energy) are within the acceptable production criteria for sustainable oil palm and biofuels developments. In order for the oil palm industry to fully accomplish the objectives of sustainable oil palm biofuels production, Malaysia and Indonesia are currently ensuring the implementation of stringent sustainability standards via best management practices especially for the production of palm biofuels so as to improve yield and reduce the amount of input resources. This chapter highlights on some best management practices involving globally accepted initiatives for sustainable oil palm agriculture, palm oil milling, and refining as well as different production routes to palm biofuels production. Integration of different production routes for various types of palm biofuels through effective utilization of wastes for sustainable development are also elaborated in this chapter. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - Electronic waste plastic problem are increasing day by day all over the world. One year 50 million tons of e-waste produce all over the world. Only 15-20% of e-waste is recycled, the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators. Electronic waste plastic conversion into fuel experiment was performed with 10 % Zinc Oxide catalyst and 10% activated carbon. Thermal degradation process temperature range was 200-400 °C. 75 gm of sample was use for this experiment by weight and 7.5 gm of ZnO and 7.5 gm of activated carbon used. Produced fuel density is 0.88 gm/ml and liquid fuel conversion rate is 74.26 %, light gas percentage is 3.34 %. Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) was use for liquid fuel analysis purpose and carbon chain compounds detected C3H6 to C24H18. Fuel can be use for petroleum feed stock refinery.

AB  - 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a potentially important platform chemical that connects renewable biomass feedstock with the future industrial production of biofuels and chemical intermediates. A reaction process toward rapid production of HMF and furfural from acacia wood chips was investigated at 180-200°C, using metal chloride catalysts in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl) solvent, with lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock. Several key factors including reaction temperature, concentration of raw wood chip materials in the solvent, hydrochloric acid (HCl) concentration, catalyst species and loading, etc. were studied in order to optimize the reaction condition. The results show that the production of HMF from lignocellulosic biomass is greatly accelerated under a higher temperature compared with that reported in the literature for cellulose conversion. Among the chosen metal chlorides, CrCl3·6H2O shows the best catalytic performance. Under the optimized reaction conditions, with CrCl3·6H2O as catalyst, HMF and furfural yields can reach 55.0% and 22.9% respectively at 200°C in 4 min. This high-temperature reaction process is rapid and cost-effective for the industrial production of HMF and furfural, and there is no need for pretreatment of lignocellulose biomass before reaction.

AB  - Advances in agrarian genomics are writing a new page in the history book of science and technology, this article analyses whether and how these advances could be also adding a new page to the work of making poverty history. More specifically, it focuses on the local specific development of biotechnologies and genomics as a catalyst for development within the agrarian systems of peasants. It takes up the challenge to research whether and how these technologies might be sustainably developed (both socially and technically) by multi-stakeholder networks formed mainly by peasants, peasants' groups, civil society organisations, and researchers in the so-called Third World. Empirical analysis have been conducted in the form of three case studies, comprising: (1) a territorial development of a Bt-biopesticide in Andhra Pradesh, India; (2) the development of molecular markers within contradictory cultural environments in small-scale potato crop systems of the Bolivian Andes; and (3) the local-global biotechnologisation of the biofuel plant Jatropha curcas in Yoro, Honduras. These developmental dynamics are captured within the term Local Sustainable Biotechnological Development, which can be defined as a type of development that is based on the reconstruction of biotechnologies mainly (though not exclusively) by and for local actors, and which strengthen peasant agrarian systems and which empowers peasants, civil society organisations and local researchers within biotechnological structures. © 2012, RIS.

AB  - The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires the U.S. to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel per year by 2022. Domestic ethanol production has increased steadily in recent years, growing from less than 5 billion gallons per year (bgpy) in 2006 to over 13 bgpy in 2010. While there is interest in developing non-oxygenated renewable fuels for use in conventional vehicles as well as interest in expanding flex-fuel vehicle (FFV) production for increased E85 use, there remains concern that EISA compliance will require further use of oxygenated biofuels in conventional vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently granted partial approval to a waiver allowing the use of E15 in 2001 and newer light-duty vehicles. Despite EPA's determination that E15 will not contribute to increases in full-useful life emissions in these vehicles, there remains concern amongst some vehicle manufacturers that the vehicle malfunction indicator light (MIL) may be displayed (or activated) due to increased use of oxygenates in gasoline. Similar concerns also exist for isobutanol and isopentanol, which are emerging as potential blending components for future gasoline formulations. This paper describes a test program in which increasing amounts of ethanol were added to gasoline to gradually increase the long term fuel trim (LTFT) until the MIL was displayed. When the MIL was activated, the threshold LTFT was recorded. Vehicles used in the MIL study were also used in the recently completed Department of Energy Catalyst Study (during which they were exposed to ethanol blends up to E20). No incidence of fuel-related MILs occurred during the 2 year catalyst aging program on the 86 vehicles from six of the largest manufacturers (Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan, Toyota). In the current MIL study, vehicles were driven on a specified 4-day cycle with multiple cold starts, idles, and hot soaks. Ethanol levels were increased steadily until the MIL was activated. Estimates of the rate of increase of LTFT as the fuel oxygen content increased were also determined. LTFT MIL thresholds were determined to vary from 18% to 38%, with the rate of LTFT increasing between 4-5% for a 10% increase in the ethanol blend level (or 3.5% oxygen in the fuel). These data were utilized in combination with statistical data on LTFT variability and mean values determined by the CRC E-90 study to project an estimate of the MIL activation frequency for the vehicle models tested in this study when they are used with 10%, 15%, and 20% by volume ethanol blends, and for equivalent oxygen content in blends of butanol and pentanol. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine the relative importance of the variables to the estimated MIL occurrence rates for each vehicle. The results show that some vehicles are likely to exhibit some MIL illumination events when using E10, while others are estimated to have few, if any, MILs illuminate with E20. In general, the estimated rate of MIL illumination increases as the ethanol blend fraction increases, although in some cases few, if any, MIL illuminations are predicted. The results show that the greatest frequency of MIL activation is expected for vehicle models that utilize an LTFT threshold of 20% or less for MIL activation. © 2012 SAE International.

AB  - Biodiesel obtained from vegetable oils as an alternative fuel for diesel engine is becoming increasingly important. The biodiesel quality and yield are affected by the properties of the oil used. The properties of the oil vary from region to region depending on the nature of the soil in which oil crops are cultivated, agricultural practices, rainfall etc. In this study the raw oil from Jatropha Curcas seeds grown in the western Ghat section of South India was tested for its physiochemical properties to determine its suitability for biodiesel production. A bench scale, compact biodiesel processor was developed locally by the authors and biodiesel was produced from raw Jatropha Curcas oil using alkali based transesterification process. The physiochemical properties of the biodiesel produced meet the ASTM standards but the yield was comparatively low (80%v/v) because of the high free fatty acid content (13.7 mg KOH/g of oil) in the raw Jatropha Curcas oil. The brake thermal efficiency of the biodiesel produced as a fuel in a four stroke single cylinder diesel engine coupled with an electric generator (34.19%) at maximum load conditions shows the possibility of utilization of biodiesel produced as a fuel in the diesel engine.

AB  - Deoxygenation, or removal of oxygen from oxygenates, is a reaction of paramount importance in the production of hydrocarbon fuels from biorenewable substrates. A thermodynamic equilibrium analysis gives valuable insights into the theoretical limits of desired products when a substrate is reacted under a given set of conditions. Here we report the equilibrium composition of the methanol-to-gasoline hydrocarbon system by minimizing the total Gibbs energy of the system. Minimization was performed under constrained conditions using a non-linear optimization technique available in SAS. The system was treated as a gaseous mixture of ten components: C6H6, C 7H8, C8H10 (ethyl benzene), C 8H10 (xylene), CH3OH, H2O, C, CO2, CO, and H2. The carbon in the equilibrium mixture was used as a measure of coke formation, which causes deactivation of catalysts that are used in aromatization reactions. The equilibrium composition of methanol was analyzed for temperatures ranging from 400°C to 1200°C and gauge pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 15 atm. It was observed that when the temperature was increased, the system changed from negative to positive, making the deoxygenation reaction less spontaneous. The positive portion of the Gibbs free energy further increased when the pressure was increased from 0 to 15 atm. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - New 'nano-meso ZSM-5' (NM-ZSM-5) material was successfully synthesised by hydrothermal treatment using silica derived from rice husk. The synthesis of the material involves two steps of crystallisation, including the formation of ZSM-5 zeolite seed and mesoporous structure. The effect of crystallisation time on the formation of mesoporous structure was studied in the range 0-40 h. Samples were characterised by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and 27Al-NMR methods. The results show that the best time for crystallisation is 14 h. The synthesised material has a multiporous structure, including micropore system of ZSM-5 zeolite, mesopore system of MCM-41 and another pore system which has a diameter in the range 10-50 nm (mesoporous system) due to the burning of organic compounds that remain in the material during the calcination process. In addition, the synthesised NM-ZSM-5 achieves crystallinity of approximately 100%. The catalytic performance of NM-ZSM-5 material was evaluated by the catalytic cracking reaction to produce biofuel from vegetable oil sludge. The research proved that NM-ZSM-5 is one of the most suitable catalysts for this process. The catalytic cracking reaction over NM-ZSM-5 yields products that are similar to those of the petroleum cracking process, such as dry gases, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, light cycle oil and heavy cycle oil. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This work proposed a method to predict the dynamic viscosity values of the hypothetical acidic oils-based biodiesel fuels. A topological index that can formulate the molecular structural information of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) components into dimensionless form was built from the integration and modification of the distance matrix and adjacency matrix of the molecular structure. Results show that both the caprylic acid (C8:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2) are beneficial components for reducing the biodiesel fuel's dynamic viscosity. Nine hypothetical acidic oils-based biodiesel fuels were made from the mixing of C8:0 or C18:2 with one vegetable oil at the same mass ratio, including peanut, canola, coconut, palm, soybean, corn, rapeseed, sunflower and cottonseed oils, and the dynamic viscosity values of them were predicted. The dynamic viscosity values were ranged at 0.90-2.13 mPa s (with the addition of C8:0) and 2.83-4.07 mPa s (with the addition of C18:2). This investigation is expected to provide some suggestions for the selection of some components that are beneficial for reducing the product's dynamic viscosity, so that the atomization characteristic of a low-quality feed can be improved by adding some suitable components into it. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper discusses possibilities of increasing the performance parameters of a diesel engine and decreasing the emission of toxic compounds contained in exhaust gases by using preliminary catalytic treatment of biofuel, executed directly in the injector body. In order to enhance the impact of the catalyst on the flowing fuel the author proposes to utilize the phenomenon of turbulization in injector passages. The results of tests on a 359 type engine have shown an improvement of operational parameters and a decrease of toxic emission in exhaust gases.

AB  - Sustainable economic and industrial growth requires safe, sustainable resources of energy. Biofuel is becoming increasingly important as an alternative fuel for the diesel engine. The use of non-edible vegetable oils for biofuel production is significant because of the increasing demand for edible oils as food. With the recent debate of food versus fuel, some non-edible oils like soapnut and Jatropha (Jatropha curcus. L) are being investigated as possible sources of biofuel. Recent research has focused on the application of heterogeneous catalysis. This review considers catalytic transesterification and the possibility of heterogeneous base catalysts. The process of transesterification, and the effect of parameters, mechanism and kinetics are reviewed. Although chromatography (GC and HPLC) are the analytical methods most often used for biofuel characterization, other techniques and some improvements to analytical methods are discussed.

AB  - Many kinetics studies on methanolysis assumed the reactions to be irreversible. The aim of the present work was to study the dynamic modeling of reversible methanolysis of Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) to biodiesel. The experimental data were collected under the optimal reaction conditions: molar ratio of methanol to JCO at 6: 1, reaction temperature of 60°C, 60 min of reaction time, and 1% w/w of catalyst concentration. The dynamic modeling involved the derivation of differential equations for rates of three stepwise reactions. The simulation study was then performed on the resulting equations using MATLAB. The newly developed reversible models were fitted with various rate constants and compared with the experimental data for fitting purposes. In addition, analysis of variance was done statistically to evaluate the adequacy and quality of model parameters. The kinetics study revealed that the reverse reactions were significantly slower than forward reactions. The activation energies ranged from 6.5 to 44.4 KJ mol-1. © 2013 Azhari M. Syam et al.

AB  - Ni-Co/Ce-Zr-O catalyst was prepared by incorporating sol-gel and wet impregnation methods. Meanwhile, mechanism of methanol and acetone (model compound derived from bio-oil) catalytic steam reforming over Ni-Co/Ce-Zr-O catalyst were studied. The results indicated that methanol was first absorbed by Ce at the catalyst Ni-Co/Ce-Zr-O and transformed into methoxyl species. Methoxyl group further dehydrogenation produced formate. Part of the formate separating from the Ce atom was combined with the absorbed H atoms to form formic acid. The others were transformed into absorbed CO2 after further liberating hydrogen. Finally, absorbed CO2 separated from the catalyst. The mechanism of acetone catalytic steam reforming is as follows: first of all, the water molecule is broken up into OH and H under the synergic effect of the carrier and the metal. The OH species is then absorbed by Ce 3+, and the H species is absorbed by active metal. Next, the carbonyl group of acetone is absorbed by OH, which is linked to Ce atom, while the methyl of acetone is absorbed by Ni atom; meanwhile hydrogen is released. After that, CO2 releases by breaking of the Ce-O bond, then part of the methyls absorbed from the neighboring Ni atoms polymerize to produce C 2H4; the others, after water assisted decomposition, produce CO2 and H2. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The reforming of glycerol was investigated using a microreactor in the presence of MoCoP/zeolite catalyst. The parameters which were investigated include initial hydrogen pressure, reaction temperature, residence time, and feedstock concentration. The liquid products were separated into water-soluble components and bio-oil by liquid-liquid extraction with water and ethyl acetate. The bio-oil, gaseous products, char, and unreacted glycerol were quantified relative to the initial mass of glycerol feed. The composition of the bio-oil was determined by GC/MS. The optimum conditions for the reforming of glycerol into bio-crude in the presence of MoCoP/zeolite catalyst were found to be: 300°C reaction temperature, 5 MPa initial hydrogen pressure, 60 min reaction time, and 100% glycerol feed. While dilution of the glycerol feedstock with water had a negative effect on bio-oil yield, reforming of pure glycerol produced the highest bio-oil yield (40 wt.% at 300°C, 1 h, and 5 MPa H2). The amount of char deposited on the catalyst decreased with extended reaction time, increased reaction temperature, and elevated initial hydrogen pressure.

AB  - The seed of Chinese Spicehush, containing 41.87% crude oil with 24.54% saturated acids and 75.32% unsaturated acids, could potentially be an alternative source of biodiesel. The problems of water pollution and the high purification cost of biodiesel can be avoided by using solid basic catalysts. The catalytic efficiency of CaMgZn oxide for the transesterification of Spicehush oil was evaluated. Catalysts were prepared via conventional co-precipitation methods and were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation. The catalyst with a Ca/Mg/Zn molar ratio of 2:1:7 exhibited excellent catalytic performance and possessed a unique mesoporous structure with a surface area of 51.35 m2g-1 and an average pore diameter of 11.6 nm. The calcination temperature largely affected the structural and catalytic properties of the catalyst. Under the optimal transesterification conditions at 65°C (catalyst amount of 5 wt.%, molar ratio of methanol to oil of 12, reaction time of 2 h), a high conversion ratio of 92.3% can be obtained. The biodiesel conversion rate did not exhibit a linear relationship with the amount of CaMgZn catalyst and reached maximum values at the catalyst amount of 5 wt.%. The CaMgZn solid basic catalysts could be applied as an alternative to traditional homogenous catalysts. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In order to improve the productivity and reduce the production cost of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) made from waste cooking oil, orthogonal tests and single factor tests were conducted to optimize the process. The effects of ratio of methanol to waste cooking oil, content of catalyst, reaction time, and reaction temperature were investigated systematically in this study. The results showed that all these factors had significant impacts on the reaction for producing biodiesel from waste cooking oil. The significance of factors influencing biodiesel production in descending order is stir speed&gt; content of catalyst input&gt; reaction time&gt; mass ratio of methanol to waste cooking oil&gt;reaction temperature. The optimal stir speed, mass ratio of methanol to waste cooking oil, content of catalyst input, reaction time, and reaction temperature were 60 r·min-1, 0.22:1, 1.0%, 3 h, and 60 °C, respectively.

AB  - A mathematical model for the enzyme-entrapped conducting polymer modified electrode is discussed. Approximate expressions for the steady state concentration of the various species in the film and the current response of the enzyme electrode are derived. In this work we employ the Homotopy analysis method (HAM) to solve the nonlinear equations. These approximate analytical results are found to be in good agreement with the previously reported limiting case results. The obtained results are valid for the whole solution domain.

AB  - In this investigation, cotton seed methyl ester (CSME) was prepared by transesterification using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst. The engine performance was analysed with different blends of biodiesel and was compared with neat diesel. It was concluded that the lower blends of biodiesel are closer to diesel as far as thermal efficiency is concerned. In the lower blends, the brakes specific fuel consumption is also comparatively reduced. The smoke density also increases for the blends of methyl ester of cotton seed oil diesel compared to neat diesel operation. The oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission level are decreased with the blends of methyl ester of cotton seed oil compared to neat diesel. The results proved that the use of biodiesel (produced from cotton seed oil) in compression ignition engine is a viable alternative to diesel. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Heteropolyacids are a class of compounds that can be used to catalyze a great range of reactions, either in homogeneous or heterogeneous phase, because they have good stability, solubility and high acidity. These compounds show good applicability in the use of biomass for biofuel production, as demonstrated in a variety of reports. This text presents a bibliographic research on the application of heteropolyacids in the production of biodiesel and bioethanol in the last years, as well as the reuse of byproducts of these processes.

AB  - Various renewable energy technologies are under considerable interest due to the projected depletion of our primary sources of energy and global warming associated with their utilizations. One of the alternatives under focus is renewable fuels produced from agricultural wastes. Malaysia, being one of the largest producers of palm oil, generates abundant agricultural wastes such as fibers, shells, fronds, and trunks with the potential to be converted to biofuels. However, prior to conversion of these materials to useful products, pre-treatment of biomass is essential as it influences the energy utilization in the conversion process and feedstock quality. This chapter focuses on pre-treatment technology of palm-based agriculture waste prior to conversion to solid, liquid, and gas fuel. Pre-treatment methods can be classified into physical, thermal, biological, and chemicals or any combination of these methods. Selecting the most suitable pre-treatment method could be very challenging due to complexities of biomass properties. Physical treatment involves grinding and sieving of biomass into various particle sizes whereas thermal treatment consists of pyrolysis and torrefaction processes. Additionally biological and chemical treatment using enzymes and chemicals to derive lignin from biomass are also discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - Algae-based technologies could provide a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes. Microalgae can produce biocompounds that are easily converted into biofuels, depending upon growing conditions. The idea of using microalgae as a source of fuel is now being taken seriously because of the escalating price of petroleum and the emerging concern about global warming that is associated with burning fossil fuels. Microalgae-derived agar to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural conversion paves the route for algal biomass to liquid fuel transformation. Ionic liquid played a major role in direct conversion of agar to liquid fuel-additive 5-ethoxymethyl-furfural. Acidic ionic liquids and solid acids would be major components of catalysts for algal biomass transformation to fuels.

AB  - Three most frequently used methods for fat transesterification were compared using rendering plant fat (RPF) as model. Acid-catalysed transesterification was found to be the most effective (conversion 90%) at optimum conditions (fat: methanol ratio 1:10, sulphuric acid amount of 2% v/v, temperature 95°C). Base-catalysed transesterification of RPF on the other hand, results in much lower conversion (45%) at optimum conditions (fat: methanol ratio 1:20, NaOH amount 8% w/v, optimum temperature 95°C). The difference is done (among others) by the fact that RPF has high concentration of free acid (high acidity number) compared with the fats usually used for transesterification and that free acids are not esterified in alkaline media. Enzyme-(lipase) catalysed reaction could lead to partial esterification of free fatty acids, but with much lower reaction velocity. This fact leads to higher conversion in the case of enzyme-catalysed transesterification of RPF compared with base-catalysed reaction; nevertheless, even in this case the conversion is much lower in comparison with acid-catalysed reaction. The optimum conversion in enzyme-catalysed reaction was 55%.

AB  - Four homogeneous catalysts RuCl2(PPh3)3, RhCl(PPh3)3, PdCl2(PPh3)2 and NiCl2(PPh3)2 were prepared for upgrading of bio-oil to improve its quality. From the results by GC-MS, the high reactive aldehydes, phenols and acids in bio-oil were converted substantially at mild conditions (under 100°C). The conversions of aldehydes to corresponding alcohols and phenols with C=C side chain to phenols with saturated side chain by using catalyst RuCl2(PPh3)3 were over 90% and 50%, respectively. Moreover, the conversion of phenols with C=C side chain was over 85% by using RhCl(PPh3)3. Besides the ability to promote adehydes and C=C hydrogenation, catalysts PdCl2(PPh3)2 and NiCl2(PPh3)2 still shown performance in acids esterification. Meanwhile, due to the low temperature and catalysts high efficiency, char and coke were not found in all experiments. The results show the great potential of upgrading bio-oil using homogenous catalytic hydrogenation technique.

AB  - Ethanol is increasingly popular as fuel. It is renewable, cleaner than gasoline, and during the 2008 oil price peak, its costs of production without subsidies actually rivalled those of gasoline. The fuel grade ethanol producers are large consumers of stainless steel, in particular for cookers, fermentation tanks, and distillation columns as well as storage tanks for the finished product. The main reason is that cleanliness is important for the enzymes. However, contaminants play an important role in production as well as storage and distribution. Contaminants are causing a phenomenon called stress corrosion cracking. Biodiesel fuel is a mixture of fatty acid alcohol esters. Modern diesel engines are very sensitive to fuel quality and purity. Biodiesel is unstable, just like butter, which is going rancid in a matter of weeks. Biodiesel degradation is an oxidation process, which among others is speeded up by tiny amounts of metal ions leaching from production and storage vessels. Biodiesel vessels need to be designed in non-degradable materials of construction, as stainless steel. In addition, pretreatment of low cost feedstock and methyl recycling operations use strong acids, which also necessitate stainless steels. Biomass is gaining importance as a source for renewable fuels and hydrogen in addition to heat and electricity. Corrosion issues are numerous and include high temperature corrosion under ash and alkali salt deposits and metal dusting at gasification. Fuel grade ethanol, biodiesel and biomass represent three different corrosion issues, which can be solved using the correct stainless steel. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

AB  - This work presents resources of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina available for bioethanol and motor fuels (gasoline and diesel fuel) from sustainable resources: corn-stalks, straw, sweet sorghum, pork fat. The physicochemical basis for novel processes for motor fuel production is coupling microwave pyrolysis of oil shale and catalytic cracking of purified pyrolysis oil, hydrothermal liquefaction of algae and swine manure. The effects of the degree of purification of crude pyrolysis oil and oil shale on the degree of their conversion to gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as the product distribution are investigated. The effects of the duration and temperature of hydrothermal liquefaction of microalga, Botryoccocus braunii, and swine manure on their degrees of conversion into biooil and its thermal properties are investigated. The development of novel strategy of biofuel in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina is presented.

AB  - We developed a method to reduce the acid value of crude Zanthoxylum bungeanum seed oil (ZSO) with high free fatty acids. The acid value of ZSO was reduced from 56.23 mg KOH/g to 1.56 mg KOH/g by using one-step, acid-catalyzed esterification under the following optimum conditions: methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 30:1; 1.5% H2SO4; temperature of 60°C; and a reaction time of 120 min. The variation analysis of the orthogonal tests reveals the following sequence of different factors that contribute to esterification: mole ratio of methanol to ZSO&gt; w (catalyst)&gt;reaction temperature &gt; reaction time. Results show that the mole ratio of methanol to ZSO has a significant influence on esterification and deacidification. The esterification kinetics reveals that the acid-catalyzed esterification of ZSO to methanol is a two-step reaction. The dynamics equation is obtained and the activation energy (Ea) is 9542 J/mol at 60°C. The work laid a good foundation for subsequent biodiesel preparation.

AB  - The increasing world production of biodiesel has resulted in an accumulation of crude glycerol as the major byproduct. This could be used as carbon source for industrial microbiology, with economic and environmental advantages for the biodiesel industry. We explored an Atlantic Rainforest soil sample to search for crude glycerol-degrading microorganisms. Microcosms of this soil were established containing minimal medium + 8% crude glycerol (w/w); the biological activity was measured by respirometry. High CO2 levels were found in some of the crude glycerol microcosms, suggesting the activity of microorganisms capable of degrading this residue. In an attempt to isolate and cultivate these microorganisms in vitro, aliquots of the soil suspension were plated on minimal medium containing 10% crude glycerol (v/v). Out of 19 morphologically distinct isolates, 12 bacteria and 6 yeasts were identified by PCR from universal primers 16S and 26S rDNA, respectively. Optical density readings revealed growth differences among cultures. Two yeasts and three bacteria with distinct growth profiles stood out and appeared to have potential for liquid fermentation of crude glycerol. The yeasts adapted rapidly, but produced relatively little biomass. Opposite tendencies were found in the bacteria. Amplicon sequencing placed the bacterial isolates as close to Staphylococcus arlettae, Pseudomonas citronellolis, and Bacillus megaterium, and the yeasts to Trichosporon moniliiforme and Meyerozyma guilliermondii. We concluded that these species have potential for use in crude glycerol bioreactors and for bioremediation processes. © FUNPEC-RP.

AB  - Particle number measurements during different real world and legislative driving cycles show that catalyst heating, cold and transient engine operation cause increased particle number emissions. In this context the quality of mixture formation as a result of injector characteristics, in-cylinder flow, operation & engine parameters and fuel composition is a major factor. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the influence of different biogenic and alkylate fuels on the gaseous and particle number emission behavior during catalyst heating operation on a single-cylinder DISI engine. The engine is operated with a late ignition timing causing a high exhaust enthalpy flow to heat up the catalyst, a slightly lean global air fuel ratio to avoid high hydrocarbon emissions and a late injection right before the ignition to reduce the coefficient of variance of the indicated mean effective pressure. While the local fuel enrichment through the late injection helps to stabilize the inflammation and combustion process it can also lead to very high particle number emissions due to poor mixture formation. Based on the experimental results with RON 95 fuel the particle emission behavior with different biogenic fuel blends (E40, B40), alkylate fuels and toluene is examined. The variation of the fuel composition shows how certain molecules (aromatics, alcohol) affect the particle emissions while the adaption of the boiling curve directly influences the mixture formation in general. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the potential of biofuels to reduce the particle number emissions of modern GDI engines. Copyright © 2013 SAE International and Copyright © 2013 KSAE.

AB  - The effects of ethyl acetate addition on the stability of bio-oil from rice straw fast pyrolysis were investigated through measuring the physicochemical properties of the bio-oil during storage. The results showed that by adding ethyl acetate of 1%, 6%, 11%, 16% and 21%, the final pH values of the bio-oils are increased by 0.66%, 2.33%, 3.65%, 4.32% and 6.31%, respectively; the final water contents are decreased by 10.90%, 20.17%, 28.19%, 30.27% and 35.10%, respectively; the final viscosities are decreased by 13.69%, 39.08%, 57.99%, 66.00% and 73.58%, respectively. The FT-IR and GC-MS analyses indicated that ethyl acetate can inhibit bio-oil from some aging reactions and reduce the content of organic acids.

AB  - This work shows the results of a Proficiency Testing performed by a partnership between INMETRO and ANP. The performance of 49 Brazilian laboratories (using the z-score statistical test) in determining 10 quality parameters of ethanol fuel and biodiesel was evaluated. The certified reference values were provided by INMETRO, allowing a more rigorous assessment of the laboratories. For hydrous ethanol, the acidity parameter showed the lowest number of laboratories with satisfactory results (48%), while 85% of the laboratories presented satisfactory results for ethanol content. For biodiesel, the percentage of laboratories with satisfactory results ranged from 46% (kinematic viscosity) to 92% (acid number).

AB  - Staphylococcus sp. WL1 lipase (LipFWS) was investigated for methanolysis of crude palm oil (CPO) at moderate temperatures. Experiments were conducted in the following order: searching for the suitable bacterium for producing lipase from activated sludge, sequencing lipase gene, identifying lipase activity, then synthesising CPO biodiesel using the enzyme. From bacterial screening, one isolated specimen which consistently showed the highest extracellular lipase activity was identified as Staphylococcus sp. WL1 possessing lipFWS (lipase gene of 2,244 bp). The LipFWS deduced was a protein of 747 amino acid residues containing an α/β hydrolase core domain with predicted triad catalytic residues to be Ser474, His704 and Asp665. Optimal conditions for the LipFWS activity were found to be at 55 C and pH 7.0 (in phosphate buffer but not in Tris buffer). The lipase had a K M of 0.75 mM and a V max of 0.33 mM min-1 on p-nitrophenyl palmitate substrate. The lyophilised crude LipFWS performed as good as the commonly used catalyst potassium hydroxide for methanolysis of CPO. ESI-IT-MS spectra indicated that the CPO was converted into biodiesel, suggesting that free LipFWS is a worthy alternative for CPO biodiesel synthesis. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Conditions were found under which the industrial aluminum-platinum catalyst AP-64 and the pilot zeolite system Pd-Zn/Al2O3/MFI (MFI is a high-silica ZSM-5 type zeolite) catalyze single-stage highly selective conversion of rapeseed oil and ethanol to either alkane or alkanearomatic fraction of hydrocarbons suitable as engine fuel components. The hydrocarbon chain grows with participation of ethylene, which is formed in the argon medium directly from the ethanol molecule. Under these conditions, hydrogenation of this alkene on intermetallic clusters arising during the long-term reductive preactivation is suppressed. The alcohol supplies not only ethylene but also hydrogen. In the presence of Pd-Zn/Al2O3/MFI, ethanol is converted to alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons according to independent pathways. Joint processing of alcohols and rapeseed oil in the presence of the Pd-Zn/Al2O3/MFI catalyst system is an efficient and promising route to C3-C11 hydrocarbons in the absence of an external source of hydrogen. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The increased demand for energy and the depletion of the main energy sources worldwide has led to the constant search for alternative and renewable sources of energy. Biofuels (e.g., bioethanol and biodiesel) have been configured with an important strategy to reduce dependence on nonrenewable fuels in the global energy matrix. However, the search for alternatives faces a number of technological challenges and market for its implementation and consolidation as a more sustainable energy source. NMR, as well as other analytical techniques, has contributed to the search for new biofuel sources with the potential energy required, process development, storage studies, as well as in the production quality control. The multiple application capabilities of NMR techniques throughout the production chain of biofuels, mainly because it is a noninvasive and rapid, make it ideally suited for application in the development of biofuels around the world. However, its implementation has some challenges that involve the use of inexpensive equipment and rapid analysis for fieldwork beyond integration of different analytical techniques and physical chemical measurements using statistical tools with purpose of using simple measures to obtain information about the chemical constitution and physical chemical properties in biofuels. © 2013 John Wiley &Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The production of palm biofuels provides the prospects for new economic opportunities for most people in rural communities in developing countries. Oil palm cultivation and palm oil milling provide wide avenues for people in terms of job creation, investment opportunities, etc. In spite of all the benefits of palm biofuels, they are also found to cause negative socio-economic impacts to the society. The economic impacts of oil palm and palm biofuels production are elaborated in this chapter. Oil palm biomass is a cheap source of feedstock for palm biofuels compared to other feedstocks used for biofuel production. In this chapter, biodiesel production from palm oil and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) are found to be economically viable compared to fossil diesel and biodiesel from other oils. Bioethanol and biomethanol production from oil palm biomass are also found to be cost competitive compared to gasoline and other cellulosic ethanol. Other potential types of palm biofuels are assessed for economic sustainability and improvement options are also suggested in this chapter. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - Ca(Ac)2/ZnO was prepared by impregnation and with which CaO/ZnO was made by high temperature calcination. Effects of impregnating solution mass fraction, calcination temperature and calcination time on the catalytic activity of CaO/ZnO were investigated through orthogonal experiments. The transesterification of castor oil with methanol was studied by using CaO/ZnO as a catalyst, prepared under the optimal conditions. Ca(Ac)2/ZnO) and CaO/ZnO prepared at optimal conditions were characterized by TG-DTG, XRD, BET. The results showed that the suitable preparation conditions of CaO/ZnO was impregnating solution mass fraction 0.2, calcination temperature 973 K and calcination time 3 h. Under the conditions of alcohol/oil molar ratio 9, catalyst/oil mass ratio 0.03, reaction temperature 338 K and reaction time 4.5 h, castor oil conversion could reach 99.7%. There were two distinct weightless peaks at 690 K and 1020 K in TG-DTG curves of Ca (Ac)2/ZnO. CaO/ZnO and ZnO had the same crystalline structure, displaying CaO being utterly dispersed on ZnO. The surface area of CaO/ZnO was 6.10 m2g and its average pore radius was 2.59 nm.

AB  - The One-pot conversion of bagasses into 5-chloromethylfurfural under mild conditions (75-95°C) was investigated. The catalytic efficiencies of ten metal chlorides (AlCl3, MgCl2 etc.) were studied, and the desired product was characterized by GC-MS, 1H-nuclear magnetic and infrared spectrum. The experimental results illustrated that all these tested metal chlorides can catalyze the conversion of bagasses into 5-CMF, and AlCl3was the optimum catalyst in these catalysts including chlorides of alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and transition metal. With AlCl3 as the catalyst, the reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction time, amount of AlCl3 were optimized. The optimum conditions were as follows: use 6.0 g/L AlCl3, 85°C for 3 h, and the yield of 5-CMF was 72%. This work will provide an important framework for the development of potential biofuels using bagasse as materials.

AB  - In this review of bioelectronic devices, the progress achieved recently in device performance and miniaturization due to the application of nanotechnology has been presented and critically evaluated. Functional nanoparticles embedded in films of various biodevices act as to enhance the electron transfer between large biomolecules, such as redox proteins, enzymes, or DNA, and the electrode surface and provide new means for the analytical signal transduction due to their unique optical and electronic properties. Metal, semiconductor, and carbon nanoparticles, including nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes, have been reviewed. The carbon nanotubes (CNT), in addition to serving as excellent electrocatalyst, can provide a molecular support (scaffold) to enhance rigidity and robustness and enable device implantation. The integration of biofuel-cells, sensors, and silicon microelectronics creates a framework of a portable or implantable device which can serve in a theranostic treatment of chronic diseases. The advantages and biocompatibility issues of implantable devices and examples of bioelectronic Boolean logic gates enhanced by nanoparticles are discussed for future development of efficient, robust, and safe bioelectronic devices.

AB  - Aviation biofuel mainly consists of straight chain paraffin with chain length from 8 to 16 carbon atoms, which has better low temperature engine startup performance and higher lubricity than traditional aviation kerosene. The production techniques for the aviation biofuel have been analyzed, including Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrodeoxygenation, fast pyrolysis and biochemical conversion. The choice of the appropriate catalysts is a key for the manufacture of biofuel by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or the hydrodeoxygenation process. When different catalysts and operation conditions are employed, synthesized products are different. Co-based and Fe-based catalysts are the main catalysts used in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process and Ni-based catalysts are the main catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation process due to their high activities. The unstable feedstock and high production cost are primary problems hindering the biofuel industrialization.

AB  - This study was carried out to synthesize, characterize and evaluate the application of mesoestruturated catalysts MCM-41, 5%MoO 3-MCM-41 and 5%NiO-MCM-41 in the hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose. XRD results indicate that the phase of mesoporous MCM-41 was obtained and that the introduction of metal oxides did not affect this mesoporous phase. About the heterogeneous hydrolysis reaction, it was observed that the increase in temperature results in a higher concentration of glucose and the catalyst 5%MoO 3-MCM-41 provides the highest concentrations of glucose.

AB  - Oils available in mango, tangerine and African star seeds were extracted and characterized to determine their fuel worthiness for biofuel production. Furthermore, the fuel properties of the three oils were within the range observed for some common oil seeds like rapeseed, soybean and sunflower, which are widely sourced for the production of biodiesel on an industrial scale. The low iodine values of the oil extend their applications as non-drying oil for lubrication purposes, however, the fuel properties exhibited by the oils enlist them as potential oil seeds for the production of biofuel and further research on the improvement of their properties will make them suitable biofuel of high economic values. © 2012 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The formation and development process of fuel spray has a great influence on fuel atomization, fuel evaporation, fuel-air mixing, and combustion, which can further influence the properties of a diesel engine. The atomization process and its quality are affected not only by the mutual friction between the fuel spray and ambient air, but also by the flow behavior in the nozzle orifice such as the cavitation effect and the turbulent flow among which the flow disturbance induced by the cavitation is the first important factor effecting the atomization of fuel spray. A lot of research studies on an alternative fuel, Jatropha curcas oil (JCO), for diesel fuel have been carried out by both domestic and international scholars with the focus mainly on the preparation methods, and physical and chemical properties as well as the performance and the pollutant emissions of a diesel engine fueled with JCO. Nevertheless, the issues related to a systematic study of the cavitation flow and the spray outflow characteristics, which have a great influence on the injection and atomization of JCO, are seldom reported. In the present paper, a three-dimensional gas-liquid two-phase model of cavitation flow was developed, which took the influence of injection conditions on fuel viscosity, fuel density, and bubble number density into consideration. After the validity of the model was verified, a three-dimensional numerical simulation that was about the influences of injection pressure, injection back pressure and fuel temperature on the cavitation flow of JCO in a diesel nozzle was carried out. The results showed that: the mean flow velocity at outlet (MFVO) and the mass flow rate is enhanced gradually with the increment of injection pressure, and the discharge coefficient decreases simultaneously. However, the cavitation effect does not change significantly. The injection backpressure has little influence on the flow characteristics of JCO in the diesel nozzle. MFVO, mass flow rate, and discharge coefficient raise remarkably with the increment of JCO temperature, and at the same time, the cavitation effect is significantly enhanced. The cavitation effect and MFVO of JCO are lower than those of diesel fuel under the same injection condition, but whether the mass flow rate and the discharge coefficient of JCO are higher than those of diesel fuel also depends on the fuel temperature. The results obtained indicate that the increment of JCO temperature will remarkably enhance the cavitation effect, strengthen the flow disturbance, and improve MFVO and the cycle fuel injection quantity, which are beneficial for the fuel injection, atomization, and the performance of a diesel engine. The research can provide references for in-depth analysis on the working process of diesel engine fueled with JCO.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of Undaria Pinnatifida was carried out over a nanoporous Al-SBA-15 catalyst for the first time. Pt nanoparticles were added to Al-SBA-15 to generate a Pt/Al-SBA-15 catalyst. The effect of the addition of the Pt nanoparticles on the catalytic pyrolysis was investigated. For rapid product analysis and catalyst evaluation, a pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used. The characteristics of the catalysts were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscope, NH3 temperature programmed desorption, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. Compared to the non-catalytic pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis over Al-SBA-15 produced a higher-quality bio-oil with a high stability and a low oxygen content. When Pt/Al-SBA-15 was used, compared to Al-SBA-15, the improvement of bio-oil quality was more profound; the yield of high-value-added aromatics increased, while the yields of acids and oxygenates decreased Copyright © 2013 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - The catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose was investigated using H-ZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios and Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn content. The nature of these catalysts was characterized by ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The no-catalytic and catalyic pyrolytic behaviors of cellulose were studied by thermo-gravimetric (TG) technique, and pyrolytic liquid product, i. e. bio-oil, was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major components of bio-oil are described as follows: anhydrosugars including levoglucosan (LGA, 1, 6-anhydro-β-glucopyranose), levoglucosenone (LGO, 1, 6-anhydro-3, 4-dideoxy-β-D-pyranosen-2-one), 1, 4: 3, 6-dianhydro-α-D-glucopyranose (DGP), furan compounds such as furfural and 2, 5-dimethyl furan, aldehydes, etc. H-ZSM-5 and Zn/ZSM-5 samples with Brönsted acid and Lewis acid sites exhibited a remarkable effect on the pyrolytic behaviors of cellulose, where H-ZSM-5 could increase the yield of bio-gas but decrease the yield of bio-char and bio-oil. Moreover, it was found that Brönsted acid and Lewis acid sites could enhance the formation of a specific compound of bio-oils, e. g. Zn ions could produce some esters.

AB  - Enzymes, as natural catalysts, are prime players in the search for the new efficient environmentally friendly production of biofuels. The different permutations of the many variables, such as source, selectivity, stability and structure of substrates and enzyme, immobilization and/or life-time of the catalyst, temperature and time of the reaction and solvent constituency, polarity and quantity make the use of enzymes for this purpose a daunting task. An esterase is a unique family of enzymes that can either esterify a fatty acid in a non-polar solvent containing a stoichiometric amount of short-chain alcohol or hydrolyse an ester into the corresponding acid and alcohol. Even though tolerance of the esterase to such solvents increases the solubility of the substrates and assists in the recovery of product final product yield is controlled provided a specific amount of water is also present influencing the enzyme-substrate equilibrium and the lipid-water interface - an area that is occupied by the esterase. Knowing the composition of the solvent medium needed for esterase activity is complicated by knowledge of the structure of the binding pocket, substrate entry into the enzyme active channel, the flexibility of the enzyme itself, unwanted hydrolytic reactions and total changes in the thermodynamic footprint between substrate and enzyme. This article explores a computational structural analysis of an esterase investigating the substrate-enzyme binding site and uses simple simulations and molecular dynamics to address the mechanism(s) and pathways that products - fatty acid esters (biodiesel) - dissociate from the enzyme. Two simulations in hexane:MeOH (9:1) and water as well as hydrogen bond interactions of the substrate/product with the enzyme, RMSD and B-factor calculations and the presence of water molecules in enzyme active binding pocket dictate which entry or exit pathway is preferable. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The MixAlco™ process converts biomass to hydrocarbons (e.g., gasoline) using the following generic steps: pretreatment, fermentation, descumming, dewatering, thermal ketonization, distillation, hydrogenation, oligomerization and saturation. This study describes the production of bio-gasoline from chicken manure and shredded office paper, both desirable feedstocks that do not require pretreatment. Using a mixed culture of microorganisms derived from marine soil, the biomass was fermented to produce a dilute aqueous solution of carboxylate salts, which were subsequently descummed and dried. The dry salts were thermally converted to raw ketones, which were distilled to remove impurities. Using Raney nickel catalyst, the distilled ketones were hydrogenated to mixed secondary alcohols ranging from C3 to C12. Using zeolite HZSM-5 catalyst, these alcohols were oligomerized to hydrocarbons in a plug-flow reactor. Finally, these unsaturated hydrocarbons were hydrogenated to produce a mixture of hydrocarbons that can be blended into commercial gasoline. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Spurred by improvements in catalysts as well as new experimental designs, lipid researchers have attained some impressive new outcomes by applying olefin metathesis to fatty acid substrates. Monomers for polyamides, environmentally-responsive coatings, and blends of biofuels are among the bio-derived materials obtained. This reaction is a powerful way to reconfigure the C18skeleton into its component subunits such as alkenes or carboxylates, or to add functionality via a cross-metathesis partner, thus continuing progress toward realizing the potential of plant oils as feedstocks for the biorefinery. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - Background: Upgrading of bio-oil using acid-catalyzed olefination with added alcohol was explored. The previous approach of using a reagent such as 1-butanol to overcome the phase separation problem demonstrated excellent results. However, bio-based production of 1-butanol is still a low-yield process. In this work, a low-cost commodity solvent and reagent, ethanol, was used. Also, ethanol has lower viscosity than 1-butanol. Results & discussion: Bio-oil was reacted with excess 1-octene in the presence of solid acid catalysts and ethanol. Acid-catalyzed olefination induced changes in the resulting bio-oil by generating variety of alcohols, ethers, esters and oligomeric mixtures of the starting olefin. The reaction also decreased the water content and acid value, and increased the heating value of the bio-oil. However, the increase of the high heating value of the product bio-oil was moderate due to the presence of two phases in the reaction mixture. Conclusion: Ethanol is not as effective as less-polar 1-butanol at promoting 1-octene and bio-oil phase compatibility. This study shows the need for a low cost, better reagent than ethanol. The reagent should effectively decrease the phase separation to facilitate the reaction between bio-oil and the olefin. Solid acid catalysts with high hydrothermal stability are also needed to improve the upgrading process. © 2013 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Environmental friendly bio-oil which offers supply reliability as a potential alternative fuel, has spurred to rapid development of biofuels technology. Palm oil is a potential renewable energy source for biofuels production in the future and Malaysia is one of the world largest palm oil producers. However, undesired oxygen content in the plant fatty acid that contributes to low energy density, high viscosity, and low stability, makes the palm oil not effective to be used as biofuels directly. In the present study, the performance of silica supported trimetal catalyst, NiSnK/SiO2, on deoxygenation of used palm oil was evaluated. In addition, the effects of operating parameters, such as reaction temperature and weight hourly space velocity were investigated. Conversion of palmitic acid as high as 90% was achieved in deoxygenation of used palm oil at reaction temperature 350oC. In order to have a better understanding on the deoxygenation reaction, model compound system using the major saturated fatty acid in the used palm oil, palmitic acid was also carried out. Palmitic acid was found mainly decarboxylated into n-pentadecane with some decarbonylation and isomerizations products.

AB  - Biomass fast pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) is considered to be a promising renewable liquid energy carrier. But it cannot be applied in stationary combustion engines, so upgrading is required. A considerable alternative upgrading method is hydrodeoxygenation; the heavy fraction of hydrodeoxygenated pyrolysis oil (HDO-oil) is called HHDO-oil. In this article, HHDO-oil co-processed with paraffin oil in a fixed-bed was studied under the conditions of different temperatures, different weight hourly space velocity, and also different co-processed ratio. It was found that co-processing of 20 wt% HHDO-oil with paraffin oil gave higher yields of liquid and better oil quality than that of the pure paraffin oil cracking. The optimum operating condition was at 520°C, the weight hourly space velocity was 4.0 h-1, and the co-processed ratio was 20%. In this operating condition, it produced the highest yield of liquid, which was 78.65 wt%, including gasoline fraction that was 8.48 wt%, diesel fraction was 37.37 wt%, lubricant fraction was 19.03 wt%, and residue fraction was 13.78 wt%. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In-use vehicles which are high emitters (HEVs) make a large contribution to the emissions inventory. It is not known, however, whether HEVs share common emissions characteristics, and particularly the effect of ethanol blends. We study this by first examining laboratory measurements of exhaust and evaporative emissions on ethanol blends containing 21%, 26% and 30% aromatics, and a reference fuel formulated with methyl-tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). Switching from MTBE to ethanol fuels on HEVs shows no effect on the total emissions of regulated pollutants, but 1,3-butadiene emissions would increased substantially while the emissions of total carbonyls would not be affected except in the case of acetaldehyde, which would increase with EtOH. The ozone-forming potential of exhaust and evaporative emissions would be less using the EtOH blends and specific reactivity will not be incremented. Lowering the vapour pressure of the gasoline and increasing the proportions of alkylate and isomerate in the composition produces an ethanol-blended fuel with lower environmental impact both in normal vehicles and HEVs. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Dual pressures currently arising from energy shortage and environmental degradation worldwide make it critically important to utilize renewable biomass resources for energy. But due to the requirement for the safety of food and feed, triglyceride feedstocks (currently derived mainly from vegetable oils and animal fats) and lignocellulose among the various kinds of naturally-occurring biomass are practical sources for production of liquid biofuels instead of fossil fuels. In this respect, we review the recent progress in the transformation of triglyceride feedstocks and lignocellulose into liquid biofuels by different catalytic routes. These routes include thermal cracking, hydrogenation and transesterification for oils and fats, and gasification-Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, liquefaction-upgrading and selective synthesis via platform chemicals for lignocellulose. The catalysts and processes involved in these catalytic routes are intensively discussed, and their existing problems and possible solutions are addressed, which may provide insights helpful for further studies on the more efficient utilization of biomass for energy.

AB  - A strong interest has been focused from several years on the algae pathway for energy production, especially for transportation fuels called third generation biofuel or G3 biofuel, and mainly from microalgae route, considering it could be a high potential alternative strategy for renewable energy and fuel production. Algae, and especially microalgae, present significant advantages compared with land resources, such as much higher productivity and lack of competition with food applications. Nevertheless, based on current knowledge, the production of an algae biomass for energy remains a difficult target to reach, due to the numerous existing hurdles such as the energetic yield and the economic positioning, without neglecting the environmental and societal aspect. Unlike first generation (G1) and a few second generation biofuel (G2) processes, G3 biofuel processes are far from the industrialization step. In 2010, under the initiative of IFP Energies nouvelles, Airbus, Safran, EADS IW and the “Acade mie des Technologies”, launched a French national study of the potential of the algae sector as resources for the so called G3 biofuel production. This study was called “Algogroup” and led by IFP Energies nouvelles. The objective was to obtain a shared vision of the deployment possibilities. It led to the creation of this Algogroup task force with the previous partners, adding Sofiproté ol, INRA1, IFREMER1, CEVA1 and the Agrimip pole to combine all available knowledge and determine the responses which could be given to the existing questions. The Algogroup objective was to facilitate vision sharing between participating organisations and industrials on the technical improvements, the probabilities of success, the R and D needs and the development perspectives, while paying close attention to the obstacles which have to be alleviated to improve the positioning of the algae pathway. To reach this target, Algogroup has explored several axes, which enabled a thorough analysis of the potentials and limits of the technology: from the species selection to the harvesting (lipid extraction/recovery), including environmental and economical aspects. This paper focuses on some main aspects of the Algogroup study related to economical positioning and environmental terms, specially Life Cycle Analysis (LCA).Alarge share of the work was dedicated to microalgae, but since it was also considered important to examine the potential role of macroalgae, a specific analysis was conducted on this aspect. It has enabled the group to issue some recommendations such as a need for an integrated approach, need for tools to run comprehensive technico-economic assessments, including co-products valorisation. Despite the limited amount of reliable information currently available on the algofuel sectors, especially in terms of environmental balance, numerous challenges still remain to be taken up to make these sectors credible and profitable, both technically, economically and environmentally. On the economic aspect the estimated costs for future microalgae biofuels remain in a very broad range from $2/Gal to $7/Gal. There remains great potential to decrease microalgae oil production costs, but this has to be considered very carefully given the large amount of underlying assumptions. Moreover, as yet underlined, microalgae biofuels are not currently being produced at a commercial scale, thus these are only potential scenarios, which will have to be confirmed. And finally, several technologies can be used to produce microalgae oil and location possibilities are proposed. Another key point is that, in a large majority of scenarios, the economic viability of the pathway relies on the valorisation of what one usually calls co-products. Valorisation of co-products is not considered a valid option in the long-term as no market identified today could absorb the quantities associated to a new fuel market. Besides, environmental studies have demonstrated that the energetic balance was not favourable at present, based on current processes, but the variation range of the results let some space for significant improvements. The balance of greenhouse gas emissions was favourable, and there also the variation range was very wide. As regards the other environmental impact categories, however, the uncertainties are too great to draw any conclusions. Because of the heterogeneity of approaches and results for the development of the algae pathway, we must bear in mind that without reliable and robust assessments of these sectors it will not be possible to direct their technical development sustainably. Macroalgae as a resource for biofuels production are very far from being a commercial reality, but do present some advantages such, for green algae, exhibiting several similarities with current G1 and G2 feedstock, being producers of starch and unlignified cellulose. Nevertheless, they also contain other specific compounds. Red and brown macroalgae are currently the most produced species, but their composition calls for the development of new transformation processes. Although technically feasible at lab-scale, the economic viability of such processes is being endangered by the complexity of the processes involved and the numerous steps required as well as by non-technical issues such as competition with other markets like green chemistry. To have a true share of the future fuel mix, macroalgae production needs to be increase by a dozentime fold. This increase should not be done without social acceptance or at the expenses of the environment. This issue was adressed for microalgae, but data on macroalgae are currently lacking to be able to conduct Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on this very specific environment. There are also additional problems to be taken into account, such as the lack of legislation or conflicts of usage with existing sea activities for example. Potential for high tonnage production seems real, but the challenge is to federate existing actors and new ones to build a new agro-industry. As a conclusion, no true leveraging option, leading to significant breakthroughs has really emerged as a short term solution, but wide spaces for significant improvement could be envisaged and more laboratory and pilot works have to be achieved before being able to move to a higher scale, leading to the first step toward industrial production. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Biodiesel has emerged as one of the most growing biofuels to replace diesel fuel. Its preference as one of the most popular alternative fuels was based on its characteristics as it is environment friendly, sustainable, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Biodiesel is mandated by many governments worldwide for incorporation into their diesel supply base. Biodiesel is easily produced through transesterification reactions of vegetable oils (triglycerides). However, current commercial usage of refined vegetable oils for biodiesel production is impractical and uneconomical due to high feedstock cost and priority as food resources. Low-grade oils, typically waste cooking oils, brown greases, crude corn oils, etc., can be better alternatives; however, the high free fatty acids (FFAs) content in such oils has become the main constrain for those potential feedstocks, and therefore pretreatment methods become necessary to prepare such feedstocks to make biodiesel. The chapter highlights the pretreatment methods to utilize and convert the FFAs from various feedstocks to biodiesel and presents the advantages and limitations of using enzymes and conventional catalysts, distillation, blending, and glycerolysis methods to lower FFAs in the feedstocks. An overview on the current status of biodiesel production, the feedstocks and the FFAs factors are also discussed. With the proper pretreatment methods, the high-FFAs feedstocks can indeed become the next ideal feedstocks for the production of biodiesel. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - One of the most important renewable resources of energy nowadays is biofuel. Biofuels can be defined as solid, liquid, or gas fuel derived from recently dead biological material which differ it from fossil fuels. They are categorised into two types: biofuels that are produced from agriculture products including crops, plants and current forests. Agriculture sources produce two main products: ethanol and biodiesel, but we study only biodiesel. The aim of this work is production of biodiesel extracted from natural vegetables oil: soybean and sunflower oils, by the process of transesterification, under laboratory conditions. Biodiesel is a diesel-type fuel made by separating glycerin from vegetable oil to create methyl esters. In this process, the alkoxy group of an ester compound is exchanged with another alcohol. These reactions are often catalysed by the addition of an acid or base. In this study we used methyl alcohol and potassium hydroxide. Biodiesel is produced in pure form (100% biodiesel or B100), and is blended with petrodiesel, 6% (B6) and 10% (B10). These analyses are made at the Organic Chemistry and Technology Laboratory, and we will continue for further analyses with different vegetable oils.

AB  - With the purpose of increasing the amount of sugars that benefit the yield of ethanol in fermentation, it was performed hydrolysis of Beta vulgaris L. with H2SO4. The following parameters were used to evaluate the degree of hydrolysis of substrate: stirring, acid concentration, mass, and temperature. The mass was tested in the range of 5 to 40 g and stirring from 100 to 250 rpm. The temperature and reaction time were evaluated in the range of 30 to 90 oC and 2 to 6 h, respectively. The tested particle size was 0.5 mm and a reaction volume of 50 mL was used for all cases. The rate of 150 rpm had a better effect over hydrolysis. By comparison of means it was determined that concentrations higher than 0.5 N of H2SO4 showed no significant effect (p&lt;0.05) on the release of total sugars. The highest yield of hydrolysis was obtained with 10 g of substrate in the reaction medium. The temperature of 90 oC provided the highest hydrolysis and at 50 oC the amount of total sugars was 3 g/L lower than that generated with 90 oC. The best pretreatment conditions were: 40 oC, 150 rpm and 10 g of substrate. The increase in the reaction time indicates that hemicellulose degradation occurs inside the matrix of substrate and that amorphous regions are generated, promoting cellulose availability.

AB  - Ethanol is a biofuel commonly used in gasoline blends to displace petroleum consumption; its utilization is on the rise in the United States, spurred by the biofuel utilization mandates put in place by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the statutory responsibility to implement the EISA mandates through the promulgation of the Renewable Fuel Standard. EPA has historically mandated an emissions certification fuel specification that calls for ethanol-free fuel, except for the certification of flex-fuel vehicles. However, since the U.S. gasoline marketplace is now virtually saturated with E10, some organizations have suggested that inclusion of ethanol in emissions certification fuels would be appropriate. The test methodologies and calculations contained in the Code of Federal Regulations for gasoline-fueled vehicles have been developed with the presumption that the certification fuel does not contain ethanol; thus, a number of technical issues would require resolution before such a change could be accomplished. This paper makes use of the considerable data gathered during the mid-level blends testing program to investigate one such issue: estimation of non-methane organic gas (NMOG) emissions. The data reported in this paper were gathered from over 600 cold-start Federal Test Procedure (FTP) tests conducted on 68 vehicles representing 21 models from model year 2000 to 2009. Most of the vehicles were certified to the Tier-2 emissions standard, but several older Tier-1 and national low emissions vehicle program (NLEV) vehicles were also included in the study. Exhaust speciation shows that ethanol, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde dominate the oxygenated species emissions when ethanol is blended into the test fuel. A set of correlations were developed that are derived from the measured non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions and the ethanol blend level in the fuel. These correlations were applied to the measured NMHC emissions from the mid-level ethanol blends testing program and the results compared against the measured NMOG emissions. The results show that the composite FTP NMOG emissions estimate has an error of 0.0015 Â±0.0074 g/mile for 95% of the test results. Estimates for the individual phases of the FTP are also presented with similar error levels. A limited number of tests conducted using the LA92, US06, and highway fuel economy test cycles show that the FTP correlation also holds reasonably well for these cycles, though the error level relative to the measured NMOG value increases for NMOG emissions less than 0.010 g/mile.

AB  - In the present paper, crude biodiesel prepared with sorbifolia oil as raw material by transesterification was purified by column chromatography, then the composition of biodiesel was analyzed by gas chromatography, FTIR, GC-MS and 1H NMR. Column chromatography can separate the crude biodiesel into two fractions: petroleum ether eluted fraction (A1) and methanol eluted fraction (A2). Petroleum ether eluted fraction was mainly biodiesel fraction, which was produced from sorbifolia oil by transesterification, including methyl linoleate, methyl cis-9-octadecenoate and so on; methanol eluted fraction was mainly glycerol fraction, which came from the side reaction of transesterification. The results show that the purity of refined biodiesel increased from 77.51% to 93.87%, and the product recovery rate reached up to 91.04% after the purification by column chromatography. The results obtained by FTIR and 1H NMR further showed that the column chromatography can effectively improve the purity of biodiesel. This paper provides a basis for industrialization of purification of biodiesel.

AB  - Biofuels, which are produced from renewable vegetable sources are considered as a good solution to reduce the European dependence on fossil fuel sources, from a geostrategic and environmental point of view. Because of the high proportion of diesel vehicles in Europe, biodiesel still remains by far the most produced biofuel, far ahead of ethanol. Biodiesel is obtained by transesterification of vegetable oils with an alcohol, usually methanol to produce methyl esters. This paper aims to present the contribution of the French institute IFP Energies nouvelles to this issue, through the development of two processes for biodiesel production by means of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. More recent developments have focused on hydrotreating vegetable oils and are also detailed in this paper. Fuels from this latest technology are drop-in fuels allowing higher incorporation rates and offering excellent qualities for diesel engines and potentially for incorporation in Jet fuel.

AB  - Zeolites can adsorb small organic molecules such as alcohols from a fermentation broth. Also in the zeolite-catalyzed conversion of alcohols to biofuels, biochemicals, or gasoline, adsorption is the first step. Several studies have investigated the adsorption of alcohols in different zeolites experimentally, but computational investigations in this field have mostly been restricted to zeolite MFI. In this study, the adsorption of C1-C4 alcohols in BEA and MOR was investigated using density functional theory (DFT). Calculated adsorption geometries and the corresponding energies of the designed cluster models were comparable to periodic calculations, and the adsorption energies were in the same range as the corresponding computational and experimental values reported in the literature for zeolite MFI. Thus, BEA and MOR may be good adsorption materials for alcohols in the field of downstream processing and catalysis. Aside from the DFT calculations, adsorption isotherms were determined experimentally in this study from aqueous solutions. For BEA, the adsorption of significant amounts of alcohol from aqueous solution was observed experimentally. In contrast, MOR was loaded with only a very small amount of alcohol. Although differences were found between the affinities obtained from gas-phase DFT calculations and those observed experimentally in aqueous solution, the computational data presented here represent molecular level information on the geometries and energies of C1-C4 alcohols adsorbed in zeolites BEA and MOR. This knowledge should prove very useful in the design of zeolite materials intended for use in adsorption and catalytic processes, as it allows adsorption behavior to be predicted via judiciously designed computational models. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper presents the experimental results of cogasification of coal and biomass in an intermittent fluidized bed reactor, aiming to investigate the influences of operation parameters such as gasification temperature (T), steam to biomass mass ratio (SBMR), and biomass to coal mass ratio (BCMR) on hydrogen-rich (Hrich) gas production. The results show that Hrich gas free of Ndilution is produced and the Hyield is in the range of 18.2568.13 g/kg. The increases of T, SBMR, and BCMR are all favorable for promoting the Hproduction. Higher temperature contributes to higher CO and Hcontents, as well as Hyield. The BCMR has a weak influence on gas composition, but the yield and content of Hincrease with BCMR, reaching a peak at the BCMR of 4. The Hcontent and yield in the product gas increase with SBMR, whilst the content of CO increases first and then decreases correspondingly. At a typical case, the relative linear sensitivity coefficients of Hproduction efficiency to T, SBMR, and BCMR were calculated. The results reveal that the order of the influence of the operation parameters on Hproduction efficiency is T > SBMR > BCMR. © 2013 Li-Qun Wang and Zhao-Sheng Chen.

AB  - Liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising process to produce liquid biofuels and valuable chemicals. The main purpose of this work is to efficiently liquefy biomass into energy-dense bio-oils through direct liquefaction. Pinewood sawdust was liquefied in supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) at various temperatures (225-375°C) and residence time (0-4 hours) with alkaline catalyst (K2CO3). The results showed that the yield of bio-oils varied from 12 wt% to 29 wt% under various conditions. The optimal parameters for SCCO2 liquefaction were 300°C and 2 hours in this study, which generated the maximum bio-oil yield 29 wt%. The effects of temperature and residence time on SCCO2 liquefaction process were discussed. Multiple analytical methods such as GC-MS, FT-IR and elemental analyzer were applied to study the compositions and properties of liquid bio-oils. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - We describe how bi-metal PtCu connected wires, immersed in a solution of benzene sulfonic acid (BSA)-phenol (P) or 2,2′-azino-bis(3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS)-phenol (P), then subjected to simultaneous alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electric fields generate power. We discovered that PtCu substrate covered by the deposit containing (BSA-PP-Pt-Cu), abbreviated as PtCu(BSA-PP-Pt-Cu) electrode, plays the role of a substantial anode and cathode. The latter was related to the formation of micro-batteries in the deposited film (BSA-PP-Pt-Cu) that are able to take or deliver electrons from the deposited Pt and Cu, respectively. PP-BSA plays probably the role of bridge for proton conduction in the formed micro-batteries. The power density of the fuel cell (FC)-based PtCu(BSA-PP-Pt-Cu) anode and PtCu(BSA-PP-Pt-Cu) cathode in phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 at room temperature reaches ∼10.8 μW mm-2. Addition of enzymes, glucose oxidase at the anode and laccase at the cathode and, replacement of BSA by ABTS at the cathode in the deposited films increases the power density to 13.3 μW mm-2. This new procedure might be of great relevance for construction of a new generation of FCs operating at mild conditions or boost the power outputs of BFCs and make them suitable for diverse applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traditional oil purification process has some drawbacks, such as high energy cost, high chemicals demand and the loss of neutral oil. In this study, for the first time, an alternative process was introduced, which combines microfiltration (MF) pretreatment for oil dewaxing and ultrafiltration (UF) purification process for phospholipid removal. More energy and chemicals can be saved by these processes without the loss of neutral oil. It was found that crude Jatropha oil after MF pretreatment shows a higher permeate flux than the degummed Jatropha oil does. After combining two-step membrane filtration process, the physical properties of crude Jatropha oil were greatly improved. The kinematic viscosity was decreased from 28 mm2/s to 25 mm 2/s, while carbon residue was also reduced from 5.5 wt% to 2.9 wt%. The newly developed two-step membrane filtration process in this study can be effectively applied for the purification of crude Jatropha oil used for biofuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass fast pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) is considered a promising renewable liquid energy. A feasible upgrading method is co-processing HHDO-oil, which is the heavy fraction of hydrodeoxygenated pyrolysis oil (HDO-oil), with paraffin oil. In this article, kinetic modeling for catalyst deactivation by coke was researched. The results show that the coke is lower by co-processing of HHDO with paraffin oil than other upgrading. Catalyst deactivation is a cascade reaction, the effect of HHDO concentration from 3.18 to 5.08 mol/m3 and the effect of temperature from 753 to 793 K were studied. The kinetic model equation of catalyst deactivation is -da/dt = 1.188 × 10 -5e18914.85/RT · c0.88 · a. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

A banana tissue rich with polyphenol oxidase (PPO), an enzyme able to reduce oxygen to water, was mixed with a carbon paste (banana/CP). The resulting tissue electrode was employed as the biocathode of a glucose biofuel cell based on a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) bioanode. On the bioanode, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are used as supports for the glucose-dehydrogenase (GDH) biocatalyst and the Meldola's blue (MDB) mediator, while the phenolic constituents of the banana serve as mediator for PPO. The maximum power output and open circuit voltage (OCV) of the banana-based tissue biofuel cell were 57μW/cm2 and 0.46V, respectively. Control experiments using the corresponding pure enzyme tyrosinase (Tyr) for the biocathode resulted in a substantially lower power output. Cost analysis of this tissue biofuel cell system indicates dramatic improvements in terms of the power-output/dollar compared to the common use of isolated enzymes (166502μW/$ vs. 17.8μW/$, i.e., 9354 times improvement). The banana-based biofuel cell displayed an extended lifetime of over 2 weeks with proper storage between experiments. We also demonstrate a fuel-free full plant-tissue based BFC concept, combining the banana biocathode with a bioanode based on germinated tomato-seeds that contain alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), NAD+ and ethanol. Our findings indicate the potential of using plant tissues for the successful operation of efficient and cost-effective BFC. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Supercritical water gasification has recently received much attention as a potential alternative to energy conversion methods applied to aqueous/non-aqueous biomass sources, industrial wastes or fossil fuels such as coal because of the unique physical properties of water above its critical conditions (i.e. 374.8 °C and 22.1 MPa). This paper presents the results obtained for the hydrothermal gasification of textile wastewater at supercritical conditions. The experiments were carried out at five reaction temperatures (between 450 and 650 °C) and five reaction times (between 30 and 150 s), under a constant pressure of 25 MPa. It was found that the gaseous products contained considerable amounts of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and C1-C4 hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, propane and propylene. The maximum amount of the obtained gaseous product was 1.23 mL per mL textile wastewater, at a reaction temperature of 600 °C, with a reaction time of 150 s. At this state, the product comprised 13.02% hydrogen, 38.93% methane, 4.33% ethane, 0.10% propane, 0.01% propylene, 7.97% carbon monoxide, 27.22% carbon dioxide and 8.00% nitrogen. In addition, a 62.88% decrease in the total organic carbon (TOC) content was observed and the color of the wastewater was removed. Moreover, for the hydrothermal decomposition of the textile wastewater, a first-order reaction rate was designated with an activation energy of 50.42 (±2.33) kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 13.29 (±0.41) s-1.

AB  - In this study, thorny bamboo (Bambusa stenostachya) and long-branch (B. dolichoclada) bamboo were integrated as feedstock to produce pyrolysis liquid (biooil) using fast pyrolysis technology, and the basic properties of the bio-oils were analyzed. Results showed that the higher heating value (HHV) of both bio-oils were 13.92 MJ/kg for thorny bamboo and 14.87 MJ/kg for long-branch bamboo, and both HHVs were relatively low for use as bioenergy. The bio-oils need to be reprocessed using upgrading technologies to promote the efficiency of energy utilization. However, both bio-oils were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and were shown to contain more than 80 different organic compounds with multifunctional groups. The major compounds in the bio-oil of long-branch bamboo were phenols with the largest proportion of >50%, and those of thorny bamboo included good distributions of phenols, carboxylic acids, and ketones. Both bio-oils are great potential resources beyond just a fossil fuel to provide various chemical compounds.

AB  - To study the influence of the Soret and Dufour effects on the reactive characteristics of a porous packed bed with endothermic reactions and forced convection, a two-dimensional mathematical model considering the cross-diffusion effects was developed in accordance with the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and the local thermal non-equilibrium model. The simulation results were validated by comparing with experimental data. The influence of the Soret and Dufour effects on the heat transfer, mass transfer and endothermic chemical reaction in the non-thermal equilibrium packed bed is discussed. It was found that when the Peclet number reaches 1865, the maximum relative error of the concentration of gas product induced by the Soret effect is 34.7% and that of the solid fractional conversion caused by the Dufour effect is 10.8% at reaction time 160 s and initial temperature 1473 K. The differences induced by the Soret and Dufour effects are demonstrated numerically to increase gradually with the initial temperature of feeding gas and the Peclet number.

AB  - In spite of the benefits associated with the production and consumption of biofuels, there are some crucial debatable issues like high cost, food insecurity, etc., that put them to the negative side. However, biofuels still hold impressive market potentials in the world today though most of their production technologies are sophisticated and costly. Liquid biofuels like bioethanol and biodiesel are commonly produced from feedstocks like corn, rapeseed, soybean, etc., but there are other potential feedstocks, which are more sustainable like palm oil. This chapter discusses the major sources of biofuel feedstocks, types of biofuels, their production technologies, and global market potentials. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - Crude glycerol is a primary by-product in the biodiesel industry. Microbial fermentation on crude glycerol for producing value-added products provides opportunities to utilize a large quantity of this by-product. This study investigates the potential of using the crude glycerol to produce vancomycin (glycopeptide antibiotics) through fermentation of Amycolatopsis orientalis XMU-VS01. The results show that crude glycerol was the most effective carbon source for mycelium growth and vancomycin production, with 40-60 g/L glycerol concentration as optimal range. Among other culture medium components, potato protein (nitrogen source) and the phosphate concentration had significant effects (p<0.05) for vancomycin production. A Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology were employed to formulate the optimal medium. Their optimal values were determined as 52.73 g/L of glycerol, 17.36 g/L of potato protein, and 0.1 g/L of dipotassium phosphate. A highest vancomycin yield of 7.61 g/L with biomass concentration of 15.8 g/L was obtained after 120 h flask fermentation. The yield of vancomycin was 3.5 times higher than with basic medium. The results suggest that biodiesel-derived crude glycerol is a promising feedstock for production of vancomycin from A. orientalis culture. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Almost every existing device includes either a control or a self-regulation system. This is also the case of a new alternative energy source, the biofuel cells. Fuel cells take advantage of natural existing compounds in biofluids and transform them into energy available in situ. Although being a promising approach to solve energy supply, particularly in small implantable devices, these systems does not produce enough energy to support a conventional computing system together with their natural functionality. Enzyme biocomputing is an unconventional computing approach that assembles enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions into Boolean logic operations, therefore can enhance the applications of biofuel cells. Enzyme logic gates can control a switch responsible of the biofuel cell power output in such a way that each specific combination of input signals-related to physiological conditions- determine whether the biofuel cell must provide energy or not and provoke an in situ real time response, i.e. drug release. Herein I review the most significant advances from the most basic enzyme logic gates to a final prototype of implantable biofuel cell controlling an acetaminophen dispenser depending on biologic marker inputs. © 2013 Old City Publishing, Inc.

AB  - A synthetic, highly active cellulase enzyme suitable for in planta production may be a valuable tool for biotechnological approaches to develop transgenic biofuel crops with improved digestibility. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of a plant derived carbohydrate binding module (CBM) to a synthetic glycosyl hydrolase improved the activity of the hydrolase in releasing sugar from plant biomass. A CEL-HYB1-CBM enzyme was generated by fusing a hybrid microbial cellulase, CEL-HYB1, with the CBM of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SlCel9C1 cellulase. CEL-HYB1 and CEL-HYB1-CBM enzymes were produced in vitro using Pichia pastoris and the activity of these enzymes was tested using carboxymethylcellulose, MUC, and native crystalline cellulose assays. The presence of the CBM substantially improved the endoglucanase activity of CEL-HYB1, especially against the native crystalline cellulose encountered in Sorghum bicolor plant cell walls. These results indicate that addition of an endogenous plant derived CBM to cellulase enzymes may enhance hydrolytic activity. © 2012 Byrt, Cahyanegara and Grof.

AB  - The castor bean cake is a residue from the biodiesel production, which has a great potential as organic fertilizer, but it also presents sodium contents in its constitution, as a result of the use of NaOH, as a catalyst for the transesterification reaction, to produce biodiesel. This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of castor bean cake resulting from biodiesel produced directly from seeds as an organic fertilizer in the cultivation of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.). The cake was washed with water, in the 1:4 (m/v) ratio, in order to reduce sodium contents. Plant height, fresh and dry shoot weight, and total shoot and root nutrients contents were evaluated, in addition to residual elements after cultivation. The study was carried out in the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, in Seropédica, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The Al Guarani cultivar, grown in a greenhouse, for 70 days, in an Inseptisol substrate from Chapada do Apodi, Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil, was evaluated in a randomized blocks design, in a 6x2 factorial scheme (six cake doses: 0 Mg ha -1, 5 Mg ha -1, 10 Mg ha -1, 20 Mg ha -1, 40 Mg ha -1, and 80 Mg ha -1; and two cake states: in natura and treated), with three replications. The sodium contents present in the cake are not harmful to castor bean plants at short term. In general, the highest dose of in natura or treated castor bean cake, equivalent to 80 Mg ha -1, promoted the highest nutrients release into the soil.

AB  - Bamboo charcoal obtained from pyrolysis was introduced as adsorbent to adsorb model compounds of bio-oil in solution. Single-, double-and four-component of bio-oil was investigated to evaluate the adsorption behavior. The results showed that the adsorption characteristics of each component were different. For single-component adsorption in 24 h, the adsorption capacity of each component by bamboo charcoal in declining order was furfural, acetic acid, phenol and glucose. When adsorption equilibrium achieved, the adsorption capacity of phenol would exceed that of acetic acid. In double-component of furfural and glucose system, furfural was showed strongly selective adsorption characteristics by bamboo charcoal. In four-component system, the adsorption capacity of each component was declined especially for acetic acid. Further more, concentration mutation was presented among acetic acid and some component which suggested that the well adsorbed furfural displaced some of the weak adsorbate. The adsorption capacity of glucose was little under all the experimental operating conditions.

AB  - Fatty-acid residue as plant oil asphalt (FA-POA) is a neglected biomass. The main objectives of this study were to identify the composition of FA-POA and to investigate the vacuum pyrolysis of FA-POA to synthesize liquid biofuel. Proximate and ultimate analysis of FA-POA was performed. The physical properties were also examined according to ASTM standards. The composition of FA-POA was inferred from FTIR spectra and thermal gravimetric analysis. GC–MS was conducted to determine the composition in the pyrolytic oil and biogas. Results showed that FA-POA is a polymerization product of fatty acids. It is formed by the combination of CC addition or association and carboxyl dehydration. In vacuum pyrolysis, a pyrolytic-oil yield of 71 wt % was achieved on a FA-POA basis. The pyroltyic oil mainly consists of fatty acids, paraffins, cycloparaffins, olefins, and aromatics. It was upgraded to pyrolytic biodiesel, which is characterized as having a high calorific value and moderate oxygen content. A pyrolysis reaction scheme of FA-POA was proposed from the experimental results. It is concluded that FA-POA is an attractive biomass source for liquid biofuels, chemicals, and biochar.

AB  - Ni-B amorphous catalysts were prepared by chemical reduction of nickel chloride with potassium borohydride aqueous solution and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Tetter (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques. The catalytic performances of model compounds and bio-oil to produce saturated alcohols were evaluated in a semi-batch reactor. The results showed that the conversion of model compounds (acetone, furfural and phenol) and the selectivity of saturated alcohols reached 99.99% and 90.00% at 110°C, 4.0 MPa (initial pressure). Under the conditions of 150°C and 4.0 MPa, the yield of saturated alcohols reached 47.54%. High temperature of above 150°C resulted in the transformation of amorphous phase to form crystal, which was attributed to the low catalytic activity. This work provides a new alternative for the production of saturated alcohols from bio-oil.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fast emerging alternate fuel but with its own disadvantage of having limited oxidative stability. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) obtained from high acid value (46.41 mgKOHg-1) rubber seed oil (RSO) was characterized by GC-MS and 1H-NMR. Fuel properties analysed were found to fit the required ASTM D6751 standard. Moreover, the possibility of monitoring the conversion efficiency of RSO to its corresponding methyl esters using FT-IR and NIR techniques was also analysed. As an important specification of bio-fuel quality, the fuel must have a minimum of three hours of oxidative stability (110oC) as per ASTM D6751 standard. Influence of metal contaminants, air, moisture and light on oxidative stability was studied on biodiesel having high iodine value. Acid value, peroxide value and induction period were recorded for samples under six different environments such as open (light exposed), closed (light exposed), open (dark), closed (dark), open (metal contaminated) and closed with metal contamination. Significant impact was observed only when metals are present as contaminants. Extent of degradation (oxidation) is higher when the samples are contaminated by metals, limiting the storage stability to thirty days. Higher oxidative stability was achieved under dark in the closed environment but in the absence of any metal contaminant.

AB  - An integrated process for obtaining liquid biofuels is reported. The process is based on the separation of a lignocellulosic feedstock into cellulose and low-molecular-weight lignin (LMWL) followed by their conversion into two types of liquid biofuels, namely, hydrocarbon mixtures and bioalcohols. Different methods of wood fractionation into cellulose and LMWL - mechanical, steam explosion, and selective oxidation methods and their combinations - are compared. The amount of cellulose derived from wood and the amount of hydrolysate obtained from this cellulose for ethanol biosynthesis are determined by the efficiency of the method used for the fractionation of the lignocellulosic material. The best results are achieved by combining mechanical activation and subsequent catalytic oxidation of wood. Use of the resulting high-quality glucose solution, which are free of pentoses - sugars inhibiting ethanol biosynthesis - allows the alcohol yield to be increased by 30-35%. Liquid hydrocarbon mixtures enriched with phenols and products of their alkylation with ethanol have been obtained by thermal processing of LMWL in ethanol at an elevated pressure. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The rapid expansion of human society implies greater energy demand and environmental issues. In face of depletion energy resources, research is being carried out widely in order to convert the plant oil into biofuel. In this research, the production of liquid biofuels via catalytic cracking of used palm oil in the presence of composite zeolite was studied. The performance of composite zeolite of different properties in the reaction has been evaluated. The catalytic cracking reactions were carried out in a batch reactor at reaction temperature of 350oC for an hour. In the present study, adjusting the ratio of mesoporous coating to microporous zeolite and magnesium loading on composite zeolite catalyst were found to be able to increase the gasoline fraction and overall conversion of the reaction.

AB  - The increasing consumption of energy with the depletion of crude oil reserves urges the usage of alternative fuel. Since there is an existing demand for edible vegetable oils, waste vegetable oils and non-edible crude vegetable oils are preferred as potential low priced biodiesel sources. In this study, utilization of Cotton Seed Oil (CSO) was tested for its potential use as biodiesel. The density, viscosity, acid value, saponification number, iodine value, cetane number wereanalyzed and all are found to be within the range specified by the ASTM standards. The Ultrasonic studies gave an idea on the ignition standard, compressibility, relaxation time of the CSO for its use as a biofuel source. The physico- chemical and ultrasonic properties of the blends B10, B20 and 100% CSO B100 were also found to be within the ASTM standards and the blend B20 of the CSO can serve as the potential source for biodiesel.

AB  - Enormous use of petroleum fuels is now widely recognized as unsustainable because of depleting supplies and these fuels contributes to the accumulation of CO2 in environment. Renewable, carbon neutral, transport fuels are necessary for environmental and economical consideration. Biodiesel is monoalkyl ester of long chain fatty acids produced from the trans-esterification reaction of vegetable oil with alcohol in the presence of catalyst &amp; can be used as fuel. Biodiesel is derived from oil crops, waste cooking oil and animal fat or micro algae. Micro algae have emerged as one of the most promising sources for biodiesel production. It can be inferred that micro algae grown in CO2-enriched air can be converted to oily substance. Such an approach can contribute to solve major problems of air pollution resulting from CO2 evolution and future crisis due to a shortage of energy sources. Oil productivity of many micro algae greatly exceeds the oil productivity of the best producing oil crops. Approaches are taken for making microbio-diesel economically competitive with petrodiesel. The production of biodiesel from microalgae oil by transesterification chemically and enzymatically. In the present work Aspergillus niger lipase were screened for a transesterification reaction of algal oil using different acyl acceptor (methanol, ethanol, propanol-2 and n-butanol) in reaction mixture to produce biodiesel; only methanol was found to give appreciable yield. The application of crude lipase was determined to catalyze the transesterification process, and a conversion of 44% was achieved under selected conditions (reaction temperature 40 °C, algal oil/methanol molar ratio 1:4, 5 ml of lipase based on the oil weight, and reaction time of 24h). It was seen that algal oil and optimization of transesterification conditions resulted in adequate yield of biodiesel in the case of the enzyme-based process.

AB  - The transesterification of cottonseed oil and used frying oil to methyl esters (biodiesel) was studied using Sr(NO3)2 loaded onto calcium oxide as heterogeneous catalyst. Reaction parameters such as catalyst concentration, methanol/oil ratio, and reaction time on the conversion of cottonseed oil and used frying oil were investigated. The 35 % m/m Sr(NO3)2 catalyst loaded onto CaO, after being calcined at 750 °C for 6 h, was found to be the optimum catalyst. The quality of the methyl esters was tested according to the European standard ELOT EN 14214. The two types of biodiesel produced seemed to meet all the parameters of the European standard, except oxidation stability. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Membrane Fractionation of Biomass Fast Pyrolysis Oil and Impact of its Presence on a Petroleum Gas Oil Hydrotreatment—In order to limit the greenhouse effect causing climate change and reduce the needs of the transport sector for petroleum oils, transformation of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising alternative route to produce automotive fuels, chemical intermediates and energy. Gasification and liquefaction of biomass resources are the two main routes that are under investigation to convert biomass into biofuels. In the case of the liquefaction, due to the unstability of the liquefied products, one solution can be to perform a specific hydrotreatment of fast pyrolysis bio-oils with petroleum cuts in existing petroleum refinery system. With this objective, previous studies [Pinheiro et al. (2009) Energy Fuels 23, 1007-1014; Pinheiro et al. (2011) Energy Fuels 25, 804-812] have been carried out to investigate the impact of oxygenated model compounds on a Straight Run Gas Oil (SRGO) hydrotreatment using a CoMo catalyst. The authors have demonstrated that the main inhibiting effects are induced from CO and CO2 produced during hydrodeoxygenation of esters and carboxylic acids. To go further, cotreatment of a fast pyrolysis oil with the same SRGO as used in the previous studies was investigated in this present work. Firstly the bio-oil was separated into four fractions by membrane fractionation using 400 and 220 Da molecular weight cut-off membranes. The bio-oil and its fractions were analyzed by spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. Then, one fraction (i.e. fraction enriched in compounds with molecular weight from 220 to 400 Da) was mixed with the SRGO and co-treated. Despite some experimental difficulties mainly due to the emulsion instability, the hydrotreatment was successful. An inhibition has been observed on the hydrotreating reactions of the SRGO in presence of the bio-oil fraction. The measurement of the CO/CO2/CH4 molar flowrate at the reactor outlet showed that the inhibition was due to the presence of CO and CO2 coming from HDO rather than to the oxygen compounds themselves. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Biorefineries are small integrated plants aiming at the recovery of specific biomass wastes via their conversion to high-value biofuels and chemicals. Pyrolysis is among the promising technologies to achieve this goal. Three major factors influence the development of a pyrolysis process: the type of biomass, process operating conditions and choice of reactor technology. In this chapter, pyrolysis as a solution to sustain biorefineries is reviewed. The chapter first discusses the various biomass feedstocks and their important characteristics. Secondly, the pyrolysis concepts and kinetics are reviewed in light of their importance in process design and modelling. The chapter also discusses the influence of several process conditions and reactor technologies on pyrolysis reaction and pyrolysis products behaviour. Finally, strategies for product optimization and avoiding purity issues are analyzed. The emphasis of this chapter is put on technologies that have been developed at commercial scale. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - The effect of alkali pretreatment on the characteristics of cypress and the liquefaction of cypress in ethanol has been investigated. The untreated and pretreated cypress samples were analyzed by XRD, SEM, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, and N2 adsorption to characterize the changes to the chemical and physical characteristics. The results showed that mild alkali pretreatment increased the surface area and pore volume of cypress. Furthermore, mild alkali pretreatment enhanced the bio-oil yield and decreased the optimum reaction temperature compared to the untreated and strongly alkali pretreated cypress samples in which the bio-oil yield increased from 15.5 to 23.5 % and the optimum reaction temperature decreased from 300 to 240 °C. GC–MS analysis demonstrated that the pretreatment affected the yields and types of compounds in the bio-oil. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In this study the effects of particle size and water content on the yields and physical/chemical properties of pyrolytic products were investigated through fast-pyrolysis of yellow poplar. Water content was critical parameters influencing the properties of bio-oil. The yields of bio-oil were increased with decreasing water content. However, the yield of pyrolytic product was not clearly influenced by feedstock's particle size. The water content, pH and HHV (Higher Heating Value) of bio-oil were measured to 20~30%, 2.2~2.4 and 16.6~18.5 MJ/kg, respectively. The water content of feedstock was clearly influenced to water content of bio-oil. In terms of bio-char, HHV of them were measured to 26.2~30.1 MJ/kg with high content of carbon over 80%.

AB  - This study presents power generation optimization in a dual chambered aerated membrane microbial fuel cell (MFC) with E. coli as biocatalyst at different culture densities (0.5 &amp; 1.0 OD) using sodium acetate as substrate. Optimum parameters were found as follows: voltage, 783 mV; power density, 222.84 mW/cm 2; and coulombic efficiency (CE), 86.56%. CE with sodium acetate as substrate was higher than with fermentable substrate. High CE indicates improved design of dual chambered mediator less aerated membrane MFC for electrical conductance with an application in water remediation.

AB  - In this paper, pyrolysis and hydroliquefaction processes were successively used to convert CCB-treated wood into bio-oil with respect to environment. Pyrolysis temperature has been optimized to produce maximum yield of charcoal with a high metal content (Cu, Cr, and B). The results obtained indicate that the pyrolysis at 300. °C and 30. min are the optimal conditions giving high yield of charcoal about 45% which contains up to 94% of Cu, 100% of Cr and 88% of B. After pyrolysis process, the charcoal has been converted into bio-oil using hydroliquefaction process. The optimization approach for the yield of bio-oil using a complete factorial design with three parameters: charcoal/solvent, temperature and hydrogen pressure was discussed. It is observed that the temperature is the most significant parameter and the optimum yield of bio-oil is around 82%. The metal analysis shows that the metals present in the bio-oil is very negligible. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol conversion from rice straw using butanone and acetaldehyde dilute solution explosions was evaluated based on the optimization of pure water explosion. To decrease residual inhibitor content, the exploded slurry was dried and investigated at different temperature. Using a 0.9-mol/L butanone solution explosion, with the explosion pressure set at 3.1 MPa, the residence time at 7 min, the dried rice straw-to-water ratio at 1:3 (w/w), and the exploded slurry drying temperuture at 90 °C for 8 h, the yields of total sugar, glucose, and xylose were 85%, 88%, 82% (w/w), respectively, and the ethanol productivity was 26.0 g/100 g rice straw dry matter. Moreover, 0.5-mol/L acetaldehyde dilute solution explosion improved the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF), and the residual inhibitors had negligible effects on EH and SSCF after detoxification by drying. The results suggested that compared with pure water explosions, the use of butanone and of acetaldehyde dilute solution explosions lowered the explosive temperature and improved the sugar yield, although relative crystallinity of the rice straw dry matter was increased after the explosion. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Some microalgae are particularly attractive as a renewable feedstock for biodiesel production due to their rapid growth, high content of triacylglycerols, and ability to be grown on non-arable land. Unfortunately, obtaining oil from algae is currently cost prohibitive in part due to the need to pump and process large volumes of dilute algal suspensions. In an effort to circumvent this problem, we have explored the use of anion exchange resins for simplifying the processing of algae to biofuel. Anion exchange resins can bind and accumulate the algal cells out of suspension to form a dewatered concentrate. Treatment of the resin-bound algae with sulfuric acid/methanol elutes the algae and regenerates the resin while converting algal lipids to biodiesel. Hydrophobic polymers can remove biodiesel from the sulfuric acid/methanol, allowing the transesterification reagent to be reused. We show that in situ transesterification of algal lipids can efficiently convert algal lipids to fatty acid methyl esters while allowing the resin and transesterification reagent to be recycled numerous times without loss of effectiveness. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - Oil palm is widely grown in Malaysia. There has been interest in the utilization of oil palm biomass for production of environmental friendly biofuels. The gasification of empty fruit bunches (EFB), a waste of the palm oil industry, was investigated in this study to effectively and economically convert low value and highly distribution solid biomass to a uniform gaseous mixture mainly hydrogen (H 2). The effects of temperature, equivalence ratio (ER) and catalyst adding on the yields and distribution of hydrogen rich gas products were also investigated. The main gas species generated, as identified by GC, were H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4 and trace amounts of C 2H 4 and C 2H 6. With temperature increasing from 700 to 1000 °C, the total gas yield was enhanced greatly and reached the maximum value (~ 90 wt. %) at 1000°C with a big portion of H 2 (38.02 vol. %) and CO (36.36 vol. %). Equivalence ratio (ER) showed a significant influence on the upgrading of hydrogen production and product distribution. The optimum ER (0.25) was found to attain a higher H 2 yield (27.42 vol. %) at 850°C. The effect of adding catalysts (Malaysian dolomite1, P1), Malaysian dolomite2 (GML), NaOH, NaCl, CaO, ZnO, NiO) as a primary catalyst on gas product yield was investigated, and it was found that adding dolomite showed the greatest effect with the maximum H 2 yield achieved (28.18 vol.%) at 850°C. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - The kinetic of the transesterification reaction over the C s X H 3 -X PW12O40/Fe-SiO2 catalyst prepared using sol-gel and impregnation procedures was investigated in different operational conditions. Experimental conditions were varied as follows: reaction temperature 323-333 K, methanol/oil molar ratio = 12/1, and the reaction time 0-240 min. The H3PW12O40 heteropolyacid has recently attracted significant attention due to its potential for application in the production of biodiesel, in either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalytic conditions. Although fatty acids esterification reaction has been known for some time, data is still scarce regarding kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially when catalyzed by nonconventional compounds such as H 3PW12O40. Herein, a kinetic study utilizing Gc-Mas in situ allows for evaluating the effects of operation conditions on reaction rate and determining the activation energy along with thermodynamic constants including Δ G, Δ S, and Δ H. It indicated that the C s X H 3 -X PW12O40/Fe-SiO2 magnetic nanocatalyst can be easily recycled with a little loss by magnetic field and can maintain higher catalytic activity and higher recovery even after being used 5 times. Characterization of catalyst was carried out by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), N2 adsorption-desorption measurements methods, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). © 2013 Mostafa Feyzi et al.

AB  - As a novel alternative fuel for diesel oil, bio-oil was upgraded by emulsification technology and the tribological performances of bio-oil and upgrade ones were tested on a cylinder liner-piston ring tribometer. The surface profilometer, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to analyze the micro-morphology and the valence states of elements on the rubbing surface and the tribological mechanisms were also discussed. The results show that the bio-oil from Chlorella had better friction-reducing and anti-wear properties than those of bio-oil from rice husk. The performances of the bio-oil can be improved significantly by the emulsification method. The lubrication mechanism was ascribed to the formation of lubricative films from adsorption, extrusion, and frictional deposition of the bio-oil organics on the cylinder surface, the rolling of micro-balls caused by local frictional melting and protective oxidation film of Fe2O3 and FeOOH on the friction surface during the friction process. Moreover, the bio-oil from Chlorella formed a nitrogen-contained organic film on the frictional surface, which was also an important reason for the better tribological performances.

AB  - The liquefaction of rice hull (a typical agricultural waste) has been conducted with n-butanol solvent at various reaction temperatures ranging from 260 to 320 C. As a result, it was found that biomass conversion rates were increased with increasing temperature up to 320dgC. However, it was observed that its rate of conversion to liquid was about 83% at 320 C for 30 min. The crude oil yield with rice hull increased up to 1,273 mg/g/L at 300 C, but the yield of Fraction 1 at 280 C was raised suddenly, and peaked at 2 times that of the initial input amount of feedstock. Furthermore, the calorific values of crude oil and Fraction 1 from rice hull were about 5,843 and 8,061 kcal/kg and were enhanced 163 and 225%, respectively, relative to its feedstock as rice hull, respectively. Fraction 1 may be suitable as an alternative liquid fuel of gasoline, based on an engine performance test. Sixty species of organic compounds in crude oil were categorized into 8 classes of compounds, including acids, alcohols, aliphatic hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, ketones, phenol, and aromatics, and others. In the crude oil from rice hull, the most common chemical types were esters and ethers accounting for 32.0 and 19.2% of the total extract, respectively. Analysis of Fraction 1 revealed that the main chemical components were C5H12O, C7H14O 2, C8H16O2, and C12H 26O2. Therefore, for producing clean and green fuel energy with plant biomass liquefaction it is necessary to further investigate crude oil and to further refine Fraction 1 through catalytic cracking or hydro-de-oxygenation (HDO). © 2013 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The use of microwaves for heating is well established in society, and is being used in domestic and some industrial processes. However, it has the potential to be introduced and applied to many other industrial heating processes, which offers unique advantages not attained from conventional heating. In this sense, microwave technology was being explored as one method to assist in pyrolysis process of cotton stalk. A study was carried out on the effect of microwave on the liquid and solid products, then the physicochemical properties of pyrolysis products were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS), isothermal adsorption analyzer (BET) and fourier transform infrared analyzer (FT-IR). The results showed that with the rising of the pyrolysis temperature, the yields of gas and liquid products had shown opposite trend, and the highest yield of bio-oil was around 500°C (about 40%), however, the yield of char gradually decreased. Furthermore, within 550-650°C the changing rate became weaker. The bio-oil had a complex composition, and major compounds in the liquid product were acetic acid, levoglucosan and phenolic substances. Besides the content of decreased acetic acid and levoglucosan with the increasing temperature, while acetic acid obtained by microwave heating was significantly lower comparing with conventional electric heating, which made the acidity of liquid products decrease, the high content of levoglucosan in the cotton stalk oil was discovered under microwave heating, which could go up to 19.86%. In addition, phenolic substances went up with the increasing temperature when below 450°C then multi-substituted phenolic substances had been declined but the content of phenol and hydroquinone increased when above 450°C, so it changed little in total phenolics. Conventionally pyrolysed char could not be used for further application since there persisted large and deep cracks due to the overheating of surfaces, which made them fragile and lost porous nature. Analysis of the product showed the adsorption loop type was L3.Moreover, microwave heating technique was conducive to the formation of the developed pore structure and the specific surface area and micro-pore surface area were first increased and then decreased as the temperature rose, the maximum of SBET and Smic reached 400.29 m2/g and 276.93 m2/g at 550°C, which was known as microwave heating and was highly effective in pyrolysing biomass, specifically the large size which otherwise if not possible but would had been difficult. The surface functional groups of char at 350°C mainly included O-H (3500-3000 cm-1), C-Hn(2970-2860 cm-1), C=O(1730-1700 cm-1), C=C(1632cm-1), C-O-C(1260 cm-1) and C-H(900-700 cm-1), then gradually decreased as temperature increased. Only small amount of aromatic structure peak (around 1450-1600 cm-1) could be detected at 650°C, which indicated the char had been close to completely pyrolysis. The comparative results showed that microwave pyrolysis had a very good prospect on the optimization of bio-oil, getting high value-added products such as levoglucosan, and also the preparation of activated char with high specific surface area.

AB  - Carboxydotrophs are known for their ability to convert carbon monoxide (CO) to butanol through fermentation. Such a platform offers a promising alternative approach to biofuel production from synthesis gas feedstocks. In this study, carboxydotrophs were isolated from various manure compost. Out of 500 isolates, only 11 carboxydotrophs (7 mesophiles and 4 thermophiles) were found to utilize CO as the sole source of carbon and energy. To assess the biochemical basis for their ability to produce biofuel (butanol), the level of activities of CO dehydrogenase (CODH), hydrogenase and butanol dehydrogenase (BDH) enzymes for these isolates against the known carboxydotroph, Butyribacterium methylotrophicum was assessed. All isolates showed evidence of enzyme activities (0.16-2.20 μmol min-1), with the majority exhibiting higher activities compared with the known carboxydotroph, B. methylotrophicum (0.33-0.71 μmol min-1). The level of activities for CODH and BDH ranged from 0.163-3.59 μmol min-1 and 0.19-2.2 μmol min -1, respectively. Three isolates (M7-1, T2-22, and T3-14) demonstrated enzymatic activity three to seven times higher than B. methylotrophicum. Of these, T2-22 exhibited the highest BDH activity and shows great promise in the conversion of toxic CO into butanol more so than other carboxytotrophs known thus far. This study revealed some biochemical basis for butanol production from CO by carboxydotrophs. However, more research is needed to discover a direct biological route for butanol production from CO to strengthen their potential for synthesis gas bioprocessing. Follow-up work will focus on whole-genome sequencing of the promising isolate T2-22 to provide system-level insights into how carboxydotrophs utilize and regulate their molecular machineries for butanol production. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - This study aimed at converting low lipid content microalgae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) to biofuels via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). In this article, ethanol was introduced as a solvent for the HTL process. The products of the HTL process were separated into gas, residue, bio-crude, and volatile components. The effects of using ethanol as the solvent are discussed in detail and compared with the traditional HTL process. Preliminary results showed that HTL with ethanol, compared with using water as the solvent, resulted in higher bio-crude yield (51.1%) with better thermal stability (95% acetone soluble after drying at 105°C), along with lower gas and residue yields (1.4% and 14.2%, respectively). The effects of operating parameters, including feedstock load ratio, solid load ratio, and initial pressure, on processing pressures and product yields were investigated. Experimental results indicated that HTL with a high feedstock load ratio increased the residue yield. Compared with water, ethanol was more suitable for HTL under high solid load ratio conditions. HTL of Chlorella pyrenoidosa with water as the solvent was fairly insensitive to the investigated processing parameters within the measuring ranges. Yields of bio-crude, gas, and residue had average values of 40.5% ±1.7%, 6.3% ±0.7%, and 20.8% ±2.9%, respectively. © 2013 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers ISSN 2151-0032.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biofuel obtained from vegetable oils. The oils used as raw materials are usually refined edible vegetable oils. Nonedible acidic oils are unsuitable for biodiesel production unless reduction of the high content in free fatty acids (FFA) of these materials had been achieved. Obtaining a good raw material from unprofitable oils becomes an important research field. Additionally clays have a long history in industrial sorption and catalysis, some being commercially available and with properties that can be modified. In this work we present the results of the use of the montmorillonite clay K10 and two acid modified clays K10(I) and K10(II), in the esterification of stearic acid with methanol and 95 % of methyl stearate was obtained with K10(II). These clays were then used for the first time to reduce the acidity of enhanced FFA sunflower oil and they show to be very effective. Reduction of FFA from 11 to 4 % was obtained with K10(II) mainly due to 94 % conversion of FFA into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). These clays were also tested with two waste oils, one from domestic use and the other gathered from different restaurants, and showed their ability to lower the acidity of these oils. Reactions were followed by 1H NMR as well as quantitative determination of FFA and FAME. Clays were characterized by FTIR and XRD. © 2012 AOCS.

AB  - The proposed analytical method allows for simultaneous determination by GC using a programed temperature vaporization injector and a flame ionization detector of the main reaction components (i.e. glycerol, methyl esters, mono-, di-, and triacylglycerols) in the reaction mixture during biodiesel production. The suggested method is convenient for the rapid and simple evaluation of the kinetic data gained during the transesterification reaction and, also partially serves as an indicator of the quality of biodiesel and mainly, as the indicator of the efficiency of the whole production process (i.e. the conversion of triacylglycerols to biodiesel and its time progress). The optimization of chromatographic conditions (e.g. the oven temperature program, injector setting, amount of derivatization reagent, and the derivatization reaction time) was performed. The method has been validated with crude samples of biodiesel made from waste-cooking oils in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and limits of detection and quantification. The results confirmed a satisfactory degree of accuracy and repeatability (the mean RSDs were usually below 2%) necessary for the reliable quantitative determination of all components in the considerable concentration range (e.g. 10-1100 μg/mL in case of methyl esters). Compound recoveries ranging from 96 to 104% were obtained. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Eugenol, vanillic aldehyde and levoglucosan were selected as the model compounds of bio-oil heavy fractions for phenols, aldehydes and saccharides, respectively; their thermal degradation behaviors and pyrolysis kinetics were investigated by thermogravimetric and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer analyses (TG-FT-IR) under non-isothermal conditions. The results indicated that the hydroxylbenzenes exhibits the greatest tendency to decompose, followed by the aldehydes and carbohydrate. One stage thermal degradation is identified for eugenol and vanillic aldehyde, with the formation of water, CO2, CO, alkanes, alkenes, as well as small molecules of phenols and aromatic aldehydes. Levoglucosan pyrolysis proceeds slowly in two stages at medium-high temperature (180~370 °C); the products are mainly composed of CO2, aldehydes, ketones, cyclic ethers, and a small amount of water and CO. As for the mixture of the model compounds, there are three stages in the pyrolysis process; the pyrolysis products evolved share the same compositions of three model samples besides the formation of some low molecular acetal polymers. Compared with the single model compounds, the interaction between the carbonyl groups and hydroxyl groups in the mixture of model compounds may produce polycondensates at high temperature (≥ 300 °C), which makes a complete pyrolysis of the mixture more difficult. The saccharide should be the key substance that dominates the pyrolysis rate of heavy fractions. By fitting the dynamic profiles of each stage, kinetic parameters of thermal degradation were determined. For the pyrolysis of levoglucosan, the apparent activation energy and reaction order are 115.80 kJ/mol and 0.5 (first stage) and 141.19 kJ/mol 2/3 (second stage), respectively; for eugenol, the apparent activation energy is 42.29 kJ/mol, with the reaction order of 0.7; for vanillic aldehyde, the apparent activation energy is 36.53 kJ/mol, with the reaction order of 0.95; for the mixture of model compounds, the apparent activation energy and reaction order are 54.46 kJ/mol and 1 (first stage) and 50.67 kJ/mol 2/5 (second stage), respectively.

AB  - The water-tolerant and microwave absorbing solid acid catalyst - heteropolyacids supported on activated carbon (H3PW 12O40•xH2O /C) - was developed and used in the synthesis of biodiesel with low-quality tung oil that contained water (0.1-1.5 wt.%) or free fatty acid (FFA; 2.6-30.0 wt.%). Microwave radiation was adopted to enhance the transesterification. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to design the synthesis experiments and optimize the operation conditions. Research results showed that the solid acid catalyst H 3PW12O40•xH2O /C (HPW/C) exhibited a better water-tolerance performance and catalytic activity than other catalysts such as HPW and HPW/γ-Al2O3, and a higher yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) could be obtained under microwave radiation than the conventional heating. The FAME yield of 67.2% could be obtained under the optimal conditions of temperature of 343 K, the methanol to oil molar ratio of 36, and catalyst to oil mass ratio of 11.5 wt.% when the tung oil contained 0.7 wt.% water and 2.6 wt.% FFA. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Degradation of cellulose represents a key step for efficient generation of biofuels such as ethanol or butanol from non-food crops. Several strategies aim to improve the performance of cellulases in order to make the overall process more cost-efficient. In one strategy, novel arrangements of cellulases are developed. The resulting so-called designer cellulosomes might allow equipping fermenting hosts with sufficient cellulase activity to grow on cellulose as sole carbon source and, thus, enable consolidated bioprocessing. Other strategies aim to engineer cellulases with higher thermostability and activity to make cellulose hydrolysis more efficient. Current developments in the field of cellulose engineering are summarized and achievements as well as limitations are highlighted. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Values of thermal expansion coefficients (b) were experimentally determined for three samples: a mineral diesel and two biodiesels constituted by either fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) or fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), from transesterification reactions using raw corn oil and ethyl or methyl alcohol. Values of b were found to be 8.36 (±0.06) 10 4 × °C 1, 8.43 (±0.09) × 10 4 °C 1 and 8.39 (±0.03) × 10 4 °C 1, respectively, within 95% of statistical confidence. The thermal expansion coefficients for biodiesels from corn are higher than that for the mineral diesel. The expansion coefficient is also a key parameter in modeling fuel injection system of internal combustion engines. Comparing the two sets of data, for fossil diesel and biodiesel provides essential information to support the design and optimization of more efficient engines. A higher value for the cubic expansion coefficient implies that less specific mass of fuel is injected at higher temperatures, which can cause a loss in engine power. This is a fundamental parameter, reinforcing further the interest to establish an algebraic model to estimate the specific mass for a biofuel as a function of temperature, which is thought to be significantly different from that more commonly used for the fossil diesel. Polynomial models for such a correction were determined in this work; resulting rates for diesel and for corn oil biodiesels, based on either fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), were respectively -0.7089 kg m 3 T 1, -0.7323 kg m 3 T 1 and -0.7313 kg m 3 T 1. From the linear correlation between these data and those from standard EN 14214, values for the sensitivity (slope term) are seemingly small, or roughly 0.723, but are high enough to cause relatively large impacts, in financial terms, for cases involving considerably big volumes of biodiesel, in commercial transactions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The introduction of sodium and potassium methoxides in processes leading to biodiesel production has triggered several questions about their stability under actual biofuel manufacturing conditions. In most biodiesel production facilities, basic homogenous catalysis is obtained through the introduction of caustic potash (KOH) or caustic soda (NaOH) in the reactor. In this process, the hydroxides are converted into their corresponding methoxide forms (CH 3OK/Na), which then become the actual catalysts in the reactor. Supplying the actual catalyst directly, instead of the low cost hydroxides, may offer several advantages, but may also introduce new hazards that deserve further characterisation work. From a review of the available literature, it was found that very little was known about the thermal decomposition properties of these methoxides. Therefore, as a starting point, l'Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques (France) and the Canadian Explosives Research Laboratory (Canada) have recently undertaken a joint effort to better characterise their thermal behaviour. This was achieved by means of a variety of calorimetric techniques including differential scanning calorimetry, accelerating rate calorimetry and 'large scale' thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis. It was found that these chemicals can become self-reactive close to room temperature under specific physical conditions. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Flax shive is a by-product of decortication of flax straw for fibre recovery, and consists of ligno-cellulosic xylem tissue. It is available in large quantities at low cost, and shows promise as a biorefining feedstock for recovery of multiple products. The objectives of this work were to investigate hemicellulose polysaccharide extractions from flax shive using alkaline reagents at mild conditions, and to determine impacts of pretreatment using sodium ethoxide in anhydrous ethanol. Sodium ethoxide is similar to the catalyst for industrial biodiesel, and had been shown previously to recover phenolic constituents from flax shive. In this work, carbohydrates extracted from flax shive were evaluated quantitatively, in terms of recovered precipitate mass, and qualitatively, in terms of backbone monomer composition. Extracts obtained using 1.0. M sodium hydroxide, alone or following pretreatment, showed no difference in mass yield, with mean recovery of 99.4 ± 5.1. mg/g on a dry basis. In terms of composition, extracts obtained using 1.0. M sodium hydroxide, alone or following pretreatment, showed no detectable mannose and no difference in molar concentration ratio of xylose-to-glucose, with mean ratio of 25.5 ± 3.4. Results inferred that no glucomannan polymer was extracted, and that glucuronoxylan polymer was present at high concentration, greater than 90% of the product stream. Tests using saturated barium hydroxide showed poor mass yield, with possible inhibitory effects in mixed solutions. The use of saturated barium hydroxide or elevated sodium hydroxide resulted in lower glucuronoxylan concentration. Flax shive showed good potential for carbohydrate extraction, and the technical feasibility of recovering multiple products was demonstrated. © 2012.

AB  - The catalytic pyrolysis of the oily seeds of Styrax officinalis L., which was carried out using two catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor. As a catalyst, expanded perlite was firstly used according to the best current knowledge. Pyrolysis experiments were performed under at 450°C temperature and 25°C/min heating rate. The results showed that both catalyst materials had approximately the same effect on the bio-oil yields. By using the natural zeolite and expanded perlite at a ratio of 30 wt %, the maximum bio-oil yields were achieved as 38.07 wt % and 37.49 wt %, respectively. The oxygen content is important to bio-oil and upgrading oil. High oxygen content causes poor heating value and instability. The use of a catalyst greatly reduced the oxygen content of the bio-oil, such that the 30 wt % of oxygen content for noncatalytic oil decreased to 16.34 wt % and 18.35 wt % with use of natural zeolite and expanded perlite, respectively. Higher heating values (34.84 and 33.48 MJ/kg) and H/C atomic ratios (1.47 and 1.51) for the catalyzed bio-oils were very close to those of petroleum, which are 40 MJ/kg and 1.5:1.9, respectively. In addition, the oxygenated species decreased and also the quantities of alkyl and alkenyl substituted aromatic compounds and paraffinic alkanes in the catalyzed bio-oils were notably higher than those of noncatalyzed bio-oils when using a catalyst. The use of catalysts in the pyrolysis not only increased the yield of bio-oil, but also produced higher quality oil with higher calorific value, lower oxygen content, higher carbon, and hydrogen contents etc. Copyright © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether palm oil monoester (EGMEPM) was synthesized through transesterification with palm oil and Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGME). Through L 9(3 4) orthogonal experiments, optimum transesterification conditions were gained as: n(EGME):n(palm oil) = 10:1, w(metal sodium) = 1.2% total amount of alcohol at 70°C for 120 min. EGMEPM yielded 85.7%. The new biofuel had a high cetane number (77), good solubility, and a large flash point. Engine combustion experiment testified that burning the novel bioenergy has little influence on engine operation. Compared with 0# diesel fuel, the pressure lifting ratio reduced 2.9%-23.9% for B25 blends and 12.8%-38.9% for the novel bioenergy (B100), and the maximal instantaneous heat release rate lowered by 11.6%-33.3% for B25 and by 26.8%-42.7% for B100, respectively. When the diesel engine burnt B100 under partial loads at 1400 rpm, smoke, CO, HC, and NO X emissions were reduced.Copyright © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A low cost method to convert triglycerides to biodiesel by transesterification reaction has been investigated. The new approach is based on controlled feeding of oil into a pool of alcohol allowing easy dispersion of oil creating large interfacial area for mass transfer. It also enabled equilibrium constants to shift in the forward direction due to excess of alcohol in the dispersion. As a result product yield higher than 95% could be achieved at lower energy input compared to conventional method. Comparisons made with conventional batch and co-solvent enabled method show differences and highlight improvements. Reactions were conducted in one liter reactor at various residence time, temperature and molar ratio of canola oil with methanol in presence of potassium hydroxide as the catalyst. Samples were collected at regular intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) to determine the reaction progress. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to produce petroleum alternatives from biomass, a significant amount of research has been focused on oils from microalgae due to their origin, which would not affect food availability. Nanoporous hybrid catalysts composed of ns Al2O3 and zeolites have been proven to be very useful compared to traditional catalysts in hydrotreating (HT), hydrocracking (HC), and catalytic cracking (CC) of large molecules. To evaluate the reaction scheme and products from model isoprenoid compounds of microalgae oil, nanoporous hybrid catalyst technologies (CC: ns Al2O3/H-USY and ns Al2O3/H-GaAlMFI; HC: [Ni-Mo/-Al2O3]/ns Al2O3/H-beta) were studied. The major product from CC on ns Al2O3/H-USY was highly aromatic gasoline, while the product from HC was half-isoparaffinic/ olefinic kerosene. Although more than 50wt of the products from HT/CC on the USY catalyst was liquefied petroleum gas due to overcracking, the product from HT/CC on the MFI catalyst was high-octane-number gasoline. Delightfully, the product from HT/HC was kerosene and its average number was 11, with more than 80wt being isoparaffinic. As a result, it was demonstrated that hydrotreating may convert isoprenoid oil from microalgae over nanoporous hybrid catalysts into a variety of products. © Copyright 2012 Toshiyuki Kimura et al.

AB  - This study analyzes the potential environmental impacts and socioeconomic benefits of installing a pilot plant for biodiesel production from used cooking oil (UCO) collected from hotels, restaurants, and bars in the Copacabana district of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Currently much of this oil is used to produce soaps or simply disposed of directly into the sewage system, contributing to the eutrophication of bodies of water. An analysis is made of the production of biodiesel by the alkaline transesterification of UCO with ethanol using a sodium hydroxide catalyst. In order to analyze the environmental impacts, the ten stages of the life cycle of biodiesel made from UCO are assessed. The environmental impact of producing 1 metric ton of biodiesel is evaluated on the basis of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. In order to assess the economic feasibility of the pilot plant, a cash flow deterministic method was employed to evaluate the investment required. The social performance of the project was assessed using Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators. The environmental analysis showed that ethanol production and fuel combustion are the stages that had the highest environmental impact. The findings of the economic analysis showed that it would be feasible for the Rio de Janeiro city council to implement a pilot plant in the Copacabana district of the city. The results of the social performance analysis indicated that the project would have a positive impact on local job and income generation. © 2012 by Yale University.

AB  - Biodiesel, chemically consists of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) produced by methanolysis of natural triglycerides, such as animal fats and vegetable oils, is a kind of biomass energy, which is renewable and ecofriendly. In this article, KF/CaO was used as solid base catalyst for transesterification of soya bean oil and methanol, while ultrasound as supplementary means. Compared to mechanical stirring, ultrasound treatment is an effective method to increase the yield of FAME and shorten reaction time. By single-factor method, the optimisation of reaction conditions has been studied. The research showed that the optimum reaction conditions were: w(catalyst)/w(oil): 3%, reaction temperature: 65°C, n(methanol)/n(oil): 12, reaction time: 1h, sound intensity: 1.01Wcm-2, frequency: 20kHz, the yield of FAME could be 97%. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The acid-catalyzed conversion of lignocellulosic biomass (AC3B) process has been developed for the direct liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass. In the original version, the main products, ethyl esters, are produced in acidic medium containing ethanol, using a one-pot conversion system. Our research strategy for obtaining a high overall performance is based on two general concepts: (a) coupling of catalytic/chemical reactions that lead to desired products and (b) decoupling of reactions that produce unwanted products, by decreasing the effectiveness of these reactions. Concept (a) is realized by using oxidizers (hydrogen peroxide and Fenton's reagent) that promote a higher production of carboxylic acids as main intermediates, while concept (b) contributes to a significant decrease of undesired formation of polymeric products. As result of these reaction coupling and decoupling, the overall yield of liquid products has been multiplied by a factor of 2.5 (from 27 to over 70 wt%). Not only the yields of products from cellulose and hemicellulose components experience considerable increases, but also the lignin component starts undergoing a noticeable conversion. Essentially, the AC3B process, in the most recent version, consumes ethanol that is partly used to produce liquid fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. The other amount of feed ethanol is converted-via diethyl ether and over ZSM-5-based catalysts-into aromatics-rich gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas-grade hydrocarbons. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The use of oxygenated bio-fuels like bio diesel and ethanol in combination with diesel is an effective measure to substitute renewable fuels and reduce particulate matter (PM) from in-use diesel vehicles. To study the fuel performance, three oxygenated blend fuel designs containing volumes of 15% ethanol with cetane improver additive, 10% ethanol with 10% bio diesel and 15% ethanol with 20% bio diesel were formed. The physical stability of ethanol diesel blend is studied and phase separation is prevented by adding co solvents like Tetrahydrafuran and bio diesel. To meet stricter emission norms, now diesel engines are fitted with after treatment devices. This paper describes the engine and emission characteristics of the above blend fuels on a 4 cylinder, naturally aspirated light duty diesel engine fitted with diesel oxidation catalyst. The engine test results show that it is feasible to use these blends in diesel engines: the thermal efficiencies of the engine fueled by the blends are comparable with that fueled by diesel, with small increase in fuel consumption, due to the lower heating value of ethanol and bio diesel. The smoke emissions from the engine fueled by the blends are lower than that fueled by diesel owing to the increased oxygen content. The reduction is more at higher loads. The HC and CO emissions are found to be higher at lower loads due to the lower cetane number of ethanol. However, NO emissions depend on load conditions and blend contents. © 2006-2012 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - In the paper, the patterns of NOx formation from fuel bound nitrogen have beeen analyzed when burning various types of biofuel containing nitrogen, and also chip-ped waste of furniture production. It has been established that fuel bound nitrogen conversion to NOx slightly de-pends on type of fuel and on whether the nitrogen contai-ned in the fuel is naturally bound or is an artificial additive. It has been concluded that when heating the fuel up to 500°C, up to 30% of substances containing nitrogen relea-ses from the fuel together with volatile substances. It has been shown that, when applying thermal processing of fuel, a part of nitrogen may be removed from the fuel. NOx formation can be reduced by rinsing the wood panels with water. 20% coke additives to fuel containing nitrogen allows reducing NOx concentration by up to 44%. Burning of high nitrogen content fuel together with low nitrogen content fuel provides ambiguous effect on NOx formation-it depends upon properties of this fuel as well.

AB  - Supported calcium oxide solid-base catalyst was prepared by the conventional incipient-wetness impregnation of aqueous solutions of the corresponding Ca(NO3)2.4H2O precursors on a palm shell activated carbon support. This catalyst was employed to catalyze transesterification to synthesis biodiesel when palm stearin was used as feedstock. Continuous transesterification of palm stearin with methanol was carried out with activated carbon supported metal oxide solid-base catalyst in a packed column reactor with an external diameter of 60 mm and a height of 345 mm to produce biodiesel. The physical and chemical properties of the produced biodiesel were determined and compared with the standard specifications. The maximum conversion of triglyceride reached 96% after 6 h at 60 °C, when using a 25:1 ratio of methanol to oil and 295 mm packed bed height of catalyst. The results showed that palm shell activated carbon supported calcium oxide solid-base catalyst presented more efficiently catalytic activity in a packed column reactor. Activated carbon is a promising solid catalyst for the production of biodiesel fuels from palm stearin because of its high performance in the conversions over 90% for the transesterifications. © 2013 American Scientific Publishers.

AB  - Highly efficient single crystalline ruthenium-vanadium mixed metal oxide (Ru1-xVxO2, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanowires were prepared on a SiO2 substrate and a commercial Au microelectrode for the first time through a vapor-phase transport process by adjusting the mixing ratios of RuO2 and VO2 precursors. Single crystalline Ru1-xVxO2 nanowires show homogeneous solid-solution characteristics as well as the distinct feature of having remarkably narrow dimensional distributions. The electrochemical observations of a Ru1-xVxO2 (x = 0.28 and 0.66)-decorated Au microelectrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrate favorable charge-transfer kinetics of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- and Ru(NH3)6 3+/2+ couples compared to that of a bare Au microelectrode. The catalytic activity of Ru1-xVxO2 for oxygen and H2O2 reduction at neutral pH increases as the fraction of vanadium increases within our experimental conditions, which might be useful in the area of biofuel cells and biosensors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels have attracted significant research attention in recent years due to various energy shortages. However, the presence of phospholipid impurities in biofuels prevents their use in diesel engines. In our previous study we developed Lewis-acid ZrO2 materials for the adsorption of phospholipids in oil solutions. In this work, for the first time, we describe the development of strong Lewis-acid Y2O3 novel structures, such as Y2O3 cubes and Y2O 3 flowers for the phospholipid removal in soybean oil solution. This is the first report for the discussion of Y2O3 cubes and flowers. The relevant growth mechanism for the cubes and flowers was also discussed in this study. The as-prepared Y2O3 flowers exhibit better performance in phospholipid removal than Y2O 3 cubes due to the larger specific surface area of the Y 2O3 flowers. This work also provides a feasible method for using Y2O3 novel structures to remove phospholipids from plant oils that is suitable for biofuel applications. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Dwindling petroleum reserves and alarming level of air pollution has been an issue of great concern in recent times and researchers across the world are experimenting on variety of renewable fuels for meeting the future energy demands. Within the gamut of alternative fuels, biofuels are the most promising and have the potential to mitigate climate change and lease a new life to existing IC engines. The vegetable oils are having immense potential in this context and have been used either in neat or modified form by large number of researchers. Jatropha curcus is a perennial plant and bears non edible oil. The plant is drought tolerant and has been cultivated all over the arid and semi-arid areas for reforestation. In the present study, blends of jatropha oil and ethanol have been prepared in 5, 10, 15 and 20% (v/v) and evaluation of important properties of blends has been carried. The results show that properties are quite similar to diesel fuel. Performance and emission characteristics were evaluated for straight vegetable jatropha ethanol (SVJE) blends. Engine performance (brake specific energy consumption, brake thermal efficiency) and emissions (CO, HC, NOx, and smoke opacity) were measured to evaluate the behavior of the diesel engine running on SVJE blends. It has been found that at part load condition, the brake thermal efficiency and brake specific energy consumption of blends of SVJE were insignificant. HC, CO emissions and smoke opacity were reduced at part load condition. However, there was a decrease in NOx in case of SVJE diesel blends at full load condition. Copyright © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - Fatty acids (FAs) are essential components of cellular structure and energy-generating routes in living organisms. They exist in a variety of chemical configurations and functionalities and are catabolized by different oxidative routes, according to their structure. α- and ω-Oxidation are minor routes that occur only in eukaryotes, while β-oxidation is the major degradation route in eukaroytes and prokaryotes. These pathways have been characterized and engineered from different perspectives for industrial and biomedical applications. The severity of FA oxidation disorders in humans initially guided the study of FA metabolism at a molecular-level. On the other hand, recent advances in metabolic engineering and systems biology have powered the study of FA biosynthetic and catabolic routes in microorganisms at a systems-level. Several studies have proposed these pathways as platforms for the production of fuels and chemicals from biorenewable sources. The lower complexity of microbial systems has allowed a more comprehensive study of FA metabolism and has opened opportunities for a wider range of applications. Still, there is a need for techniques that facilitate the translation of high-throughput data from microorganisms to more complex eukaryotic systems in order to aid the development of diagnostic and treatment strategies for FA oxidation disorders. In addition, further systems biology analyses on human systems could also provide valuable insights on oxidation disorders. This article presents a comparison of the three main FA oxidative routes, systems biology analyses that have been used to study FA metabolism, and engineering efforts performed on microbial systems. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The reclamation of mining operation tailings water is of major concern to the oil sands industry. Naphthenic acids (NAs) are recognized as a major toxic component in tailings water. The acid-catalyzed esterification of commercially prepared NAs to biodiesel was performed as a test case for the utilization of these toxic compounds. In a series of batch acid-catalyzed esterification reactions, the influence of reaction temperature, catalyst type, catalyst concentration, and methanol to oil ratio on the esterification was investigated. The NA esterification reactions were found to be positively dependent on temperature and catalyst concentration while large methanol to oil ratios had a negative effect on the esterification. Finally, sulfuric acid was identified as a preferred catalyst for the esterification compared to p-toluene sulfonic acid. The esterification was completed successfully at the relatively mild conditions used in commercial biodiesel production. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Conversion methods for lignocellulosic materials are essential for the production of biofuels and bio-chemicals via sugar platform biorefineries. Sugars are commonly derived by a two-step process involving liquid acid pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Recent advances in biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis with solid acid catalysts have shown that catalytic method can be a promising replacement for liquid acid hydrolysis. This chapter covers works concerning the pretreatment and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials using solid- and nano-catalysts. First, biomass pretreatment is introduced briefly. The properties and synthesis of solid acid catalysts, such as acid site density, acid strength, structure of supports, acid site distribution, and tolerance to water are introduced in detail. Influences of reaction conditions on hydrolysis efficiency are also summarized. Moreover, the chapter discusses obstacles in the applications of solid acid catalysts for biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis. Suggestions are given for promoting catalytic efficiency, recycling, and regeneration of solid acid catalysts. Finally, nanosized solid catalysts are introduced and discussed that can promote biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - The noncatalytic transformation of the crude lipid of Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) into fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) via a thermo-chemical process was mainly investigated in this work. The crude lipid of C. vulgaris was recovered by means of solvent extraction from C. vulgaris cultivated in a raceway pond. The conventional catalyzed transesterification of crude lipid of C. vulgaris is notably inhibited by the impurities contained in the crude lipid of C. vulgaris. These impurities are inevitably derived from the solvent extraction process for C. vulgaris. However, this work presents the noncatalytic transesterification of microalgal lipid into FAME, which could be an alternative option. For example, the noncatalytic transformation of microalgal lipid into FAME provides evidence that the esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) and the transesterification of triglycerides can be combined into a single step less susceptible to the impurities and with a high conversion efficiency (~97%). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production from waste cooking oil (WCO) was investigated using a mixture lipases of Novozym 435 and lipozyme TLIM as biocatalysts in ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([Emim]TfO). 1H-NMR spectroscopy was conducted to quantify the biodiesel yield. The mixture lipases in [Emim]TfO were very efficient with the biodiesel yield of approximately 99%. Temporal dynamics studies indicated that the mixture lipases showed a positive synergistic effect and eliminated the rate-limiting step in biodiesel production. The mixture lipases showed the highest catalytic activity in [Emim]TfO in comparison with solvent-free, tert-butanol, and isooctane media. It was revealed that the mixture lipases in [Emim]TfO was an outstanding catalytic system for biodiesel production. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Reduction of dioxygen catalyzed by laccase was studied at poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDO) modified electrodes. PEDOT with laccase are directly fabricated on pt electrode by simple process. The cyclic voltammetry (CVs) has been used for the measurement of electroanalytical properties of analytes by means of modified electrodes. The GOx/MWCNTs modified electrode exhibited good catalytic activity towards glucose oxidation and the PEDOT-laccase/pt modified electrode exhibited good catalytic activity towards O2. The maximum power density was 102 μWcm-2. The stabilities of laccase, the reduction potentials and ratios of catalytic to background currents were compared. Efforts are underway to improve the interface transfer to achieve higher potential and current output. © 2012 by ESG.

AB  - New methods for fabrication of 3D macroporous carbon scaffolds and synthesis of mesopores on carbon surfaces are proposed. Ordered macroporous filamentary carbon structures were made by rapid prototyping using solvent-based extrusion freeforming which allows the scaffold to be designed on computer and downloaded directly to a building platform. The surface of extruded filaments was decorated with 20-25 nm open mesopores by coating with nano-silica as a hard template followed by pyrolysis and dissolution of the silica. This left an open mesoporous surface to serve as a host for catalysts or enzymes while retaining integrity in the core for electrical and mechanical performance. The combination of these two methods could be used to make different hierarchical, multi-functional carbon structures which could be applied in fuel cells as the catalyst carrier and biofuel cell electrode. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

AB  - The mediated electro-enzymatic electrolysis systems based on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reaction were examined on a micro-bulk electrolytic system. A series of the enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the TCA cycle was coupled with electrode reaction. Electrochemical oxidation of NADH was catalyzed by diaphorase with an aid of a redox mediator with a formal potential of -0.15V vs. Ag|AgCl. The mediator was also able to shuttle electrons between succinate dehydrogenase and electrode. The charge during the electrolysis increased on each addition of dehydrogenase reaction in a cascade of the TCA cycle. However, the electrolysis efficiencies were close to or less than 90% because of the product inhibition. Lactate oxidation to acetyl-CoA catalyzed by two NAD-dependent dehydrogenases was coupled with the bioelectrochemical TCA cycle reaction to achieve the 12-electron oxidation of lactate to CO 2. The charge passed in the bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of 5nmol of lactate was 4mC, which corresponds to 70% of the electrolysis efficiency. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Non-edible oils represent one of the most viable alternative feed stocks for the production of large volumes of biodiesel at cheaper cost in tropical countries. The objective of the present study is to investigate the ability of the immobilized whole cells of Rhizopus oryzae MTCC 262 to catalyze the biodiesel production from karanja oil in n-hexane system. Response surface methodology was employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters, such as molar ratio of oil to alcohol, reaction temperature and reaction time on percentage biodiesel (methyl esters) yield. Transesterification was performed in shake flasks containing immobilized cells in the reaction mixture with 10% oil weight of n-hexane. The quadratic effects of molar ratio of oil to alcohol and reaction time proved to be the significant at 1% and 5% levels, respectively. The optimum synthesis conditions were found to be: molar ratio of oil to alcohol 1:2. 73, reaction temperature 41. 39°C and reaction time 73. 97 h. Biodiesel yield (methyl ester) was 75. 98 (wt.%) under the optimal conditions and the subsequent verification experiments with biodiesel yield of 78. 0 (wt.%) confirmed the validity of the proposed model. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Microwave-assisted transesterification of vegetable oil is emerging as an alternative process for the production of biodiesel. Microwave energy offers a number of advantages over conventional heating methods, including faster reaction rates, reduced processing times, and reduced catalyst consumption. This article describes the result of a pilot-scale continuous microwave-assisted transesterification process in focusing cavities with an analysis of the effect of temperature and time on the transesterification reaction for soybean oil. Experiments were performed in a continuous pilotscale microwave reactor at temperatures of 60°C and 75°C and total processing times ranging from 1 to 16 min. Ethanol was used as a solvent with NaOH as a catalyst (<0.2% by weight of oil). The conversion obtained was >99% for all experimental conditions, compared to 84% in conventional methods, and the energy balance yielded a positive value for this process. The results of the scaled-up microwave heating process are encouraging for the development of an industrial-scale, continuous microwave system for production of biodiesel. © 2013 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Gasification is considered to be an effective process for energy conversion from various sources such as coal, biomass, and waste. Cleanup of the hot syngas produced by such a process may improve the thermal efficiency of the overall gasification system. Therefore, the cleanup of hot syngas from biomass gasification using molten carbonate is investigated in bench-scale tests. Molten carbonate acts as an absorbent during desulfurization and dechlorination and as a thermal catalyst for tar cracking. In this study, the performance of molten carbonate for removing H2S was evaluated. The temperature of the molten carbonate was set within the range from 800 to 1000°C. It is found that the removal of H2S is significantly affected by the concentration of CO2 in the syngas. When only a small percentage of CO2 is present, desulfurization using molten carbonate is inadequate. However, when carbon elements, such as char and tar, are continuously supplied, H2S removal can be maintained at a high level. To confirm the performance of the molten carbonate gas-cleaning system, purified biogas was used as a fuel in power generation tests with a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC). The fuel cell is a high-performance sensor for detecting gaseous impurities. When purified gas from a gas-cleaning reactor was continuously supplied to the fuel cell, the cell voltage remained stable. Thus, the molten carbonate gas-cleaning reactor was found to afford good gas-cleaning performance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Based on the known ability of perfluorodecalin/perfluorohydrocarbons to enhance oxygen solubility we modified oxygen sensitive biocathode by adding perfluorinated components to the catholite. This procedure improved the efficiency of the oxygen sensitive cathodes. Glassy carbon electrodes covered with single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with covalently bonded perfluoroaromatic groups were shown to be more sensitive to oxygen, and higher catalytic reduction currents were observed using laccase modified biocathodes allowing to improve the performance of bioelectrodes for fuel cells and oxygen monitoring devices. Maximum current and power density was found for the glucose/oxygen fuel cell composed of anode modified with side-aminoethylated SWCNTs conjugated with glucose dehydrogenase and cathode covered with side-perfluorophenylated SWCNTs and laccase. The open circuit potential of this cell is 0.57 ± 0.05 V and the maximum power density is 0.865 ± 0.090 mW/cm2. In case of applications of biofuel cells in the biological media, in order to avoid addition of NAD+ to the solution, we propose binding this cofactor to the aminoethylated SWCNTs. For applications of this biofuel cell in biological media, we propose binding NAD+ cofactor to the aminoethylated SWCNTs instead of its addition to the electrolyte. The power output 0.226 ± 0.031 mW/cm2 of such cell is somewhat smaller but still satisfactory, and the open circuit potential is 0.65 ± 0.08 V. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Metabolic engineering has been successful in generating highly efficient Escherichia coli catalysts for production of biofuels and other useful products. However, most of these engineered biocatalysts are only effective when glucose is used as the starting substrate. Strategies to overcome this limitation in the past almost exclusively relied on extracellular secretion or surface display of a β-glucosidase. We show here, for the first time, a periplasmic expression of a Sacchrophagus degradans cellodextrinase (Ced3A) as a successful strategy to enable E. coli to use cellodextrin. The engineered strain was able to grow with cellodextrin as sole carbon source. Additionally, we show that penetration of cellodextrin into periplasmic space was enhanced by using a mutant with leaky outer membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the catalyst can efficiently ferment cellodextrin to lactic acid with about 80 % yield. The ability of a biocatalyst to use cellodextrin should make it useful in consolidated bioprocessing of cellulose. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Plant cell-wall arabinoxylans have a complex structure that requires the action of a pool of debranching (arabinofuranosidases) and depolymerizing enzymes (endo-xylanase). Two Aspergillus nidulans strains over-secreting endo-xylanase and arabinofuranosidase were inoculated in defined 2% maltose-minimum medium resulting in the simultaneously production of these enzymes. To study the synergistic hydrolysis was used arabinoxylan with 41% of arabinose and 59% of xylose residues. Thus, it was adopted different approaches to arabinoxylan hydrolysis using immobilized arabinofuranosidase and endo-xylanase: (i) endo-xylanase immobilized on glyoxyl agarose; (ii) arabinofuranosidase immobilized on glyoxyl agarose; (T1) hydrolysis of arabinoxylan with arabinofuranosidase immobilized on glyoxyl agarose for debranching, followed by a second hydrolysis with endo-xylanase immobilized on glyoxyl agarose; (T2) hydrolysis using (i) and (ii) simultaneously; and (T3) hydrolysis of arabinoxylan with endo-xylanase and arabinofuranosidase co-immobilized on glyoxyl agarose. It was concluded that arabinoxylan hydrolysis using two derivatives simultaneously (T2) showed greater hydrolytic efficiency and consequently a higher products yield. However, the hydrolysis with multi-enzymatic derivative (T3) results in direct release of xylose and arabinose from a complex substrate as arabinoxylan, which is a great advantage as biotechnological application of this derivative, especially regarding the application of biofuels, since these monosaccharides are readily assimilable for fermentation and ethanol production. © The Authors 2013.

AB  - Hydrotreatment of glycerol (a byproduct of bio-diesel production) was conducted in the presence of a number of different supported metal catalysts at a temperature of 300 C under 5 MPa initial pressure of H2. The bio-oil products were comprehensively characterized to determine their physical/chemical properties. Experiments with supported catalyst metals revealed a positive correlation between support acidity and bio-oil yield. It was determined that MoCoP is the most effective combination of catalyst metals, and the bio-oil yield from hydro-treatment of glycerol with the MoCoP catalysts is strongly dependent on the support materials, following the trend of MgO &lt; AC &lt; Al2O3 &lt; zeolite. With the MoCoP/zeolite catalyst, a maximum yield of ∼40 wt.% bio-oil, and &gt;90% glycerol conversion was achieved for 60 min reaction. The volatile components of the bio-oil were found to consist mostly of substituted phenols and ketones in the C6-C9 range. The bio-oils obtained had a maximum HHV of 33 MJ/kg and the majority (∼95%) of the compounds present was found to have boiling points lower than 165 C, making these bio-oils potential oxygenated fuel additives. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME; Biodiesel) of four plant species of Brassicaceae family having more than 30% fixed oil in their seeds were examined. Base catalyzed transesterification using 1:6 molar ratio (oil:methanol) at 70°C was the optimal method to convert crude oil into FAMEs. FAME of oil of these four species, Brassica alba (white mustard), Brassica campestris (mustard), Brassica rapa (canola), and Eruca sativa (rocket seed oil), were found suitable for use as biodiesel and they meet the major specification of biodiesel standards of the United States. The selected plants have great potential for biodiesel use in ordinary diesel engine due to their engine efficiency, consumption, and performance, which is in accordance with mineral diesel. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper discusses the thermal conversion of non-homogeneous residual biomass from urban wastes as well as from forest and agricultural operations into an ultrapure syngas used for the thermo-catalytic synthesis of methanol. The latter is a commodity/building block for subsequent synthesis of fuels and chemicals. This paper focuses on the feedstock choices made by Enerkem and on its conversion technology which embraces staged gasification, syngas conditioning and conversion of syngas into methanol and of the latter into ethanol. The fundamental concepts that have led to the development of the technology are the result of a joint R&D experimental effort between the Université de Sherbrooke, Enerkem and the Edmonton Waste Management Center of Excellence. The technology has been scaled up, from 2009 to 2011, and production of biomethanol using 1. 5 tonnes/h of feed (dry basis) is ongoing at Enerkem's demonstration plant in Westbury (Québec) since June 2011. The conversion of the produced biomethanol into bioethanol has been proven at bench scale level, and we foresee the latter to be piloted in the first half of 2012. Based on the results of the demonstration, Enerkem is erecting a 100,000-tonne/year commercial plant in Edmonton. It will use secondary recovered fuel from the mechanical biological treatment process already implemented at the Edmonton Waste Management Center. Production of methanol is initially targeted for 2013. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We attempted to integrate lipase-catalyzed ethanolysis into fermentative bioethanol production. To produce bioethanol, ethanol fermentation from brown rice was conducted using a tetraploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing α-amylase and glucoamylase. The resultant ethanol was distilled and separated into three fractions with different concentrations of water and fusel alcohols. In ethanolysis using the first fraction with 89.3% ethanol, a recombinant Aspergillus oryzae whole-cell biocatalyst expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase (r-FHL) afforded the highest ethyl ester content of 94.0% after 96. h. Owing to a high concentration of water in the bioethanol solutions, r-FHL, which works best in the presence of water when processing ethanolysis, was found to be more suitable for the integrative process than a commercial immobilized Candida antarctica lipase. In addition, r-FHL was used for repeated-batch ethanolysis, resulting in an ethyl ester content of more than 80% even after the fifth batch. Fusel alcohols such as 1-butanol and isobutyl alcohol are thought to decrease the lipase activity of r-FHL. Using this process, a high ethyl ester content was obtained by simply mixing bioethanol, plant oil, and lipase with an appropriate adjustment of water concentration. The developed process model, therefore, would contribute to biodiesel production from only biomass-derived feedstocks. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lignocellulosic materials, such as wood, grass, and agricultural and forest residues, are potential resources for the production of bioethanol. The biochemical process of converting biomass to bioethanol typically consists of three main steps: pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. During the whole process, pretreatment is probably the most crucial step since it has a large impact on the efficiency of the overall bioconversion. The aim of pretreatment is to disrupt recalcitrant structures of cellulosic biomass to make cellulose more accessible to the enzymes that convert carbohydrate polymers into fermentable sugars. Physical, physical-chemical, chemical, and biological processes have been used for pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials. This chapter summarizes the leading technologies in chemical pretreatment on softwood, particularly pine species, which generally show relatively higher recalcitrance than hardwood, grass, and other lignocellulosic materials. Different chemical pretreatment techniques, including dilute acid pretreatment, alkaline hydrolysis, wet oxidation, sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocellulose (SPORL), organosolv, ionic liquids pretreatment, and ozonolysis process are intensively introduced and discussed. In this chapter, the key points are focused on the structural changes primarily in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin during the above leading pretreatment technologies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - Deoxy-liquefaction of cotton seed in husk was carried out to produce hydrocarbon oil at different temperatures (400-500°C). Results indicated that at 450°C, the obtained oil had a maximum alkanes value of 49.58% with a low oxygen content (1.4%) resulting in the increase of HHV (43.8MJkg-1), whereas the oil contained considerable nitrogenous compounds. In the presence of γ-Al2O3-CuO catalyst, at 450°C nitrogen content in the oil dropped 20%, exhibiting the activity of catalysis for denitrification, when the content of alkanes rose to 54.91%; by vacuum distillation, the oil was then separated into light/heavy fractions which showed that they both possessed rich carbon and hydrogen with low oxygen contents. The light fractions were much the same as that of gasoline, while the heavy fractions were close to diesel, which laid the foundation of further treatment and applications. © 2013 .

AB  - Oil dependency and global warming have stimulated R&D activities on the utilization of secondary biofuels. This article investigates the suitability of coconut shell-derived producer gas (a secondary gaseous biofuel) as a substitute for coal gas from an environmental perspective using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Thermochemical gasification in an air-fluidized bed with steam injection is the gaseous fuel production process. LCA is carried out with respect to Indian conditions based on primary and modified Ecoinvent 2.0 data using IMPACT 2002+ environmental impact assessment methodology. The study indicates that coconut shell-derived producer gas life cycle is capable of saving 18.3% of emissions causing global warming potential, 64.1% of emissions causing ozone depletion potential, and 71.5% of nonrenewable energy consumption. The analysis of energy and exergy consumptions of the two life cycles reveal that the renewable fraction in the total energy demand is 62.9% for producer gas life cycle, while it is only 2.8% for coal gas life cycle. Allocation of the by-product, coconut palm residues, is the major responsible factor for this reduction in environmental burden. Based on the existing fertilization practice and the utilization of electricity from the Indian electric grid, substantial green house gas (GHG) emission savings cannot be achieved for producer gas life cycle over coal gas life cycle. However, the green electricity-aided catalytic gasification of coconut shell produced by organic farming can result in 43.4% reduction in GHG emissions, meeting European Union renewable energy directive. © 2013 Sreejith et al.

AB  - This study was to investigate the composition and characteristics of long-straight chain alkane and fatty alcohols from the microalga Chlorella Sorokiniana 21, isolated from the coastal water of Pearl River Delta, China. Under the optimized aeration growth condition, this strain yielded up to 1.44gL-1 biomass and 24.90% extracts of dry weight. The major compounds of the extracts were identified to be alkanes (35.93%) and alcohols (53.73%). Of the extracts, long-straight chain alkanes accounted for 30.54% with heptadecane (21.13%) as a predominant component. Furthermore, a large amount of fatty alcohols (53.73%) were identified in the algal extracts with 29.09% of 3-(2-methoxyethyl)-1-nonanol. Thus, this algal species is a promising feedstock for the production of supplement for petrodiesel-like fuels and biochemicals used in the cosmetics and food industries. This study represents the first report of long-straight chain alkane and fatty alcohols from microalgae isolated from coastal water of the region. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aims: To reduce the cost of biodiesel, the utilization of rice straw hydrolysate and restaurant oil wastes as the substrates for biodiesel production in a recombinant strain by a one-step method was investigated. Methods and Results: A recombinant Escherichia coli pET28a (+)-PAW, which encodes enzymes for the ethanol pathway and acyltransferase, was constructed. Fermentation results in Luria-Bertani medium revealed that xylose was favourable for fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) production (2·79 g l-1) by E. coli pET28a (+)-PAW. When rice straw hydrolysate and restaurant oil wastes were utilized as the monosaccharide substituent and the fatty acids substituent, 0·27 g l-1 FAEEs and 0·249 g l-1 FAEEs were obtained, respectively. 1·27 g l-1 FAEEs was obtained in the restaurant oil wastes medium supplemented by 2% sodium oleate. Conclusions: The fermentation results indicated that the strain was effective in biodiesel production. The rice straw hydrolysate and restaurant oil wastes could be utilized by E. coli as the substrates for FAEE production. Significance and Impact of the Study: This novel exploration might pave the way for biodiesel production from waste materials by genetically engineered microorganism. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Petroleum-based insulating liquids are applied in several items of electrical power equipment, in which they serve as a dielectric as well as a coolant. However, these oils are environmentally toxic and inflammable, require costly fire protection schemes and deluge systems. To overcome this problem, seed-based vegetable oils have been investigated since these are biodegradable, non-toxic, and posses high fire point. In this experimental investigation, a local brand of seed-based corn oil is evaluated so as to be adopted as a viable dielectric fluid. It was characterized through a series of dielectric and physio-chemical properties and compared with mineral insulating oil. Results show that its 60 Hz breakdown strength is much higher than the mineral oil, while tan δ values satisfy IEC-60156 set criteria. Higher values of permittivity will enable favorable field distribution across oil-cellulose composite insulation. Under oxidation in presence of copper catalyst, it exhibits much less degradation than in mineral oil since its acidity is decreased. It therefore offers a more cost effective replacement solution, in particular for electrical applications in under developed and developing countries where the mineral-based oils are expensive due to a price hike in petroleum crudes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We report the preparation of two hydrocracking catalysts Pd/CoMoO4/silica and Pd/CNTs/CoMoO4/silica (CNTs, carbon nanotubes). The structure, morphologies, composition, and thermal stability of catalysts were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The catalyst activity was measured in a Parr reactor with camelina fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as the feed. The analysis shows that the palladium nanoparticles have been incorporated onto mesoporous silica in Pd/CoMoO4/silica or on the CNTs surface in Pd/CNTs/CoMoO4/silica catalysts. The different combinations of metals and supports have selective control cracking on heavy hydrocarbons. © 2012 Ling Fei et al.

AB  - Recycled fiber hydrolysis was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of reducing sugar accumulation for biofuel products during hydrolysis in subcritical water. The hydrolysis conversion of recycled fiber was reaching to approximate 90% within 3min at 280-320°C, while the glucose decomposed simultaneously within 0.5min. The FTIR wave variation and the crystalline index of hydrolysis residue indicated that the intermolecular, intramolecular hydrogen bond and the crystalline was a constraint for recycled fiber hydrolysis. The kinetics analysis demonstrated the cylindrical shape model is proper at low temperature for recycled fiber hydrolysis, while sphere shape model is suitable at high temperature. The apparent activation energies of recycled fiber on both kinetics models were 58.19kJmol -1 and 53.18kJmol -1, which were lower than that the glucose with 79.59kJmol -1. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that the high yield of glucose during recycled fiber hydrolysis is achievable by reducing the cellulose crystalline through proper indispensible pretreatments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel production generates significant amounts of low-value residues and wastes. This results in concern over the sustainability of the biofuel industry and its impact on the environment. Bioconversion offers opportunities for the economic utilization of biofuel residues and wastes with concomitant remediation of wastes. Due to their characteristics, these residues/wastes can serve as low-cost substrates for bioconversion to high-value products. Attempts have been made to produce several bio-based products, such as single-cell proteins, single-cell oil, enzymes, bioplastics, and organic acids. The authors review biofuel residues/wastes generation and their use in value-added processing. In addition, special attention is given to economic analyses of value-added processing of biofuel residues. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The production of synthetic fuels from alternative sources has increased in recent years as a cleaner, more sustainable source of transport fuel is now required. The European Commission has outlined renewable energy targets pertaining to transport fuel which must be met by 2020. In response to these targets Ireland has committed, through the Biofuels Obligation Scheme of 2008, to producing 3% of transport fuels from biofuels by 2010 and 10% by 2020. In order to be suitable for sale in Europe, diesel fuels and biodiesels must meet certain European fuel specifications outlined in the EN 590:2009 standard. The aim of this paper was to prepare blends of varying proportions of synthetic diesel (Cyn-diesel) fuel, produced from the pyrolysis of plastic, vs regular fossil diesel. The flash point (°C) and cold filter plugging point (°C) of these blends as well as of the conventional petroleum diesel fuel were analysed in relation to compliance with the European fuel standard EN 590. The results confirmed that blending of Cyn-diesel with conventional petroleum diesel has a highly significant effect on the properties of the resulting fuel blend. The results show that by increasing the Cyn-diesel content of the blend, the flash point of the blend decreases and the cold filter plugging point increases. Furthermore, comparing the fuel blends to EN 590 specifications has highlighted significant trends. The cold filter plugging points of all of the fuel blends are in compliance with EN 590 specifications. However, only blends of up to, and including, 40% Cyn-diesel are in compliance with EN 590 specifications for flash point. This analysis shows that a blend of 40% Cyn-diesel is in compliance with all of the EN 590 specifications examined, and as such could be placed on the European fuel market (provided that the blend meets the requirements for the other properties in the EN 590 specification). This finding highlights the potential for Cyn-diesel blends to be incorporated into the European and national renewable energy targets. © Murphy et al.

AB  - The chelated-iron process is among the most promising techniques for the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal due to its double advantage of waste minimization and resource recovery. However, this technology has encountered the problem of chelate degradation which made it difficult to ensure reliable and economical operation. This work aims to develop a novel fuel-cell-assisted chelated-iron process which employs an air-cathode fuel cell for the catalyst regeneration. By using such a process, sulfur and electricity were effectively recovered from H2S and the problem of chelate degradation was well controlled. Experiment on a synthetic sulfide solution showed the fuel-cell-assisted chelated-iron process could maintain high sulfur recovery efficiencies generally above 90.0%. The EDTA was preferable to NTA as the chelating agent for electricity generation, given the Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) of 17.8±0.5% to 75.1±0.5% for the EDTA-chelated process versus 9.6±0.8% to 51.1±2.7% for the NTA-chelated process in the pH range of 4.0-10.0. The Fe (III)/S2- ratio exhibited notable influence on the electricity generation, with the CEs improved by more than 25% as the Fe (III)/S2- molar ratio increased from 2.5:1 to 3.5:1. Application of this novel process in treating a H2S-containing biogas stream achieved 99% of H2S removal efficiency, 78% of sulfur recovery efficiency, and 78.6% of energy recovery efficiency, suggesting the fuel-cell-assisted chelated-iron process was effective to remove the H2S from gas streams with favorable sulfur and energy recovery efficiencies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The liquid product (biofuel) obtained from biomass pyrolysis has a very complex composition that consists of a mixture of different organic compounds. This mixture presents a high content of oxygenated groups (aldehydes, acids, esters, etc.) that reduce the quality of the biofuel. The deoxygenation of these biofuels improves their quality, reducing the viscosity, increasing the calorific value and improving their thermal stability. In this sense, the deoxygenation of methyl octanoate was carried out over different catalysts with basic properties such as FAU zeolites, SBA-15 ordered mesoporous silicate and clays like sepiolite and hydrolacite. Enhancement of its basic properties was carried out by ion-exchange and/or by impregnation with CsOH. Among these catalysts only over X zeolite was obtained good activity and selectivities to the desired products (C6, C7 and C8 hydrocarbons), especially over the ones with low silicon/aluminum molar ratio. The decrease of the electronegativity of the exchangeable cation in the X zeolite (KNaX1 and CsNaX1) allowed to improve the selectivity to C6 and C7 hydrocarbons (60%). Furthermore, the presence of cesium hydroxide (10 wt%) on the zeolite (CsI-NaX1) produced significant conversion of methyl octanoate (70%) with high selectivity to alkenes (53%) reaching a desired/undesired product ratio of 7.3. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The preparation, characterization and catalytic activity test of Cr/acid activated natural zeolite on palm oil hydrocracking reaction into liquid biofuels fraction were performed. Natural zeolite obtained from Klaten, Indonesia was activated with 1 M sulfuric acid to obtain a sample of acid activated natural zeolite (ZZA). The catalysts preparation was made by impregnation method of precursor salt solution of Cr(NO3) 3·9H2O into acid activated natural zeolite samples, followed by calcination, oxidation and reduction, to bring the material become Cr/acid activted natural zeolite catalyst. Catalyst characterization includes the determination of the TO4 site (T = Si or Al) in zeolite which was observed by the infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and Brønsted-Lewis acid sites, the determination of acidity by the method of vapour adsorption of ammonia and pyridine on the internal and external surfaces of the catalyst, catalysts crystallinity was determined with the diffraction of X-ray method and the porosity of the catalyst was analyzed with a surface area analysis method. Palm oil hydrocracking reactions was carried out by using a fixed-bed reactor at 450 °C and the H2 flow rate was 20 mL/min, in the ratio variation of the feed/catalyst 1/1, 2/1 and 3/1, respectively by doing the preliminary preparation of the palm oil. Liquid product analysis by using the chromatography gas method, to calculate the fraction of gasoline, kerosene and diesel. The result shows that the acid activation and the insertion of the metal on the surface of zeolite could increased the acidity of the samples. Acid activated natural zeolite samples had specific surface area of 162.46 m2/g, meanwhile the Cr/acid activated natural zeolite catalyst was found 74.54 m 2/g. The highest conversion of liquid products was 82.05 % resulted from the ratio of the feed/catalyst of 2/1 with the preliminary preparation of the feed through the esterification reaction.

AB  - Euphorbia characias has drawn much attention as a potential bioenergy crop given its considerable amount of latex, rich in hydrocarbon-like compounds, and its ability to grow in large areas of semiarid lands. Compositions of major constituents with an energy value have been determined for the three phenological stages of this plant (preflowering, flowering, and postflowering) and different irrigation treatments. Metabolites from both nonpolar and polar extracts have been identified and quantified by GC-MS, GC-FID, HPLC-ELSD, and UPLC-PDA-MS. The results highlight that the end of the flowering period is the optimal harvesting time to maximize the yields of E. characias as a potential energy crop. The total water requirements to obtain the maximum yields of hexane- and methanol-extractables were determined for its annual development cycle. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Renewable biobased carbon fibers are promising materials for large-scale electrochemical applications including chemical processing, energy storage, and biofuel cells. Their performance is, however, often limited by low activity. Herein we report that branching carbon nanotubes can enhance the activity of carbonized cellulosic fibers, such that the oxidation potential of NAD(H) was reduced to 0.55 V from 0.9 V when applied for bioprocessing. Coordinating with enzyme catalysts, such hierarchical carbon materials effectively facilitated the biotransformation of glycerol, with the total turnover number of NAD(H) over 3500 within 5 h of reaction. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An ultrasonic pretreatment method was developed to enhance the yield of bio-oil obtained from the liquefaction of cornstalks in hot-compressed water at different reaction temperatures (260-340 C) and residence times (0-40 min). Influences of ultrasonic pretreatment on the physicochemical properties of cornstalks and bio-oil yields were investigated. The results show that ultrasonic pretreatment obviously increases surface areas of cornstalks, decreases crystallinities, and erodes the structures of lignin, leading to more exposure of cellulose and hemicellulose. The yield of bio-oil was increased remarkably by 10.1% for 40 min sonicated cornstalks under the optimum liquefied conditions (300 C for 0 min of residence time). Carbon balance indicates that ultrasonic pretreatment increases the carbon conversion of cornstalks to heavy oil and water-soluble oil. Energy balance indicates that the sonicated cornstalks have positive energy efficiencies. GC-MS analyses demonstrate ultrasonic pretreatment increases the contents of the phenols in heavy oil and water-soluble oil. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present study is our attempt to develop a first robust protocol for one-pot transformation of vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, to a mixture of FAMEs and glycerol ether derivatives as final potential biofuel. The reaction is catalyzed by amorphous silica oxide functionalized with 10 wt% of sulfonic groups. The best performance was observed when a mixture of substrate/tert- butyl-methyl ether in 1:10 ratio and almost 1% catalyst was treated under microwave conditions fixed at 20 W. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sodium and potassium methoxides are used as an intermediary for a variety of products in several industrial applications. For example, current production of so called " 1G-biodiesel" relies on processing a catalytic reaction called " transesterification" This reaction transforms lipid resources from biomass materials into fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters. 1-G biodiesel processes imply the use of methanol, caustic potash (KOH), and caustic soda (NaOH) for which the hazards are well characterized. The more recent introduction of the direct catalysts CH3OK and CH3ONa may potentially introduce new process hazards. From an examination of existing MSDSs concerning these products, it appears that no consensus currently exists on their intrinsic hazardous properties. Recently, l'Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques (France) and the Canadian Explosives Research Laboratory (Canada) have embarked upon a joint effort to better characterize the thermal hazards associated with these catalysts. This work employs the more conventional tests for water reactivity as an ignition source, fire and dust explosion hazards, using isothermal nano-calorimetry, isothermal basket tests, the Fire Propagation Apparatus and a standard 20L sphere, respectively. It was found that these chemicals can become self-reactive close to room temperature under specific conditions and can generate explosible dusts. © 2013 Crown.

AB  - Lipid analysis often needs to be specifically optimized for each class of compounds due to its wide variety of chemical and physical properties. It becomes a serious bottleneck in the development of algae-based next generation biofuels when high-throughput analysis becomes essential for the optimization of various process conditions. We propose a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based high-throughput assay as a 'quick-and-dirty' protocol to monitor various lipid classes in algal crude oils. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization was determined to be most effective for this purpose to cover a wide range of lipid classes. With an autosampler-LC pump set-up, we could analyze algal crude samples every one and half minutes, monitoring several lipid species such as TAG, DAG, squalene, sterols, and chlorophyll a. High-mass resolution and high-mass accuracy of the orbitrap mass analyzer provides confidence in the identification of these lipid compounds. MS/MS and MS3 analysis could be performed in parallel for further structural information, as demonstrated for TAG and DAG. This high-throughput method was successfully demonstrated for semi-quantitative analysis of algal oils after treatment with various nanoparticles. © 2013 AOCS (outside the USA).

AB  - Catalytic cracking experiments were performed for bio-oil model compounds (acetic acid, guaiacol, n-heptane and hexamethylene, etc) using HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst at 550 °C, aiming to study the reaction mechanism and catalyst properties. The results show that the main product for catalytic cracking of n-heptane and hexamethylene is aromatics (53% and 91%, respectively in area). Catalytic cracking reaction occurs more easily for those oxygen-free model compounds. The aromatics content increase effectively (from 12% to 90% in area) with increasing addition of catalyst for acetic acid. The guaiacol structure is quite complex and the catalyst mainly removes its methoxy group. Increasing the weight of catalyst could lead to aromatics formation more easily.

AB  - The separation properties of sensitive bio-oil using molecular distillation technology were investigated under different distillation pressures. Crude bio-oil is divided into distillate fraction and residual fraction after the molecular distillation process. The yield of distillate fraction increases obviously with the decline of pressure, which achieves the highest value of 56.50% under 700 Pa. Most of water is enriched in the distillate fraction while water in residual fractions is effectively removed; water content in the residual fraction under 700 Pa is reduced to 4.20%. The distribution of some typical compounds, including acetic acid, phenol, furfural, levoglucosan, etc, under different distillation pressures was studied and the separation characteristic of these typical compounds was obtained; based on that, a separation factor model was proposed and a quantitative evaluation was made on the enrichment behaviors of 14 compounds in bio-oil.

AB  - Production of alternative fuels, such as biodiesel, from transesterification of vegetable oil driven by heterogeneous catalysts is a promising alternative to fossil diesel. However, achieving a successful substitution for a new renewable fuel depends on several quality parameters. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the amount of methyl esters, free glycerin and acid number in the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol in the presence of hydrotalcite-type catalyst to produce biodiesel. Reaction parameters, such as temperature and time, were used to evaluate soybean oil methyl esters rate conversion. Temperatures of 100 to 180 °C and times of 20 to 240 min were tested on a 1: 12 molar ratio soybean oil/methanol reaction. At 180 °C/240 min conditions, a rate of 94.5 wt% of methyl esters was obtained, where free glycerin and free fatty acids were not detected. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Although there has been a large research effort associated with individual parts of various algal biofuel production pathways, few studies have tracked changes in product composition throughout an integrated biofuel production process. This study uses microscopy and chromatography to analyze the progression of lipid profile and cell structure of algal cells throughout a research-scale production pathway for biocrude. For the specific processing methods used in this pathway, it is shown that TAG content decreased, while DAG and FFA content increased during processing. The changes in the lipid content corresponded to cell degradation that was observed by SEM and TEM throughout processing. These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of lipid composition in an algal culture used for biofuel production and emphasize the need to monitor changes in lipid profile, as those changes can directly impact biofuel productivity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pressurised steam gasification of wet biomass in a fixed-bed downdraft gasifier was implemented to identify reaction conditions yielding the highest synthesis gas concentration and efficiency, and to examine the generation of sulphur compounds. The gasification of lignin-rich fermentation residue derived from a bench-plant for bioethanol production from woody biomass was investigated at p=0.99MPa and T=750-900°C for steam to biomass ratios (S/B) of 3.4-17 and equivalence ratios (φ) of 3.3-∞. The results showed that the highest concentration of around 70mol% was obtained at T≥850°C, φ=13 and S/B=3.4, the highest efficiency of 0.26 was obtained at T=900°C, φ=3.3 and S/B=3.4, and sulphur compounds were H2S and COS. For the production of BTL synthesis gas, pressurised gasification has the potential to convert the wet residue below 77.3wt.% moisture contents. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work improved the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) quality produced using a stoichiometric methanol to oil molar ratio, removing monoglycerides (MGs), diglycerides (DGs) and glycerol by using a ceramic membrane. This work improved the conventional biodiesel batch reactor (CBR) performance, adding a refining stage using a ceramic membrane according to two different operational strategies: a batch reactor membrane system (CBR-MS) and a sequential batch membrane reactor (SBMR). The SBMR strategy showed the best results with an 87. wt.% FAME conversion yield and a 99.9% glycerol removal efficiency. SBMR was based on the operation of consecutives cycles of charge, transesterification, and discharge of permeate by operating the membrane only when a 70% FAME conversion was reached. This allowed both to work with a low viscosity product, increasing the permeate flux during the filtration process, and to diminish MG and DG content in the permeate. The application of the SBMR strategy improved a 34% the FAME content in the final product, in comparison to the CBR and 13% in comparison to CBR-MS. In addition, MG content was reduced a 79% in the final product in comparison to the CBR and a 20% compared to the CBR-MS. Finally, the DG content was reduced a 78% in comparison to the CBR and a 50% compared to the CBR-MS system when applying the SBMR strategy. It is proposed that the biodiesel successful separation-refining performance depends on the evolution of the emulsion during transesterification, as the ceramic membrane cannot remove MG and DG, but using the adequate strategy, their removal is possible from the biofuel stream. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) has become an interesting technology because of its potential role in producing biofuels via Biomass-to-Liquids (BTL) processes. In Fischer-Tropsch (FT) section, biomass-derived syngas, mainly composed of a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2), is converted into various forms of hydrocarbon products over a catalyst at specified temperature and pressure. Fixed-bed reactors are typically used for these processes as conventional FT reactors. The fixed-bed or packed-bed type reactor has its drawbacks, which are heat transfer limitation, i.e. a hot spot problem involved highly exothermic characteristics of FT reaction, and mass transfer limitation due to the condensation of liquid hydrocarbon products occurred on catalyst surface. This work is initiated to develop a new chemical reactor design in which a better distribution of gaseous reactants and hydrocarbon products could be achieved, and led to higher throughput and conversion. The main goal of the research is the enhancement of a fixed-bed reactor, focusing on the application of Kenics™ static mixer insertion in the tubular packed-bed reactor. Two FTS experiments were carried out using two reactors i.e., with and without static mixer insertion within catalytic beds. The modeled syngas used was a mixed gas composed of H 2/CO in 2: 1 molar ratio that was fed at the rate of 30 mL(STP)-min- 1 (GHSV ≈ 136 mL. g ca -1.h -1) into the fixed Ru supported aluminum catalyst bed of weight 13.3 g. The reaction was carried out at 180 °C and atmospheric pressure continuously for 36 h for both experiments. Both transient and steady-state conversions (in terms of time on stream) were reported. The results revealed that the steady-state CO conversion for the case using the static mixer was approximately 3.5 times higher than that of the case without static mixer. In both cases, the values of chain growth probability of hydrocarbon products (α) for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis were 0.92 and 0.89 for the case with and without static mixer, respectively. © 2012 CAS/DICP.

AB  - Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were functionalized with pyrogallol and used in a composite with silica as a support for a Cu-Co based catalyst. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and H 2 temperature programmed reduction. The effects of pyrogallol and the weight ratio of silica to MWNTs on the performance of the catalyst were studied in a fixed bed reactor. The increase of the amount of MWNTs in the catalyst support was found to favor decreased methanol production and increased production of C2+ alcohols. Using pyrogallol in catalyst preparation was also found to increase the production of C2+ alcohols. It was concluded that pyrogallol improves the distribution and uniformity of metal particles on the support, decreases the size of metal particles and increasing the rate of catalytic reduction. © 2012.

AB  - Background: Acetals can be considered important bio-based diesel additives. The production of most of these compounds, from an alcohol and an aldehyde, suffers from low conversion due to thermodynamic limitations. These limitations can be overcome through the removal of the by-product water. Previous studies showed that the in situ dehydration options of reactive distillation and pervaporation membrane reactor integration offer little advantage or at least not at reasonable unit dimensions. The aim of the present work is the development of a membrane based process and comparison with other alternatives (based on experimental data). Results: Three different membrane processes were developed. The one in which the reaction mixture is recycled over a first dehydration membrane module and subsequently through a simple distillation column, was found to give the highest overall conversion (100%) at low recycle rates and reasonable membrane area. This process was techno-economically compared with other possible alternatives: (1) a process based on a conventional tubular reactor and several distillation columns; and (2) a process based on reactive distillation. Conclusions: Efficient water removal by membranes avoids possible azeotropes in downstream distillation units making them much simpler, reducing considerably the unit sizes and the energy demand (40% lower). © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - A central composite rotatable design and response surface methodology were used in order to investigate the individual and combined effects of the ethanol-to-oil ratio, H 2SO 4 concentration, temperature and time of reaction on the reduction of free fatty acid (FFA) in jatropha oil. A quadratic polynomial model relating the reaction variables with FFA reduction was developed, presenting a good coefficient of determination (R 2= 0. 893). For reducing FFA to less than 1%, the optimal combination was found to be 0. 62 v·v -1 ethanol-to-oil ratio (14. 9 v·v -1 ethanol-to-FFA ratio), 1. 7% v·v -1 H 2SO 4 concentration, and 79 min reaction time at a reaction temperature of 54°C. These results are of great relevance to maximize methyl esters formation by transesterification using an alkaline catalyst. © 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Coal, natural gas and petroleum-based liquid fuels are still the most widely used energy sources in modern society. The current scenario contrasts with the foreseen shortage of petroleum that was spread out in the beginning of the XXI century, when the concept of "energy security" emerged as an urgent agenda to ensure a good balance between energy supply and demand. Much beyond protecting refineries and oil ducts from terrorist attacks, these issues soon developed to a portfolio of measures related to process sustainability, involving at least three fundamental dimensions: (a) the need for technological breakthroughs to improve energy production worldwide; (b) the improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors of modern society; and (c) the increase of the social perception that education is a key-word towards a better use of our energy resources. Together with these technological, economic or social issues, "energy security" is also strongly influenced by environmental issues involving greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity in environmentally sensitive areas, pollution and poor solid waste management. For these and other reasons, the implementation of more sustainable practices in our currently available industrial facilities and the search for alternative energy sources that could partly replace the fossil fuels became a major priority throughout the world. Regarding fossil fuels, the main technological bottlenecks are related to the exploitation of less accessible petroleum resources such as those in the pre-salt layer, ranging from the proper characterization of these deep-water oil reservoirs, the development of lighter and more efficient equipment for both exploration and exploitation, the optimization of the drilling techniques, the achievement of further improvements in production yields and the establishment of specialized training programs for the technical staff. The production of natural gas from shale is also emerging in several countries but its production in large scale has several problems ranging from the unavoidable environmental impact of shale mining as well as to the bad consequences of its large scale exploitation in the past. The large scale use of coal has similar environmental problems, which are aggravated by difficulties in its proper characterization. Also, the mitigation of harmful gases and particulate matter that are released as a result of combustion is still depending on the development of new gas cleaning technologies including more efficient catalysts to improve its emission profile. On the other hand, biofuels are still struggling to fulfill their role in reducing our high dependence on fossil fuels. Fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) from vegetable oils and ethanol from cane sucrose and corn starch are mature technologies whose market share is partially limited by the availability of their raw materials. For this reason, there has been a great effort to develop "second-generation" technologies to produce methanol, ethanol, butanol, biodiesel, biogas (methane), bio-oils, syngas and synthetic fuels from lower grade renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulosic materials whose consumption would not interfere with the rather sensitive issues of food security. Advanced fermentation processes are envisaged as "third generation" technologies and these are primarily linked to the use of algae feedstocks as well as other organisms that could produce biofuels or simply provide microbial biomass for the processes listed above. Due to the complexity and cost of their production chain, "third generation" technologies usually aim at high value added biofuels such as biojet fuel, biohydrogen and hydrocarbons with a fuel performance similar to diesel or gasoline, situations in which the use of genetically modified organisms is usually required. In general, the main challenges in this field could be summarized as follows: (a) the need for prospecting alternative sources of biomass that are not linked to the food chain; (b) the intensive use of green chemistry principles in our current industrial activities; (c) the development of mature technologies for the production of second and third generation biofuels; (d) the development of safe bioprocesses that are based on environmentally benign microorganisms; (e) the scale-up of potential technologies to a suitable demonstration scale; and (f) the full understanding of the technological and environmental implications of the food vs. fuel debate. On the basis of these, the main objective of this article is to stimulate the discussion and help the decision making regarding "energy security" issues and their challenges for modern society, in such a way to encourage the participation of the Brazilian Chemistry community in the design of a road map for a safer, sustainable and prosper future for our nation.

AB  - This contribution discusses the state of the art and the challenges in producing biofuels, as well as the need to develop chemical conversion processes of CO2 in Brazil. Biofuels are sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels for providing energy, whilst minimizing the effects of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Ethanol from fermentation of simple sugars and biodiesel produced from oils and fats are the first-generation of biofuels available in the country. However, they are preferentially produced from edible feedstocks (sugar cane and vegetable oils), which limits the expansion of national production. In addition, environmental issues, as well as political and societal pressures, have promoted the development of 2nd and 3 rd generation biofuels. These biofuels are based on lignocellulosic biomass from agricultural waste and wood processing, and on algae, respectively. Cellulosic ethanol, from fermentation of cellulose-derived sugars, and hydrocarbons in the range of liquid fuels (gasoline, jet, and diesel fuels) produced through thermochemical conversion processes are considered biofuels of the new generation. Nevertheless, the available 2nd and 3 rd generation biofuels, and those under development, have to be subsidized for inclusion in the consumer market. Therefore, one of the greatest challenges in the biofuels area is their competitive large-scale production in relation to fossil fuels. Owing to this, fossil fuels, based on petroleum, coal and natural gas, will be around for many years to come. Thus, it is necessary to utilize the inevitable CO2 released by the combustion processes in a rational and economical way. Chemical transformation processes of CO 2 into methanol, hydrocarbons and organic carbonates are attractive and relatively easy to implement in the short-to-medium terms. However, the low reactivity of CO2 and the thermodynamic limitations in terms of conversion and yield of products remain challenges to be overcome in the development of sustainable CO2 conversion processes.

AB  - Cellulose is an important material for production of biofuel and refined chemicals. Pyrolysis is one of the most promising approaches for cellulose de-polymerization. Understanding the mechanism of cellulose pyrolysis is essential for development of efficient biomass conversion technologies. In this study, the thermodynamic energy change of cellulose pyrolysis through homolytic bond cleavage was studied with the aid of density functional theory method by using cellulose dimer as a model compound. The free energy changes of various homolytic bond dissociation of cellulose dimer were studied by the method of M06-2x at the temperature of 800°C. To compare with experiment results of cellulose pyrolysis reported recently by Huber et al., the free energy changes of reaction pathways studied by Auerbach group via Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics calculations were also studied. Calculated results show that the free energy changes of homolytic dissociation of glucosidic bond varies in the range of 45~51 kcal/mol. The free energy changes of homolytic bond dissociation of C-OH bond vary in the range of 62~70 kcal/mol. The free energy changes of homolytic bond dissociation of O-H bond vary in the range of 82~95 kcal/mol. The free energy changes of homolytic bond dissociation of C-C bond vary around 46 kcal/mol. Furthermore, thermodynamic stabilities of products were found to be irrelevant to the ratios of them in Huber et al.'s fast pyrolysis experiments no matter at a high temperature (800 K) or a mild temperature (298 K). Finally, we found that temperature have a significant influence on whether a reaction can occur spontaneously or not. At relatively high temperature, the reactions having significant increase of entropy are favored, e.g. dehydration. The free energy of reactions with small entropy changes are less sensitive to the change of temperature. This foundation provides an inspiration for controlling chemical selectivity of different types of reactions by temperature regulation. © 2013 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - This paper focuses on the classified separation of flash pyrolysis oil by united extraction and distillation. Flash pyrolysis oil was effectively separated into four types of substances, including water-soluble fraction (low-boiling organic acids, alcohols, ketones, etc.), crude saccharide (mainly levoglucosan), phenolic compounds (guaiacol, 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, etc.), and residue. The separation process was discussed in detail. The optimal separation condition was temperature 50 °C, 1:1 of water-to-oil ratio, and 20 min of contacting time. At this optimal separation condition, external standard method was employed to quantify levoglucosan, 4.1 wt% of levoglucosan accounted for the bio-oil could be obtained. Moreover, the potential applications of these four types of separated substances were discussed and proposed. Considering it is a kind of simple and effective process for the bio-oil, as well as the promising application prospects of the classified separation substances, this separation method will bring a new and highly efficient application of the bio-oil. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Staphylococcus haemolyticus L62 (SHL62) lipase was displayed on the cell surface of Escherichia coli using an autotransporter protein of Pseudomonas putida EstAβ8 as an anchoring motif. Localization of the SHL62 lipase on the cell surface of E. coli was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry analysis, Western blot, protease accessibility, and whole-cell enzyme activity assays. SHL62 lipase activity of whole cells reached 168 U/g dry cell weight toward p-nitrophenyl caprylate after being induced by 0.1 mM IPTG for 24 h. The optimum temperature and pH of the displayed SHL62 lipase was 40-45 C and pH 10, respectively. The displayed SHL62 was stable up to 45 C, at which it had >80% of maximum activity. The displayed SHL62 lipase showed a preference for medium chain fatty acids of p-nitrophenyl esters. Moreover, the displayed SHL62 lipase was used as a whole cell catalyst to produce biodiesel that was obtained at a yield of nearly 89.4% after a 96 h reaction at 30 C. These results suggest that the displayed SHL62 lipase on the cell surface of E. coli using an EstAβ8 anchoring motif can be used for biocatalytic applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The scheme of biomass microwave pyrolysis reactor system, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis instrument, temperature adsorption analyzer, and other analysis equipment were used to study the influence of cotton stalks with NaCl, K2CO3 and MgCl2 on microwave pyrolysis characteristics. The results showed that three kinds of metal salt additives made the yield of liquid product decrease and the yield of solid product increase. The introduction of additives can simplify the bio-oil components and improve the quality effect of bio-oil obviously. Phenolic compounds were significantly lower in the product and the peak area percentage of acetic acid increased to 37.57% from 11.87%, while the surface pore structure of solid coke was also significantly improved.

AB  - High temperature and pressure are generally required to produce biodiesel using supercritical methanol. We reduced the harsh reaction conditions by means of sonicating the reaction mixture prior to transesterification using supercritical methanol. Soybean oil was selected as the raw material for transesterification. As soybean oil contains more unsaturated fatty acid triglycerides, the biodiesel degraded more at high temperature. The reactants were sonicated for 60 min at 35 °C prior to transesterification to avoid degradation of the product and to enhance biodiesel yield at temperatures <300 °C. The process parameters were optimized using central composite design. The variables selected for optimization were temperature, time, and the oil to methanol molar ratio. The temperature and oil to methanol molar ratios were varied from 250 to 280 °C and 1:40-1:50, respectively. The reaction time was tested between 4 and 12 min. The biodiesel was analyzed for any possible degradation by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and for the wt% of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) obtained. The maximum FAME yield (84.2 wt%) was obtained at a temperature of 265.7 °C, an oil to alcohol molar ratio of 1:44.7, and a time of 8.8 min. The optimum yield was obtained at a pressure of 1,500 psi. The pressure and optimum temperature used to obtain the maximum yield were the lowest reported so far without the use of a co-solvent. Thus, the severity of the supercritical reactions was reduced by adding sonication prior to the reaction. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Many oxygen compounds were contained in bio-oil, such as acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, phenols, and sugar. Acetic acid, ethylene glycol, butanone, furfural, and m-cresol were selected as bio-oil model compounds in this article. Hydrogen production was carried out via catalytic steam reforming under the conditions of the mole ratio of steam and carbon = 6, liquid hourly space velocity = 5 h-1, and 600°C with catalyst Ni/MgO. Infrared gas analyzer was used to analyze gas concentration via catalytic steam reforming of model compounds on line, while the liquid products from a collection device were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrum. Intermediates were formed under catalytic steam reforming through elimination and recombination reaction, etc. The intermediates reacted with steam to produce H2 and CO 2, and then the reactions reached equilibrium in the end. The hydrogen yield of acetic acid, ethylene glycol, and butanone as materials were higher than that of furfural and m-cresol as materials at the same conditions. The lowest hydrogen yield is only 34.0% (m-cresol as feedstock) and the highest hydrogen yield is up to 78.6% (butanone as feedstock). © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - RS223-BX of glycoside hydrolase family 43 is a β-d-xylosidase that is strongly activated (kcat/Km as much as 116-fold) by the addition of divalent metal cations, Ca2+, Co2+, Fe 2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Ni2+. Slow activation by Mg2+ was demonstrated (kon 0.013 s -1 mM-1, koff 0.008 s-1) at pH 7.0 and 25 C. koff and kon values are independent of Mg 2+ concentration, but koff and kon are slower in the presence of increasing levels of substrate 4-nitrophenyl-β-d- xylopyranoside. The kinetics strongly suggest that M2+ binds to the enzyme rapidly, forming E M2+, followed by slow isomerization to the activated enzyme, E- M2+. Moderately high values of k cat (7-30 s-1) were found for M2+-activated RS223-BX acting on xylobiose (natural substrate) at pH 7.0 and 25 C. Certain M2+-activated RS223-BX exhibit the highest reported values of k cat/Km of any β-xylosidase acting on natural substrates: for example, at pH 7.0 and 25 C, xylobiose (Mn2+, 190 s-1 mM-1), xylotriose (Ca2+, 150 s-1 mM-1) and xylotetraose (Ca2+, 260 s-1 mM -1). There is potential for the enzyme to add value to industrial saccharification operations at low substrate and high d-glucose and high d-xylose concentrations.

AB  - Mesoporous SBA-15-based catalysts were applied, for the first time, to the pyrolysis of waste mandarin residue. Si-SBA-15 with few acid sites, Al-SBA-15 with a significant amount of acid sites owing to the alumination treatment, and Pt/Al-SBA-15, which was synthesized by incorporating 7.1-nm Pt nanoparticles on Al-SBA-15, were used. Pyrolysis experiments were conducted by pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy to determine the catalytic activities of the catalysts used. X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, NH3- temperature-programmed desorption and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the catalysts. Al-SBA-15 produced higher quality bio-oil than Si-SBA-15 due to its better deoxygenation and cracking performance stemming from the presence of acid sites. Pt/Al-SBA-15 showed the highest oxygenate conversion as well as the largest yield of high-value-added compounds, such as aromatics, low-molecular-mass hydrocarbons and furans.

AB  - Successful nanobiotechnology implementation largely depends on control over the interfaces between inorganic materials and biological molecules. Controlling the orientations of biomolecules and their spatial arrangements on the surface may transform many technologies including sensors, to energy. Here, we demonstrate the self-organization of L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which exhibits enhanced enzymatic activity and stability on a variety of gold surfaces ranging from nanoparticles to electrodes, by incorporating a gold-binding peptide tag (AuBP2) as the fusion partner for Bacillus stearothermophilus LDH (bsLDH). Binding kinetics and enzymatic assays verified orientation control of the enzyme on the gold surface through the genetically incorporated peptide tag. Finally, redox catalysis efficiency of the immobilized enzyme was detected using cyclic voltammetry analysis in enzyme-based biosensors for lactate detection as well as in biofuel cell energy systems as the anodic counterpart. Our results demonstrate that the LDH enzyme can be self-immobilized onto different gold substrates using the short peptide tag under a biologically friendly environment. Depending on the desired inorganic surface, the proposed peptide-mediated path could be extended to any surface to achieve single-step oriented enzyme immobilization for a wide range of applications. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Glycerol (a bio-waste generated from biodiesel production) has been touted as a promising bio-syngas precursor via reforming route. Previous studies have indicated that carbon deposition is the major performance-limiting factor for nickel (Ni) catalyst during glycerol steam reforming. In the current paper, dry (CO2)-reforming of glycerol, a new reforming route was carried out over alumina (Al2O3)-supported non-promoted and lanthanum-promoted Ni catalysts. Both sets of catalysts were synthesized via wet co-impregnation procedure. The physicochemical characterization of the catalyst showed that the promoted catalyst possessed smaller metal crystallite size, hence higher metal dispersion compared to the virgin Ni/Al2O 3 catalyst. This was also corroborated by the surface images captured by the FESEM analysis. In addition, BET surface area measurement gave 92.05m2/g for non-promoted Ni catalyst whilst promoted catalysts showed an average of 1 to 6% improvement depending on the La loading. Reaction studies at 873 K showed that glycerol dry reforming successfully produced H 2 with glycerol conversion and H2 yield that peaked at 9.7% and 25% respectively over 2wt% La content. The optimum catalytic performance by 2%La-Ni/Al2O3 can be attributed to the larger BET surface area and smaller crystallite size that ensured accessibility of active catalytic area. © 2013 BCREC UNDIP.

AB  - This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of a high-yield biochemical process for biofuel production from lignocelluosic biomass based on a previously proposed process. Unlike the standard biochemical process, which ferments sugar intermediates to ethanol, the process under consideration converts sugars to acetic acid which is esterified and hydrogenated to produce ethanol. This process has a significantly higher yield and produces no carbon dioxide. However, we find that the thermodynamic efficiency of the process is not increased in proportion to the yield gain. An additional survey of various biofuel production processes showed no direct correlation between yield and thermodynamic efficiency. This survey and the detailed thermodynamic analyses lead us to conclude that yield alone is an unreliable performance metric for biofuel technologies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel hydrothermal catalytic liquefaction process for Chlorella pyrenoidosa was studied in the paper to explore the new resources of bio-fuel. The effects of catalytic liquefaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst on the yield of bio-fuel were investigated, and the reaction conditions were optimized via orthogonal optimization method. The chemical groups and components of final bio-fuel were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that the optimal reaction was taken place at 300°C for 20 minutes as Ce/HZSM-5 was selected as a catalyst with 5% mass fraction and the volume ratio of Chlorella pyrenoidosa to solvent was 1:10. The maximum liquefaction yield reached to 39.87% and the heating value of final bio-fuel was up to 26.09 MJ/kg. The main components of bio-fuel from Chlorella pyrenoidosa contained alcohol, ester derivatives and some hydrocarbons. Compared with other lignocellulosic bio-fuels, the prepared bio-fuel can be regarded as an alternative diesel fuel because of their similar chemical components and higher heat value. The research is helpful for the preparation of bio-fuel from microalgaes.

AB  - In this paper, a novel biodiesel, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether cottonseed oil monoester (EGMECOM), which was synthesized through transesterification reaction of the refined cottonseed oil with ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, was developed. Its chemical structure was characterized through FT-IR, 1H NMR, and GPC analyses. Its main physical and chemical properties were tested. Also, with a two-cylinder DI diesel engine, its combustion performances and emissions characteristics were investigated. The results indicated that EGMECOM has a comparative high cetane number and a high oxygen content, which are the prime factors that determine its NO x and smoke emissions, respectively. As a result, the trade-off relationship between the NO x and smoke emissions is broken for EGMECOM fuel, which both reduce with the increase of EGMECOM fraction in the EGMECOM - diesel blends. As well, the high oxygen content shows positive effects on the reduction of both the CO and HC emissions. Compared to diesel fuel, a maximal reduction of the smoke, NO x, CO, and HC by 50.0%, 50.0%, 20%, and 55.6%, respectively, can be reached when EGMECOM is used. Besides, for EGMECOM, the combustion timing of engine is advanced, ignition delay is shortened, and the combustion is improved. Copyright © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC 2012.

AB  - This article examines biodiesel production from nonedible oil extracted from Thespesia populnea L. plant seeds. The effects of catalyst concentration, time, water content, and temperature on transesterification were studied to get large yield of fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) of the Thespesia populnea L. oil. It was found that the yield of biodiesel made from the Thespesia populnea L. oil under various conditions was found 50%-92%. Biodiesel produced from this nonedible oil was tested on a diesel engine to study the effect of biodiesel fatty acid composition on the engine exhaust emission. The smoke, HC, CO, and NO x emissions for B50 blend of this biodiesel at different loads, i.e., 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, were found higher or comparable with diesel fuel. Nonedible oils can prove viable alternatives to edible oils for biodiesel production. From the environmental point of view, biodiesel is superior fuel than fossil fuel. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Chestnut cupulae pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor in an attempt to determine the effects of pyrolysis temperature, particle size and sweeping gas (N2) flow rate on the product yields. The maximum bio-oil yield of 52.50 wt% was obtained from chestnut cupulae in N2 atmosphere at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 C, sweeping gas-flow rate of 100 cm3. min-1 and particle size of Dp â‰ 250 mm. The pyrolysis oils were collected in a cold trap maintained liquid nitrogen and characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, 1HNMR and GC. Chromatographic and spectroscopic studies on bio-oil have shown that chestnut cupulae can be used as a fuel and chemical feedstock.

AB  - The oxidation of n-butyl formate, a potential biofuel candidate, is studied using three different experimental approaches. Ignition delay times have been measured for stoichiometric mixtures of fuel and air for pressures of about 20 and 90. bar at temperatures from 846 up to 1205. K in a high-pressure shock tube. A rapid compression machine has been used to determine the low-temperature ignition delay times for stoichiometric mixtures at pressures close to 20. bar over the temperature range from 646. K up to 861. K. Laminar burning velocities have been determined for stoichiometric ratios ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 using the high-pressure chamber method combined with an optical Schlieren cinematography setup in order to acquire experimental data at elevated pressures of about 10. bar and a temperature of 373. K. A detailed kinetic model has been constructed including high-temperature and low-temperature reaction pathways. The enthalpies of formation, entropies, and specific heats at constant pressure for the fuel, its primary radicals, and several combustion intermediates have been computed with the CBS-QB3 methods and included in the mechanism. This model was validated successfully against the presented data and used to elucidate the combustion of this interesting ester. The importance of accurate inclusion of the low-temperature peroxy chemistry has been highlighted through sensitivity and reaction path analysis. This study presents the first combustion study of n-butyl formate and leads to an improved understanding of the chemical kinetics of alkyl ester oxidation. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biodiesel production is not economically competitive with petroleum diesel particularly when using virgin and refined vegetable oils. Rich-in-oil miscella obtained from the extraction of soybean oil with ethanol may be a promising feedstock for taking off the refining process, simultaneously introducing an environmental friendly step by replacing hexane by ethanol as a renewable solvent in the oil extraction process. The aim of this study was to investigate the production of biodiesel from the oil-ethanol miscella by direct transesterification using Novozym®435 as catalyst and ethanol as acyl acceptor; simultaneously optimizing the process by response surface methodology and enzyme reuse. RESULTS: The best experimental conditions indicated by the empirical model were temperature 40°C, oil:ethanol molar ratio 1:4.5 and catalyst concentration 9.5% for 24h, reaching 85.4% fatty acid ethylic esters (FAEE) yield. Tert-butanol used as co-solvent increased the ethyl esters yield from 18%, keeping a high FAEE yield (over 70%) for more than 3cycles of enzyme reuse. CONCLUSIONS: Rich miscella has great potential as a low cost feedstock for biodiesel production when Novozym®435 is used as catalyst, simultaneously introducing an environmentally friendly step by using the renewable solvent ethanol in the extraction and transesterification. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In this study, scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sawdust was used as biomass resources. Catalyzed and uncatalyzed (thermal) pyrolysis processes were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of the parameters on pyrolysis product yields such as temperature and catalysis type were investigated. The pyrolysis of the experimental samples that have a particle size in the range of 0.850-1.60 mm were carried out at the temperatures of 400, 500 and 600 °C at the heating rate of 5°C/min. Nitrogen gas (N2) flow was used at the rate of 30 ml/min during the process. Basic salts such as Na 2CO3, K2CO3 and Lewis acid (FeCl3) were used as catalyses. As a result, it was determined that temperature and catalysis types were effective parameters in the yields of char, bio-oil and gas products. Also it was determined that the conversion of wood materials into fuel or valuable chemicals with the pyrolysis method is an applicable technology.

AB  - Calcined waste starfish was used as a base catalyst for the production of biodiesel from soybean oil for the first time. A batch reactor was used for the transesterification reaction. The thermal characteristics and crystal structures of the waste starfish were investigated by thermo-gravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction. The biodiesel yield was determined by measuring the content of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The calcination temperature appeared to be a very important parameter affecting the catalytic activity. The starfish-derived catalyst calcined at 750 C or higher exhibited high activity for the transesterification reaction. The FAME content increased with increasing catalyst dose and methanol-over-oil ratio. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Bio oil, produced by a fast pyrolysis of biomass, seems to be promising as the alternative to fossil fuel. However, bio oil has some undesired properties for fuel applications: high acidity, corrosiveness, low octane value, thermal instability, etc. These properties restrict its direct use for transportation, and require upgrading technology by reducing the oxygen content before use. Regarding to the complicated composition of bio oil, it is difficult to identify the reaction mechanism. Therefore, a model compound is widely used in bio oil upgrading research. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) experiments were performed in a quartz fluidized bed for a bio-oil model compound (acetol, ethyl acetate, guaiacol) over a HZSM-5 molecular sieve catalyst at 550°C, aiming to study the cracking characteristics of model compounds and the reaction mechanism as well as catalyst deactivation properties. The FCC facility mainly consisted of a gas-supplying unit, a pre-heater, a fluidized bed reactor with an inner diameter of 4cm and a height of 50 cm, a two-step condenser, an accumulative flowmeter and a gas-collecting unit. Gas products were quantified by GC 9800, liquid products quantified and qualified by Agilent 7890/5973-GC/MS, coke deposition detected by TG-DSC (Netsch STA409PC). The liquid products of acetol cracking are composed of aromatics, phenols (&lt;5%), and hydrocarbons, while oxygen is released in the form of CO, CO2, H2O. The liquid product of ethyl acetate cracking is mainly aromatics (&gt;65%), oxygenated chemicals were less than 7%, and olefin content in the gas products is higher than 60%, which shows that the HZSM-5 has good selectivity of aromatics and olefins and has good deoxygenation properties. The liquid products of guaiacol are phenols (~50%), aromatics (~25%) and oxygenated chemicals (&lt;10%), which proves the stable structure of phenol. The catalytic liquid product of a model compound without aromatic rings contains mainly aromatics and a low content of oxygenated chemicals. The catalytic gaseous products for acetol and ethyl acetate are mainly CO and olefin, respectively. The main catalytic product of phenols are phenolic compounds, followed by aromatics, which means phenols have relatively stable structures, while the olefin gaseous products are around 30%. The coke deposition rate is acetol &gt; guaiacol &gt; ethyl acetate. According to the catalytic cracking products distribution, the catalytic reaction pathways is speculated to illustrate that deoxygenation and cyclodehydration take place over a bio-oil catalytic cracking reaction, and show a good selectivity of aromatics and olefins, which provides a theoretical basis for the bio-oil catalytic cracking mechanism study.

AB  - Biodiesel, an alternative diesel additive made from renewable sources, has problems associated with their cloud points when used in colder climate. One method of improving the cloud point of biodiesel is hydroisomerization which branches the saturated portion of the biodiesel and lowers the cloud point of the compound. Palmitic acid methyl ester, which is the major saturated fatty acid in vegetable oils, is hydroisomerized with a 5 g kg-1 Pt impregnated beta zeolite catalyst at reaction conditions 200-285 °C and 1.0-4.0 MPa H2 pressure. FTIR and GC/MS analyses confirmed the branching and the identity of the reaction products. The cloud point of the material was lowered from 30 °C to 20 °C under reaction conditions of 285 °C and 4.0 MPa H2 pressure at the yield of 42% after 16 h. This study reports the hydroisomerization reaction being successful in branching the starting material in order to lower the cloud points of methyl esters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (PY-MS) have been completed on mallee woody biomass with the generated bio-oil and gases being collected and analysed. Equivalent TGA and PY-MS experiments showed that the TGA differential weight curve was similar to the combined PY-MS CO 2 and CO evolution curve. To determine how the product distribution through the pyrolysis process changed with temperature, a series of stepwise temperature experiments was performed using novel isolation and characterisation procedures, where the final PY-MS temperature was chosen to correspond to a specific portion of the total TGA curve. Three stepwise experiments were completed in the same fashion as the full range experiment, but where the final temperatures were 234, 330 and 587 C respectively. Analysis of the products from the low temperature Step 1 experiment showed an acetic acid-rich bio-oil and a CO2-rich gas had formed, indicative of hemicellulose decomposition. Phenols were also found to be present in this oil indicating that lignin decomposition also had occurred. The Step 2 experiment was characterised by major bio-oil generation with a full range of typical components present, indicating the decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin had occurred. The higher temperature Step 3 experiment was mainly characterised by volatiles generation which appeared to be derived from thermal decomposition reactions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Milled Tetra Aseptic (TA), and cardboard (TAC) and polyethylene (TAPE) layers separated from TA were subjected to non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis at 450 C with a heating rate of 100 C/s to produce liquid products with high yield. Two montmorillonite clays (K10, KSF) were acting as catalysts. The pyrolytic oil yield was in the range of 49.7-69.3 wt% depending on the type and the amount of catalyst. The non-catalytic fast pyrolysis at 450 C leads to the formation of bio-oil as a mixture of water, oil and wax with the highest yield (66.9 wt%). The addition of montmorillonite K10 promotes deeper degradation of polyethylene with the formation of liquid and gaseous products. Increasing amount of montmorillonite results in loss of bio-oil productivity followed by a substantial increase of gas yield. The amount and the type of catalyst influence the distribution of oil components. The addition of montmorillonite K10 to Tetra Aseptic promotes deeper conversion of cardboard and polyethylene layers. Ultimate and FT-IR analyzes show that the liquid products are characterized by lower oxygen content accompanied by increased hydrogen and carbon contents. The contribution of liquid hydrocarbons is the highest in bio-oil when a montmorillonite K10 is used as a catalyst during pyrolysis of TA. The pyrolysis of cardboard or polyethylene layers separated from TA shows that the process does not undergo according to the additivity rule. The degradation of PE is much deeper during the pyrolysis of separate layer than whole TA. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A unique approach was used in which polyoxometalate-based ionic liquids (POM-IL) were synthesized and employed for the one-pot dissolution and conversion of biomass. A library of four functional POM-IL compounds was synthesized using two cationic organic groups (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolim and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium) and two anionic POMs (phosphotungstate and tungstosilicate). The POM-IL compound serves a dual-purpose. First, it dissolves approximately 30 wt% of cellulosic biomass in 2 h at 200 °C. Second, analysis using HPLC confirmed that the POM-ILs catalyze conversion of biomass into commodity monosaccharides such as glucose and xylose. All of the prepared POM-IL compounds demonstrated dynamic thermal stabilities exceeding 300 °C and were characterized using IR and thermogravimetric analysis.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of two-step pretreatment on fermentable sugar production from corn stalk silage. In the first step, the corn stalk silage was extracted by tepid water and then the solid was pretreated using Fe(NO3)3 as catalyst. The results showed that 45.8g/100g DM total sugars was obtained and the surface of remaining solid was seriously damaged after two-step pretreatment. Compared with one-step pretreatment, the production of total sugars increased by 23.8% and the amount of the catalyst of Fe(NO3)3 decreased by 28.8%. This research provides a new effective, suitable and economical pretreatment method for biogas production from corn stalk. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), a renewable liquid biofuel popularly known as biodiesel, is emerging as a suitable replacement to common diesel fuel (CDF) in unmodified Compression Ignition (CI) engine. Present article reports the development of a process to reduce the operating cost during the conversion of vegetable oil to biodiesel through the application of ultrasound energy. Around 98% yield of FAME could be achieved with low reaction parameters such as methanol-oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time, and temperature. The optimum condition for the maximum 98% yield was 1.0 wt% of NaOH catalyst, 5:1 methanol: oil molar ratio and temperature 55°C under a sonication frequency of 20 kHz. With these reaction parameters the conversion occurred in just 5 minutes. The FAME obtained was purified in an effective way by water washing followed by passing over a bed of silica gel. The purified FAME was subjected to the evaluation of its fuel characteristics in a four-stroke, single-cylinder CI engine, which could operate with variable compression ratio. The engine performance study revealed that lower blends of biodiesel up to B20 could be an efficient fuel for an unmodified CI engine. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Macropores were introduced into nanotube matrices via polystyrene bead templates, and the resulting matrix was applied to carbon fiber microelectrodes as a porous medium for immobilization of enzymatic biocatalysts. The macropores were found to increase the electrochemically active surface area by twofold at a nominal polystyrene mass fraction of 73%. The modified electrodes were further coated with biocatalyst hydrogel comprising glucose oxidase, redox polymer, and crosslinker to create a glucose oxidizing bioanode. Glucose oxidation current density also increased two fold after introduction of the macropores. Focused ion beam cut cross-sections reveal complete adsorption of the enzyme-hydrogel matrix into the CNT layer. This templating technique is a promising approach to the maximization of surface area and transport in bioelectrodes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The total palm oil production has increased in the last few years, as a result, palm oil waste which is a by-product of the milling process will also increase. The palm oil production process in mills consists of several unit operations. The processing of fresh fruit bunches of palm results in the generation of different types of residue. Among the waste generated, palm oil mill effluent (POME) is considered as the most harmful waste for the environment if discharged untreated. POME is a thick brownish liquid that contains high solids, oil and grease. Several treatment technologies have been used for POME treatment, since the direct discharge of POME adversely affects the environment. Due to the presence of high oil residue in POME, attempts have been made to recover and convert it into valuable products such as usefull chemicals and biofuel. Recovery process of oil residue from POME is difficult and not economical; therefore, its alternative usage is explored. In a preliminary study, we observed that it was possible to produce various types of liquid hydrocarbons fuel (biofuel) from oil residue from POME. Oil residue from POME has been catalytically hyrdrocracked to biofuel by Ni/Mo-ZrO2 pillared monmorillonite catalyst in fixed bed micro reactor. The data show that the catalytic activity of ZrO2 pillared montmorillonite (ZM) is more active than parent monmorillonite. While, catalyst Ni/Mo loaded on ZM can increase the catalytic activity for hydrocracking of oil residue from POME into biofuel. The products were mainly gases, biofuel and solid coke. The biofuel products consist of gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil fraction. © 2012, Chinese Institute of Environmental Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - Meat and bone meal (MBM) is a mass-produced by-product of the meat rendering industry. It has great potential as a feedstock for the production of bio-fuels. Meat and bone meal, however, is a highly cohesive and temperature sensitive material and has traditionally been found to be very difficult, if not impossible, to feed properly into pyrolysis reactors or bubbling fluidized beds. This study showcases an application of the ICFAR intermittent solid slug feeder technology and its capability of successfully feeding the MBM regularly at an average feeding rate of 0.34 g/s into the reactor. A highly automated and instrumented fast pyrolysis pilot plant has been used to process meat and bone meal residues and to operate within a wide range of temperatures (450-600 °C). This is the first study dealing with the pyrolysis of pure meat and bone meal at various operating conditions continuously fed into a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor. All liquid and solid products have been analyzed (yields, HHV, GC-MS, elemental analysis, and ash mineral analysis). The homogenous bio-oil produced is an attractive fuel with a significant high heating value (HHV) of 31.5 MJ/kg and an average liquid yield of 43 wt% at 550 °C. The highest water-free HHV (36.7 MJ/kg) was found at 500 °C, with a liquid yield of 35 wt% at this temperature. The optimized pyrolysis temperature, at which the heat from the gas combustion can provide the heat required for processing MBM, while maximizing the bio-oil liquid yield and process energy yield, is 550 °C. Under these conditions, the pyrolysis process energy yield is 91%. The study also demonstrates a new technique to accurately determine the heat of pyrolysis reaction energy required by the process, using a non-invasive water calibration method. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An industrial project was developed to optimize the biodiesel production from crude palm oil. This process was developed for a one ton scale application on the palm oil production facility in equatorial Africa, to be used on the plantation to provide fuel for the fleet of the company. Because of the specific conditions (crude palm oil as starting material, application in technologically difficult conditions), it was essential for the developed procedure to be robust and simple, and to use minimum amounts of chemicals. The process was optimised on lab-scale in 2005 and 2006, scaled up in the following year, and is since then successfully applied as intended on the palm oil plantation. The produced biodiesel is used pure, without mixing with diesel fuel and without additives. After several years of continuous use, no negative effects were noticed on the engines. The process efficiency and durability are therefore confirmed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrothermal processing may provide an attractive alternative for producing biofuels with microalgae. Hydrothermal processing can be used with wet feedstocks without needing energy-intensive drying or solvents for oil recovery as is typical for algae biofuel processes. In this study, microalgae strains Isochrysis sp. and Thalassiosira weissflogii were processed in a hydrothermal batch reactor at temperatures of 250-350 C and residence times up to 3 h. Triglyceride feedstock hydrolysis in hydrothermal systems was modeled using previously identified methods. Kinetic parameters for triglyceride hydrolysis were fit to literature data. Degradation of unsaturated fatty acids in hydrothermal systems was modeled by adding reaction pathways to the hydrolysis reaction system, and fitting kinetic parameters to the experimental data. The time scale for the degradation indicates that short reaction times (<30 min) with high temperatures (300-350 C) will maximize the yield of free fatty acids before degradation occurs. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - At present, one of the most promising methods of processing renewable raw materials is pyrolysis, which allows liquid organic products (bio-oil) to be derived from biomass. For obtaining fuel products from bio-oil, the latter needs to be preliminarily upgraded. It is appropriate to carry out this process in two stages. The first stage-decarboxylation-is intended to reduce the corrosiveness (acidity) of the feedstock and hydrogen consumption at the second stage. Decarboxylation is usually conducted over noble metal-based catalysts. There are examples of employing cheaper catalysts based on alkaline-earth metals; however, these catalysts suffer from insufficient stability. Here, we report the activity of MgO-based catalysts in the decar- boxylation of pentanoic acid, a model compound imitating bio-oil, and the effect of dopants on the stability of the magnesium-containing catalysts. The process has been carried out in an inert atmosphere at a temper- ature of 350°C and a pressure of 0.50 MPa. Raising the MgO calcination temperature to 1200°C and intro- ducing stabilizing admixtures (Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2) affords catalysts that are mainly deactivated via car- bonate formation rather than the formation of soluble magnesium salts and are, therefore, more promising from the standpoint of regenerability. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2013.

AB  - Sugarcane products represent an abundant and relatively low cost carbon resource that can be utilised to produce chemical intermediates such as levulinic acid and furanics. These chemicals can be easily upgraded to commodity and specialty chemicals and biofuels by high yielding and well established technologies. However, there are challenges and technical hurdles that need to be overcome before these chemical intermediates can be costeffectively produced in commercial quantities. The paper reviews production of levulinic acid and furanics from sugars by homogeneous mineral acid catalysts, and reports on preliminary studies on the production of these compounds with environmentally friendly biodegradable sulfonic acids. The yields (>50% of theoretical) of levulinic acid, formic acid and furfural obtained with these organic acids are comparable to that of sulphuric acid currently used for their production.

AB  - This study provides a systematic approach to understand the water tolerance of a newly developed non-catalytic biodiesel conversion process. The influence of water on the non-catalytic biodiesel conversion process was compared directly with the conventional transesterification reaction, which uses homogenous catalysts, such as KOH and H2SO4. This study demonstrated that water had no significant impact on non-catalytic biodiesel conversion and the conversion efficiency reached approximately ~98±0.5% at a water content of 5wt.% in the biodiesel lipid feedstock (i.e., corn oil). However, this work showed that the non-catalytic biodiesel conversion using porous hydrophobic materials (i.e., charcoal) exhibited better biodiesel conversion performance compared to non-catalytic biodiesel conversion in the presence of activated alumina. This can be explained by the mechanism of the reaction between gas-phase MeOH and liquid-phase triglycerides. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rape straw pretreated by a continuous twin screw-driven reactor (CTSR) with hot water presented a distinctive particle-size distribution profile as a function of the operating temperature. The relative amount of finer particle size dramatically increased as the ratio of solid to liquid was increased. Size reduction through physical CTSR process effectively promoted the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated rape straw. Meanwhile, the crystallinity of the physically pretreated straw was not a greater factor affecting the enzyme digestibility. The glucose conversion from the enzymatic hydrolysis of the straw pretreated by CTSR with hot water was maximized at 52%. Using the chemicals as catalyst have affected considerably for increasing the digestibility at same condition with hot water pretreatment. The enzymatic digestibilities of the straw pretreated by CTSR with sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid were 60% and 77%, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article reports biodiesel production and discusses experimental results from a laboratory performance study by using natural novel source of non edible wild safflower (Carthamus oxyacantha Bieb.) oil. The effect of variables including molar ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time, concentration of catalyst, and mixing intensity on biodiesel yield and characteristics of the biodiesel produced from wild safflower oil were analyzed. The highest triglyceride conversion rate of 84% was achieved after 2 hr of reaction at 65C, with a 5:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil and sodium hydroxide as catalyst. It is stated that the wild safflower oil biodiesel (WSOB) is comparable with the recommended ASTM biodiesel standard and can be used as option for biomass energy. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In order to improve the efficiency of distillers' grains converting to ethanol, 13 dilute solution explosions were evaluated based on the optimization of pure water explosion. To decrease residual inhibitor content, the exploded slurry was dried at 105°C. Using a 1.1mol/L butanone solution explosion, with the explosion temperature set at 160°C (pressure at 1.9MPa), the residence time at 10min, and the dried distillers' grains-to-water ratio at 1:2 (w/w), the yields of total sugar, glucose, and xylose were 86%, 89%, and 84% (w/w), respectively, and the ethanol yield was 25.3g/100g distillers' grains dry matter. Moreover, the eight other reagent solution explosions improved the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis, and of simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation, and the residual contents of furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and acetic acid decreased to an acceptable concentration range after detoxification by drying. The results suggested that compared with pure water explosions, the use of volatile solutions lowered the explosive temperature and improved the sugar yield. This study offers a reference for the further study of lignocellulosic materials with higher starch and hemicelluloses contents as raw materials for converting biomass to bioethanol. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Direct addition of bioethanol to diesel reduces the quality of commercial blends. An alternative way to introduce bioethanol into diesel is as linear ether such as ethyl octyl ether (EOE). EOE synthesis by 1-octanol (OcOH) reaction with ethanol (EtOH) or diethyl carbonate (DEC) over acidic ion-exchange resins has been studied in a 100-mL batch reactor (130-150 °C, 25 bar). The main drawback for ethylating OcOH in both reaction systems is the loss of ethyl groups by diethyl ether formation. In OcOH excess, selectivity to EOE with respect to EtOH and to DEC was found to be similar (58-59%) when the ethylating agent was entirely consumed. However, the initial reaction rate of EOE formation from DEC is lower, due to the formation of ethyl octyl carbonate as reaction intermediate. Accordingly, EtOH showed to be more interesting ethylating agent to produce a synthetic biofuel such as EOE over acidic ion-exchange resins. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel (FAME) was produced from Pongamia seeds (commonly known as Karanja) by reactive-extraction. Reactiveextraction involves contacting ground seeds directly with alcohol and catalyst i.e. without intervening extraction of the vegetable oil. This process has the potential to reduce cost by removing the need for capital and running cost-intensive steps such as oil extraction of seeds. Reaction parameters such as seed size (>2 mm to <1 mm), seed/solvent ratio (wt/wt) (1:2-1:4), temperature (30-60°C) and rate of mixing (250-550 rpm) were studied. The maximum 98.5% conversion to biodiesel was achieved at: seed size (<1 mm), seed/solvent ratio (wt/wt) (1:4), rate of mixing (550 rpm) at 60 °C for 1 hr with 0.1 M catalyst (KOH) concentration, meeting International (ASTM) as well as National (BIS) specifications.

AB  - The yield of monosaccharides after two-stage concentrated sulfuric acid hydrolysis of softwood (Scots pine) and hardwood (trembling aspen) was modeled using a generalized severity parameter with a time-independent rate constant. The severity parameter, which combines the major operating variables acid concentration, temperature, and reaction time in the decrystallization stage into a single reaction ordinate, was successfully used to describe monosaccharide yields after a standardized hydrolysis stage. Conversion of cellulose to glucose demanded a higher severity to reach maximum glucose yields than the conversion of hemicelluloses to their respective monosaccharides, and the conversion of pine demanded a higher severity to obtain maximum monosaccharide yields as compared to aspen. The results indicate that the generalized severity parameter can be a useful tool for the prediction of sugar yields in a two-stage concentrated sulfuric acid hydrolysis process.

AB  - This review deals with the current trends in the use of vegetal renewable sources of energy. Microalgal biomass is considered to be the most promising renewable raw material since microalgae grow at a high rate and exceed the other cultures in productivity. Although large-scale technologies for production of energy-rich biomass to be converted into biofuels are at their early stages of development, recent advances in this area augur commercialization of these technologies in the near future. The advanced catalytic methods being developed (such as transesterification and hydrocracking) allow the microalgal biomass to be efficiently converted into biofuels. In order to obtain high-grade hydrocarbons, it is necessary to carry out the following conversions of the microalgal lipids: hydrolysis for removal of phosphorus-containing compounds, transes-terification with methanol over a heterogeneous catalyst, hydrodeoxygenation (hydrocracking), and isomer-ization. The existence of a wide variety of microalgae processing methods and the growing number of studies in this field suggest that microalgae have great potential as a source of bioenergy. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2012.

AB  - In this work fluorescence-based method to assess the biodiesel production from different refined vegetable oils is presented. Four different refined oils (soybean, sunflower, canola, and corn) and their respective biodiesel were used and the fluorescence of the compounds contained in their compositions was taken as a probe. The results show that the fluorescence intensity of the biodiesel is lower than one verified in the vegetable oil. The data achieved point out that the ratio between the fluorescence intensity of biodiesel and oil is about 0.6 regardless of the vegetable oil feedstock investigated. Reduced content of fluorophores as well as low viscosity of the biodiesel regarding the oil have been raised as hypotheses to explain the low fluorescence intensity of the biodiesel. The results obtained may provide the basis for the development of an alternative method able to give fast and accurate information about the conversion of oil into biodiesel without the requirement of dilution or pretreatment of the biodiesel. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - An O 2-consuming cathode for biofuel cell applications consisting of Trametes hirsuta laccase (ThL) immobilized in an electropolymerized fine-tuned poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) bilayer structure as the catalyst was studied. A NO 3 --doped PEDOT layer with a relatively porous structure was used as the immobilization matrix on which the enzyme was added by solution casting. A capping layer of polystyrene sulphonate, PSS --doped PEDOT was then electrodeposited on top of the first PEDOT layer in order to entrap the ThL between the layers. The PEDOT-NO 3 -/ThL/PEDOT-PSS - enzyme electrode is reported to be able to promote direct electron transfer (DET) between ThL and the current collector and it catalyzes the reduction of O 2 into water. The applicability of the PEDOT-NO 3 -/ThL/PEDOT-PSS - enzyme electrode structure on ITO glass with a geometrical surface area of 1 cm 2 as the electrode material was studied. The influence of different enzyme electrode fabrication parameters, such as the dopant ion used during electropolymerization, different combinations of PEDOT films, the thickness of both PEDOT layers and ThL loading on the enzyme electrode performance were investigated by chronoamperometric and cyclic voltammetric measurements. The optimum working pH for the enzyme electrode was found to be in the pH range 3.0-3.5. No enhanced cell performance was recorded when 2,2′-azinobis(3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) was used as mediator compared to DET in the PEDOT bilayer structure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of phase separation temperatures (5-90°C) on losses of higher fatty acid (C 16 and C 18) ethyl esters in the glycerol phase were investigated. Losses of ethyl esters produced from ethanolysis of rapeseed oil were 30-60% higher when NaOH rather than KOH was used as homogeneous catalyst. The losses decreased with an increase in separation temperature, resulting in an increase in the yield of the ester phase. The concentration of impurities (e.g. alkali metals, free glycerol and glycerides) in the ester phase increased with increasing separation temperature due reversible transesterification and reciprocal solubility of the compounds. Carbonates formed during neutralization of the catalysts are also transesterification catalysts and they cause reverse reaction. The ethyl ester bound in the glycerol phase during NaOH-mediated catalysis can be extracted by heating the separated glycerol phase to 60-90°C. The ester yield is increasing with increasing separation temperature, however with decreasing quality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The CatLiq process is a thermochemical conversion of wet biomass with process conditions near the critical point of water. Although the technology shares similarities with other thermochemical conversion processes such as liquefaction, pyrolysis and gasification it cannot be fully classified as one of these technologies. The process is a continuous process using both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts as well as the properties of near-critical water to achieve a conversion of biomass into a bio-oil product and a product gas. The CatLiq process is compared to these other thermochemical conversion methods to give a view of the similarities as well as the differences, including process conditions, feedstock requirements and product types. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential of tailored nanopores to transform technologies such as drug delivery, biofuel production, and optical-electronic devices depends on fundamental knowledge of the self-assembly of ordered nanoporous solids. Atomic-level geometries of critical nuclei that lead to such solids have remained hidden in the nanoscale blind spot between local (<0.5 nm) and collective (>5 nm) probes of structure. Heroic efforts at molecular simulation of nanopore formation have provided massive libraries of hypothetical structures;(1-5) however, to date no statistical simulation has generated a crystallization pathway from random initial condition to ordered nanoporous solid, until now. In this work, we show that a recently developed atomic lattice model of silica and related materials can form ordered nanoporous solids with a rich variety of structures including known chalcogenides, zeolite analogs, and layered materials. We find that whereas canonical Monte Carlo simulations of the model consistently produce the amorphous solids studied in our previous work, parallel tempering Monte Carlo gives rise to ordered nanoporous solids. The utility of parallel tempering highlights the existence of barriers between amorphous and crystalline phases of our model. Moreover, the self-assembly or nanoporous crystalline phases in the model open the door to detailed understanding of nanopore nucleation. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The efficient deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass remains a significant barrier to the commercialization of biofuels. Whereas most commercial plant cell-wall-degrading enzyme preparations used today are derived from fungi, the cellulosomal enzyme system from Clostridium thermocellum is an equally effective catalyst, yet of considerably different structure. A key difference between fungal enzyme systems and cellulosomal enzyme systems is that cellulosomal enzyme systems utilize self-assembled scaffolded multimodule enzymes to deconstruct biomass. Here, the possible function of the X1 modules in the complex multimodular enzyme system cellobiohydrolase A (CbhA) from C. thermocellum is explored. The crystal structures of the two X1 modules from C. thermocellum CbhA have been solved individually and together as one construct. The role that calcium may play in the stability of the X1 modules has also been investigated, as well as the possibility that they interact with each other. Furthermore, the results show that whereas the X1 modules do not seem to act as cellulose disruptors, they do aid in the thermostability of the CbhA complex, effectively allowing it to deconstruct cellulose at a higher temperature. © 2012 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved.

AB  - A novel production process of biodiesel using magnetically stabilized fluidized bed reactor (MSFBR) has been developed based on cottonseed oil and the reaction conditions were also studied. The reactant flow rate and magnetic field intensity affects on the magnetic catalytic particles behavior in the column were performed, and the transesterification reaction conditions of cottonseed oil were investigated in MSFBR with nanometer magnetic catalytic particles. Under the suitable reaction conditions of methanol/oil molar ratio 8:1, 40 cm3 min-1 flow rate, 225 Oe magnetic field intensity and temperature of 65 °C, the conversion efficiency reaches to 97% in 100 min. The stability and recovery of the magnetic catalytic particles in MSFBR are much better than that in autoclave stirred reactor. The result shows that most of the resultant cottonseed oil biodiesel parameters comply with the limits established by representative biodiesel standards. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Maximizing the efficiency and economic benefits of bio-oil is a major challenge for the emerging bio-refining industry. This research has developed a promising route to produce clean-fuel hydrogen with high value carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a by-product of the process via evaporation/pyrolysis-reforming of crude bio-oil. Since the waste catalyst coke is replaced by high-value CNTs, a potential significant increase of additional economic benefit could be contributed to the bio-refining process. Moreover, CO2 emission to the environment from the current practice of coke oxidation during catalyst regeneration would be reduced. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - There are several ways to produce the renewable resource biochar, such as pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization. Technologies for the conversion of biochar to biofuels could contribute to suffice the growing demand for fuel. Liquid-phase pyrolysis produces about 40 wt% of biochar. Direct liquefaction of biochar is a conceivable way of producing biofuels but has not been considered yet. Direct liquefaction of biochar is carried out in a 450 ml batch reactor at the temperature of 425 °C using tetralin as a hydrogen donor solvent. Several experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of an initial heating and an isothermal stage on the conversion of biochar to biofuel. The isothermal stage was investigated at two pressure levels. Reaction time was limited to 30 min. Biochar conversion of 84% and an oil yield of 72% were observed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of ultrasonication, temperature and solvent to solid ratio on oil yield using response surface analysis and develops a mathematical model to describe the kinetics of oil extraction from black seed (Nigella sativa). The mass transfer coefficients were calculated by fitting a two-exponential model to the experimental data. An ultrasonication time of 30min, solvent to solid ratio of 20:1 and temperature at 32C provided the maximum oil yield. Increasing the solvent to solid ratio and ultrasonication time improved the oil extraction rates during the diffusion stage while increasing temperature without ultrasonication improved the oil extraction rates during the washing stage. The kinetics of oil extraction with different particle sizes indicated that ultrasonication improved the values of mass transfer coefficients of washing and diffusion compared with the oil extraction process without ultrasonication. A two-exponential equation modeled the kinetics of oil extraction from black seed. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Extraction of oil from oil-bearing seeds and materials is important for both the food and biofuel industry. Solvent extraction is the predominant oil extraction method used by the vegetable oil industry. The vegetable oil companies have been looking for alternative methods to increase the efficiency of the extraction processes to reduce the production costs and minimize the wastes. Technological developments in high-intensity ultrasound generators and transducers increased their use in several industries. The effects of high-intensity ultrasound in addition to temperature, particle size and solvent to solid ratio on oil extraction were investigated using response surface methodology, and mathematical models for the oil extraction from black seed were demonstrated. High-intensity ultrasound, response surface experimental design and kinetic models are useful tools that can be adapted by the food industry to optimize and increase the efficiency of the extraction processes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Biogas slurry is not suitable for liquid fertilizer due to its high amounts of volatile materials being of complicated composition and peculiar smell. In order to remove volatiles from biogas slurry efficiently, the dynamic headspace and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to clear the composition of volatiles. Nitrogen stripping and superfluous ozone were also used to remove volatiles from biogas slurry. The results showed that there were 21 kinds of volatile compounds in the biogas slurry, including sulfur compounds, organic amines, benzene, halogen generation of hydrocarbons and alkanes, some of which had strong peculiar smell. The volatile compounds in biogas slurry can be removed with the rate of 53.0% by nitrogen stripping and with rate of 81.7% by the oxidization and stripping of the superfluous ozone. On this basis, the removal rate of the volatile compounds reached 99.2% by chloroform and n-hexane extraction, and almost all of odor was eliminated. The contents of some dissolved organic compounds decreased obviously and however main plant nutrients had no significant change in the biogas slurry after being treated. © 2013 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The decarboxylation of brown grease (BG) to green diesel hydrocarbons over a 5 wt % Pd/C catalyst was investigated in semibatch and batch reactors. Catalytic deoxygenation of BG under H2-Ar occurs primarily via decarboxylation with the liquid products of primarily n-heptadecane and n-pentadecane. A 90% conversion of BG in a semibatch mode was obtained in 7 h. In contrast, in a batch reaction the conversion was roughly 40% in the same reaction time. However, by pretreating the "as received" BG with H2, the conversion in a batch reactor was increased 1.4-fold; and when the H2 to BG ratio was increased to 3/1 (mol/mol), the conversion was further improved. A complete conversion of BG into green diesel via decarboxylation is possible over 5% Pd/C catalyst at 300 C and 1.5 MPa. This study demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining valuable green diesel biofuel from waste oil. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study presents a high-performance biofuel cell construction based on the covalent immobilizing of glucose oxidase (GOx) on chitosan-coated carbon cloth which is used as an anodic catalyst. The chitosan was coated by the coagulation of an aqueous chitosan solution on the carbon cloth surface. The GOx was coupled to chitosan using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as the condensing agents. Response surface methodology (RSM) and Box-Behnken design were employed to search for the optimal conditions, and to understand the significance of the factors affecting the activity of immobilized GOx. From ridge max analysis, the optimal immobilization condition was found at a reaction time of 50 min, a pH of 5.9, and an enzyme/support ratio of 3 (w/w). Under optimal conditions, the predicted and the experimental immobilized GOx activities were 34.42±1.07 and 33.50±0.92 U g-1 support, respectively. Based on the regression model, the carbon cloth electrodes with various GOx activities were prepared, and the effect of GOx activity on the power density generated from the biofuel cell was investigated. The power density was increased with GOx activity, and the maximum power of 1.87 mW cm-2 was obtained at a cell voltage of 0.44 V. © 2013 by ESG.

AB  - Absolute photoionization cross sections of the molecules γ-butyrolactone (GBL), γ-valerolactone (GVL), α- angelicalactone (AAL), and γ-methylene-γ-butyrolactone (GMGB), including partial ionization cross sections for dissociative ionization, are measured. The experiments are carried out using photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS) at the Advanced Light Source, and an orthogonal extraction time-of-flight spectrometer is used for mass analysis. Photoionization of furan, 2-methyl furan (2-MF), and 2,5-dimethyl furan (2,5-DMF) is also investigated to confirm the accuracy of our measurements, which show a good agreement of the absolute partial photoionization cross sections with literature values.

AB  - CO2 reduction from fossil-fired power plants can be achieved by carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). Among different CO2 capture technologies for power plants the oxyfuel power plant concept is a promising option. High temperature ceramic membranes for oxygen production have the potential to reduce the associated efficiency losses significantly compared to conventional air separation using cryogenic techniques. Focus of this paper is the environmental performance of membrane-based oxygen production for oxyfuel power plant technology. Included into the analysis are the production of the perovskite membrane (BSCF=Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ), the incorporation into a steel module, and the integration of several modules into an oxyfuel power plant. The membrane-based oxygen production is compared to the conventional cryogenic air separation in oxyfuel power plants in an ecological way. The evaluation is performed using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology from "cradle to grave". The share in the overall environmental impacts of respective life cycle elements like membrane and module production but also coal supply processes as well as the operation of the oxyfuel power plant are identified. Sensitivity analyses referring to life-time, permeability and housing conditions of the membranes set benchmarks for further membrane development. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - SUMMARY: In the present work, catalytic cracking of fish oil industrial residue was investigated to study the effect of temperature, type of catalyst and the heating rate on the yield of organic liquid fraction (OLF) and its acid value. The highest bio-oil yield of 72% (wt.) was obtained at temperature range of 300-500°C and heating rate of 10°C/min with the mixture of Al2O3 and Na2CO3 as a catalyst. It was found that the mixture of Na2CO3 and MgSO4 as a catalyst gives lowest acid value of 8.75 mgKOH/goil and 68.1% of OLF yield. Furthermore, the acid value is reduced to 0.36 mgKOH/goil using Na2CO3 as an absorbent. The results show that the catalytic cracking process represents a sustainable method to produce bio-oil from fish oil industrial residues with physicochemical characteristics similar to the diesel fuel. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - To test the viability of converting sawdust to bio-oil, an experimental fluidized-bed reactor was designed, constructed, and operated. The design was for a sawdust feed rate of 100 g/h at a temperature of 500 C. The gas residence time in the reactor was less than 1 s to achieve fast pyrolysis. Experimental repeatability and operational stability were evaluated, and the yields of various products, including char and bio-oil, were determined. Results showed a consistent bio-oil yield of about 62%. Bio-oil samples from the liquid collection system were taken and examined separately using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Detectable components with a sizable concentration belonged to the acid, ketone, and phenol groups. The heavier fraction of bio-oil had a lower water content and higher percentage of phenolic compounds. Elemental analyses of the bio-oils and chars were determined and compared to that of the sawdust. A low ash content in the produced bio-oils proved that the char separation system was very efficient. The heating value of the produced char, the byproduct of pyrolysis, was high, and therefore, it has potential for use as a source of process heat. The composition of the non-condensable gas produced was characterized by a micro-gas chromatograph. Results prove that fast pyrolysis is a promising technique to convert sawdust into liquid that can be more easily transported than low-density biomass. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cell immobilisation provides the opportunity to reduce the cost of producing bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass such as oilseed rape (OSR) straw, in addition to enhancing operational stability. Bioethanol fermentation of OSR straw hydrolysate by free and immobilised Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied. Cells were either entrapped in alginate beads or Lentikat® discs or immobilised as a biofilm on spent grains, Leca, or reticulated foam. The overall aims of the research were to compare bioethanol yields produced from free and immobilised systems, and to identify the most suitable immobilisation technique in terms of bioethanol yield and longevity of the immobilised cell system. Cell entrapment in alginate beads and Lentikat® discs resulted in significantly higher bioethanol yields compared to when cells were free in suspension or immobilised as a biofilm on a support material. The maximum amount of bioethanol produced by cells immobilised in alginate beads and Lentikat® discs were 169.26 ± 0.24 and 165.13 ± 0.67 g bioethanol kg-1 OSR straw after 3 h and 7 h of fermentation, respectively. Due to the high mechanical stability and bioethanol yield, immobilisation of S. cerevisiae in Lentikat® discs was considered the most appropriate immobilisation technique for bioethanol production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass fast pyrolysis is considered as a promising route to produce liquid for the transportation field from a renewable resource. However, the derived bio-oils are mainly oxygenated (45–50%w/w O on a wet basis) and contain almost no hydrocarbons. Therefore, upgrading is necessary to obtain a liquid with lower oxygen content and characterization of oxygenated compounds in these products is essential to assist conversion reactions. For this purpose, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC× GC) can be investigated. Oxygen speciation in such matrices is hampered by the large diversity of oxygenated families and the complexity of the hydrocarbon matrix. Moreover, response factors must be taken into account for oxygenate quantification as the Flame Ionisation Detector (FID) response varies when a molecule contains heteroatoms. To conclude, no distillation cuts were accessible and the analysis had to cover a large range of boiling points (30–630 °C). To take up this analytical challenge, a thorough optimization approach was developed. In fact, four GC× GC column sets were investigated to separate oxygenated compounds from the hydrocarbon matrix. Both model mixtures and the upgraded biomass flash pyrolysis oil were injected using GC× GC-FID to reach a suitable chromatographic separation. The advantages and drawbacks of each column combination for oxygen speciation in upgraded bio-oils are highlighted in this study. Among the four sets, an original polar× semi-polar column combination was selected and enabled the identification by GC× GC-ToF/MS of more than 40 compounds belonging to eight chemical families: ketones, furans, alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, guaiacols, anisols, and esters. For quantification purpose, the GC× GC-FID chromatogram was divided into more than 60 blobs corresponding to the previously identified analyte and hydrocarbon zones. A database associating each blob to a molecule and its specific response factor (determined by standards injection at different concentrations) was created. A detailed molecular quantification by GC× GC-FID was therefore accessible after integration of the corrected normalized areas. This paper aims to present a detail level in terms of characterization of oxygenated compounds in upgraded bio-oils which to our knowledge has never been reached so far. It is based on an original column set selection and an extremely accurate quantification procedure. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The choice of gasifying medium significantly affects the fuel gas composition and its heating value in biomass gasification. Generally, steam gasification is superior to air or steam-air or pure oxygen gasification in terms of hydrogen concentration and heating value of product gas. In this context, a thermodynamic equilibrium model for steam gasification of biomass based on minimization of Gibbs free energy is presented. Gas phases are modeled as real gases obeying the Redlich-Kwong equation of state. Minimization of Gibbs free energy of the gasification system is carried out with simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The parametric variation is studied by varying temperature and pressure for computing the composition and lower heating value of the product gas and energy efficiency of the gasification process for arriving at the optimum values of these variables. Simulations are performed with apricot stones as biomass material. Sensitivity analysis is done for the model and corresponding sensitivity coefficients are computed. The maximum mole fraction of hydrogen is found to be 63.5% at 870 K and the maximum LHV is 14.3 MJ/Nm 3 at 1050 K at a pressure of 1 bar. Similarly, the highest mole fraction percentage of 62% and LHV of 15.5 MJ/Nm3 are obtained at pressures of 8 bar and 4 bar, respectively, for the gasification temperature of 1000 K. Energy efficiency is consistently above 60% with a peak of 65.7% at 973 K and 1 bar. From the simulation results, the global optimum conditions for operation of gasifier are arrived as 973 K and 1 bar. © 2013 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this work, olive tree pruning has been fractionated into its components to produce ethanol (biofuel) from the cellulose fraction and platform chemicals (biochemicals) from lignin fraction. Organosolv pretreatment has been proved to be an effective process that fractionate and produce intermediates - cellulose and lignin- that can be later transformed. Ethanol was successfully produced from cellulose enriched solid fraction with high yields, 71.9gL-1 of glucose and 17.1g of ethanol per 100g of olive tree pruning. Organosolv pretreatment has been proved to enhance enzymes accessibility to the substrate and so, increased hydrolysis yields. Lignin was depolymerized into interesting compounds such as catechol and 4-methylcatechol. The chemicals obtained from lignin presented promising industrial applications. Repolymerization phenomenon was found to decrease the yields of the proposed lignin revalorization process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The feasibility of co-producing activated carbon and bio-oil from rice stalk through molten salt pyrolysis is reported in this work. The results indicated that: (1) mixed ZnCl2-KCl molten salt could considerably improve the solid and liquid yield as well as the ratio of H2 and CH4 selectively (compared to the traditional ZnCl2 method), (2) an increase of pyrolysis temperature had the same impact on the yield as mixed molten salt, except for a decrease of the liquid yield, which may have a negative effect on the adsorption ability of activated carbon, and (3) the adsorption capability of activated carbon varied significantly with the activation temperature and, to a lesser degree, with the pyrolysis temperature. The conclusion can be drawn that pyrolysis in molten salt is a potential technology for agricultural residue utilization because of its capability of co-production, especially in activated carbon and bio-oil.

AB  - The present work aims to investigate an innovative application of natural clay as a catalyst for biofuel combustion. The mineralogical, chemical, thermal and textural characterizations of the natural clay suggest an intrinsic catalytic potential without any prior treatment. The catalytic performance was studied with respect to the combustion of n-butanol as a representative biofuel using different forms of the natural clay: fine powder, pressed pellets and extruded honeycomb monoliths. No major difference was found among these forms regarding texture, morphology and stability. In terms of performance, this clay proved competitive relative to cobalt oxide spinel, which is one of the most reactive non-noble transition metal oxides. The significant amount of naturally occurring transition metals such as iron and some elements considered as promoters in the clay were proposed to account for the catalytic properties. A systematic investigation of the catalytic performance of the clay as a function of the equivalence ratio and of the total flow rate was performed using gas-phase FTIR spectroscopy. Increase of the equivalence ratio at a fixed flow rate yielded a lower catalytic performance toward n-butanol combustion producing a consequent fraction of carbon monoxide and ethylene. At a constant equivalence ratio of 0.6, the performance of the clay was not affected by increasing the total inlet flow rate up to 30. sccm. These findings may initiate the development of a new catalyst for biofuel combustion based on relatively low-cost and abundantly available raw materials such as the natural clay investigated here. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The ionic liquid (IL) 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C 2OHmim][OAc]) was designed and used to provide a compatible IL-cellulase system in which lignocellulosic biomass can be effectively solubilized and activated, while maintaining the high stability and activity of the cellulase. In this study, we investigated the stability and activity of a commercially available cellulase (optimum pH 4.8) in the presence of different concentrations of a [C 2OHmim][OAc]/buffer solution, using CMC (carboxy-methylcellulose) as substrate. The cellulase retained 87% and 79% of its original activity after being pre-incubated in 15% (pH = 5.79) and 20% (pH = 6.0) (w/v) IL solutions at 50°C for 1.5 h, respectively. Similar results obtained for both the IL and traditional buffer solutions led us to conclude that the reduction in the enzymatic activity may have been caused by the deviation of the solutions' pH from the optimum pH for cellulase; the IL showed improved enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose compared with the traditional buffer solution. The cellulases also retained high activity in [C 2OHmim] [OAc] (15%) to hydrolyze MCC (microcrystalline cellulose), a model substrate for cellulase analysis, with a conversion efficiency of approximately 99.67%. Using this IL-cellulase system, the saccharification of straw, cotton and filter paper, which have different compositions of cellulose, hemicellulose and ligin, was also significantly improved during the first hour of enzymatic hydrolysis. The IL can be separated from the reducing sugar using affinity solvent extraction, and can then be reused. Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that [C 2OHmim][OAc] was compatible with the cellulase, and this compatible IL-cellulase system is promising for the efficient activation and hydrolysis of native biomass to produce biofuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

AB  - This study examines the heating value and combustion efficiency of organic sludge derived fuel, spent activated carbon derived fuel, and derived fuel from a mixture of organic sludge and spent activated carbon. Spent activated carbon was sampled from an air pollution control device of an incinerator and characterized by XRD, XRF, TG/DTA, and SEM. The spent activated carbon was washed with deionized water and solvent (1. N sulfuric acid) and then processed by the organic sludge derived fuel manufacturing process. After washing, the salt (chloride) and sulfide content could be reduced to 99% and 97%, respectively; in addition the carbon content and heating value were increased. Different ratios of spent activated carbon have been applied to the organic sludge derived fuel to reduce the NO. x emission of the combustion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The renovation of biomass waste in the form of date seed waste into activated carbon and biofuel by fixed bed pyrolysis reactor has been focused in this study to obtain gaseous, liquid, and solid products. The date seed in particle form is pyrolysed in an externally heated fixed bed reactor with nitrogen as the carrier gas. The reactor is heated from 400°C to 600°C. A maximum liquid yield of 50wt%. and char of 30wt%. are obtained at a reactor bed temperature of 500°C with a running time of 120 minutes. The oil is found to possess favorable flash point and reasonable density and viscosity. The higher calorific value is found to be 28.636MJ/kg which is significantly higher than other biomass derived. Decolonization of 85-97% is recorded for the textile effluent and 75-90% for the tannery effluent, in all cases decreasing with temperature increase. Good adsorption capacity of the prepared activated carbon in case of diluted textile and tannery effluent was found. © 2012 Mohammad Uzzal Hossain Joardder et al.

AB  - In 2005 the government of India declared its policy for development of biofuels. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy Sources of India has identified around 400 oil seed species available in the forests of India, which can be used for various applications including that as biofuels. Due to lack of detailed studies and non-availability of mechanism for the collections of these oilseeds, this source has remained largely untapped. The National Oilseed and Vegetable Oil Development Board (NOVOD) is working on strategies to promote studies and for establishing mechanisms for collection. These biofuels can be effectively used to meet some or all of the energy needs of remote un-electrified villages. This can be achieved by generating electricity at village level, in a decentralized manner by using small capacity generator sets running on biodiesel derived from locally available oils. In this case it will be essential to find techniques for utilization of non-edible de-oiled seedcake obtained as the byproduct of this process. Using the seedcake for biogas generation by anaerobic digestion process is a promising option. Mahua (. Madhuca indica) is a specie naturally available with high tree density in most parts of India. In addition one less familiar oil seed specie available in central India is Hingan (Balanites aegyaptiaca). The paper investigates the suitability of de-oiled cakes of these two oilseeds for biogas generation. This investigation reveals that both the seedcakes have a mean biogas generation potential in the range of 198 to 233 l/kg of seedcake. The biogas generated from these sources could make a significant contribution to cooking energy demand in rural areas. The paper also highlights the fact that the sludge and the slurry coming out of the reactor as waste have very high manurial value by virtue of its high nitrogen content and a good amount of other secondary and tertiary nutrients. © 2012 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Acid catalysts were prepared by sulfonation of carbon materials obtained from the pyrolysis of sugar beet molasses, a cheap, viscous byproduct in the processing of sugar beets into sugar. Conditions for the pyrolysis of molasses (temperature and time) influenced catalyst performance; the best combination came from pyrolysis at low temperature (420°C) for a relatively long time (8-15a H), which ensured better stability of the final material. The most effective molasses catalyst was highly active in the esterification of fatty acids with methanol (100% yield after 3a H) and more active than common solid acidic catalysts in the transesterification of vegetable oils with 25-75 wt% of acid content (55-96% yield after 8a H). A tandem process using a solid acid molasses catalyst and potassium hydroxide in methanol was developed to de-acidificate and transesterificate algal oils from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Nannochloropsis gaditana, and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, which contain high amounts of free fatty acids. The amount of catalyst required for the de-acidification step was influenced by the chemical composition of the algal oil, thus operational conditions were determined not only in relation to free fatty acids content in the oil, but according to the composition of the lipid extract of each algal species.

AB  - The exploitation of renewable resources for the production of biofuels relies on efficient processes for the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. The development of enzymes and strains for these processes requires reliable and fast activity-based screening assays. Additionally, these assays are also required to operate on the microscale and on the high-throughput level. Herein, we report the development of a highly sensitive reducing-sugar assay in a 96-well microplate screening format. The assay is based on the formation of osazones from reducing sugars and para-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide. By using this sensitive assay, the enzyme loads and conversion times during lignocellulose hydrolysis can be reduced, thus allowing higher throughput. The assay is about five times more sensitive than the widely applied dinitrosalicylic acid based assay and can reliably detect reducing sugars down to 10 μM. The assay-specific variation over one microplate was determined for three different lignocellulolytic enzymes and ranges from 2 to 8%. Furthermore, the assay was combined with a microscale cultivation procedure for the activity-based screening of Pichia pastoris strains expressing functional Thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase A, Trichoderma reesei β-mannanase, or T. reesei cellobiohydrolase 2. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Scarcity and non-renewable nature of petroleum based liquid fuels have made them an un-reliable source of energy. Excessive greenhouse gas emissions and the associated effects on global warming have become noteworthy environmental, economic and social threats. In this milieu, the development of renewable, carbonneutral and sustainable alternative energy sources has become inevitable. Biofuels have been found a promising alternative and a driving force for modern world. Different feed-stocks have been evaluated for biofuels production to date but microalgae have been found the most attractive due to their higher growth productivity, higher lipid contents, non-competitive nature with human food and their ability to grow on non-arable land using brackish or waste water. However, there are a number of technological barriers that are still questioning the economic feasibility and competitiveness of such biofuels. On the other hand, there are also a number of trade opportunities if we pay attention to the use of integrated system following the bio-refinery concept. Bio-refinery concept reflects the production of value added by-products along with the biofuels, contributing to an overall escalation of the economic feasibility of the whole system. These types of systems may help to progress the competitiveness of biodiesel production using microalgae as a potential feedstock. This paper reviews the most recent and relevant information on such integrated systems. Several aspects related to the treatment of municipal and animal wastewater with simultaneous recovery of microalgae and the potential of biodiesel production are discussed. Bio-refinery concept also presenting new opportunities for the cost-effective production of biodiesel coupled with valuable non-fuel by-products.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the technological feasibility and economic viability of producing liquid fuels from biomass via thermo-chemical route. We initially present laboratory scale production results for synthesizing liquid fuels using syngas derived from biomass. The experiments showed that excellent yield of middle distillate products can be obtained from the bio-derived syngas, but it required supplementing the syngas with hydrogen due to low H2/CO ratio. The results from bench-scale liquefaction unit served as the basis for subsequent modeling and simulation of a biomass to liquid production facility which in turn is used for a preliminary economic analysis of a commercial scale facility using this technology.Two different technologies are compared; one using biomass as the sole feedstock (BTL), while the other augmented biomass derived syngas with hydrogen using the reforming process (BGTL). The idea of co-processing was suggested due to (i) hydrogen deficiency in the biomass feedstock, and, (ii) lower cost of natural gas which is rich in hydrogen. The basis for the design was 2000 metric tons of dry biomass fed per day. We did not include CO2 capture and storage in this study. However, when co-processing was employed, there was significant reduction in CO2 emissions and carbon capture from the biomass increased. A conceptual process capable of 100% feedstock carbon capture is also presented. The breakeven cost of oil (BECOP) was estimated to be $124/bbl for the BTL plant versus $95/bbl for a natural gas assisted BGTL plant using current market prices for raw material and capital equipment. With the increased availability, and falling prices of natural gas, augmentation with natural gas can provide a bridge solution in short term for an economical biomass to liquid fuel technology. © 2013 .

AB  - A method of ultrasound-assisted reduction of a nickel-ammonia complex with borohydride in aqueous solution was used to prepare NiMoB/MCM-41 and NiMoB/SBA-15 supported amorphous alloy catalysts. These catalysts were used to upgrade bio-oil at mild temperatures ranging from 100 to 160°C and recycling of these two supported catalysts and of unsupported NiMoB was carried out. Then, fresh and third time used catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative results were obtained from the analysis of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Through mild upgrading, 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, furfural, and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol in the bio-oil were converted to relevant alcohols and saturated phenols. The conversion rates were 45.7, 71.5, and 57.1%, respectively, when crude bio-oil was upgraded using NiMoB/MCM-41 at 160°C. The two supported catalysts, especially NiMoB/MCM-41, had smaller amorphous NiMoB particles and exhibited more uniform dispersion on mesoporous silica, leading to higher reaction activity and stability than unsupported NiMoB. Deactivation of these catalysts resulted from the reduction of Ni0, B0, and Mo4+ species on the surface, the transition from the amorphous to the crystalline state, particle agglomeration, and coke deposition on the surface. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - Microalgae are a promising biofuels feedstock, theoretically yielding concentrations of triacylglycerides (TAGs) per unit area that are far higher than traditional feedstocks due to their rapid growth. Dunaliella is particularly advantageous as a feedstock because it is currently commercially mass cultured, thrives in salt water, and has no cell wall. Fourteen strains of Dunaliella have been investigated for growth rates and lipid production in mass culture and tested for enhanced lipid production under a range of environmental stressors including salinity, pH, nitrogen and phosphorus limitation, and light regime. The nuclear genome has been sequenced for four of these strains, with the objective of increasing carbon flux through genetic engineering. Electroflocculation followed by osmotic membrane rupturing may be a very energy and cost efficient means of harvesting the lipid bodies from Dunaliella. A technically feasible and scalable thermo-catalytic process to convert the lipids into replacements for liquid transportation fuels has been developed. The lipids were converted into long-chain alkanes through continuous thermal hydrolysis followed by fed-batch thermo-catalytic decarboxylation. These alkanes can be reformed into renewable diesel via conventional catalytic hydrocarbon isomerization reactions to improve cold flow properties, if desired. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 916-925, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz in the last few years is garnering a lot of attention as a biofuel and as raw material for the chemical industry due to its high oil productivity. However the high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids of camelina oil (over 50%), which is rich in linolenic acid (37-40%) limits its commercial value and large-scale production. To improve the oil quality and its oxidative stability the methyl esters have been selectively hydrogenated using a non-toxic and non-pyrophoric heterogeneous copper catalyst (Cu/SiO2 or Cu/Al2O3). Our results showed that both catalysts are able to reduce the linolenic acid content below 1% while selectively increasing the monounsaturated one. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Five regions of Ethiopia were identified as potential sites for the algal biomass cultivation considering both sunlight and local climatic conditions. The meteorological data, sunlight and air temperature information for the identified potential sites were used as a basis to estimate annual biomass production, lipid production and carbon sequestration potential. An average upper biomass, oil yield and carbon fixation potential were calculated to be 291.6 ton/ha/yr, 101,249.2 L/ha/yr. and 82.7 tonCO2/ha/yr. This study provides a baseline data for theoretical estimates of open pond microalgae production systems in Ethiopia. This study will support the Ethiopian government in its Energy and Food Security policy to promote the use of indigenous and renewable sources of energy for transportation fuels and income generation.

AB  - Hexokinase 2 (Hxk2p) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a bi-functional enzyme being both a catalyst and an important regulator in the glucose repression signal. In the presence of xylose Hxk2p is irreversibly inactivated through an autophosphorylation mechanism, affecting all functions. Consequently, the regulation of genes involved in sugar transport and fermentative metabolism is impaired. The aim of the study was to obtain new Hxk2p-variants, immune to the autophosphorylation, which potentially can restore the repressive capability closer to its nominal level. In this study we constructed the first condensed, rationally designed combinatorial library targeting the active-site in Hxk2p. We combined protein engineering and genetic engineering for efficient screening and identified a variant with Phe159 changed to tyrosine. This variant had 64% higher catalytic activity in the presence of xylose compared to the wild-type and is expected to be a key component for increasing the productivity of recombinant xylose-fermenting strains for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstocks. © 2013 Bergdahl et al.

AB  - The efficient localization of increased levels of active enzymes onto conducting scaffolds is important for the development of enzyme-based biofuel cells. Cross-linked enzyme clusters (CEC) of glucose oxidase (GOx) constrained to functionalized carbon nanotubes (CEC-CNTs) were generated in order to evaluate the potential of using CECs for developing GOx-based bioanodes functioning via direct electron transfer from the GOx active site to the CNT scaffold. CEC-CNTs generated from several weight-to-weight ratios of GOx:CNT were examined for comparable catalytic activity to free GOx into the solution, with CEC-CNTs generated from a 100% GOx solution displaying the greatest enzymatic activity. Scanning transmission electron microscopic analysis of CEC-CNTs generated from 100% GOx to CNT (wt/wt) ratios revealed that CEC clusters of ∼78 μm2 localized to the CNT surface. Electrochemical analysis indicates that the enzyme is engaged in direct electron transfer, and biofuel cells generated using GOx CEC-CNT bioanodes were observed to have a peak power density of ∼180 μW cm-2. These data indicate that the generation of nano-to-micro-sized active enzyme clusters is an attractive option for the design of enzyme-specific biofuel cell powered implantable devices. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - An analytical platform was developed for the detection of biomass oxygenates and biocarbon in biogasoline produced by coprocessing of hydrodeoxygenated pyrolysis oils (HDO-oil) and vacuum gas oil. A combination of different analytical techniques is necessary for analyzing such complex mixtures. The presence of various oxygenated compounds such as alcohols, acids, and phenols was quantified using phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Different alkylphenols were identified using two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The transformations of lignin oligomers present in HDO-oil were determined with size-exclusion chromatography carried out for the products. Accelerator mass spectrometry was used to make the distinction between carbonaceous material of biological origin and that of fossil origin. This type of analytical platform, which is tailored for bio-oil identification and quantification, appears to be required for exploratory catalyst research and kinetic studies in this rapidly expanding domain. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Transformation of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels involves multiple processes, in which thermal decomposition, hydrotreatment are the most central steps. Current work focuses on the impact of several solid acids and Keggin-type heteropolyacids on the decomposition temperature (Td) of pine wood and the characterization of the resulted products. It has been observed that a mechanical mixture of solid acids with pine wood has no influence on Td, while the use of heteropolyacids lower the Td by 100°C. Moreover, the treatment of biomass with a catalytic amount of H3PW12O40 leads to formation of three fractions: solid, liquid and gas, which have been investigated by elemental analysis, TGA, FTIR, GC-MS and NMR. The use of heteropolyacid leads, at 300°C, to a selective transformation of more than 50wt.% of the holocellulose part of the lignocellulosic biomass. Moreover, 60wt.% of the catalyst H3PW12O40 are recovered. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The focus of this study was the reuse of red algal ethanol fermentation residue as feedstock for anaerobic digestion. Levulinic acid and formic acid, the dilute-acid hydrolysis byproducts, inhibited methanogenesis at concentrations over 3.0 and 0.5. g/L, respectively. However, the inhibition was overcome by increasing inoculum concentration. A series of batch experiments with the fermentation residue showed increased methane yield and productivity at higher inoculum concentration. The maximum methane conversion rate of 84.8% was found at 5. g COD/L of fermentation residue at 0.25. g COD/g VSS of food-to-microorganism (F/M) ratio. The red algal ethanol fermentation residue can possibly be used as a feedstock in anaerobic digestion at appropriate concentration and F/M ratio. © 2013.

AB  - Branches from three transgenic poplar lines and their wild type line 107 were used to study the effect of lignocellulosic composition and structure on the production of glucose and ethanol. Experimental results showed that the transgenic line 18-1 had the high cellulose content and amorphous fibril structure. After poplar meals were pretreated with 10% NaOH and a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid, their lateral order index decreased significantly. The highest glucose yield in enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol yield from the substrate of 18-1 was much higher than that from feedstock of 107 by 192.7% and 108.7%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed that lignocellulose from the 18-1 could be destroyed by chemicals more easily than those from other lines. These results demonstrated that changing lignocellulose structure could be more effective on improving the digestibility and enzymatic hydrolysis of poplar biomass than increasing the cellulose content in biomass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A simple nonenzymatic electrochemical protocol is proposed for the oxidation of aliphatic alcohols using formed N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) radical cation on the graphene nanosheets/l-cysteine/cadmium telluride quantum dot (QD) nanocomposite (GNs/Cys/CdTe) modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode. At first, graphene oxide (GO) is chemically synthesized from graphite after which Cys is covalently functionalized to GO through formation of amide bonds between carboxylic acid groups of GO and amine groups of Cys. The resulting GNs/Cys is used as a capping agent to synthesize CdTe QD nanoparticles. After the characterization of the as-made nanocomposite which confirmed the successful attachment of CdTe nanoparticles to the GNs, the ability of the GNs/Cys/CdTe modified GC electrode toward the nonenzymatic ethanol electrooxidation is examined in the presence of NHS as an effective mediating system. Our results revealed that the proposed system possess a good activity to NHS electrooxidation and subsequently, ethanol oxidation. Moreover, the GNs/Cys/CdTe modified electrode displayed a significant photoelectrocatalytic activity toward the ethanol oxidation upon illumination by visible light. The photoactive GNs/Cys/CdTe nanohybrid presented here showing favorable photoelectrochemical features for nonenzymatic aliphatic alcohols oxidation may hold great promise to the development of electrochemical sensors and biofuel cells. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of ethanol concentration gradients along with varied cultivation times on lipid and fatty acid accumulation and composition of Scenedesmus sp. were studied. The maximum increment of algal density, lipid productivity, lipid content and fatty acid content were 6.61, 11.75, 1.34 and 3.14 times higher than the control group under 12h photoperiod. Algal light deprivation inhibited ethanol positive effects on algal growth and lipid biomass. The cumulative quantity of C16:0 and C18:0 decreased correspondingly with the increase of ethanol concentrations and cultivation times. Besides, unsaturated fatty acids appeared early in algal cells and increased 57.02% in maximum. However, only 2.27% 14C was transferred from ethanol to fatty acids. The results indicated that adding proper amount of ethanol in algal culture medium was beneficial to biodiesel feedstock production and biodiesel properties. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study has demonstrated that microcapsules can be used as a microreactor for the transesterification of rapeseed oil with calcium oxide (CaO) base catalyst. CaO-loaded microcapsules were prepared by coextrusion technique, and the transesterification reaction was carried out by adding methanol into the prepared microcapsules and oil in a batch-type reactor. Results showed that the microcapsules system could promote the transesterification and hinder the dissolution of the catalyst, in contrast to a biodiesel production with CaO particles. The optimal conditions for methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst content in the microcapsules and reaction temperature were found to be 8:1, 20. wt.%, and 65. °C, respectively. The results of reusability tests showed that CaO-loaded microcapsules could be successfully reused for three times without loss of the catalytic activity. It was concluded from these results that microcapsules have the potential to improve the performance of solid base catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is important to develop a renewable source of energy to overcome a limited source fossil energy. Palm oil is a potential alternative and environmental friendly energy resource in Indonesia due to high production capacity of this vegetable oil. The research studied effect of catalyst to selectivity of biofuel product from cracking of palm oil. The catalyst consisted of HZSM-5 catalyst with or without impregnation. The research was conducted in two steps, namely catalyst synthesized and catalytic cracking process. HZSM-5 was synthesized using Plank methods. The characterization of the synthesized catalysts used AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy) and BET (Brunaueur Emmet Teller). The cracking was carried out in a fixed bed microreactor with diameter of 1 cm and length of 16 cm which was filled with 0.6 gram catalyst. The Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst was recommended for cracking palm oil for the high selectivity to gasoline. © 2013 BCREC UNDIP.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters derived from renewable sources such as vegetable oils has gained importance nowadays as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. The present study is aimed to produce biodiesel from non-edible oil (Karanja oil of Indian origin) both in batch and continuous reactors. The purpose of the study is the comparison of Karanja biodiesel production with different reactor types under variable reaction characteristics. Therefore, two types of continuous reactors were used: helical tube reactor and reactive distillation (RD) column. Experiments were carried out to obtain suitable operating parameters in batch-and continuous-flow reactors. For batch reactor, suitable operating conditions obtained are: 7:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 0.8% (by weight of oil) catalyst (KOH), 65C reaction temperature, and 1-h reaction time, at which the maximum yield obtained is 96%. In continuous helical tube reactor, maximum yield of 92.6% was obtained at 6.6 mL/min of flow rate at the same operating conditions of batch reactor. In continuous RD column, maximum yield of biodiesel 96.6% was obtained at the same operating conditions except methanol-to-oil molar ratio (5:1) because of recycling of methanol into the column. The residence times in the helical tube reactor and RD column were 4 and 8 min, respectively, as compared to 1 h in the batch reactor for almost the same yield. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This work showed that sewage sludge could be a strong candidate for biodiesel production. High lipid content (18-20%) with C16-18-carbon range was experimentally identified and measured. These lipids from sewage sludge were converted into biodiesel via the transesterification reaction with MgO-CaO/Al2O3 derived from magnesium slag, and biodiesel conversion was ~98%. The experimental work enabled explaining that temperature is the main driving force for the transesterification reaction, which can be enhanced in the presence of CO2. This also enables combination of esterification of free fatty acids and transesterification of triglycerides into a single process within 1min in the temperature range of 350-500°C. Sewage sludge residue after extracting lipids was also a good feedstock for recovering energy via thermo-chemical processes. The impact of CO2 co-feed on the pyrolysis/gasification process of SS residue was also investigated in this work. The CO2 injected into the thermo-chemical process remarkably increased the generation of CO by a factor of 2. Moreover, the introduction of CO2 into the pyrolysis/gasification process enabled reducing condensable hydrocarbons (tar) by expediting cracking; thus, utilizing CO2 as chemical feedstock for the gasification process not only leads to higher thermal efficiency but also has environmental benefits. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The limited supply of traditional fossil based fuels, and increased concern about their environmental impact has driven the interest in the utilization of biomass based energy sources, including those that are underutilized or otherwise nuisance species such as Chinese tallow trees (Triadica sebifera [L.]). This species is a prolific seeds producer, and this paper shows that they contain more than 50% lipids by mass that are suitable for conversion into biodiesel. We present here, for the first time, the seeds' thermophysical properties important for biofuel production. The seeds were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and ultimate analysis; their thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat were determined. The characterization results were correlated to fatty acid composition and lipid content for whole seeds and individual layers, as well as to the protein, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin content. The TGA analysis indicated the presence, in addition to lipids, of hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and proteins, depending on the layer analyzed. Thermal conductivity and specific heat were, respectively 0.14 ± 0.007 W/mK and 3843.5 ± 171.16 J/kgK for wax, 0.20 ± 0.002 W/mK and 2018.7 ± 5.18 J/kgK for shells, 0.13 ± 0.0 W/mK and 1237 ± 3.15 J/kgK for internal kernel, and 0.13 ± 0.000 W/mK and 2833.9 ± 104.11 J/kgK for whole seeds. These properties and characterization method can be further used in engineering analysis used to determine the most optimum processing method for production of biofuels from this feedstock. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ether (FAME) is a green biofuel that can be used as an alternative fuel to replace conventional petroleum. A novel solid base catalyst, CsF/CaO, was used to catalyze the transesterification of soybean oil to produce FAME. This catalyst showed strong basicity, resulting in high reactivity on transesterification. With an 8% catalyst dosage, 12:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil and 1% water content in oil, the FAME yield reached 98% at 65 °C in 1 h. Moreover, the catalyst also exhibited high resistance to water, which allowed more flexibility for biodiesel mass production. The transesterification of soybean oil followed a second-order reversible kinetic rate equation. The forward reaction rate constants and apparent activation energy were evaluated. Comparisons with the experimental data indicated that the kinetic model was suitable for predicting the yield of FAME. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

Apart from the search for alternatives, there is a need to achieve energy independence, directing much focus on biofuels. Biodiesel is simple to use, biodegradable, nontoxic, and essentially free of sulfur and aromatics. Oil was extracted from the seeds of Blighia unijugata and Luffa cylindrica, subjected to chemical characterization and biodiesel production. The oil yield from the seed of B. unijugata was 50. 82 ± 1. 20% while that of L. cylindrica was 39. 10 ± 0. 20%. The biodiesel produced had ester content above 98%. The flash point of the biodiesel from B. unijugata and L. cylindrica was above 120°C while the phosphorus content was also below 1 ppm in both cases. The oxidative stability of B. unijugata was 44. 30 ± 0. 30 h, while that of L. cylindrica was lower than this value due to its high unsaturation. The copper strip corrosion value of the biodiesel was also found to be 1A. This study showed that the high free fatty acid content of B. unijugata and L. cylindrica seed oil can be reduced in a one-step pretreatment of esterification reaction using H 2SO 4 as catalyst thus reducing the problem of soap formation encountered when using oil with high free fatty acid for the production of biodiesel. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) has a high content of free fatty acids and has been used extensively as a feedstock in biodiesel production. In the present study, the transesterification reaction of JCO to Jatropha curcas methyl ester (biodiesel) was performed in a continuous pulsed loop reactor under atmospheric conditions. The JCO was pre-treated prior to the reaction to reduce the free fatty acid content to below 1% (w/w). The operating parameters of the loop reactor were optimised based on the conversion of the JCO to Jatropha curcas biodiesel and included reaction temperature, molar ratio of oil to MeOH, reaction time and oscillation frequency. The findings show that the highest reaction conversion of 99.7% (w/w) was achieved using KOH catalyst and 98.8% conversion was obtained using NaOCH 3 catalyst. The optimal operating conditions were a molar ratio of 6:1, an oscillation frequency of 6Hz, temperature of 60°C, feedstock FFA content of 0.5% (w/w) and only 10min of reaction time. As a commercial commodity, the physical properties of biodiesel were analysed, and they compared well with the characteristics of fossil-based diesel fuel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, microalgae were cultured under indoor and outdoor systems with high density and biomass. Their chemical analysis showed high lipid (28.2 and 21.6% respectively) and fatty acid methylesters (FAME) content. Fatty acids such as palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2) were reported to be high in C. marina and S. costatum. S. costatum is containing more eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Marine diatom, S. costatum is efficiently converting the algal oil into biodiesel (87%) followed by C. marina which is produced the 70% of the biodiesel. Biodiesel yield of presently studied marine microalgae was being comparatively higher than that of existing oil crops. It is clearly implied that, marine microalgae C. marina and S. costatum were considered as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production in near future.

AB  - Use of advanced microwave technology for biodiesel production from vegetable oil is a relatively new technology. Microwave dielectric heating increases the process efficiency and reduces reaction time. Microwave heating depends on various factors such as material properties (dielectric and thermo-physical), frequency of operation and system design. Although lab scale results are promising, it is important to study these parameters and optimize the process before scaling up. Numerical modeling approach can be applied for predicting heating and temperature profiles including at larger scale. The process can be studied for optimization without actually performing the experiments, reducing the amount of experimental work required. A basic numerical model of continuous electromagnetic heating of biodiesel precursors was developed. A finite element model was built using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2 software by coupling the electromagnetic problem with the fluid flow and heat transfer problem. Chemical reaction was not taken into account. Material dielectric properties were obtained experimentally, while the thermal properties were obtained from the literature (all the properties were temperature dependent). The model was tested for the two different power levels 4000 W and 4700 W at a constant flow rate of 840ml/min. The electric field, electromagnetic power density flow and temperature profiles were studied. Resulting temperature profiles were validated by comparing to the temperatures obtained at specific locations from the experiment. The results obtained were in good agreement with the experimental data.

AB  - A series of modified Zr–Mo oxide-based solid-acid catalysts were prepared by using the corresponding chlorides as oxide precursors and low-cost monofunctional carboxylic acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, and lauric acid as modifiers. The catalysts were characterized by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nitrogen adsorption–desorption. It was demonstrated that the modified catalysts possessed grainy structures and loose honeycombed surfaces that exhibit high acid intensity and surface area. In particular, Zr–Mo oxide modified with stearic acid showed the best catalytic performance for the esterification of oleic acid with methanol in comparison to other mixed metal oxides, and it was selected for further experimental studies. Under the optimal reaction conditions of molar ratio of 10:1 methanol/oleic acid, 4 wt % of catalyst loading, 2 h reaction time, and 180 °C reaction temperature, the conversion of oleic acid reached 94.2 %. Moreover, the employed solid-acid catalysts could also facilitate carbohydrate transformation, and could be easily separated from the reaction system and reused over at least six runs without significant loss of activity.

AB  - Nigeria's Biofuels Policy introduced in 2007 mandates a 10% blend (E10) of bioethanol with gasoline. This study investigates the potential for the development of a cellulosic ethanol industry based on the availability of agricultural residues and models the number of commercial processing facilities that could be sited in the six Geo-political zones. The potential for cellulosic ethanol production from agricultural residues in Nigeria is 7556km3 per annum exceeding the mandate of 10% renewable fuel required and providing the potential for 12 large- and 11 medium-scale processing facilities based on the use of a single feedstock. Cassava and yam peelings provided in excess of 80% of the process residues available with enough feedstock to supply 10 large-scale facilities with a fairly even distribution across the zones. Sorghum straw, millet straw and maize stalks represented 75% of the potential resource available from field residues with the potential to supply 2 large- and 7 medium-scale processing facilities, all of which would be located in the north of the country. When a multi-feedstock approach is used, this provides the potential for either 29 large- or 58 medium-scale facilities based on outputs of 250 and 125km3 per annum respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research aims to overcome kinetics, ohmic and mass transport limitations by improving the nanoarchitectured design of the catalytic layer and the mass transport system in order to improve the current output and stability of the bioanode. Carbon nanostructured material, the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNTs) paper (buckeye paper (BEP)), and the polymeric structure of chitosan-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) mixture are integrated in the design. Integration of these nanostructured materials with various enzymes-alcohol, lactate and glucose dehydrogenases (ADH, LDH and GDH respectively)-was performed and analyzed. Polymethylene green (PMG) is used as a catalyst toward the oxidation of NADH to NAD+. The GDH-based anodic interface showed the best performance in the static electrolytic cell as well as in the quasi-2D flow-fan cell. Michaelis-Menten analysis on the GDH-based bioanode showed an I Max = 3.382 ±0.180 mA.cm∼2 and KM = 17.5 ±3.1 mM compared to IMax = 226.6 ± 10.1 μA.cm∼2 and KM = 16.0 ± 2.5 mM for ADH and, IMax = 53.4 ± 5.1 μA.cm∼2 and KM = 6.6 ± 3.3 mM for LDH respectively (electrolytic cell). Stability studies showed the GDH- bioanode conserved ∼80% of its initial performance at 15 days and ∼65% at 30 days of dry storage at 4°C. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - Efficient cleaning and conditioning of biomass derived syngas for use in fuel synthesis continues to be a significant technical barrier to commercialising biofuels. The relative effectiveness of a range of nickel and rhodium containing catalysts for the conversion of model tar compounds (toluene and naphthalene or benzene) in a simulated bio-syngas stream containing up to 100 ppm H2S and up to 5 vol.% CH4 at temperatures from 700 to 900 C were assessed at JMTC. Though H2S was found to significantly reduce hydrocarbon conversion near complete conversion of methane and tar could be achieved on a Rh based catalyst at 900 C with a very high GHSV of 150,000 h-1. At more realistic GHSV of 60,000 h-1 and higher methane levels (5 vol.%) the effect of H2S concentration on catalyst activity followed an apparent linear activity decay law. Furthermore, the H2S deactivation was fully reversible and could be attributed to a transient site-blocking mechanism (TSB). Selected catalysts were also evaluated at NREL for tar and methane conversions using oak modelled syngas. The best Ni and best Rh catalyst were then tested under real conditions using oak derived syngas from NREL's pilot scale gasification unit. Rh based catalysts gave significantly better hydrocarbon conversion than the Ni catalysts at comparable conditions. The best Rh catalyst demonstrated 200 h of steady state methane conversion of 95% with little apparent loss of activity using oak modelled syngas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background:As a by product of higher value cotton fibre, cotton seed has been increasingly recognised to have excellent potential as a source of additional food, feed, biofuel stock and even a renewable platform for the production of many diverse biological molecules for agriculture and industrial enterprises. The large size difference between cotyledon and embryo axis that make up a cotton seed results in the under-representation of embryo axis gene transcript levels in whole seed embryo samples. Therefore, the determination of gene transcript levels in the cotyledons and embryo axes separately should lead to a better understanding of metabolism in these two developmentally diverse tissues.Results:A comparative study of transcriptome changes between cotton developing cotyledon and embryo axis has been carried out. 17,384 unigenes (20.74% of all the unigenes) were differentially expressed in the two adjacent embryo tissues, and among them, 7,727 unigenes (44.45%) were down-regulated and 9,657 unigenes (55.55%) were up-regulated in cotyledon.Conclusions:Our study has provided a comprehensive dataset that documents the dynamics of the transcriptome at the mid-maturity of cotton seed development and in discrete seed tissues, including embryo axis and cotyledon tissues. The results showed that cotton seed is subject to many transcriptome variations in these two tissue types and the differential gene expression between cotton embryo axis and cotyledon uncovered in our study should provide an important starting point for understanding how gene activity is coordinated during seed development to make a seed. Further, the identification of genes involved in rapid metabolite accumulation stage of seed development will extend our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events in these developmental processes and provide a foundation for future studies on the metabolism, embryo differentiation of cotton and other dicot oilseed crops. © 2013 Jiao et al.

AB  - Fatty nitriles have lately become of interest in the frame of biofuels or for the valorization of the oil part of biomass as fine chemicals such as polymers. The production of long-chain fatty nitriles by direct reaction of esters with ammonia has however not been academically extensively studied, although several catalysts were developed and published in patents. Acid-base features are implicitly considered as leading the catalysis of this reaction, but no direct correlation was investigated with any nature or number of acidic or basic sites. The present study aims at understanding which sites are responsible of this reaction and thus how to design better catalysts. Strong acidity correlates at 300 C for ester conversion and nitrile yield, suggesting a common nature of the reaction among all kinds of catalysts. An upper strength limit, over which undesirable side-products appear, was evaluated, and the factors influencing the production of N-methyl amide were analyzed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are sustainable fuels produced from modern biomass such as plants and algae. Biodiesel has high lubricity and ultra-low sulfur content. Biodiesel is produced from vegetable oil by transesterification. Actually, practical biodiesel production is limited by the low reaction rate of transesterification of vegetable oil with methanol catalyzed by CaO. Here we designed an efficient catalyst: benzyl bromide-modified CaO. Using benzyl bromide-modified CaO, we obtained a 99.2 % yield of fatty acid methyl esters in 3 h, compared with 35.3 % yield using commercial CaO under the same reaction conditions. The improved catalytic activity is explained by better fat diffusion to the surface of the benzyl bromide-modified CaO. The novelty of our findings is the much higher yield of our method compared to literature data on heterogeneous catalysis. In addition, the lifetime of our catalyst is excellent. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the two-step acid base homogenous catalyzed transesterification of olive pomace oil, with the ultimate purpose of producing biodiesel under mild reaction conditions by optimizing the process. Optimization of the experimental procedure was conducted by a factorial design of 23 under the acidic pretreatment step and during the basic transesterification. The optimal production of methyl esters (97.8%) was achieved for the experimental conditions H2SO4=20 wt%/CH3OH=35:1/T=40°C and KOH=0.6+ fatty acid value /CH3OH=9:1/ T=60°C, in the acidic and basic stage of the process, respectively. Finally, to properly assess the quality of the biofuel produced, it was tested for all the European Standard properties. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In this study, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) were produced from four different vegetable oils (sunflower, cotton seed, olive oil, and used frying oil) using calcium ethoxide as a heterogeneous solid base catalyst. The ester preparation involved a two-step transesterification reaction, followed by purification. The effects of the mass ratio of catalyst to oil, the molar ratio of ethanol to oil, and the reaction temperature were studied on conversion of sunflower oil to optimize the reaction conditions in both stages. The rest of the vegetable oils were converted to ethyl esters under optimum reaction parameters. The optimal conditions for first stage transterification were an ethanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, catalyst amount (3.5%), and 80°C temperature, whereas the maximum yield of ethyl esters reached 80.5%. In the second stage, the yield of ethyl esters showed signs of improvement of 16% in relation with the one-stage transesterification, which was obtained under the following optimal conditions: catalyst concentration 0.75% and ethanol/oil molar ratio 6:1. Property analysis of prepared ethyl ester samples was done, in order to examine their quality parameters. The results obtained showed that the density, viscosity, and calorific value of the produced ethyl esters had values close to those of a no. 2 diesel. On the contrary, the cold filter plugging points were higher than the conventional diesel fuel. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The treatment of wastewater derived from a biodiesel fuel (BDF) production plant with alkali-catalyzed transesterification was studied at full scale. The investigated wastewater treatment plant consisted of the following phases: primary adsorption/coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation processes, biological treatment with the combination of trickling filter and activated sludge systems, secondary flocculation/sedimentation processes, and reverse osmosis (RO) system with spiral membranes. All the processes were developed in a continuous mode, while the RO experiment was performed with batch tests. Two types of BDF wastewater were considered: the first wastewater (WW1) had an average total chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH and feed flow rate of 10,850.8 mg/L, 5.9 and 2946.7 L/h, respectively, while the second wastewater (WW2) had an average total COD, pH and feed flow rate of 43,898.9 mg/L, 3.3 and 2884.6 L/h, respectively. The obtained results from the continuous tests showed a COD removal percentage of more than 90% for the two types of wastewater considered. The removal of biorefractory COD and salts was obtained with a membrane technology in order to reuse the RO permeate in the factory production cycle. The rejections percentage of soluble COD, chlorides and sulphates were 92.8%, 95.0% and 99.5%, respectively. Because the spiral membranes required a high number of washing cycles, the use of plane membranes was preferable. Finally, the RO reject material should be evaporated using the large amount of inexpensive heat present in this type of industry. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Hydrotreatment catalytic operations are commonly performed industrially by layered molybdenum sulfide promoted by cobalt or nickel in order to remove heteroelements (S, N, O) from fossil fuels and biofuels. Indeed, these heteroelements are responsible of the emission of pollutants when these fuels are used in vehicles. In this respect, previous studies made by our research group have shown that the active phase under steady state conditions is partially carbided while strong bending effects of MoS2 slabs were also observed. However, up to now, the morphology of the resulting Co/MoSxCy carbided catalyst has not been fully characterized. In the present study, for the first time, a chemical reaction between the carbon content of a TEM Cu/C grid and a freshly sulfide Co/MoS2 catalyst was in situ observed at 300°C and 450°C by HRTEM experimental techniques at ~10nm of resolution. Results indicate that bending of MoS2 layers occurred due to carbon addition on MoS2 edge sites, as observed in stabilized catalysts after HDS reaction. Using a silicon grid, only cracks of MoS2 slabs were observed without bending effect confirming the role of structural-carbon in this change of morphology. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to explore the current relationship between industrial design and waste management (WM), a semi-structured interview study was carried out with 25 professionals from WM and designers that have worked with waste. The main aim was to learn about the collaborative work between these two areas and to investigate whether collaboration could help to incorporate material resources into production. The study reveals that designers and WM professionals regard the relation between disciplines in different ways, being more or less centered in their own disciplines. The designers interviewed, however tend to have a wider impression of this relation. This, together with the lack of understanding of the other's role and a fundamental scale difference when dealing with material flows were identified as the main barriers to better and more frequent collaboration. Even though some examples of collaborative work were found, they were not significant enough to have any noticeable effect on the WM system.

AB  - In the present work, non-edible oil source, Jatropha curcas oil was used with base catalyzed methanol and ethanol to produce biodiesel using in situ transesterification assisted by Benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (BTMAOH) as a phase transfer catalyst (PTC). Experimental investigation showed that base catalyzed in situ transesterification reaction rate was enhanced with the use of BTMAOH as a PTC. During the experiment fast formation of biodiesel was observed in relatively shorter time for PTC assisted reaction as compared to the reaction in the absence of PTC. The effect of individual reaction parameters was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). Optimum operating conditions were also found statistically. Weight fractions of 89 ± 0.7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield and 99.4 ± 0.4% fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) yield were produced at optimum reaction condition. The fuel quality of FAME and FAEE was investigated against the fuel quality specification set by ASTM D6751 and EN-14214 standards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although microalgae have potential as a raw material for biodiesel production it is necessary to increase biomass and lipids productivity. One way to achieve this goal is the implementation of mixotrophic cultures and the regulation of carbon/nitrogen ratio. The present work aims to improve the productivity of biomass and lipids in Chlorella vulgaris UTEX 1803 using waste glycerol from biodiesel production (1, 5 and 10% v/v) and sodium acetate (5, 10 and 20 mM) as carbon sources, with modification of the initial concentration of nitrogen (1.02, 1.47 and 2.94 mM de NaNO3). All experiments were performed at 23±1°C, with light-dark cycles of 12:12h during five days. In biomass production, a significant increase was achieved (80% higher that cultures without modification). Lipid productivities were also found 2.83 and 3.5 times greater than control. Results show the possibility of increasing the production of biomass and lipids by applying the carbon/nitrogen ratio, using waste glycerol. This opens up great possibilities for the re-use of this residue, thus increasing the sustainability of the process in general. Also, it has been proved that -due to its low cost- carbon/nitrogen ratio using sodium acetate is an interesting alternative.

AB  - In order to eliminate the expense associated with solvent extraction and oil cleanup, and reduce the processing steps in biodiesel production, reactive extraction has become a focus of research in recent years. In this study, germinated castor seed was used as substrate and catalyst, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was used as acyl acceptor and oil extractant to produce biodiesel. The optimum conditions were as follows: the germination time of castor seed was 72. h, DMC/germinated seed ratio was 12.5. ml/g, reaction temperature was 35. °C, and water content was 2.11%. The biodiesel yield could reach as much as 87.41% under the optimized conditions. This germinated oilseed self-catalyzed reactive extraction can be a promising route for biodiesel production. © 2013.

AB  - N-methyl-2-pyrrolidonium methyl sulfonate, a Brønsted acid ionic liquid, promoted the transesterification of soybean oil with ethanol giving a high quality fatty acid ethyl ester. At the end of the reaction, after distillation of excess of ethanol, spontaneous phase separation took place. While the clear upper phase corresponded to the ethyl ester, the lower phase was composed of a mixture of glycerol byproduct and the catalyst. By addition of a stoichiometric amount of appropriated reagents to the resulting mixture, a new ionic liquid-catalyzed process allows the conversion of the glycerol into less polar derivatives, and consequent migration to the ethyl esters phase. This work demonstrated that emulsion, phase separation and contamination problems were completely avoided and the glycerol could be incorporated into the biodiesel as additives in a single step. The whole process involves two renewable starting materials, ethanol and vegetable oil, allowing a total green additive-blended biodiesel production process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over decades, Thailand energy consumption has been concentrated in three main sectors, namely manufacturing, power and transportation. Energy consumption in transportation sector has also been dominated by road transport due to limited coverage by rail and water transportation. Hence, road transport has been a major contributor for greenhouse gas emission in Thailand over recent years. Along with global warming concern throughout the world, Thailand has taken various adaptation and mitigation measures, especially the strong policy push to use carbon-neutral biofuel in transportation sector due to Thailand competitive advantage in agriculture sector. National Renewable Energy Plan (2008-2022) has set challenging targets of 9 and 4.5 million liters/day of ethanol and biodiesel consumption by 2022, respectively. Various blends of ethanol in gasoline (10%, 20% and 85%) and biodiesel in diesel (up to 5%) have been commercially available. However, since current consumption of diesel is twice as much of gasoline, ethanol blend in gasoline would widen the imbalance consumption of gasoline and diesel. The present study however offers an insight into a possibility to use ethanol as diesel substitute. A case study of ethanol bus technology was investigated by recourse to energy demand modeling. Necessary data, such as a number of vehicles (NVs) for various vehicle types, vehicle kilometer of travel (VKT) and fuel economy (FE) were collected, with reasonable assumptions made for those unavailable data, to construct predicative energy demand model. Scenario analysis on ethanol bus introduction was conducted to assess reduction of fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emission by increasing the use of ethanol to achieve ethanol consumption target in 2022. Successful demonstration of ethanol bus operation in Thailand will be briefly mentioned to give confidence for larger project implementation in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Three different biodiesel production processes were simulated using the SuperPro Designer program. The process for producing biodiesel from soybean oil and methanol was designed using commercial chemical catalysts. This chemical process was compared with the biological process catalyzed by immobilized enzymes. In addition, a hybrid process consisting of catalytic biodiesel production and enzymatic glycerol carbonate production was designed and simulated for the conversion of waste glycerol to value-Added chemical. Finally, the economics and productivity of these processes were evaluated to determine economic feasibility. © The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer 2012.

AB  - The production of biodiesel is greatly increasing due to its environmental benefits. However, production costs are still rather high compared to petroleum-based diesel fuel. In this investigation we report a production process that reduces the cost of biodiesel. The process proposed in this investigation, brings biodiesel production cost down due to the use of a solar heater as energy source to attain the reaction temperatures, the use of nonedible Jatropha curcas crude oil (JCCO) as raw material, and the use of low cost Zn filings as esterification catalyst. This biofuel was produced from nonedible Mexican J. curcas crude oil (JCCO) by a two step catalyzed process. The free fatty acids (FFAs) were first esterified with methanol, catalyzed by Zn filings. This catalyst showed a high FFA esterification activity and high stability. XRD study indicated that after 20 esterification runs, the Zn metallic surface remained unaffected. The use of Zn filings prevents the water waste streams, excess of methanol, high pressure and high cost stainless steel equipment used to eliminate the homogeneous acid catalyst that would have been used for the FFA esterification. During the second step, the triglycerides present in the JCCO were transesterified with methanol catalyzed by NaOH. The chromatographic analysis of the biodiesel obtained, revealed that the process proposed in this investigation led to a very high quality biodiesel, meeting the international requirements for its utilization as a fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Immobilized lipase has the potential to be the catalyst of choice for biodiesel production since it is efficient, effective, and environmentally friendly; however, the stability and activity of lipase must be addressed before enzymatic biodiesel production processes can be industrially accepted. This study investigates an enzyme immobilization procedure that immobilizes lipase in a sol-gel supported on diatomaceous earth (Celite ® R632), and determines its potential for biodiesel production in terms of achievable conversion and apparent stability. Four immobilized materials (lipase sol-gels with and without Celite ® at two protein loading levels) were compared in terms of their immobilized protein content, conversion of methanol to methyl oleate, lipase activity, long term stability, and glycerol-water adsorption. The Celite ® R632 sol-gel with high protein loading achieved the maximum conversion in the 6-h reaction period (90%). A drying step was found to be advantageous prior to the reaction, and the absorption of glycerol-water on the Celite ® was only found to be significant at high levels of glycerol. The material was found to be very stable upon storage at 4 °C for up to 1.5 years, losing only about 15% of its percent conversion capacity per year. Based on this study, the supported immobilization technique shows significant potential as a novel catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The conversion of palmitic and oleic acid as well as tall oil fatty acid was investigated in a fully continuous small scale fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) pilot plant. A conventional FCC zeolite catalyst was used. Experiments were performed in the range of 485-550°C. The highest gasoline yield of 44 wt.% was obtained from oleic acid at 550°C. Palmitic acid yielded the most cracking gas at 550°C with 43. 9 wt.%. The obtained gasoline was practically oxygen-free at high octane numbers. Oxygen contained in the feed was mainly converted to water and small amounts of CO2. Gasoline aromaticity clearly increased with temperature. The formation of high boiling products was enhanced by the number of C=C double bonds in the fatty acids. Large amounts of propene and ethene were formed which are valuable reactants for the polymer industry. The lower price of fatty acids in comparison with fresh vegetable oils makes them an interesting feedstock for the FCC process. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biofuel production from gasified black liquor is an interesting route to decrease green house gas emissions. The only pressurised black liquor gasifier currently in pilot operation is located in Sweden. In this work, synthesis gas was taken online directly from this gasifier, purified from hydrocarbons and sulphur compounds and for the first time catalytically converted to methanol in a bench scale equipment. Methanol was successfully synthesised during 45 h in total and the space time yield of methanol produced at 25 bar pressure was 0.16-0.19 g methanol/(g catalyst h). The spent catalyst exposed to gas from the gasifier was slightly enriched in calcium and sodium at the inlet of the reactor and in boron and nickel at the outlet of the reactor. Calcium, sodium and boron likely stem from black liquor whereas nickel probably originates from the stainless steel in the equipment. A slight deactivation, reduced surface area and mesoporosity of the catalyst exposed to gas from the gasifier were observed but it was not possible to reveal the origin of the deactivation. In addition to water, the produced methanol contained traces of hydrocarbons up to C 4, ethanol and dimethyl ether. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Waste frying oil, which not only harms people's health but also causes environmental pollution, can be a good alternative to partially substitute petroleum diesel through transesterification reaction. This oil contained 8.8 % of free fatty acids, which cause a problem in a base-catalyzed process. In this study, synthesis of biodiesel was efficiently catalyzed by the covalently immobilized Talaromyces thermophilus lipase and allowed bioconversion yield up to 92 % after 24 h of reaction time. The optimal molar ratio was four to six parts of methanol to one part of oil with a biocatalyst loaded of 25 wt.% of oil. Further, experiments revealed that T. thermophilus lipase, immobilized by a multipoint covalent liaison onto activated chitosan via a short spacer (glutaraldehyde), was sufficiently tolerant to methanol. In fact, using the stepwise addition of methanol, no significant difference was observed from the one-step whole addition at the start of reaction. The batch biodiesel synthesis was performed in a fixed bed reactor with a lipase loaded of 10 g. The bioconversion yield of 98 % was attained after a 5-h reaction time. The bioreactor was operated successfully for almost 150 h without any changes in the initial conversion yield. Most of the chemical and physical properties of the produced biodiesel meet the European and USA standard specifications of biodiesel fuels. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Palm oil is a potential alternative energy source, since it has long hydrocarbon chains which is quite similar to the hydrocarbon chains in fossil oil. Thus, palm oil can be processed to produce biofuel which may replace the non-renewable fossil fuels, such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil. During utilization, biofuel produces fewer pollutants than fossil fuel. Therefore, biofuel is safer and environmentally friendly. The research was conducted through a catalyst synthesis and the catalytic cracking process. HZSM-5 was synthesized using an Absorption Atomic Spectroscopy (AAS) which produced a synthesized HZSM-5 Si/Al 198. Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET) analysis showed that surface area of synthesized catalysts was 21.3524 m2.g-1 and the average pore size of the catalysts was 13 °A. This process confirmed that the synthesized catalysts meet the requirement as a catalyst used in the catalytic cracking process. The catalytic cracking was carried out in a fixed bed micro reactor at temperatures between 350 - 500 °C and N2 flow rates between 100-160 ml.min-1 for 120 min. It was found that at 450°C and N2 flow rate of 100ml.min-1resulted in the highest yield of gasoline fraction of 28.87%, 16.70% kerosene and 1.20%. diesel oil. The synthesized HZSM-5 catalysts meet the standard of a catalyst used in the catalytic cracking of vegetable oil to produce biofuel. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.

AB  - Ionic liquids (ILs) are often cited for their excellent thermal stability, a key property for their use as solvents and in the chemical processing of biofuels. However, there has been little supporting data on the long-term aging effect of the temperature on these materials. Imizadolium-, quaternary ammonium-, pyridinium-, and pyrrolidnium-based ILs with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and bis(perfluoroethylsulfonyl)imide anions were aged for 2520 h (15 weeks) at 200 °C in air to determine the effects of an oxidizing environment on their chemical structure and thermal stability over time. It was found that the minor changes in the cation chemistry could greatly affect the properties of the ILs over time. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study compares the thermo-oxidative stability and cold flow properties of waste cooking oil (WCO) and castor oil (CO) as inexhaustible potential raw materials to replace the conventional diesel fuels. The thermo-oxidative stability and high viscosity are the limitations of the vegetable oils to use directly as fuel in diesel engines. Therefore, proper investigation on these physical properties of WCO and CO could help to develop high energy efficient biofuels which could act as an alternative to fossil fuels. This study proposes modern and advanced analytical techniques, i.e., thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) which consumes less time, energy, and requires less quantity of sample to evaluate aforementioned physical properties. For comparison purpose, properties were also found out using conventional ASTM standard methods. Obtained results by TGA and DSC were very much close to the conventional standard methods. WCO used in this study was found to be thermally more stable, but displays less oxidative stability than CO. Similarly, CO demonstrates improved cold flow properties, i.e., pour point (PP) than WCO. Higher oxidative stability and PP of CO attributed due to the presence of more mono-unsaturated fatty acids in its composition. Finally, from this communication, it can be concluded that the TGA and DSC studies proved as a reliable and efficient analytical techniques to determine thermo-oxidative stability and cold flow properties of virgin oils. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - A semi-pilot continuous process (SPCP) for enzymatic biodiesel synthesis utilizing near-critical carbon dioxide (NcCO2) as the reaction medium was developed with the aim of reducing the reaction time and alleviating the catalyst inhibition by methanol. Biodiesel synthesis was evaluated in both lab-scale and semi-pilot scale reactors (batch and continuous reactors). In a SPCP, the highest conversion (∼99.9 %) in four and a half hours was observed when three-step substrate (methanol) addition (molar ratio [oil/methanol] = 1:1.3) was used and the reaction mixture containing enzyme (Lipozyme TL IM, 20 wt.% of oil) was continuously mixed (agitation speed = 300 rpm) at 30 C and 100 bar in a CO2 environment. The biodiesel produced from canola oil conformed to the fuel standard (EU) even without additional downstream processing, other than glycerol separation and drying. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Bark is one of the most under-utilized types of lignocellulosic biomass in the forest industry. In this study, bark fast pyrolysis was optimized for phenols yield using response surface methodology (RSM), considering the pyrolysis temperature, gas flow rate, and biomass particle size. The bio-oil generated under optimal conditions was then characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), ultimate analysis, and several physical methods. A regression equation was estimated based on the statistical analysis. It was found that the optimal conditions for phenols yield were 485 °C (pyrolysis reaction temperature), 28 L/min (gas flow rate), and 0.35 mm (biomass particle size), giving an experimental phenols yield of 13.2 wt%. The bio-oil obtained in optimum conditions met ASTM standard D7544-12 and contained up to 30.42% phenols. This renewable, phenol-rich bio-oil may be a good feedstock for phenolic-based chemicals, such as phenolic resin and phenoplast.

AB  - Meat-and-bone-meal (MBM) produced from animal waste has become an increasingly important residual fraction needing management. As biodegradable waste is routed away from landfills, thermo-chemical treatments of MBM are considered promising solution for the future. Pyrolysis and gasification of MBM were assessed based on data from three experimental lab and pilot-scale plants. Energy balances were established for the three technologies, providing different outcomes for energy recovery: bio-oil was the main product for the pyrolysis system, while syngas and a solid fraction of biochar were the main products in the gasification system. These products can be used - eventually after upgrading - for energy production, thereby offsetting energy production elsewhere in the system. Greenhouse gases (GHG) accounting of the technologies showed that all three options provided overall GHG savings in the order of 600-1000kg CO2-eq. per Mg of MBM treated, mainly as a consequence of avoided fossil fuel consumption in the energy sector. Local conditions influencing the environmental performance of the three systems were identified, together with critical factors to be considered during decision-making regarding MBM management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rasta resin-TBD has been synthesized and used to catalyze a wide range of transesterification reactions, including biodiesel synthesis and ring-opening polymerizations. It was found to be a more efficient heterogeneous catalyst than a related polystyrene-based analogue based on the Merrifield resin architecture involving divinylbenzene cross-linking. In the reactions studied rasta resin-TBD was separated from the desired products simply by filtration, and it could be regenerated and reused numerous times without significant loss of catalytic activity. © Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart · New York.

AB  - In this study, Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was used as a woody biomass in the form of sawdust. Hydrothermal conversion of the biomass was carried out in the absence and presence of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate and boric acid at the temperatures of 250, 300 and 350°C. The effects of temperature and catalysts on the product distributions and bio-oil compositions were investigated. The highest total bio-oil yield obtained at 300°C with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was 34.9wt%, whereas the total bio-oil yields from the non-catalytic run and the run with H3BO3 at 300°C were 24.6wt% and 19.1wt%, respectively. Although the composition of bio-oils was similar in all runs, some compounds such as furfural and furfural derivatives were not observed in the light and heavy bio-oils produced from the non-catalytic run and the run with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate at 300°C. The light bio-oils from all runs contained mainly oxygenated hydrocarbons. The major compounds in HBOs were the following: 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone for disodium octaborate tetrahydrate, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid for the non-catalytic run and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid for the run with boric acid. The maximum heating values for the LBO and HBO were estimated to be about 25 and 28MJ/kg, respectively, and they were obtained with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate. SEM analysis of the bio-char obtained from the non-catalytic run at 250°C showed a semi-char formation. An increase in temperature from 250 to 300°C led to the formation of regular channels on the surface of the bio-char. These open channels closed when the temperature was increased from 300 to 350°C. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel, which is derived from oil/fat by transesterification with alcohol, has attracted considerable attention over the past decades due to its ability to subsidise fossil fuel derived energy as a renewable and carbon neutral fuel. Several approaches for biodiesel fuel production have been developed, among which transesterification using a catalyst gives high yields of methyl ester. This method has therefore been widely utilized for biodiesel production in a number of countries. In this study, a Downflow Liquid Contactor Reactor (DLCR) has been used for the liquid-liquid transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with alcohol with extraordinary results. The reactor provides great potential for chemical reactions, which are normally limited by mass transfer and possesses a number of distinctive advantages over conventional multiphase reactors. Inside the reactor a high velocity liquid jet stream is produced which generates powerful shear and energy, causing vigorous agitation in the upper part of the reactor. The high mixing intensity in the DLCR enabled the manufacture of biodiesel to European Standard EN14214 (ester content 96.5%) in 2.5 min at 40 °C with 0.43 wt.% alkali catalyst and alcohol to oil molar ratio of 4.5 to 1.0. The separation of FAME from glycerol is done by gravity settling only without water washing. The effect of the alcohol type (methanol, ethanol) on biodiesel yield was also investigated. The process offers the advantage of continuous large scale production with limited reactor volume. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A commercial macroporous resin (D3520) was screened for lipase recovery by adsorption from the aqueous phase of biodiesel production. The influences of several factors on the adsorption kinetics were investigated. It was found that the kinetic behavior of lipase adsorption by macroporous resin could be well described by pseudo-first-order model. Temperature had no significant effects on lipase adsorption, while resin-to-protein ratio (R) significantly affected both rate constant (k1) and equilibrium adsorption capacity (Qe). No lipase was adsorbed when mixing (shaking) was not performed; however, protein recovery reached 98% after the adsorption was conducted at 200rpm for 5h in a shaker. The presence of methanol and glycerol showed significant negative influence on lipase adsorption kinetics. Particularly, increasing glycerol concentration could dramatically decrease k1 but not impact Qe. Biodiesel was found to dramatically decrease Qe even present at a concentration as low as 0.02%, while k1 was found to increase with biodiesel concentration. The adsorbed lipase showed a relatively stable catalytic activity in tert-butanol system, but poor stability in solvent-free system when used for biodiesel preparation. Oil and biodiesel were also found to adsorb onto resin during transesterification in solvent-free system. Therefore, the resin had to be washed by anhydrous methanol before re-used for lipase recovery. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The need for biocompatible, low impedance abio-to-bio interfaces suitable for implantable bioactive devices has led us to develop electroconductive hydrogels. Conductive electroactive polymers (CEPs) are one dimensional organic semiconductors synthesized from aromatic monomers into extended pi-conjugated polymers. The synthesis of CEP's, in association with hydrogels, produces a class of hybrid materials with the conductivity of the CEP and inherent biocompatibility of the hydrogel. CEPs provide a means for the additive electrodeposition of biorecognition molecules to specific nano- and micron-dimensioned metallic and semiconducting sites on microfabricated metallic or semiconductorMEMS devices. Through judicious engineering of repeat unit chemistry, polymer architecture, crosslink density and microstructure, the mechanical, transport and surface properties may be controlled. Implanted, thesematerials enable programmed lowvoltage electro-release of factors suitable formitigating inflammatory response. Finally, these hydrogels can accommodate supramolecular assemblies of CNTs and enzymes supporting direct electron transfer for generation-3 biosensors and implantable biofuel cells. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - A three-step bio-oil production process involving torrefaction pretreatment (225, 250, or 275 °C at 20 min hold time), pyrolysis (500 °C, two heating rates), and secondary catalytic processing over HZSM-5 (at 400, 450, or 500 °C) was studied to determine how treatments affected byproduct formation and catalyst properties and function. Torrefaction pretreatment significantly reduced average yields (%, w/w of feed) of reactor char (100% reduction), catalyst coke (21.4%), and catalyst tar (8.1%) relative to the best-case conditions using non-torrefied feedstock. The yields of chemical components, including levoglucosan, formic acid, acetic acid, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), were significantly reduced in intermediate fast-pyrolysis bio-oil (FPO) derived from torrefied feedstock, while for intermediate slow-pyrolysis bio-oil (SPO), yields of levoglucosan, acetic acid, and 5-HMF were reduced. However, in terms of concentration, only furfural showed a significant correlation with the torrefaction temperature. Both furfural and formic acid indicated correlations with coke formation, although these were negative correlations. For formic acid, a decreased coke yield with an increasing concentration was attributed to the formation of H2 from the thermal decomposition. Combined coke, char, and tar yield significantly decreased with an increasing torrefaction temperature, decreasing formic acid, acetic acid, and furfural concentrations, and an increasing levoglucosan concentration to a minimum of 14.4% (w/w of bio-oil feed). Torrefaction also increased catalyst effectiveness for minimizing changes to pore size, pore volume, and surface area upon upgrading FPO but reduced effectiveness for SPO processing. Torrefaction of biomass prior to slow pyrolysis more effectively maintained weak and strong acid site density after catalytic processing, although no clear effect of torrefaction was seen for FPO-processing catalysts. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - There is considerable interest in using crude glycerin from biodiesel production as a heating fuel. In this work crude glycerin was emulsified into fuel oil to address difficulties with ignition and sustained combustion. Emulsions were prepared with several grades of glycerin and two grades of fuel oil using direct and phase inversion emulsification. Our findings reveal unique surfactant requirements for emulsifying glycerin into oil; these depend on the levels of several contaminants, including water, ash, and components in MONG (matter organic non-glycerin). A higher hydrophile-lipophile balance was required for a stable emulsion of crude glycerin in fuel oil compared to water in fuel oil. The high concentration of salts from biodiesel catalysts generally hindered emulsion stability. Geometric close-packing of micelles was carefully balanced to mechanically stabilize emulsions while also enabling low viscosity for pumping and fuel injection. Phase inversion emulsification produced more stable emulsions than direct emulsification. Emulsions were tested successfully as fuel for a waste oil burner. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion of vegetable oils has become an attractive and alternative method for the production of high-grade biofuels. In the present work, thermal and catalytic cracking reactions were studied in a 60 L scale-up reactor using soybean oil and high acid value waste oil under the catalysis of a basic catalyst. A bio-oil yield of approximately 70% was obtained at a reaction temperature of 450 C with a heating rate of 5 C/min. After the thermal and catalytic cracking reactions, upgrading of bio-oils in a continuous pilot reactor was investigated. It was found that those undesired products (carboxylic acids) were changed into their corresponding fatty acid esters efficiently by a continuous esterification operation. The upgraded oils were further fractionated into gasoline and diesel fractions via distillation processing according to the requirements of the boiling range in the China specification for petroleum fuels. The results showed that the obtained biofuels have excellent cold-flow properties superior to those of conventional petroleum-based liquid fuels. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) are attractive biofuel molecules. Conventional FAEEs production process uses triglycerides and ethanol as feedstocks and is sensitive to water contents. In this work, we show that the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides cells are capable of converting lipids into FAEEs intracellularly in aqueous phase. Up to 73% of cellular neutral glycerides could be converted into FAEEs when lipid-rich cells were incubated for 84. h at 35. °C, pH 6.0 in a broth containing 10 vol% ethanol. It was found that neutral glycerides were first hydrolyzed to free fatty acids followed by esterification and that lipid droplets played important roles in the process. This new process provides a novel opportunity for integration of microbial lipid production technology with bioethanol fermentation for more efficient production of drop-in biofuels from renewable resources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Optimization of sodium loading on zeolite HY for catalyzed transesterification of triolein in excess methanol to biodiesel was studied. Zeolite HY catalyst was activated by loading sodium ions to their surface via an ion-exchange method. The effects of ion-exchange process parameters, including the temperature, the process time, the pH value, as well as concentrations and sources of Na+ cations (NaOH, NaCl and Na2SO4), on the conversion yield of triolein to biodiesel were investigated. Most of these Na+-activated zeolite HY catalysts could really facilitate the catalyzed transesterification reaction of triolein to biodiesel at a lower temperature near 65°C. Consequently, a high conversion yield of triglycerides to biodiesel at 97.3% was obtained at 65°C. Moreover, the durability of zeolite catalysts was examined as well. Catalytic performance tests of these zeolite catalysts in transesterification did not show a significant decrease in catalysis at least for three batch cycles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fatty nitriles have lately become of interest in the framework of biofuels and for the valorization of the oil part of biomass to form fine chemicals or polymers. The production of long-chain fatty nitriles by the direct reaction of acids with NH3 has not been extensively studied, although several catalysts have been developed and published as patents. The characterization of this reaction with and without catalyst is, to the best of our knowledge, performed for the first time in this study. Several catalysts with various acid-base features were tested, and the best catalysts at 250 °C (Zn- and In-based catalysts) were further studied. Catalytically active forms and models are proposed for the Zn- and In-based catalysts, and the kinetic parameters for the amide to nitrile reaction are evaluated. In the zinc: Catalysts of different acid-base surface features are screened, which include efficient catalysts from the patent literature. Zn and In species display the best results at 250 °C, which correlates with the amount of dissolved materials in the medium. Clues are obtained for coordination complexes formed from ammonia and carboxylates as the catalytically active forms. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Acetic acid (HOAc) was selected as a bio-oil model compound for the steam reforming of bio-oil for hydrogen production. The influence of temperature and steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C) on the steam reforming of HOAc over hydrogen-type Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (HZSM-5) and the catalyst with added Pd (Pd/HZSM-5) have been investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurements, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were performed to characterize the texture and structure of the catalysts. Upon addition of Pd to HZSM-5, the selectivity of the products was modified and the H2 yield was greatly increased. The hydrogen yield and potential hydrogen yield from the steam reforming of HOAc were as high as 60.2% and 87.5%, respectively, under optimized reaction conditions. Both the conversion of HOAc and the H2 yield over Pd/HZSM-5 were significantly enhanced with increasing S/C ratio and reaction temperature below 600 °C, whereas the H2 yield did not significantly increase at temperatures above 600 °C. The mechanism of HOAc decomposition on the Pd(111) surface was calculated via density functional theory. The optimal decomposition route was found to be CH3COOH* → CH3CO* → CH3* + CO*.

AB  - Catalytic refining of bio-oil by reacting with olefin/alcohol over solid acids can convert bio-oil to oxygen-containing fuels. Reactivities of groups of compounds typically present in bio-oil with 1-octene (or 1-butanol) were studied at 120 °C/3 h over Dowex50WX2, Amberlyst15, Amberlyst36, silica sulfuric acid (SSA) and Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 supported on K10 clay (Cs2.5/K10, 30 wt. %). These compounds include phenol, water, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, hydroxyacetone, D-glucose and 2-hydroxymethylfuran. Mechanisms for the overall conversions were proposed. Other olefins (1,7-octadiene, cyclohexene, and 2,4,4-trimethylpentene) and alcohols (iso-butanol) with different activities were also investigated. All the olefins and alcohols used were effective but produced varying product selectivities. A complex model bio-oil, synthesized by mixing all the above-stated model compounds, was refined under similar conditions to test the catalyst's activity. SSA shows the highest hydrothermal stability. Cs2.5/K10 lost most of its activity. A global reaction pathway is outlined. Simultaneous and competing esterification, etherfication, acetal formation, hydration, isomerization and other equilibria were involved. Synergistic interactions among reactants and products were determined. Acid-catalyzed olefin hydration removed water and drove the esterification and acetal formation equilibria toward ester and acetal products. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of low concentration biodiesel blends on the regulated, carbonyl and PAH emissions from a modern passenger vehicle. The vehicle was a Euro 4 compliant SUV type fitted with a common-rail diesel engine and a diesel oxidation catalyst. Emission and fuel consumption measurements were performed on a chassis dynamometer using a constant volume sampling (CVS) technique, following the European regulations. All measurements were conducted over the NEDC and Artemis driving cycles. Aiming to evaluate the fuel impact on emissions, a soy-based biodiesel was blended with an ultra low sulphur diesel at proportions of 10 and 30% by volume. The experimental results revealed that emissions of PM, HC and CO decreased with biodiesel over most driving conditions. Some increases were observed over the NEDC which may be attributed to the cold-start effect and to certain fuel characteristics. NOx emissions were found to be higher with biodiesel especially during Artemis operation. CO2 emissions and fuel consumption followed similar patterns and increased with biodiesel. Most carbonyl compound emissions increased with biodiesel, with the exception of aromatic aldehydes. It was found that carbonyl emissions decreased as the mean speed and load of the driving cycle was increased. Most PAH emissions were found to be lower with biodiesel, however, some increases were observed for certain toxic compounds. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Upgrading bio-oil by addition reactions across olefins represents a route to refine bio-oil to combustible and stable oxygen-containing fuels. Development and application of highly active strong solid acid catalysts with good hydrothermal stability has become a key determinant for success, because bio-oil's complexity includes large amounts of water. Temperatures of 120°C or more are needed for satisfactory kinetics. Batch upgrading of a model bio-oil (phenol/water/acetic acid/acetaldehyde/hydroxyacetone/d-glucose/2-hydroxymethylfuran) over five water-tolerant solid acid catalysts (Dowex50WX2, Amberlyst15, Amberlyst36, silica sulfuric acid (SSA) and Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 supported on K-10 clay (Cs2.5/K-10, 30wt.%)) with 1-octene/1-butanol were studied at 120°C/3h. SSA, exhibited the highest water tolerance and activity. Upgrading using olefin/1-butanol is complex, involving many simultaneous competing esterification, etherification, olefin hydration, phenol alkylation, aldol condensation, sugar dehydration etc. reactions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuels warrants the use of biofuels as an alternate source to minimize the usage of petroleum reserves. Biodiesel fuels are renewable source of energy derived from plant oils or animal fats. They are mono alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids formed by transesterification of oils/fats. Efficiency of transesterification of oils from four sources (safflower, cottonseed, castor, used cottonseed oil) was determined in this study with both methanol and ethanol as alcohols and sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide as catalysts. Methanol was found to be a better solvent and sodium hydroxide a better catalyst. The highly viscous nature of raw vegetable oils has been shown to decrease through transesterification process. In our experiments, the highest viscosity reduction was observed for castor oil even though it was the most viscous among four oils, both methyl and ethyl esters of safflower was shown to have a similar viscosity as No. 2 diesel. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production by enzymatic catalysis has been the subject of much research for developing processes that can potentially compete with other types of catalysis. The objective of this paper was to study the variables that affect the transesterification of coconut oil in biodiesel production using immobilized enzymes as catalysts and ethanol. The transesterification reactions were carried out in closed glass reactors kept under agitation at 200 rpm and catalyzed by the commercial immobilized lipase Novozym 435. An experimental design with the variables: temperature (40-60 °C), enzyme concentration (3-7%) and oil:ethanol ratio (1:6-1:10) was carried out. The best result - 80.5% conversion - was achieved with the highest temperature, molar ratio and enzyme concentration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A lipase-producing Photobacterium strain (MA1-3) was isolated from the intestine of a blood clam caught at Namhae, Korea. The lipase gene was cloned by shotgun cloning and encoded 340 amino acids with a molecular mass of 38,015 Da. It had a very low sequence identity with other bacterial lipases, with the exception of that of Photobacterium lipolyticum M37 (83.2%). The MA1-3 lipase was produced in soluble form when Escherichia coli cells harboring the gene were cultured at 18°C. Its optimum temperature and pH were 45°C and pH 8.5, respectively. Its activation energy was calculated to be 2.69 kcal/mol, suggesting it to be a cold-adapted lipase. Its optimum temperature, temperature stability, and substrate specificity were quite different from those of M37 lipase, despite the considerable sequence similarities. Meanwhile, MA1-3 lipase performed a transesterification reaction using olive oil and various alcohols including methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol. In the presence of t-butanol as a co-solvent, this lipase produced biodiesel using methanol and plant or waste oils. The highest biodiesel conversion yield (73%) was achieved using waste soybean oil and methanol at a molar ratio of 1:5 after 12 h using 5 units of lipase. © 2012 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - Lactate is not believed to be a suitable substrate for hydrogen fermentation, although glucose and starch are. To eliminate this 'blind spot' in hydrogen fermentation, we showed that it is feasible to produce hydrogen with lactate as the sole carbon source by using mixed microflora as well as a single culture. Microflora were isolated from a methane fermentation system, and their hydrogen productivity, fermentation properties, and diversity were analyzed. Since previous studies used inoculum pretreatment to improve efficiency, we used both pretreated and non-pretreated samples. The hydrogen yield of the non-pretreated microflora sample was 0.43 mol/mol lactate, which is approximately 49 times the values reported previously. Megasphaera elsdenii was found to be the main lactate utilizing-hydrogen producing bacteria (LU-HPB) in this sample, but it is not heat-shock tolerant. Thus, heat-shock pretreatment reduces microbial diversity, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and LU-HPB, in the inoculum. This is another 'blind spot' of hydrogen fermentation from lactate. The hydrogen yield of M. elsdenii was approximately 0.4 mol/mol lactate. Considering the balance of metabolites in the reaction, even if the substrate was completely consumed for lactic acid fermentation, 0.8 mol hydrogen per mol of glucose may be recovered via homo-type lactic acid fermentation. Thus, LU-HPB do not require inoculum and/or substrate pretreatment and may improve the utilization of recalcitrant substrates such as xylose by cooperating with LAB. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify and characterise a microbial hydrogen fermenter that can use lactate as the sole carbon source. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Mesoporous materials possess a hexagonal array of uniform mesopores, high surface areas, and moderate acidity. They are one of the important catalysts in the field of catalytic pyrolysis. In this paper, mesoporous materials of Al-MCM-41, La-Al-MCM-41, and Ce-Al-MCM-41 were synthesized, characterized, and tested as catalysts in the cellulose catalytic pyrolysis process using a fixed bed pyrolysis reactor. The results showed that mesoporous materials exhibited a strong influence on the pyrolytic behavior of cellulose. The presence of these mesoporous molecular sieve catalysts could vary the yield of products, which was that they could decrease the yield of liquid and char and increase the yield of gas product, and could promote high-carbon chain compounds to break into low-carbon chain compounds. Mesoporous molecular sieve catalysts were benefit to the reaction of dehydrogenation and deoxidation and the breakdown of carbon chain. Further, La-Al-MCM-41 and Ce-Al-MCM-41 catalysts can produce more toluene and 2-methoxy-phenol, as compared to the non-catalytic runs. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Coherent Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy is a label-free method for chemical imaging, as it offers chemical specificity with orders of magnitude better sensitivity than the state-of-the-art confocal Raman scattering microscopy. Currently CRS technique includes coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). This chapter describes the methods of using CRS microscopy to image major polymers in plant cell wall (i.e., lignin and cellulose). This method can also be used to real-time monitor the chemical processes involved in biomass pretreatment. These together demonstrate CRS as an effective method for imaging complex chemistry in biological systems. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Cellulases, including cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases, are important enzymes involved in the breakdown of the polysaccharide cellulose. These catalysts have found widescale industrial applications, particularly in the paper and textile industries, and are now finding use in second-generation conversion of biomass to biofuels. Despite this considerable biotechnological application, and undoubted future potential, uncertainty remains as to the exact reaction mechanism of the inverting cellulases found in the GH6 family of carbohydrate-active enzymes. In order to gain additional understanding as to how these societally beneficial biocatalysts function, the crystal structure of a GH6 cellobiohydrolase from Chaetomium thermophilum, CtCel6A, has been solved. This structure reveals a distorted /Β-barrel fold comprising a buried tunnel-like active site quite typical of Cel6A enzymes. Analysis of an enzyme-product complex (cellobiose in the -3 and -2 subsites and cellotetraose in subsites +1 to +4) supports the hypothesis that this group of enzymes act via an atypical single-displacement mechanism. Of particular note in this analysis is an active-centre metal ion, Li +, the position of which matches the position of the positively charged anomeric carbon of the oxocarbenium-ion-like transition state. © 2012 International Union of Crystallography.

AB  - Industrial production of ethyl esters is impeded by difficulties in purifying the product due to high amounts of soap formed during transesterification. A simple biodiesel wash process was developed that allows successful purification of samples containing high amounts of soap. The key step was a first washing with neutral water, which removed the soaps without increasing the acidity or affecting the process yield. Afterward, the biodiesel was washed with water saturated with CO 2, a mild acid that neutralized the remaining soaps and extracted impurities. The acidity, free-glycerine, methanol and soaps concentrations were reduced to very low levels with high efficiency, and using non-corrosive acids. Independently of the initial acidity, it was possible to obtain biodiesel within EN14214 specifications. The process included the recovery of soaps by hydrolysis and esterification, making it possible to obtain the theoretical maximum amount of biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A glucose bio-battery prototype independent of oxygen is proposed based on a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) bioanode and a graphite cathode with an iodide/tri-iodide redox couple. At the bioanode, a NADH electrocatalyst, poly(methylene blue) (PMB), which can be easily grown on the electrode (screen-printed carbon paste electrode, SPCE) by electrodeposition, is harnessed and engineered. We find that carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are capable of significantly increasing the deposition amount of PMB and thus enhancing the PMB's electrocatalysis of NADH oxidation and the glucose bio-battery's performance. The choice of the iodide/tri-iodide redox couple eliminates the dependence of oxygen for this bio-battery, thus enabling the bio-battery with a constant current-output feature similar to that of the solar cells. The present glucose bio-battery prototype can attain a maximum power density of 2.4μW/cm 2 at 25°C. © 2012.

AB  - The present study was conducted to standardize the esterification process parameters for the production of methyl ester of raw hemp oil. The effect of process parameters such as molar ratio, catalyst concentration, and reaction time was studied to standardize the esterification process and for estimating the highest recovery of ester with lowest possible viscosity. Based on the observations from the ester recovery and kinematic viscosity, it can be seen that raw hemp oil at 6:1 M ratio may be reacted with methanol at 60 °C reaction temperature for 45 min in the presence of 2 g of KOH and then allowed to settle for 24 h in order to get lowest kinematic viscosity with ester recovery of 90.62%. The yield of hemp methyl ester was found to be 90.62% with oil methanol ratio of 0.37 w/w and 0.01 w/w alkali catalyst. Different fuel properties such as density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, fire point, cloud point, pour point, free fatty acid content and calorific value of the hemp methyl ester and hemp oil were measured. From the properties and engine test results it has been established that methyl ester of hemp oil can be substituted for diesel oil. Methyl ester of above non-edible oil has several advantages among other new renewable and engine fuel alternatives along with its environmental benefits. © 2012.

AB  - Open-cell nanoporous Au (np-Au) electrodes with pore size of approximately 40 nm were fabricated by dealloying of Au-Ag, and surfaces of the electrodes were modified with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 4- aminothiophenol to enhance the electrocatalytic activities of immobilized laccase and glucose oxidase. Enzymeimmobilized SAM-modified np-Au working electrodes exhibited additional reduction-oxidation peak pairs in cyclic voltammograms in buffer solution (pH05.0). Thus, the SAM on the np-Au facilitated electron transfer between the electrode and reactants. First-principles calculations of perfect and defective Au (111) surfaces indicated that the atomic defects at nanoligament surface of np-Au are critically responsible for the electron transfer enhancement. For the utilization of these results, a glucose/O 2 biofuel cell composed of these enzymeimmobilized SAM-modified np-Au electrodes was preliminarily fabricated, and it exhibited a maximumpower density of 52 μW/cm 2 at 20°C. Further optimization of nanoporous structures and kinds of SAM will improve the performance of biofuel cells.© 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - Over 9. million dairy cows generate an estimated 226. billion. kg of wet manure annually in the US. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the viability of a novel two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) process for producing methane-rich biogas on pre-fermented dairy manure. In summary, it was observed that AD of thickened pre-fermented manure can generate comparable biogas quantities to AD using raw manure, with enhanced methane content. Despite receiving a lower quality (i.e., partially biodegraded) substrate, biogas stoichiometry and overall process stability in the two-stage system was also comparable to AD receiving raw manure. Finally, the two-stage AD was more enriched with the acetoclastic methanogen Methanosarcinaceae (Msc; compared to AD of raw manure) and biogas production appeared closely linked with the Msc fraction. In fact, the enhanced enrichment of Msc likely contributed to the successful and stable operations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel crops are promoted as a climate friendly alternative to fossil energy. Yet environmental risks such as potential biodiversity loss are not always adequately considered. This might occur directly as a consequence of land-use change from natural systems to biofuel plantations, but also through invasive behavior of the biofuel species, as it might disperse and establish into adjacent natural systems. Therefore, there is a need to perform ex-ante invasiveness risk assessments including field trials on new biofuel species before they get promoted and expanded on a large scale. This perspective uses Jatropha curcas L. as a model biofuel crop and reviews the biological traits and the circumstantial factors which may contribute to its invasive behavior. J. curcas has recently received much attention as a biodiesel 'wonder crop' and is being planted at large scale without scientific study on its invasiveness risk. We applied two risk assessment frameworks to provide an ex-ante invasiveness risk assessment and obtained that J. curcas is a species with a high invasiveness risk, which is in contradiction with recent experimental evidence. We discuss the limitations of the available risk assessment frameworks, which may have led to unreliable prediction. We interpret the outcome of this theoretical exercise with some recommendations for the selection, introduction, cultivation, and processing stages of J. curcas and other biofuel crops to minimize invasiveness risk. Finally we point to the responsibilities of investors and governments and the need for integrated research of the whole biofuel production supply chain to avoid bio-invasions. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The effect of reaction time and operating parameters like temperature, catalyst loading and feed ratios on Amberlite IR 120-catalyzed esterification of ethanol with acetic, propanoic and pentanoic acids is studied. All three esterifications are slightly endothermic. The kinetic results are presented in the form of surface response plots. Relative increase in initial rates with increase in temperature depends on the steric hindrance around the carboxylic group. Ethanol feed ratios ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 exhibit the fastest initial rates. Catalyst efficiency is found to decrease significantly with increase in carboxylic acid chain length. Modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) model is used to predict system non idealities. An Eley Rideal mechanism, with surface reaction between adsorbed ethanol and acid in the bulk as the limiting step, best correlates the kinetic data. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study the catalytic activity of Na-rich and MO-containing natural clinoptilolite (MO - nanoparticles of NiO, ZnO, or Cu2O) was studied in the pyrolysis of hardwood lignin. The clinoptilolite samples exhibit different catalytic activities which depend mainly on the type of the nano-oxide. The presence of nano-oxides did not affect the porosity of the clinoptilolite framework but influenced its acidity. However, it seems that acidity of the lattice did not influence the catalytic activity of the clinoptilolite in the pyrolisis of hardwood lignin. The number of Lewis acid sites increased significantly for the ZnO- and Cu2O-containing clinoptilolite whereas for the NiO-sample it did not change appreciably in comparison to the parent zeolite. The amount of phenols in the as-produced bio-oil varies from 39% for ZnO-clinoptilolite, 43% for Na-rich clinoptilolite, to 50 and 54% for Cu2O- and NiO-containing samples, respectively. The highest yield of phenols obtained in the presence of NiO-containing clinoptilolite is ascribed to a synergetic interaction of the clinoptilolite lattice and nano-NiO particles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Pretreatment is a key step to decrease the recalcitrance of lignocelluloses and then increase the digestibility of cellulose in second-generation bioethanol production. In this study, wood chips from triploid poplar were biopretreated with white rot fungus Trametes velutina D10149. The effects of incubation duration on delignification efficiency and structural modification of cellulose were comparably studied, as well as the digestibility of cellulose by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). Results: Although microbial pretreatments did not significantly introduce lignin degradation, the data from SSF exhibited higher cellulose conversion (21-75% for biopretreated samples for 4-16 weeks) as compared to the untreated poplar (18%). In spite of the essential maintain of crystallinity, the modification of lignin structure during fungal treatment undoubtedly played a key role in improving cellulose bioconversion rates. Finally, the ethanol concentration of 5.16 g/L was detected in the fermentation broth from the cellulosic sample biodegraded for 16 weeks after 24 h SSF, achieving 34.8% cellulose utilization in poplar. Conclusion: The potential fungal pretreatment with Trametes velutina D10149 was firstly explored in this study. It is found that the biopretreatment process had a significant effect on the digestibility of substrate probably due to the removal and unit variation of lignin, since the crystallinities of substrates were rarely changed. Additional investigation is still required especially to improve the selectivity for lignin degradation and optimize the digestibility of cellulose. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Glucose/O2 biofuel cells (BFCs) with an improved power density and stability were developed, using glucose oxidase (GOD) nanotubes with polypyrrole (PPy)-carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-GOD layers deposited on their surface as an anode and a PPy-laccase-2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6- sulfonate) diammonium salt (ABTS) film type cathode. The GOD nanotubes were fabricated within the nanopores of an anodized aluminum oxide membrane using a template-assisted layer-by-layer deposition method. These BFCs exhibited a higher volumetric power than the best performance reported previously; this was likely due to an increase in enzyme loading of GOD nanotubes and improved electrochemical properties of the PPy-CNTs-GOD layers. The stability of BFCs was closely related to the leakage of ABTS from the cathode. When the leakage of ABTS was suppressed, the power density of BFCs was nearly unchanged for at least 8 days under physiological conditions. © 2013 the Owner Societies.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biofuel that is of great importance; its good performance is associated with its purity mainly related to a high content of fatty acid alkyl esters, quantified by gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. However, these methodologies take long a time and are relatively expensive. Herein, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and viscometry (VA) are studied as alternative methods for the quantification of alkyl esters (FAME and FAEE). Analytical curves from the viscosity and mass loss percentage (TGA) as a function of methyl and ethyl ester levels on binary mixtures (soybean biodiesel/soybean oil) were constructed. The correlations experimentally obtained were presented and used to quantify biodiesel content in the products of ethanolysis and methanolysis and in biodiesel/vegetable oil mixtures of different feedstocks. This comparative study confirmed that both alternative methods are adequate to be used. A single viscometry analytical curve could be used to analyze products, obtained by different oleaginous plants, if their oils exhibit similar viscosities. Viscometry can be the most suitable alternative technique because it is portable, fast, less sensitive to the presence of intermediates than thermogravimetric analysis, easy to work with and very inexpensive. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To understand the potential of cellulosic based municipal waste as a renewable feed-stock, application of pyrolysis by biorefinery approach was comprehensively studied for its practicable application towards technical and environmental viability in Indian context. In India, where the energy requirements are high, the pyrolysis of the cellulosic waste shows numerous advantages for its applicability as a potential waste-to-energy technology. The multiple energy outputs of the process viz., bio-gas, bio-oil and bio-char can serve the two major energy sectors, viz., electricity and transportation. The process suits best for high bio-gas and electrical energy production when energy input is satisfied from bio-char in form of steam (scheme-1). The bio-gas generated through the process shows its direct utility as a transportation fuel while the bio-oil produced can serve as fuel or raw material to chemical synthesis. On a commercial scale the process is a potent technology towards sustainable development. The process is self-sustained when operated on a continuous mode. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, Forsythia suspense seed oil (FSSO) was investigated for the first time as an alternative non-conventional feedstock for the preparation of biodiesel. The FSSO yield is 30.08. ±. 2.35% (dry weight of F. suspense seed basis), and the oil has low acid value (1.07. mg KOH/g). The fatty acid composition of FSSO exhibits the predominance of linoleic acid (72.89%) along with oleic acid (18.68%) and palmitic acid (5.65%), which is quite similar to that of sunflower oil. Moreover, microwave-assisted transesterification process of FSSO with methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide catalyst was optimized and an optimal biodiesel yield (90.74. ±. 2.02%) was obtained. Furthermore, the fuel properties of the biodiesel product were evaluated as against ASTM D-6751 biodiesel standards and an acceptable agreement was observed except the cetane number. Overall, this study revealed the possibility of FSSO as a potential resource of biodiesel feedstock. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on carbon cloth substantially increased the surface area of the electrodes. Carbon cloths were pretreated with HNO3 vapor before CNTs growth and electrochemically oxidized afterwards. The CNT-modified carbon cloths were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Biofuel cells based on these CNT-modified electrode materials using Laccase from Trametes hirsuta and cellobiose dehydrogenase from Myriococcum thermophilium entrapped in specifically designed Os-complex modified redox polymers showed a power density of 5.87μW/cm2 which is 125 fold enhanced as compared with electrodes prepared on untreated carbon cloth. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - It was revealed that the dry powder yeast extract (YE) has the ability to act as a biocatalyst as well as a mediator in a biofuel cell. The yeast extract, from Nihon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., was used as a biocatalyst in an open air cathode biofuel cell containing phosphate buffer for glucose oxidation. The anode medium with only the YE showed an immediate activity by producing a current and delivering power depending on its concentration. By adding glucose to the anode medium, the anode potential decreased with time to -0.2 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and produced a higher power compared to that without glucose. The biofuel cell produced an open circuit voltage (OCV) as high as 1 V. © 2012 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - The production of ethanol and methane from corn stover (CS) was investigated in a biorefinery process. Initially, a novel soaking pretreatment (NaOH and aqueous-ammonia) for CS was developed to remove lignin, swell the biomass, and improve enzymatic digestibility. Based on the sugar yield during enzymatic hydrolysis, the optimal pretreatment conditions were 1 % NaOH+8 % NH4OH, 50°C, 48 h, with a solid-to-liquid ratio 1:10. The results demonstrated that soaking pretreatment removed 63.6 % lignin while reserving most of the carbohydrates. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the yields of glucose and xylose were 78.5 % and 69.3 %, respectively. The simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of pretreated CS using Pichia stipitis resulted in an ethanol concentration of 36.1 g/L, corresponding only to 63.3 % of the theoretical maximum. In order to simplify the process and reduce the capital cost, the liquid fraction of the pretreatment was used to re-soak new CS. For methane production, the re-soaked CS and the residues of SSF were anaerobically digested for 120 days. Fifteen grams CS were converted to 1.9 g of ethanol and 1337.3 mL of methane in the entire process. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Ni + Ce xZr 1-xO 2 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) cermets were synthesized and their catalytic performance for partial oxidation of ethanol (POE) reaction was studied. The structure, reducibility properties and carbon deposition behavior of the various catalysts were investigated. Among the various catalysts, Ni + Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 displayed the best catalytic activity in terms of H 2 selectivity and also the highest coking resistance. The fuel cell with Ni + Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 catalyst layer delivered a peak power density of 692 mW cm -2 at 700°C when operating on ethanol-O 2 gas mixtures, comparable to that applying hydrogen fuel. The fuel cell also showed an improved operation stability on ethanol-O 2 fuel for 150 h at 700°C. Ni + Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 is promising as an active and coke-tolerant catalyst layer for solid oxide fuel cells operating on ethanol-O 2 fuel, which makes it highly attractive by applying biofuel in an SOFC system for efficiency electric power generation. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Background: Pyrolysis is a promising approach to utilize biomass for biofuels. One of the key challenges for this conversion is how to analyze complicated components in the pyrolysis oils. Water contents of pyrolysis oils are normally analyzed by Karl Fischer titration. The use of 2-chloro-4,4,5,5,- tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane followed by 31P NMR ana lysis has been used to quantitatively analyze the structure of hydroxyl groups in lignin and whole biomass. Results: 31P NMR ana lysis of pyrolysis oils is a novel technique to simultaneously characterize components and analyze water contents in pyrolysis oils produced from various biomasses. The water contents of various pyrolysis oils range from 16 to 40 wt%. The pyrolysis oils obtained from Loblolly pine had higher guaiacyl content, while that from oak had a higher syringyl content. Conclusion: The comparison with Karl Fischer titration shows that 31P NMR could also reliably be used to measure the water content of pyrolysis oils. Simultaneously with ana lysis of water content, quantitative characterization of hydroxyl groups, including aliphatic, C-5 substituted/syringyl, guaiacyl, p-hydroxyl phenyl and carboxylic hydroxyl groups, could also be provided by 31P NMR ana lysis. © 2012 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - We report for the first time the direct conversion of raw grape berry biomass to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using ionic liquid solvents with metal chloride catalysts. Exploiting raw plant biomass as a biorefinery feedstock is innovative for sustainable chemical industry. The use of the raw biomass to synthesize compounds can indeed lead to less energy consumption and less CO 2 emissions. Using raw plant biomass skips pretreatment steps that are required to produce biomaterials such as carbohydrates or cellulosic biomass. Here, grape berry biomass was used as a raw chemical feedstock for the production of hydroxymethylfurfural, a key platform intermediate for syntheses of future renewable biofuels. We examined 3 ionic liquid solvents, 3 reaction temperatures, 5 chloride catalysts, and 5 concentrations of HCl. We found an increasing HMF yields depending on reaction conditions. 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride was most effective for HMF synthesis. Addition of HCl or metal chlorides alone showed little improvement. The highest HMF yield of about 100 mg HMF per mL of grape biomass extract was obtained using 0.3 M HCl, [OMIM]Cl, and CrCl 2 at 100°C for 3 h. Our study provides a model system of sustainable production of valuable compounds from raw plant biomass. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Most research on the upgrading of bio-oil by cracking has been done under atmospheric pressure, which results in a catalyst coke yield as high as 20 wt%. In this paper, pressurized cracking, as well as co-cracking with methanol proved to be an effective solution for relieving catalyst deactivation. HZSM-5 catalyst was found to deactivate rapidly in the cracking process of pure ketones. However, when methanol was used as the co-cracking substance for ketones under 2 MPa, ketones reached a full conversion of 100 % without obvious catalyst deactivation. The highest selectivity of bio-gasoline phase from co-cracking of ketones and methanol reached a value of 31.6%, in which liquid hydrocarbons had a relative content of 97.2%. The co-cracking of hydroxypropanone and methanol had lower bio-gasoline phase selectivity but better oil phase quality (liquid hydrocarbons selectivity up to 99%) than those of cyclopentanone and methanol. Based on the experimental results, the promotion mechanism of methanol on cracking of ketones in bio-oil was illustrated by a co-cracking mechanism model.

AB  - The potential of Jatropha curcas seed oil for biodiesel production is well recognized. Lipase transesterification of triglycerides is an eco-friendly alternative to chemical process. However, intoxication by methanol hampers further applicability of enzymatic transesterification. This study investigated the impact of methanol adding on transesterification efficiency for jatropha oil with methanol from 40 to 60 °C. For stepwise addition, the conversions by using methanol were from 33 to 42% at 24 h. For continuous addition, the conversions by using methanol were from 47 to 64%. Higher empirical first-order rate constants and favorable energetics for the first 6 h also demonstrated the advantages of the gradient addition over stepwise addition. Faster ME conversion for palmitic acid (C16:0) of jatropha oil was found, as well as the negative impact of double bonds of linoleic acid (C18:2) on methanolytic transesterification by both adding methods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The stability of fuel during storage is an important consideration for bulk users. Storage instability leads to solids formation which can plug nozzles and filters. This work focuses on the effect of the addition of antioxidants on EURO-III and Jatropha Biodiesel blends. The changes in physico-chemical properties were observed for these blends after addition of antioxidants. BHA (butylated hydroxy anisole), BHT (butylatedhydroxy toluene), TBHQ (tert-butylhydroxyquinone) and DPA (diphenylamine) were the antioxidants used for this study. The rate of change in kinematic viscosity and density of EURO-III-Jatropha Biodiesel blends with antioxidants were found to be less as compared to the neat samples. The oxidation stability of the neat samples, after addition of antioxidants, was found to increase significantly. It was also observed that addition of antioxidant significantly improved the oxidation stability of biodiesel-diesel fuel blends however in some case may act as pro-oxidants. The results showed that the addition of an antioxidant to diesel fuel blends influenced beneficially most of the important fuel properties. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of residence time and reaction temperature on the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) with and without presence of biodiesel as a co-solvent. Experiments were performed for transesterification of non-edible oil (i.e., Jatropha curcas oil) in both batch and continuous mode. It is observed that presence of biodiesel as co-solvent enhances the yield appreciably with increase in reaction temperature and residence time. In addition, co-solvent enhances the miscibility between oil and methanol and consequently enhances the rate of reaction. Further, the results showed that the yield of fatty acid methyl esters obtained almost 20% higher than co-solvent free process. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (BFCs) show great potential for the direct conversion of biochemically stored energy from renewable biomass resources into electricity. However, enzyme purification is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the long-term use of enzymatic BFCs is hindered by enzyme degradation, which limits their lifetime to only a few weeks. We show, for the first time, that crude culture supernatant from enzyme-secreting microorganisms (Trametes versicolor) can be used without further treatment to supply the enzyme laccase to the cathode of a mediatorless BFC. Polarization curves show that there is no significant difference in the cathode performance when using crude supernatant that contains laccase compared to purified laccase in culture medium or buffer solution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the oxygen reduction activity of this enzymatic cathode can be sustained over a period of at least 120 days by periodic resupply of crude culture supernatant. This is more than five times longer than control cathodes without the resupply of culture supernatant. During the operation period of 120 days, no progressive loss of potential is observed, which suggests that significantly longer lifetimes than shown in this work may be possible. Our results demonstrate the possibility to establish simple, cost efficient, and mediatorless enzymatic BFC cathodes that do not require expensive enzyme purification procedures. Furthermore, they show the feasibility of an enzymatic BFC with an extended lifetime, in which self-replicating microorganisms provide the electrode with catalytically active enzymes in a continuous or periodic manner. Using microorganisms for enzymatic biofuel cells: Enzymes in crude culture supernatant of the fungus Trametes versicolor are used at an enzymatic biofuel cell cathode without further purification. The lifetime of an enzymatic cathode can be extended by resupplying fresh enzymes from the crude culture supernatant. This can enable the development of a simple, mediatorless, and cost-efficient enzymatic biofuel cell cathode with an extended lifetime. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Biodiesel production from high acidity industrial by-products was studied using heterogeneous acid catalysts. These by-products contain 26-39% of free fatty acids, 45-66% of fatty acids methyl esters and 0.6-1.1% of water and are consequently inadequate for direct basic catalyzed transesterification. Macroporous vanadyl phosphate catalysts with V/P = 1 (atomic ratio) prepared via sol-gel like technique was used as catalyst and it was possible to produce in one reaction batch a biodiesel contain 87% and 94% of FAME, depending on the by-product used as raw material. The initial FAME content in the by-products had a beneficial effect on the reactions because they act as a co-solvent, thus improving the miscibility of the reaction mixture components. The water formed during esterification process seems to hinder the esters formation, possibly due to competitive adsorption with methanol and to the promotion of the FAME hydrolysis reaction.The observed catalyst deactivation seems to be related to the reduction of vanadium species. However, spent catalysts can be regenerated, even partially, by reoxidation of the reduced vanadium species with air. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The substitution of fossil fuels and fossil-based products with biofuels and biomass-based products is indispensable for a sustainable society and a green environment. The liquefaction of biomass to produce biofuels under sub- and/or super-critical water conditions is one of the most promising methods that might allow this substitution. Here, for the first time, we report the results of the liquefaction of woody biomass under sub-critical water conditions at 250, 300, and 350 °C using potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) as a catalyst. To compare and evaluate the catalytic performance of t-BuOK, the experiments were also performed under identical conditions using KOH as the catalyst. The product distributions obtained using either KOH or t-BuOK as the catalyst were very similar. The total oil yields increased and the solid residue yields decreased when either KOH or t-BuOK were used at reaction temperatures of 300 and 350 °C. The total bio-oil yields obtained at 300 °C with t-BuOK and KOH were 41. 9 weight (%) and 43. 0 weight (%), respectively, whereas the total bio-oil yield from the thermal run at 300 °C was approximately 24. 0 weight (%). Although the O/C ratio of the raw material is 0. 70, the O/C ratios of the light and heavy bio-oils obtained from the KOH catalytic run are 0. 38 and 0. 25, respectively. In addition, the O/C ratios for the light and heavy oils obtained from the t-BuOK catalyst are 0. 41 and 0. 26, respectively. We estimate that the heating values of the light and heavy bio-oils obtained by either catalytic run (t-BuOK or KOH) are approximately 24 MJ kg-1 and 29 MJ kg-1, respectively © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Understanding the interaction and immobilization of [NiFe] hydrogenases on functionalized surfaces is important in the field of biotechnology and, in particular, for the development of biofuel cells. In this study, we investigated the adsorption behavior of the standard [NiFe] hydrogenase of Desulfovibrio gigas on amino-terminated alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with different levels of protonation. Classical all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed a strong correlation between the adsorption behavior and the level of ionization of the chemically modified electrode surface. While the hydrogenase undergoes a weak but stable initial adsorption process on SAMs with a low degree of protonation, a stronger immobilization is observable on highly ionized SAMs, affecting protein reorientation and conformation. These results were validated by complementary surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) measurements on the comparable [NiFe] standard hydrogenases from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F and allowed in this way for a detailed insight into the adsorption mechanism at the atomic level. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Atmospheric indirect steam-blown and pressurised direct oxygen-blown gasification are the two major technologies discussed for large-scale production of synthetic natural gas from biomass (bio-SNG) by thermochemical conversion. Published system studies of bio-SNG production concepts draw different conclusions about which gasification technology performs best. In this paper, an exergy-based comparison of the two gasification technologies is performed using a simplified gasification reactor model. This approach aims at comparing the two technologies on a common basis without possible bias due to model regression on specific reactor data. The system boundaries include the gasification and gas cleaning step to generate a product gas ready for subsequent synthesis. The major parameter investigated is the delivery pressure of the product gas. Other model parameters include the air-to-fuel ratio for gasification as well as the H2/CO ratio in the product gas. In order to illustrate the thermodynamic limits and sources of efficiency loss, an ideal modelling approach is contrasted with a model accounting for losses in, e.g. the heat recovery and compression operations. The resulting cold-gas efficiencies of the processes are in the range of 0.66-0.84 on a lower heating value basis. Exergy efficiencies for the ideal systems are from 0.79 to 0.84 and in the range of 0.7 to 0.79 for the systems including losses. Pressurised direct gasification benefits from higher delivery pressure of the finished gas product and results in the highest exergy efficiency values. Regarding bio-SNG synthesis however, a higher energetic and exergetic penalty for CO2 removal results in direct gasification exergy efficiency values that are below values for indirect gasification. No significant difference in performance between the technologies can be observed based on the model results, but a challenge identified for process design is efficient heat recovery and cogeneration of electricity for both technologies. Furthermore, direct gasification performance is penalised by incomplete carbon conversion in contrast to performance of indirect gasification concepts. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Crude bio-oil from pine chip fast pyrolysis was upgraded with olefins (1-octene, cyclohexene, 1,7-octadiene, and 2,4,4-trimethylpentene) plus 1-butanol (iso-butanol, t-butanol and ethanol) at 120 °C using a silica sulfuric acid (SSA) catalyst that possesses a good catalytic activity and stability. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) analysis showed that upgrading sharply increased ester content and decreased the amounts of levoglucosan, phenols, polyhydric alcohols and carboxylic acids. Upgrading lowered acidity (pH value rose from 2.5 to &gt;3.5), removed the unpleasant odor and increased hydrocarbon solubility. Water content dramatically decreased from 37.2% to about 7.0% and the heating value increased from 12.6 MJ·kg-1 to about 31.9 MJ·kg-1. This work has proved that bio-oil upgrading with a primary olefin plus 1-butanol is a feasible route where all the original heating value of the bio-oil plus the added olefin and alcohol are present in the resulting fuel. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - Switchgrass was liquefied in supercritical water (SCW) using Ca(HCOO)2 as an in-situ source of hydrogen to enhance deoxygenation and the quality of the biocrude obtained. In SCW, Ca(HCOO)2 produces hydrogen via decomposition and hydrolysis reactions, and simultaneously switchgrass hydrolyzes to form oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds. Because of the close proximity of the newly-formed hydrogen and active hydrocarbons, hydrodeoxygenation occurred whereby some of the oxygenated compounds were upgraded by the removal of oxygen in the form of water. The analysis of the so-formed biocrude revealed the presence of benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and alkyl phenolics. The benzene formation is attributed to the hydrogenation of phenols but also due to the Diels-Alder alkene addition, followed by dehydrogenation. The addition of Ca(HCOO)2 doubled the yield of biocrude (10wt%) and increased the heating value from 28 to 34kJ/g. Formic acid amount increased in the aqueous biocrude due to the enhanced decomposition of xylose and glucose. © 2013.

AB  - The combustion and emission characteristics of ethyl levulinate (EL)-diesel blended fuels were investigated using engine bench tests. Blended fuels properties, including the kinematic viscosity (KV), density, EL proportions, oxygen content, cetane number (CN), and lower heating value (LHV) were considered. The combustion and emission characteristics of brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), as well as hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as smoke opacity, were tested. The relationship between the blended fuel properties and the combustion-emission characteristics were analyzed using grey relational analysis (GRA). The correlation degree between the fuel properties and the combustion-emission results indicated that the BSFC was influenced most by the density of the blended fuels. NOx, CO, and CO2 emissions were influenced most by the oxygen content. The KV was the most influential parameter for HC emissions and the opacity of the blended fuels. The oxygen content was the foremost influential parameter. The results show that GRA could be used to increase the comprehensiveness of combustion-emission blended-fuel studies, by providing a reference for the reasonable use of biofuel-diesel mixtures.

AB  - Biomass contains varying proportions of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, and when pyrolyzed, a liquid bio-oil is produced that can be converted to fuels and value-added products such as biopesticides for insect pest management. The objective of this study was to determine which biomass components are responsible for the insecticidal activity of biomass bio-oil by comparing the individual toxicity (LC50) of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose bio-oils with the toxicities of mixtures of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose bio-oils to the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). Lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose individually as well as in mixture were pyrolyzed at 550 °C in a fluidized bed reactor with nitrogen as the fluidizing gas and silica sand as the bed material. Bio-oil collected from the reactor's condenser (aqueous and organic phases) and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or demister pyrolyzed from the same biomass were combined proportionally on the basis of their respective yields. The different biomass components were mixed in equal proportions and then pyrolyzed to provide an artificial biomass bio-oil. Of the three individual component bio-oils, lignin was the most active and the ESP portion the most toxic compared to the other components and collections. Alone, it accounted for the majority of the insecticidal activity in the mixtures, but only the cellulose-hemicellulose bio-oil combination was determined to exhibit synergism. In contrast, the lignin-cellulose-hemicellulose bio-oil combination was determined to exhibit an antagonistic effect. Therefore, it is important to consider the type of biomass component or the proportion of lignin that makes up a particular biomass in order to produce a bio-oil for potential pesticide development.

AB  - Acid-treatment of the bio-oil from the pyrolysis of mallee leaves in methanol over a solid acid catalyst Amberlyst 70 has been investigated in this study. The reactivities of the carboxylic acids with methanol were quite different over the solid acid catalyst, which was closely related to their distinct molecular structures. The linear alkyl substituted groups, the branched alkyl substituted groups, and the aromatic carbon chain of the acids created the different steric hindrances, which negatively affected their accessibility to the catalytic sites on/in the solid acid catalyst. Similar steric effects were found in the conversion of the heavy esters into small esters via transesterification. In addition to the esterification/transesterification, the methanolysis of the olefin and decomposition of the oligomers in bio-oil occurred simultaneously during the acid treatment, which converted the reactive components into the relatively volatile and stable ones and improved the quality of the bio-oil. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spent sulphite liquor is a lignocellulosic residue obtained in the acid sulphite pulping process after the digestion of hardwood chips, and composed mainly by lignosulphonates and hemicelluloses. The aim of this work is to study the main process variables at different digestion conditions: maximum temperature, heating rate, and total SO2 content, which affect the delignification process of hardwood chips to obtain dissolving pulp and to increase the total amount of fermentable sugars and lignosulphonates presented in this lignocellulosic waste. The best results are 210.5g/L of lignosulphonates and 47.26g/L of total monosaccharides obtained at higher temperatures of 1.058T and 1.072T, low heating rates of 0.334R and 0.285R, and total SO2 content of 6.20%. Furthermore, concentrate-acid hydrolysis of the liquor with sulphuric acid was performed in order to study the evolution of the sugar content and the release of the inhibitors. Temperature, acid concentration, acid/liquor ratio and time were modified, showing that acid/liquid ratio is the most influential variable. Although increase in the content of sugars in neither case, a notable furfural and acetic acid concentration decrease is registered, 97.88% and 36.57% respectively, at 20°C, 60% (w/w) sulphuric acid and acid/sample ratio of 1/0.1 (v/v). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study compared biomass gasification based syngas-to-distillate (S2D) systems using techno-economic analysis (TEA). Three cases, state of technology (SOT), goal, and conventional, were compared in terms of performance and cost. The SOT case represented the best available experimental results for a process starting with syngas using a single-step dual-catalyst reactor for distillate generation. The conventional case mirrored a conventional two-step S2D process consisting of separate syngas-to-methanol and methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) processes. The goal case assumed the same performance as the conventional, but with a single-step S2D technology. TEA results revealed that the SOT was more expensive than the conventional and goal cases. The SOT case suffers from low one-pass yield and high selectivity to light hydrocarbons, both of which drive up production cost. Sensitivity analysis indicated that light hydrocarbon yield and single pass conversion efficiency were the key factors driving the high cost for the SOT case. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The oil of Thevetia peruviana with some level of free fatty acid can be reduced in a one-step pretreatment by esterification using H2 treated oil of Thevetia peruviana was then subjected to alkali-catalyzed transesterification, which gave a yield of Thevetia peruviana biodiesel with ester content of 98.20 0.20%. This one-step pretreatment reduced the problem of soap formation normally encountered when using oil with free fatty acid for the production of biodiesel, thus reducing the production cost of Thevetia peruviana biodiesel. Fuel properties of the methyl esters of Thevetia peruviana compared favorably with the European recommendation (EN 14214). Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The thermal degradation of free fatty acids and animal fat in a moving bed of sodium carbonate and 5 wt% of water were carried out at 430 ± 20°C at a pilot scale plant. During start-up the loading rates for a 60:40 mixture of oleic and stearic acids were 10 kg/h resulting in a 69 ± 5% of bio-crude. The acidity index was remarkably low within a range of 0.64-0.80 mg KOH/g during 3 weeks of operation. The loading rates for animal fat were increased from 10 to 40 kg/h corresponding to a weight hourly space velocity of 0.03-0.1 h -1 over a period of 6 months. Heat transfer into the reactor was the limiting criterion. The main product with a yield of 65 ± 5% was bio-crude showing an acidity index of 0.5-1.8 mg KOH/g. The mean value for kinematic viscosity at 40°C was 1.78 mm 2/s. The net calorific value of bio-crude was 41.6 MJ/kg. Coke deposits on sodium carbonate were determined to be 5 ± 1%. The gaseous products ranged from 25 wt% to 30 wt%. The presence of CO 2, H 2, CH 4, C 2H 6, C 2H 4 and C 3 to C 5 hydrocarbons as major components was established by gas chromatography. The gases were directly fed into an on-site gas line and used for heating purposes. The distillation curve of bio-crude from animal fat showed hydrocarbon based bio-fuels in the boiling ranges of gasoline and diesel. Upon rectification 66% of bio-diesel and 21% of bio-gasoline were obtained. This corresponds to a total yield of 43% bio-diesel and 14% bio-gasoline from animal fat. The bio-diesel had favorable low-temperature properties (cold filter plugging point = -18°C) with oxidation stability between that of mineral oil based diesel and fatty acid methyl ester fuels. The gasoline fraction lacked low-boiling hydrocarbons as indicated by a vapor pressure of 26 kPa instead of 60-90 kPa (DIN EN 228). Thus, water-cooled condensers need to be improved for a full-scale plant. The results are discussed in terms of German specifications for standard fuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Car Fluff samples collected from a shredding plant in Italy were classified based on particle size, and three different size fractions were obtained in this way. A comparison between these size fractions and the original light fluff was made from two different points of view: (i) the properties of each size fraction as a fuel were evaluated and (ii) the pollutants evolved when each size fraction was subjected to combustion were studied. The aim was to establish which size fraction would be the most suitable for the purposes of energy recovery. The light fluff analyzed contained up to 50. wt.% fines (particle size. <. 20. mm). However, its low calorific value and high emissions of polychlorinated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), generated during combustion, make the fines fraction inappropriate for energy recovery, and therefore, landfilling would be the best option. The 50-100. mm fraction exhibited a high calorific value and low PCDD/F emissions were generated when the sample was combusted, making it the most suitable fraction for use as refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Results obtained suggest that removing fines from the original ASR sample would lead to a material product that is more suitable for use as RDF. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aqueous-phase aldol condensation of biomass-derived ketones and aldehydes is a key step in the preparation of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources. Furfural-acetone aldol condensation yielding C8 and C13 adducts was studied at 323K and 1MPa in a stirred batch reactor. We propose a new strategy for minimizing catalytic deactivation, consisting of modifying catalysts (MgO-ZrO2 and MgO-Al2O3) by Pd addition (2%). This modification slightly changes the morphology and surface chemistry of the supports, leading to changes on the catalysts performance but not reaction mechanism modifications. If condensation is performed in hydrogen atmosphere, the partial hydrogenation of the condensation adducts increases its water solubility, minimizing catalyst deactivation. In that way, the selectivity for C13 adduct decreases only 25% between two successive reaction cycles using Pd/MgO-ZrO2 catalyst, whereas this decrease is of 90% for the un-doped mixed oxides. These effects are less marked for the MgO-Al2O3 catalyst. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic feedstocks can be prepared for ethanol fermentation by pre-treatment with a dilute mineral acid catalyst that hydrolyzes the hemicellulose and opens up the plant cell wall fibers for subsequent enzymatic saccharification. The acid catalyzed reaction scheme is sequential whereby released monosaccharides are further degraded to furans and other chemicals that are inhibitory to the next fermentation step. This work evaluated the use of agricultural residue (flax shive) as starting material for making activated biochar to adsorb these degradation products. Results show that both furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are adsorbed by steam-activated biochar prepared from flax shive. Decontamination of the hydrolyzate significantly improved the fermentation behavior by Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, including significantly reducing the lag phase of the fermentation, when the amount of biochar added to the fermentation broth was 2.5% (w/v). No negative effects were noted from addition of activated char to the process. © 2013.

AB  - Using the severity factor, it has been possible to study cellulose and hemicellulose fractional conversion, sugar yields change and oligosaccharides variation through olive tree pruning biomass pretreatments with acid or liquid hot water under pressure. The temperatures tested were in the range 180-230°C, operation time varying between 0 and 30 min and acid concentration used did not exceed 0.05 M. Complete hemicellulose solubilization in autohydrolysis was achieved using severity factors (log R0) close to 3.9 (most sugars are like oligomers), while if sulfuric acid 0.025 M is employed, this parameter could be smaller (≥3.4). With these treatments, we have obtained cellulose conversions between 30 and 42% from liquid hot water experiments, 40-51% with sulfuric acid 0.025 M and 42-57% when the acid concentration was 0.05 M. The best results in terms of maximum yield in total sugars, d-glucose and d-xylose, with a low amount of acetic acid and hydroxymethylfurfural, was obtained at 200°C, 0 min (what means that there is no time of temperature maintenance, only heating and cooling) and H 2SO4 0.025 M. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Formose reaction converts formaldehyde to carbohydrates. We found that formose reaction can be used linking the biomass gasification with the aqueous-phase processing (APP) to produce liquid transportation fuel in three steps. First, formaldehyde from syn-gas was converted to triose. This was followed by aldol condensation and dehydration to 4-hydroxymethylfurfural (4-HMF). Finally, 4-HMF was hydrogenated to produce 2,4-dimethylfuran (2,4-DMF) or C 9-C 15 branched-chain alkanes as liquid transportation fuels. In the linked strategy, high energy-consuming pretreatment as well as expensive and polluting hydrolysis of biomass were omitted, but the high energy recovery of APP was inherited. In addition, the hexoketoses via formose reaction could be converted to HMFs directly without isomerization. A potential platform molecule 4-HMF was formed simultaneously in APP.

AB  - We introduce a reactive extraction to detoxify hydrolysate before fermentation to biofuels. In the selection of diluents, n-octanol showed the highest removal yield of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and levulinic acid. The removal yields of inhibitors were normalized to 30-min reactions. In treatments with pure extractant or diluents, only 2 ∼ 4.1% of the formic acid was removed. Tri-n-octylamine (extractant) removed levulinic acid and acetic acid more efficiently, and furfural was removed more efficiently than formic acid or 5-HMF. n-Octanol (polar diluent) removed levulinic acid and acetic acid, furfural, and 5-HMF at 21.2, 33.7, and 65.7%, respectively. In contrast, kerosene (inert diluent) only removed the furfural by 27.6%. Based on these results, the optimum reactiveextraction system comprised tri-n-octylamine as the extractant, n-octanol as the polar diluent, and kerosene as the inert diluent. The optimal proportion of complex extractant was 20% trialkylamine, 70% n-octanol, and 10% kerosene. By detoxification, 63.9% of acetic acid and levulinic acid, 24.4% of 5-HMF, 63.9% of formic acid, and 64.0% of furfural could be removed. © 2013 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Considering that biofuels are considered as a catalyst for stimulating rural economic development, a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SAA) have developed policies to guide the development of the sector. This paper reviews the extent to which the existing biofuels policies and strategies of SSA countries have embraced public-private partnerships (PPPs) and whether the policies enhance or hinder such partnerships. In general, most SSA countries have no regulatory frameworks that have led to some private firms taking advantage of this inactivity to acquire large amounts of land for the growing of energy crops for biofuels at the expense of food crops, mostly involving smallholder farmers. The paper proposes developing effective PPP arrangements in order to leverage the synergies from the efficiencies of both public and private sectors. Such PPPs are crucial for mobilizing financial resources to drive scientific research and innovations for developing advanced processing technologies for second generation biofuels using lignocellulosic biomass as alternatives to traditional feedstock in order to foster the commercialization of biofuels in SSA. In conclusion, as we now live in a global village, countries must undertake detailed and systematic, country-specific assessments to ascertain the viability and feasibility of biofuels, and define the " rules of the game" in order to protect rural dwellers from loosing land to investors for growing energy crops and ensure equitable distribution of benefits of biofuels investments without posing a threat to environment or intruding on the rights of citizens or communities. Where biofuels are viable, PPPs should be part of the biofuels policy and investment strategy in order to build trust, collective responsibility and joint risk management to achieve shared outcomes for farmers, the investor and the environment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 2nd generation biofuels will have an important part to take in the energy transition as far as fuels are concerned. Using non edible biomass, they will avoid any direct competition with food usage. Within 2nd generation biofuels, the BTL route consists in the production of middle distillates (Diesel and jet fuel) via gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. These fuels are called "drop in" fuels; this means that to be used they technically do not request any modification in the vehicle whatever the blending rate with conventional fuels. This route is currently at the pre-industrial phase where demonstration is required. This article presents the BioTfueL project which has been created by Axens, CEA, IFP Energies nouvelles, Sofiprotéol, ThyssenKrupp Uhde and Total. This project is focused on the original concept of co-processing (biomass can be gasified together with fossil feedstock) and proposes to develop and demonstrate a full process chain to be commercialized worldwide via licensing. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Electrochemically induced crosslinking is suggested to stabilize electrodeposition polymer/enzyme films selectively on an electrode surface. 4 different protected diamine or dithiol based bi-functional crosslinkers have been synthesized, which can be activated by a pH-shift invoked by electrochemical water oxidation or proton reduction. Deprotection occurs either simultaneously or sequentially to the deposition of specifically designed redox electrodeposition polymers. The stability of the resulting polymer films was substantially enhanced as evaluated using continuous potentiodynamic cycling alternated by difference pulse voltammetry. Electrochemically induced crosslinking is compatible with biological recognition elements using Trametes hirsuta laccase or glucose oxidase entrapped within specifically adapted Os-complex modified or phenothiazine-modified redox polymers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oil is an alternative source of renewable energy produced from the pyrolysis of different biomass. However, it is not an expedient automotive fuel due to its unfavorable nature (highly oxygenate/phenolic). Due to the presence of highly oxygenate compounds in the bio-oil, it is not possible to convert the bio-oil into transport fuel easily. To prevail over these physicochemical issues, hydro treatment (HT), and fractionation would be the possible upgrading method. Attempts have been made to upgrade the bio-oil by reduction/removal of oxygenate/phenolic compounds from the bio-oil by of Pd/Al2O 3 catalyst and Hempel distillation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Levoglucosan is one of the major polar compounds that can be initially extracted into an aqueous fraction with water as the solvent. Levoglucosan can be hydrolyzed by an acid catalysis into monomeric sugars (primarily glucose), which can be further converted biochemically into alcohols or lipids, or converted catalytically into hydrogen. It has been demonstrated that the levoglucosan yield can be greatly increased if the proper pretreatment is applied to demineralize the feedstock prior to pyrolysis. In this study, bio-oil with a high levoglucosan concentration was produced via the fast pyrolysis of a dilute acid pretreated loblolly pine wood in an auger reactor. The water-to-bio-oil ratio, temperature, and time were selected as the three parameters to investigate the optimal condition for extracting the maximum amount of levoglucosan from the bio-oil. A response surface design (Box Behnken Design) was utilized to determine the direct and interactive effects of the three parameters on the extraction yield of the levoglucosan from the bio-oil. The optimal condition for the levoglucosan extraction was found to be 1.3:1 (water-to-bio-oil ratio), 25 °C, and 20 min, with a levoglucosan yield of 12.7 wt%.

AB  - Purpose: Earth faces an urgent need for climate change mitigation, and carbon storage is discussed as an option. Approaches for assessing the benefit of temporary carbon storage in relation to carbon footprinting exist, but many are based on a 100-year accounting period, disregarding impacts after this time. The aim of this paper is to assess the consequences of using such approaches that disregard the long timescale on which complete removal of atmospheric CO2 occurs. Based on these findings, an assessment is made on what are relevant timescales to consider when including the value of temporary carbon storage in carbon footprinting. Methods: Implications of using a 100-year accounting period is evaluated via a literature review study of the global carbon cycle, as well as by analysing the crediting approaches that are exemplified by the PAS 2050 scheme for crediting temporary carbon storage. Results and discussion: The global carbon cycle shows timescales of thousands of years for the transport of carbon from the atmosphere to pools beyond the near-surface layers of the Earth, from where it will not readily be re-emitted as a response to change in near-surface conditions. Compared to such timescales, the use of the 100-year accounting period appears hard to justify. We illustrate how the use of the 100-year accounting period can cause long-term global warming impacts to be hidden by short-term storage solutions that may not offer real long-term climate change mitigation. Obtaining long-term climatic benefits is considered to require storage of carbon for at least thousand years. However, it has been proposed that there may exist tipping points for the atmospheric CO2 concentration beyond which irreversible climate changes occur. To reduce the risk of passing such tipping points, fast mitigation of the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration is required and in this perspective, shorter storage times may still provide climatic benefits. Conclusions: Both short- and long-term perspectives should be considered when crediting temporary carbon storage, addressing both acute effects on the climate and the long-term climate change. It is however essential to distinguish between short- and long-term mitigation potential by treating them separately and avoid that short-term mitigation is used to counterbalance long-term climate change impacts from burning of fossil fuels. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The present study investigated the feasibility of the recovery and reuse oxalic acid in a multistage process for the pretreatment of a lignocellulosic biomass. Electrodialysis (ED), an electrochemical process using ion exchange membranes, was used to recover and reuse oxalic acid in the multistage process. The ED optimal condition for recover oxalic acid was potential of 10. V and pH 2.2 in synthetic solutions. The recovery efficiency of oxalic acid from hydrolysates reached 100% at potential of 10. V. The power consumption to treat 1. mol of oxalic acid was estimated to be 41.0. wh. At the same time, ethanol production increased up to 19. g/L in the ED-treated hydrolysate, corresponding to ethanol productivity of 0.27. g/L/h. It was clearly shown that bioethanol fermentation efficiency increased using the ED process, due to a small loss of fermentable sugar and a significantly high removal of inhibitory chemicals. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Here we present the design and study of a simple biofuel cell consisting of a glucose oxidase (GOx)-based bioanode and a laccase based bio cathode. Ferrocene monocarboxilic acid (FMCA) was used as a mediator for the bio anode to enhancing the electron transfer at the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface. GOx was co immobilized at electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) by simple electrochemical approach, and the Laccase was incorporated in multiwalled carbon nanotube/Zinc oxide composite modified GCE. The morphological studies of the bio anode and bio cathode have been investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electroanalytical properties of each modified bioelectrodes have been investigated by the cyclic voltammetry. The redox potential of the each enzyme as used to set up the open circuit potential. The fabricated biofuel cell delivers a power density up to 54 nW cm-2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.055 V, under the physiological conditions (pH 7). © 2012 by ESG.

AB  - Present study describes optimized production of waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) using chemical and enzymatic transesterification. Maximum WCOB yield was 89% for chemical transesterification catalyzed by NaOCH 3 and 95.9% for enzymatic transesterification using NOVOZYME-435. Optimized WCOB yield was procured for chemical transesterification when reactions were performed for 90 min at 45C using 0.75% NaOCH 3 and 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, whereas, enzymatic transesterification at 32.50C for 60 h using 0.75% NOVOZYME-435 and 6:1 methanol: oil molar ratio. When compared the exhaust emission levels from diesel engine exhaust operated on conventional diesel fuel with the waste cooking oil biodiesel blends (WCOB), a notable reduction (%) in CO and PM levels was observed for WCOB5, WCOB20, WCOB40, WCOB50, WCOB80, and WCOB100 whereas in case of NOx emissions reduction (%) was observed only in case of WCOB5, WCOB20, and WCOB40, respectively.

AB  - Pretreatment of poplar bark with a combination of sulfuric acid (3%, w/w, H 2SO 4) and gamma irradiation (0-1000kGy) was performed in an attempt to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis for bioethanol production. The yields of reducing sugar were slightly increased with an increasing irradiation dose, ranging from 35.4% to 51.5%, with a 56.1% reducing sugar yield observed after dilute acid pretreatment. These results clearly showed that soluble sugars were released faster and to a greater extent in dilute acid-pretreated poplar bark than in gamma irradiation-pretreated bark. When combined pretreatment was carried out, a drastic increase in reducing sugar yield (83.1%) was found compared with individual pretreatment, indicating the possibility of increasing the convertibility of poplar bark following combined pretreatment. These findings are likely associated with cellulose crystallinity, lignin modification, and removal of hemicelluloses. © 2012.

AB  - The catalytic pyrolysis of waste wood including the particle board was examined by pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to produce bio-oil. Three different catalysts with a nanoporous structure, Al-MCM-48, Meso-MFI, and Pt-Meso-MFI, were used and their performances were compared. When MCM-48 was used, the quality of the bio-oil product was better than that prepared by non-catalytic pyrolysis but the improvement was limited due to its weak acid sites. On the other hand, Meso-MFI, which has both an MFI structure and strong acid sites, exhibited much better cracking ability and higher selectivity for aromatics. Moreover, Pt-impregnation on Meso-MFI resulted in an even higher selectivity for aromatics and phenolics, which are important raw materials in various petroleum chemical processes. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

AB  - An allothermal biomass gasification system using biomass micron fuel (BMF) as external heat source was developed. In this system, heat supplied to gasifier was generated from combustion of BMF. Biomass feedstock was gasified with steam and then tar in the produced gas was decomposed in a catalytic bed with NiO/γ-Al 2O 3 catalyst. Finally the production gas was employed as a substitute for civil fuel gas. An overall energy analysis of the system was also investigated. The results showed that the lower heating value of the product gas reached more than 12MJ/Nm 3. The combusted BMF accounted for 26.8% of the total energy input. Allothermal gasification based on the substituted BMF for conventional energy was an efficient and economical technology to obtain bioenergy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Renewable feedstocks have been in the spotlight of intensive research activities over the past 10 years. Glycerol is one of the feedstock molecules which has been the target of numerous research efforts, for a number of reasons. First of all glycerol is currently readily available due to the fact that it is a couple product of the first generation biodiesel production. Secondly glycerol can be taken as a representative model substrate to explore the options of selective conversion of sugar alcohols to products of value. In our paper we discuss potential routes for the valorisation of glycerol which lead to intermediates already established within the petrochemical value chain and illustrate what impact high throughput experimentation may have as a success factor on research and development for this field. As illustrative examples we have chosen the oxidative transformation of glycerol to acrolein and acrylic acid and the carbonylation of glycerol to C4-acids. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Recently biodiesel is produced from refined/edible oils using methanol and alkaline catalyst. However, wide range of non-edible oils are available, the alkaline transesterification of these oils is difficult due the presence of large amount of free fatty acids (FFA). Hence these free fatty acids form soap with alkali, it is mandatory to reduce FFA present in non-edible oils. Acidic ion exchange resins can be used to decrease FFA level. In this study, activities of resins (Amberlite IR 120H, Amberjet 1200H) in direct esterification of FFA present in Karanja oil were examined; the acid value was reduced ≤2mg/KOH. The optimum conditions of esterification such as catalyst amount, methanol to oil ratio, and reaction time are chosen as 0.8% (w/w), 1:6 and 25min for Amberlite IR 120H and 1% (w/w), 1:6, and 25min for Amberjet 1200H. This pretreatment reduces the complexity of the process and the production cost of biodiesel by alkaline catalyzed transesterification. © 2011.

AB  - The beneficial use of tung oil in pre-blended oil for the production of biodiesel was studied at various blending compositions of tung, canola and palm oils (CBT, CBC and CBP). The effects of CBT, ultrasonic power (PWUS) and sample loading (VL) on the yield (YF) and the properties of acid value, iodine values (IV), kinematic viscosity (KV), density and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) were investigated. The pre-blending of tung oil with palm oil greatly decreases the CFPP of palm oil biodiesel, whereas the presence of canola and palm oils with tung oil reduces the IV and KV of tung oil biodiesel. For PWUS/VL = 0.92-2.08 W/mL, CBT can be as high as 60 wt.% with 30 wt.% CBC and 10 wt.% CBP to produce biodiesel with high YF and satisfactory qualities of the said properties. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, noncatalytic and catalytic fast pyrolysis of forest thinnings was carried out in a bench-scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor using two commercial ZSM-5 catalysts. After the initial comparison experiments at 475 C, the catalyst which showed a clearly higher activity was further tested at reaction temperatures of 400 and 550 C. The yield of organic liquids, which was 39 wt % in the noncatalytic experiment, decreased to 14-24 wt % depending on the reaction temperature. Varying the reaction temperature while using the ZSM-5 catalyst also caused significant changes in the elemental composition, viscosity, and pH, as well as the chemical composition of bio-oil. In general, the use of the catalyst resulted in a less viscous bio-oil with an oxygen content as low as 19 wt %. The catalytically produced bio-oil contained less carbohydrate degradation products and more aromatic compounds. Based on the chemical characterization results (13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography-flame ionization detector, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and solvent fractionation) obtained in this study, a new supplementary procedure for the existing solvent fractionation method was suggested to be used as an initial screening tool for aromatic hydrocarbon content in bio-oil samples. In this procedure, a water-insoluble, dichloromethane-soluble fraction containing low molecular mass lignin compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons is first isolated using solvent fractionation. When the dichloromethane is allowed to evaporate at room temperature, the consequent mass loss of the pyrolysis products exhibits a linear correlation with the content of aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil, as quantified by gas chromatographic methods. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In recent years, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have received much interest as host materials for the construction of organic-inorganic supramolecular structures by an anion exchange method. This study demonstrates the preparation of a series of solid base catalysts through attachment of triazabicyclodecene (TBD) to Mg/Al-LDH surfaces with different Mg/Al molar ratios (Mg/Al = 3, 4 and 5). A new three-stage approach was taken to obtain TBD-LDH materials: (i) an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was intercalated in parent LDH replacing nitrates from interlayer via anion exchange to widen the gallery of LDH, (ii) a silane coupling agent (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (3GPS) was used to attach TBD with the terminal glycidyl groups, and (iii) interlayer molecules from SDS-LDH gallery were replaced by the 3GPS moieties containing TBD. The surfactant modified Mg/Al LDH materials showed an increase in interlayer distance (maximum 44.8 Å) as compared to unmodified Mg/Al LDH (8.8 Å). Infrared and Raman spectroscopy results were in agreement with the proposed organic functionalized structure. Therefore, based on these observations, a schematic representation of the TBD functionalized LDH surface is also presented. The temperature programmed desorption (TPD) study on the different products showed approximately 3-5 times higher basic properties than those of pristine LDHs. Thermal decomposition was changed significantly after organic modification of LDHs. All TBD-LDHs are found to be effective catalysts for the transesterification of canola oil with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) for biofuel production under mild conditions (atmospheric pressure and 70°C). © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Utilization of lignocellulosic material via thermo-chemical processes has received huge attention from both biofuel and biochemical sectors. Intensive research has been embarked to study the thermal behavior and the decomposition patterns of the potential feedstock materials. Palm plantation waste, empty palm fruit's bunches (EFB) are used as a biomass source in this experiment. A comparison study was made using basic lignocellulosic model compounds such as hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. The thermal stability of each compound in both oxygen and nitrogen environments was investigated. The degradation of model compounds were categorized into primary (200-400 C) and secondary (500-800 C) stages based on structural collapse and liquid/solid decompositions. Besides, the influence of inorganic substances in EFB degradation was reported whereby the mineral contents act as a catalyst by enhancing the decomposition at lower temperatures compared to demineralized EFB. In addition, the product gas evolutions from the gasification reaction of the components were analyzed using online mass spectrometer. The gas production patterns indicate the nature of the compounds in terms of thermal stability, functional group cleavages and catalytic reactions. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - The pyrolysis process of pine wood, a promising biofuel feedstock, has been studied with tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry. The mass spectra at different photon energies and temperatures as well as time-dependent profiles of several selected species during pine wood pyrolysis process were measured. Based on the relative contents of three lignin subunits, the data indicate that pine wood is typical of softwood. As pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 C, some more details of pyrolysis chemistry were observed, including the decrease of oxygen content in high molecular weight species, the observation of high molecular weight products from cellulose chain and lignin polymer, and potential pyrolysis mechanisms for some key species. The formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was also observed, as well as three series of pyrolysis products derived from PAHs with mass difference of 14 amu. The time-dependent profiles show that the earliest products are formed from lignin, followed by hemicellulose products, and then species from cellulose. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this study, non-edible Jatropha oil and postcooking waste soybean oil were utilized for enzymatic biodiesel production. The process was optimized by using a statistical method. In addition, a novel continuous process using co-immobilized Rhizopus oryzae and Candida rugosa lipases was developed. The optimum conditions for the batch process were determined to be a reaction temperature of 45oC, an agitation speed of 250 rpm, 10 wt% of water, and 20% of immobilized lipases. A conversion of about 98% at 4 h could be achieved for biodiesel production using Jatropha oil, while a conversion of about 97% at 4 h was achieved from waste soybean oil. A packed bed reactor charged with co-immobilized lipases was employed for continuous biodiesel production from Jatropha and waste soybean oil. The reactor consisted of a jacketed glass column (ID 25 mm × 130 mm), in which a temperature of 45 C was maintained by water circulation. A maximum conversion of about 80% in 24 h at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/ min was achieved with the continuous process, whereas in the two-stage continuous process, a conversion of about 90% in 72 h was attained at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min. © 2013 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Carbonic anhydrase is a valuable and efficient catalyst for CO2 hydration. Most often the free enzyme is employed which complicates catalyst recycling, and can increase cost due to the need for protein purification. Immobilization of the enzyme may address these shortcomings. Here we report the development of whole-cell biocatalysts for CO2 hydration via periplasmic expression of two forms of carbonic anhydrase in Escherichia coli using two different targeting sequences. The enzymatic turnover numbers (kcat) and catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) were decreased by an order of magnitude as compared to the free soluble enzyme, indicating the introduction of transport limitations. However, the thermal stabilities were improved for most configurations (&gt;88% activity retention up to 95°C for three of four whole-cell biocatalysts), operational stabilities were more than satisfactory (100% retention after 24h of use for all four whole-cell biocatalysts), and CO2 hydration was significantly enhanced relative to the uncatalyzed reaction (~50-70% increase in CaCO3 precipitate formed). A significant advantage of the whole-cell approach is that protein purification is no longer necessary, and the cells can be easily separated and recycled in future applications including biofuel production, biosensors, and carbon capture and storage. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Biomass can be converted into a plethora of compounds through different chemical transformations, thus leading to a complex network of possible synthesis steps. In this work, we propose a novel strategy that simultaneously identifies (a) the most desirable biomass-derived products for an application of interest and (b) the corresponding synthesis routes. The strategy consists of i) constructing an exhaustive network of reactions consistent with an input set of chemistry rules and ii) using the network information to formulate and solve an optimization problem that yields an optimal product distribution and the sequence of reactions that synthesize them. We use this strategy to identify potential renewable oxygenates and hydrocarbons obtained from heterogeneous catalysis of biomass that can be blended with gasoline to satisfy ASTM specifications. Multiple objectives (energy loss, catalyst requirement, and absolute heat duty) are considered, and multiple alternative solutions are found in each case. We identified that both oxygenates and hydrocarbons are components of optimal blends for the energy loss objective, but the other two objectives produce only oxygenates. The proposed strategy is flexible enough to be applicable for any problem involving concurrent product and chemistry selection. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - During the past few decades, much effort has been devoted to increasing the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass to create biofuels, biochemicals, biocomposites, and a host of other bioproducts to replace fossil-based products. Recently, the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass received much more attention in ionic liquids with strong hydrogen-bond-destroying ability to produce lignocellulosic derivatives containing new functionality. In present study, carboxyl groups were attached onto sugarcane bagasse (SCB) by the homogenous modification of SCB with maleic anhydride in ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) without any catalysts. The parameters optimized included maleic anhydride concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time required in the process. The extent of maleation of SCB was measured by the weight percent gain (WPG), which increased with an increment of maleic anhydride concentration between 1:1 and 5:1 (g/g, maleic anhydride/SCB). It should be noted that WPG decreased at wild conditions, including long reaction duration (&gt;60min) and high temperature (&gt;110°C). The results from FT-IR and solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectroscopies indicated that the maleation of hydroxyl groups in lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses all occurred. XRD, SEM and TGA/DTG analyses of the native and modified SCB showed that the cellulose crystalline structure of SCB was significantly destroyed after dissolution, maleation, and regeneration in IL. However, the remained cellulose crystalline structure did not change except remarkable decrystallization. The thermal stability of the maleated SCB decreased at low temperature (lower than 300°C), and increased at high temperature (above 300°C) compared with that of native ball-milled SCB. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Alkali pretreatment of wheat straw was optimized by response surface methodology to maximize yields of fermentable sugars in subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and to remove maximum lignin in order to improve rheological attributes of the media. The effects of pretreatment conditions on biomass properties were studied using the Expert Designer software. Concentration of sodium hydroxide and temperature were the factors most affecting pretreatment efficiency. At the optimum (80°C, 39 min, 0.18 g NaOH and 0.06 g lime per g of raw biomass), 93.1 ± 1.0% conversion of cellulose to glucose after enzymatic hydrolysis and 80.3 ± 1.2% yield of monosaccharides (glucose plus xylose and arabinose) from cellulose and hemicellulose of wheat straw were achieved.

AB  - This research demonstrated hydrolysis of wet microalgal lipid and esterification of free fatty acid (FFA) using acid in one-step process. The investigation of simultaneous hydrolysis-esterification (SHE) of wet microalgal lipid was conducted by using L27 orthogonal design and the effects of water content, volume of sulphuric acid, volume of methanol, temperature and time on SHE were examined. As a result, water content was found to be the most effective factor. The effects of various parameters on fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content and equilibrium relation between FAME and FFA were also examined under water content 80%. Equimolar amounts of sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid showed similar results. This method has great potential in terms of biodiesel production from microalgae since no organic solvents are used. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - By using pig pancreatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3 or PPL) as a biocatalyst, covalently immobilized on amorphous AlPO4 support, a new second generation biodiesel was obtained in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol. The resulting biofuel is composed of fatty acid ethyl esters and monoglycerides (FAEE/MG) blended in a 2:1 molar ratio. This novel product, which integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols (MG) into the biofuels composition, has similar physicochemical properties as conventional biodiesel and also avoids the removal step of the by-product by washing of the biodiesel with water. Immobilization of PPL was achieved by covalent attachment of the e-amino group of the lysine residues of PPL with the aldehyde groups of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde linked on a hybrid organic-inorganic functionalized AlPO4 surface. With this procedure, the PPL biocatalyst was strongly fixed to the inorganic support surface (94.3%). Nevertheless, the efficiency of the immobilized enzyme was relatively lower compared to that of the free PPL, but it showed a remarkable stability as well as a great capacity of reutilization (25 reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. Therefore, this enzymatic method allows the production of a biodiesel which integrates the glycerol, allows a more efficient fabrication method and minimizes the waste production as compared to the conventional alkali-catalyzed process. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - Inspired by adhesive proteins secreted by mussels, a general biomolecule immobilization approach has been proposed to the synthesis of multifunctional core-shell heme protein-Au-polydopamine-Fe3O4 magnetic bionanoparticles (heme protein-Au-PDA-Fe3O4 MBNPs) using one-pot chemical polymerization. Scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, UV-vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods were used to characterize the heme protein-Au-PDA-Fe3O4 MBNPs. Results demonstrated that the resultant MBNPs not only had the magnetism of Fe3O4 nanoparticles which made them easily manipulated by an external magnetic field, but also had the excellent biocompatibility and good conductivity of PDA and Au nanoparticles which could maintain the native structure of the heme proteins, and facilitated the direct electrochemistry of heme proteins including hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin (Mb) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the biofilm. Hence, the protein-Au-PDA-Fe3O 4 biofilm electrode displayed excellent catalytic performance for H2O2. This facile, versatile, and inexpensive proteins immobilization platform is promising for the preparation of many other MBNPs with interesting properties and application potentials in many fields, such as biosensing, biocatalysis, biofuel cells, and bioaffinity separation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a relatively inexpensive and abundant feedstock for biofuel production. The key to unlocking the recalcitrance of lignocelluloses is an effective pretreatment process. A promising new pretreatment method for lignocellulosic biomass is the use of ionic liquids (ILs). In this study, wood flour was partially dissolved in the novel ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acesulfamate ([BMIM]Ace) mixed with different organic solvents (1,4-dioxane, acetone, methanol, DMSO, and DMF) followed by precipitation in water. Hemicelluloses were successfully extracted from the carbohydrate-enriched residues by an alkaline ethanol solvent. Sugar analysis of the hemicellulosic fractions indicated that xylose (63.25-74.85%) was the major sugar component, while small amounts of glucose (4.85-14.40%) and galactose (4.49-7.32%) were also observed. Molecular weights of these fractions varied between 49.330 and 60.760 g/mol as determined by GPC. NMR studies revealed that the hemicelluloses had a backbone of β-(1→4)-linked-D-xylopyranosyl units and were branched mainly through 4-O-methyl-α-D-glucuronic acid. The thermal degradation behavior of the hemicellulosic fractions showed that the most significant degradation occurred between 242 and 300 °C.

AB  - This study investigated production of biodiesel from oil seeds of Jatropha curcas, obtained in Nigeria, with a view to encouraging the cultivation of Jatropha plant in Nigeria and to providing a motivation for the development of biodiesel production from this feedstock. Also effect of oil-to-alcohol molar ratio on the biodiesel production from Nigerian Jatropha curcas seeds oil was investigated with a view to confirming established base case. A maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of 87% was obtained at 333 Kelvin, oil-to-alcohol molar ratio of 1:6 and at 1wt% NaOH catalyst concentration. The physical properties of the BD obtained from Nigerian Jatropha oil met the ASTM standard of D-6751. Consequently, this study reveals that Jatropha curcas, an economically invaluable plant in Nigeria, could be a good feedstock for biodiesel production in Nigeria.

AB  - Aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of the low-boiling fraction (LBF) of bio-oil from rice husk pyrolysis was investigated over Pt/Al2O3 for hydrogen production. The influence of reaction temperature (503-563K), reaction time (1-4h), different load of organics in water (3-12wt.%) and catalyst amounts (0.25-1g) were studied. The hydrogen content of the gas products reached 65vol.% at 533K for 4h with a feedstock of 9.6g LBF and 30mL water in the presence of 0.5g of 2wt.% Pt/Al2O3. APR is a promising method to make use of the organics in LBF of bio-oil to produce hydrogen. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study evaluates an integrated process for the production of platform chemicals and diesel miscible biofuels. An energy crop (Miscanthus) was treated hydrothermally to produce levulinic acid (LA). Temperatures ranging between 150 and 200 °C, sulfuric acid concentrations 1-5 wt.% and treatment times 1-12 h were applied to give different combined severity factors. Temperatures of 175 and 200 °C and acid concentration of 5 wt.% were found to be necessary to achieve good yield (17 wt.%) and selectivities of LA while treatment time did not have an effect. The acid hydrolysis residues were characterized for their elemental, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents, and then tested in a small-scale pyrolyzer using silica sand and a commercial ZSM-5 catalyst. Milder pretreatment yielded more oil (43 wt.%) and oil O 2 (37%) while harsher pretreatment and catalysis led to more coke production (up to 58 wt.%), less oil (12 wt.%) and less oil O 2 (18 wt.%).

AB  - The feedstocks for biodiesel production are predominantly from edible oils and the high cost of the feedstocks prevents its large scale application. In this study, we evaluated the oil extracted from Boettcherisca peregrine larvae (BPL) grown on solid organic wastes for biodiesel production. The oil contents detected in the BPL converted from swine manure, fermentation residue and the degreased food waste, were 21.7%, 19.5% and 31.1%, respectively. The acid value of the oil is 19.02 mg KOH/g requiring a two-step transesterification process. The optimized process of 12:1 methanol/oil (mol/mol) with 1.5% H2SO4 reacted at 70°C for 120 min resulted in a 90.8% conversion rate of free fatty acid (FFA) by esterification, and a 92.3% conversion rate of triglycerides into esters by alkaline transesterification. Properties of the BPL oil-based biodiesel are within the specifications of ASTM D6751, suggesting that the solid organic waste-grown BPL could be a feasible non-food feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2012 Yang et al.

AB  - Fast-pyrolysis based processes can be built on small-scale and have higher process carbon and energy efficiency as compared to other options. H2Bioil is a novel process based on biomass fast-hydropyrolysis and subsequent hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and can potentially provide high yields of high energy density liquid fuel at relatively low hydrogen consumption. This paper contains a comprehensive financial analysis of the H2Bioil process with hydrogen derived from different sources. Three different carbon tax scenarios are analyzed: no carbon tax, $55/metric ton carbon tax and $110/metric ton carbon tax. The break-even crude oil price for a delivered biomass cost of $94/metric ton when hydrogen is derived from coal, natural gas or nuclear energy ranges from $103 to $116/bbl for no carbon tax and even lower ($99-$111/bbl) for the carbon tax scenarios. This break-even crude oil price compares favorably with the literature estimated prices of fuels from alternate biochemical and thermochemical routes. The impact of the chosen carbon tax is found to be limited relative to the impact of the H2 source on the H2Bioil break-even price. The economic robustness of the processes for hydrogen derived from coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy is seen by an estimated break-even crude oil price of $114-$126/bbl when biomass cost is increased to $121/metric ton. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Laccase enzyme has been widely used as the catalyst of the biocathodes in enzymatic biofuel cells (BFCs); the poor biocompatibility of this enzyme (e.g., poor catalytic activity in neutral media and low tolerance against chloride ion) and the lack of selectivity for oxygen reduction at the laccase-based biocathode against ascorbic acid, unfortunately, offer a great limitation to future biological applications of laccase-based BFCs. This study demonstrates a facial yet effective solution to these limitations with the assistance of hydrophobic room temperature ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (Bmim+PF6-). With the Bmim+PF6- overcoating, the laccase-based biocathodes possess a good bioelectrocatalytic activity toward O2 reduction in neutral media and a high tolerance against Cl-. Moreover, the Bmim+PF6- overcoating applied to the laccase-based biocathodes also well suppresses the oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) at the biocathodes and thereby avoids the AA-induced decrease in the power output of the laccase-based BFCs. The mechanisms underlying the excellent properties of the Bmim+PF6- overcoating are proposed based on the intrinsic features of ionic liquid Bmim+PF 6-. To demonstrate the applications of the BFCs with the as-prepared biocathodes in biologically relevant systems, an AA/O2 BFC is assembled with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as electrode materials both for accelerating AA oxidation at the bioanode and for promoting direct electron transfer of laccase at the biocathode. With the presence of 0.50 mM AA in 0.10 M quiescent phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), the assembled BFC has an open circuit voltage of 0.73 V and a maximum power output of 24 μW cm -2 at 0.40 V under ambient air and room temperature. This study essentially offers a new strategy for the development of enzymatic BFCs with a high biocompatibility. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ethanol has long been regarded as the optimal gasoline-alternative biofuel for spark-ignition (SI) engines. It is used widely in Latin and North America and is increasingly accepted as an attractive option across Europe. Nevertheless, its low energy density requires a high rate of manufacture; in areas which are deficient of arable land, such rates might prove problematic. Therefore, fuels with higher calorific values, such as butanol or 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) deserve consideration; a similar yield to ethanol, in theory, would require much less land. This report addresses the suitability of DMF, to meet the needs as a biofuel substitute for gasoline in SI engines, using ethanol as the biofuel benchmark. Specific attention is given to the sensitivity of DMF to various engine control parameters: combustion phasing (ignition timing), injection timing, relative air-fuel ratio and valve timing (intake and exhaust). Focus is given to the window for optimization; the parameter range which sustains optimal IMEP (within 2%) but provides the largest reduction of emissions (HC or NO). The test results using a single-cylinder SI research engine at 1500 rpm show how DMF is less sensitive to key engine parameters, compared to gasoline. This allows a wider window for emissions optimization because the IMEP remains optimal across a greater parameter range. Copyright Â© 2012 SAE International.

AB  - In order to improve the efficiency of conversion of lignocellulosic materials to simple sugars in an environmentally friendly manner, the efficiency of ultrasonic pretreatment, as an alternative pretreatment method to conventional ones, was studied. Ultrasound waves with their mechanical features on degradation of organic network and effect on the chemical reactions can be used as the new method for pretreatment of lignocellulosic material. The influences of enzyme, particle size, acid concentration, power of ultrasound, and time of irradiation of ultrasound on releasing the simple sugars were investigated. The optimal conditions of pretreatment were obtained by using Taguchi method. The results indicate that the sequence of influential factors is enzyme, particle size, acid concentration, duration of ultrasonication, and power of ultrasound. Under optimal conditions (using enzyme, particle size < 0.18 mm, acid concentration (v/v) 3%, ultrasound power 120 W and 180 s ultrasound time) the sugars' yield was 26.01 (g/L) which was 94.49% of the expected theoretical result. This suggests that ultrasound-acid pretreatment of sugar cane bagasse can be used as an effective method for pretreatment though at this stage much more information is required.

AB  - This work describes the mechanical and solvent extraction of Sterculia striata seed oil. It was determined that the seeds contain up to 41% in oil, which has an unusual composition. Indeed, up to 50% of the fatty acid contain cyclopropenoid ring. The oil was used as raw material to produce bio-oil and biodiesel and their physical-chemical properties were evaluated. Some of the studied physical-chemical properties of the S. striata biodiesel are in acceptable range for use as biodiesel in diesel engines, showing a promising economic exploitation of this raw material in semi-arid regions. It was also observed that the cyclopropenoid ring remains after transesterification and is decomposed during pyrolysis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ZrO 2 nanoparticles were successfully fabricated via a facile hydrothermal process. The diameter and surface area of the as-prepared ZrO 2 nanoparticles were approximately 5-10nm and 102m 2/g, respectively. For the first time, Zr atoms with partial positive charges in a Lewis acid ZrO 2 nanoparticle adsorbent were used for the adsorption of negatively charged phospholipids from Jatropha oil. The capacity for phospholipid adsorption using the ZrO 2 nanoparticles was better than that of commercial ZrO 2 powder due to the larger surface area of the ZrO 2 nanoparticles. Phospholipid removal makes Jatropha oil a potential oil for biofuel applications. © 2011.

AB  - In an effort to identify a microbial lipase that can catalyze transesterification reactions used in biodiesel production, an organic solvent-tolerant lipase was purified from Streptomyces sp. CS268. The molecular weight of the purified lipase was estimated to be 37.5 kDa by SDSPAGE. The lipase showed highest activity at a temperature of 30°C and pH 8.0 while it was stable in the pH range 4.0 ∼ 9.0 and at temperatures ≤ 50°C. It showed the highest hydrolytic activity towards medium-length acyl chain pnitrophenyl decanoate with Km and Vmax values of 0.59 mM and 319.5 mmol/mg/min, respectively. Also, the lipase showed non-position specificity for triolein ydrolysis. The purified lipase catalyzed transesterification reaction of soybean oil with methanol, suggesting that it can be apotential enzymatic catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2012 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer.

AB  - In this experiment, argemone oil, toxic and highly viscous oil, was treated in two different processes to use this as an adulterer to petroleum diesel. Firstly oil was passed through several processes to lower it viscosity and to improve its properties. The resultant oil, refined argemone oil (RAO), was compared with traditional transesterified biodiesel (TEO) prepared from crude argemone oil. Results indicated that RAO had properties closer to those of TEO and important properties like viscosity, acid value, iodine value and pour point of RAO were also within the acceptable range. Engine testing revealed that up to 42% increment in engine runtime was recorded when only 10% RAO was added to the petroleum diesel, and this is probably the most feasible technique to convert argemone oil to biofuel additive with petroleum diesel. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of methyl esters of several saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in both RAO and TEO. However, methyl eicosanoate was present in the highest concentration in these oils. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A bioanode has been developed based on the oxidation of ethanol by the recombinant pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The apo form of the recombinant protein (PpADH) was purified and displayed catalytic activity for binding PQQ in the presence of Ca2+. PpADH exhibited broad substrate specificity towards various alcohols and aldehydes. The Km values for the aldehydes of PpADH were increased compared to those for the alcohols, whereas the kcat values were unaltered. For instance, the Km values at T=298.15K (25°C) for ethanol and acetaldehyde were 0.21 (±0.02)mM and 5.8 (±0.60)mM, respectively. The kcat values for ethanol and acetaldehyde were 24.8 (±1.2)s-1 and 31.1 (±1.2)s-1, respectively. The aminoferrocene was used as an electron transfer mediator between PpADH and the electrode during electrochemical experiments. The catalytic currents for the oxidation of alcohol and acetaldehyde by PpADH were also observed in this system. The electric charge for the oxidation of ethanol (Q=2.09×10-3·C) was increased two-fold compared to that for the oxidation of acetaldehyde (Q=0.95×10-3·C), as determined by chronoamperometric measurements. Thus, we have electrochemically demonstrated the two-step oxidation of ethanol to acetate using only PpADH. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A model is proposed to describe soot formation and oxidation during bio-oil gasification. It is based on the description of bio-oil heating, devolatilization, reforming of gases and conversion of both char and soot solids. Detailed chemistry (159 species and 773 reactions) is used in the gas phase. Soot production is described by a single reaction based on C 2H2 species concentration and three heterogeneous soot oxidation reactions. To support the validation of the model, three sets of experiments were carried out in a lab-scale Entrained Flow Reactor (EFR) equipped with soot quantification device. The temperature was varied from 1000 to 1400 C and three gaseous atmospheres were considered: default of steam, large excess of steam (H2O/C = 8), and the presence of oxygen in the O/C range of 0.075-0.5. The model is shown to accurately describe the evolution of the concentration of the main gas species and to satisfactorily describe the soot concentration under the three atmospheres using a single set of identified kinetic parameters. Thanks to this model the contribution of different mechanisms involved in soot formation and oxidation in various situations can be assessed. © 2013 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The aim of this work was to compare the properties of niobium (Si/Nb = 118) and tantalum (Si/Ta = 121) containing mesostructured cellular foams (MCF) modified with (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) in one-pot synthesis and the application of materials obtained in acetic acid esterification with glycerol. TaMCF materials were prepared for the first time. Catalysts were characterized by different techniques: N2 adsorption, XRF, elemental and thermal analyses, FTIR + pyridine adsorption and titration of acid sites. New catalysts have showed an excellent catalytic activity in the acetic acid esterification with glycerol to yield triacetylglycerol, also known as triacetin (a valuable additive for biodiesel composition). The influence of modifiers on the number and strength of acidic centres in the materials obtained was found and discussed in details in the paper. The strength of Brønsted acid centres (BAS) was estimated by the interaction of organosilane with transition metal via the use of methoxy groups from MPTMS. The highest concentration of acidic sites determined by NaOH titration was obtained on tantalum modified MCF, whereas the highest strength of BAS was observed on MP-NbMCF sample. The catalytic behaviour of MPTMS and Nb modified MCF samples was comparable to that observed for Amberlyst 15 and better than that of Nafion SAC 13. The materials obtained could be reused and showed stable catalytic features in subsequent cycles. The addition of tantalum allows obtaining a new catalyst with high efficiency of thiol species oxidation (higher than reported before for other catalysts). MPTMS modified TaMCF material appeared to be attractive for further study in different reactions requiring high concentration of acidic centres. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the polyphosphonate-assisted coacervation of chitosan, a simple and versatile procedure for the encapsulation of proteins/enzymes in chitosan-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composites matrix was developed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) mapping demonstrated the hemoglobin (Hb) uniformly distributed into chitosan-CNTs composites matrix. Raman measurements indicated the CNTs in composites matrix retained the electronic and structural integrities of the pristine CNTs. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy displayed the encapsulated Hb preserved their near-native structure, indicating the polyphosphonate-chitosan-CNTs composites possessed excellent biocompatibility for the encapsulation of proteins/enzymes. Electrochemical measurements indicated the encapsulated Hb could directly exchange electron with the substrate electrode. Moreover, the modified electrode showed excellent bioelectrocatalytic activity for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Under optimum experimental conditions, the fabricated electrochemical sensor displayed the fast response (less than 3s), wide linear range (7.0×10-7 to 2.0×10-3M) and low detection limit (4.0×10-7M) for the determination of hydrogen peroxide. This newly developed protocol was simple and mild and would certainly find extensive applications in biocatalysis, biosensors, bioelectronics and biofuel cells. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chemical looping reforming (CLR) is a novel technology that can be used for reforming of cheaply available abundant biofuel like ethanol for the production of hydrogen/syngas for fuel cells. A systematic thermodynamic study for the CLR process using selected oxygen carriers was done to analyze the products and energy requirements of the CLR process in the temperature range of 500-1200°C at 1bar pressure for ethanol. The results showed favorable conditions for syngas manufacture from this process. Fe2O3 was found to be the best performing oxygen carrier followed by calcium and sodium sulfates, while Mn oxides were the least preferred oxygen carriers for CLR of ethanol process. The optimum process temperature was found to be 1000°C. The actual CLR-ethanol process shows exothermicity against the theoretical endothermic partial oxidation of ethanol. The results obtained in this theoretical study can pave the way for experimental programs for syngas generation for SOFC-type fuel cells. Similar studies can be undertaken for other fuels for fuel processor development by CLR process. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The catalytic activity of Lewis acidic metal chlorides were screened for the production of biofuel precursor platform chemical, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), from carbohydrates and biopolymers in aqueous and biphasic solvents under microwave and conventional heating methods. The screening of metal chloride catalysts for dehydration of several carbohydrate substrates revealed that Zr(O)Cl2 catalyst is the most effective. Cheap and readily abundant Zr(O)Cl2 catalyst produced 63% and 42% HMF from fructose and glucose, respectively, in water using methylisobutylketone (MIBK) as the organic phase in biphasic solvent system. The yield of HMF increased to 84% and 66% when Zr(O)Cl2 catalyzed dehydration of fructose and glucose was carried out in [BMIM]Cl (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride)-MIBK biphasic solvent. 1H NMR studies revealed that the dehydration reactions progressed through the formation of fructofuranose as an intermediate. Accordingly, a mechanism for isomerization of glucopyranose to fructofuranose has been proposed. The catalyst was recycled for five catalytic cycles without a significant loss in its activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, transesterification kinetics of canola oil with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was investigated, intending to produce glycerol-free biofuel using triazabicyclodecene (TBD) as a catalyst. The triglyceride/DMC reaction in a stirred batch reactor produces a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and fatty acid glycerol carbonates (FAGCs), which are soluble in FAMEs and can then be used as a motor fuel. The main factors affecting the yield of biofuel, such as the molar ratio of oil/DMC, catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and reaction time, are discussed. A reaction mechanism has been proposed for the TBD-catalyzed transesterification. For the conversion of triglycerides, a second-order reaction rate with rate constants of 1.09 × 10-2, 1.65 × 10-2, and 2.30 × 10-2 L mol -1 min-1 at 50, 60, and 70 C, respectively, was determined from the regression of the experimental data. The corresponding value of activation energy was 36.36 kJ mol-1. The maximum yield of 97.99% from transesterification of canola oil was obtained within 120 min. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrogenases are the key enzymes for hydrogen metabolism in many microorganisms. Due to the high efficiency and specificity they developed for H2 oxidation, they have been recently used as biocatalysts for an efficient H2/O2 biofuel cell. In this work we explore new properties of an O2-, CO- and T°-resistant hydrogenase. Enzyme immobilization on carbon nanotube modified electrodes is studied and optimized for long-term stabilization of the direct hydrogen catalytic oxidation process. The role of co-immobilized redox mediator is finally discussed in view of H2/O2 fuel cell performance enhancement. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass is a primary step for converting multi-structure biomass to biofuels and other industrial products in integrated biorefinery processes. Here, the effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous acid promoters (HNO3-, HCl-, H2SO4-, and H3PO4-activated carbons) on Clean Fractionation (CF), a single-step aqueous-organosolv fractionation, of eucalyptus wood chips was studied and optimised. The optimised process contained 16.7% w/v biomass in a ternary mixture of methyl isobutyl ketone:methanol:water (25:42:33) with 5% AC-H3PO4 and incubated at 180°C for 60min. Under these conditions, 41.2wt.% cellulose was obtained in enriched solid pulp with the average glucan content of 75.9%. The majority of the hemicelluloses was hydrolysed into the aqueous-methanol phase, which contained 17.8wt.% monomeric xylose and xylooligomers while 13.7wt.% lignin was separated into the organic phase. The heterogeneous acid-promoter process is a potent alternative to corrosive homogeneous acids for lignocellulose fractionation in integrated biorefineries. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Renewable energy has gained great attention and interest in recent years due to growing energy consumption and greater environmental concerns. Biomass is regarded as a promising candidate for replacing fossil-derived products, through either thermal, biological, or physical processes. This review focuses on thermal processing of biomass in molten salts for production of renewable fuels and chemicals, concepts based on dispersion of biomass or waste particles in a molten salt bath. Inorganic salts have very high heat capacities and good thermal stability at high temperatures. Some molten salts have catalytic properties, and in thermal processing of biomass, the product yields and compound compositions of products can be adjusted by varying compositions and amount of molten salts. In addition, molten salts will retain noxious contaminants, and it is thus possible to use difficult convertible- and/or contaminated biomass as feedstock. © The Author 2012.

AB  - The disposal of wastes, such as municipal solid waste, wastewater treatment sludge, agricultural waste, plastics, and tires, is becoming a serious problem in many industrialized and public sectors. Although these wastes are reused, there are still an abundant amount left posing environmental and health problems. A thermal treatment method to convert such wastes to energy, such as pyrolysis, has recently become an attractive alternative for the wastes disposal because both energy and usable by-products can be produced. The use of microwave for pyrolysis, although at its infancy for waste treatment, has several advantages compared to conventional heating, especially time saving due to volumetric heating. Several microwave pyrolysis of wastes has been investigated, including coffee hulls, wood, coal, sewage sludge, hospital waste, plastic wastes, corn cobs, and rice straw. The most important factors influencing the yield of product during the pyrolysis is temperature in a range from 200 to 1,000C according to product preference. High temperature favors gas products, whereas lower temperature favors liquid products. Comparatively, microwave pyrolysis produced gas with higher hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) content compared to conventional heating. Liquid product also has shown a considerable decrease in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons production, which is of known carcinogens. Solid products also showed promising characteristics for adsorbent and carbon sequestration. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Fractions of waste square timber and waste ordinary plywood were pyrolyzed in a pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor and a dual char separation system. The maximum bio-oil yield of about 65. wt.% was obtained at reaction temperatures of 450-500 °C for both feed materials. For quantitative analysis of bio-oil, the relative response factor (RRF) of each component was calculated using an effective carbon number (ECN) that was multiplied by the peak area of each component detected by a GC-FID. The predominant compounds in the bio-oils were methyl acetate, acids, hydroxyacetone, furfural, non-aromatic ketones, levoglucosan and phenolic compounds. The WOP-derived bio-oil showed it to have relatively high nitrogen content. Increasing the reaction temperature was shown to have little effect on nitrogen removal. The ash and solid contents of both bio-oils were below 0.1. wt.% due to the excellent performance of the char separation system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, the feasibility of crude Jatropha curcas L. oil (CJCO) as raw material to produce biodiesel under low-frequency ultrasonic irradiation (40 kHz) assisted is examined. A two-step transesterifi cation process (acid catalyzed esterifi cation followed by alkaline catalyzed transesterifi cation) is employed to produce biodiesel. In the fi rst step, the high level of free fatty acid (FFA), 12.5%, of CJCO is successfully reduced to less than 3% by acid catalyzed esterifi cation with 15% w/w methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration 3.0% w/w, ultrasonic irradiation time 20 min at under reaction temperature 30°C, which are selected as optimum conditions for the acid catalyzed esterification. Then, the second step, alkaline catalyzed transesterifi cation is carried out as methanol to oil ratio 15% w/w, catalyst concentration 1% w/w, reaction temperature 30°C and ultrasonic irradiation time 30 min. This results to high percentage of conversion to biodiesel about 98%. Comparing the results obtained under the ultrasonic irradiation in this study with those under conventional stirring conditions, ultrasonic irradiation technique signifi cantly illustrated the higher effi ciency than the conventional method, especially for the high FFA oil. © 2012 by Japan Oil Chemists' Society.

AB  - A two-stage hybrid fractionation process was investigated to produce cellulosic ethanol and furfural from corn stover. In the first stage, zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) was used to selectively solubilize hemicellulose. During the second stage, the remaining treated solids were converted into ethanol using commercial cellulase and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or recombinant Escherichia coli, KO11. This hybrid fractionation process recovered 93.8% of glucan, 89.7% of xylan, 71.1% of arabinan, and 74.9% of lignin under optimal reaction conditions (1st stage: 5% acidified ZnCl 2, 7.5 ml/min, 150 °C (10 min) and 170 °C (10 min); 2nd stage: simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using S. cerevisiae). The furfural yield from the hemicellulose hydrolysates was 58%. The SSF of the treated solids resulted in 69-98% of the theoretical maximum ethanol yields based on the glucan content in the treated solids. After fermentation, the solid residues contained primarily lignin. Based on the total lignin in untreated corn stover, the lignin recovery yield was 74.9%. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A microbial fuel cell (MFC) was designed in which fuel is generated in the cell by the enzyme glucoamylase, which is displayed on the surface of yeast. The enzyme digests starch specifically into monomeric glucose units and as a consequence enables further glucose oxidation by microorganisms present in the MFC anode. The oxidative enzyme glucose oxidase was coupled to the glucoamylase digestive enzyme. When both enzymes were displayed on the surface of yeast cells in a mixed culture, superior fuel-cell performance was observed in comparison with other combinations of yeast cells, unmodified yeast, or pure enzymes. The feasibility of the use of the green macroalgae Ulva lactuca in such a genetically modified MFC was also demonstrated. Herein, we report the performance of such fuel cells as a proof of concept for the enzymatic digestion of complex organic fuels in the anode of MFCs to render the fuel more available to microorganisms.

AB  - The fatty acid methyl esters of vegetable oils and animal fats, more commonly known as biodiesel, represent a renewable, biodegradable, noninflammable, and low toxicity alternative to diesel. In this study, the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) and the interaction radius of the solute sphere (R0) were determined for the biodiesel derived from soybean oil, coconut oil, palm oil, and castor oil, using 45 solvents and solvent mixtures. The values for the HSPs and R0 obtained for the different biodiesels were soybean (15.03, 3.69, 8.92, and 11.33; MPa(1/2)); coconut (15.12, 3.99, 9.25, and 10.92; MPa(1/2)); palm (15.43, 5.28, 6.61, and 10.54; MPa(1/2)); and castor (16.10, 6.72, 9.11, and 11.78; MPa(1/2)). The HSPs of four biofuels were also determined using the average values of the fatty esters of each oil, calculated using group contribution. Subsequently, the solubilities of the biofuels were predicted using the van Krevelen-Hoftyzer, Greenhalgh, and Bagley approaches. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Because of the world energy crisis, many countries have initiated a series of measures to resolve this problem through alternative energy resources. Biodiesel as an alternate fuel has received much attention in recent years. A number of reports are available on the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils and related sources but its production from microalgae is a highly prospective field. Microalgae can produce and accumulate lipids within their cells. These lipids on transesterification yields biodiesel. Hence, microalgae have the capacity to produce more biodiesel per acre land than any other plants or living organisms. This manuscript deals with chemical and biochemical aspects of microalgae-based biodiesel and methodology of its production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Architectonics of the paper-structured catalyst for the application to the biofuel reformer or direct internal reforming SOFC (DIRSOFC) was studied. Inorganic fiber network, "paper", composed of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fiber (Zf), alumina fiber (Af) and inorganic binder (Al 2O3 sol (As) or ZrO2 sol (Zs) or CeO 2 sol (Cs)) was prepared by a simple paper-making process. Then, the catalytic activities of the Ni and Ni-MgO loaded papers called "paper-structured catalysts (PSCs)" for the steam reforming of biodiesel fuels (BDFs) were evaluated. Ni-MgO loaded PSC using Cs as an inorganic binder, Ni-MgO/ZfAfCs, exhibited excellent performance over Ru/γAl2O3 catalyst beads. Formation of light hydrocarbons, especially C2H4, was eliminated and water-gas shift reaction was more promoted compared to the catalyst beads.© 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - A small scale biodiesel production facility based on the Mcgyan process is simulated in HYSYS and a follow-up techno-economic analysis is performed. Two feedstocks are analyzed: a soybean oil and waste cooking oil analogs. It is found that the soybean oil based process is not economical at such small scales, whereas the waste oil case has an NPV of $618K with an internal rate of return of 80%. The economic feasibility of a distributed system of small scale biodiesel production facilities in Greater London using waste vegetable cooking feedstock is also investigated. It is found that this system is feasible with a total of 20 installed facilities and an NPV of $1.1MM. A scheme is then implemented which reduces the total capital expenditure per facility based on the mass production of similar facilities. As expected, this scheme reduces the total capital cost of the system. Finally, a Monte Carlo scheme is implemented to study how the variability in economic parameters affects the system. It is found that the system is most sensitive to the sale price of biodiesel but that in all cases a positive NPV is returned. These analyses support the feasibility of small scale locally based biofuel production from locally sourced feestocks. © 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are formed during waste incineration and in waste-to-energy boilers. Incomplete combustion, too short residence times at low combustion temperatures (&lt;700°C), incineration of electronic waste and plastic waste containing chlorine are all factors influencing the formation of PCDD/Fs in boilers. The impact of chlorine and catalysing metals (such as copper and iron) in the fuel on PCDD/F formation was studied in a 12MWth circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. The PCDD/F concentrations in the raw gas after the convection pass of the boiler and in the fly ashes were compared. The fuel types were a so-called clean biomass with low content of chlorine, biomass with enhanced content of chlorine from supply of PVC, and solid recovered fuel (SRF) which is a waste fuel containing higher concentrations of both chlorine, and catalysing metals. The PCDD/F formation increased for the biomass with enhanced chlorine content and it was significantly reduced in the raw gas as well as in the fly ashes by injection of ammonium sulphate. A link, the alkali chloride track, is demonstrated between the level of alkali chlorides in the gas phase, the chlorine content in the deposits in the convection pass and finally the PCDD/F formation. The formation of PCDD/Fs was also significantly reduced during co-combustion of SRF with municipal sewage sludge (MSS) compared to when SRF was fired without MSS as additional fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work is to explore the potential of producing biodiesel and valuable co-products from the biomass of Schizochytrium mangrovei PQ6 which was isolated from Phu Quoc Island, Kien Giang province, Vietnam. This microalga contains high lipid content (up to 70% of dry cell weight) and high level of total fatty acids, which is ideal for making biodiesel. The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from this marine microalga resulted in a yield of 88% based on algal oil and 44% based on algal biomass. The process of separating the obtained FAME into a first fraction enriched with saturated FAME (SFAME) and a second fraction enriched with unsaturated FAME (UFAME) was then investigated to exploit the valuable co-products. The obtained results shown that the mass fraction of SFAME and UFAME were 70% and 30%, respectively. The UFAME fraction contains a high content of DHA (accounting for 69.000% of TFAs). The test results of the SFAME fraction indicated that specific gravity at 15°C, flash point, water and sediment, kinematic viscosity at 40°C, sulfated ash, sulfur, copper strip corrosion at 50°C, cetane number, carbon residue, iodine number, workmanship meet Vietnam Biodiesel B100 Standard. Moreover, the utilization of waste glycerol from biodiesel process as carbon source for the cultivation of the microalgae S. mangrovei PQ6 and Spirulina platensis was also investigated. © 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - The problems associated with the high content of organic acids present in bio-oil can potentially be alleviated through the use of the ketonization reaction. While there have been previous reports that ketonization reactions are sensitive to the surface morphology of the respective catalyst, these studies have largely been performed in idealized conditions. Here, shape selective ceria nanocatalysts were synthesized and examined in both condensed and vapor phase ketonization reactions with the model bio-oil compound, acetic acid. It was found that in lower temperature (503 K) condensed-phase conditions the morphology of the catalyst was of less importance due to crystal disruption from metal carboxylate formation. However, the bulk structure was maintained to a greater extent in the higher temperature (623 K) vapor phase conditions. This work demonstrated that surface morphology of the ceria catalyst did not play a significant role in the ketonization reaction. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although biomethanol production has attracted most of the attention in the past years, there is a current trend for the synthesis of higher alcohols (i.e. ethanol, plus C3-C4) from biomass gasification. These compounds could be used directly as fuel or fuel additives for octane or cetane number enhancement. These also serve as important intermediates for the chemical industry. In this paper a comparison is performed between the different process configurations a higher alcohols production plant from biomass gasification can take. These options are modelled in Aspenplus™; all steps and important unit operations are presented with the aim to correctly evaluate the peripheral energy requirements and conclude with the overall thermodynamic limitations of the processes. The differentiation between black liquor and solid biomass gasification, the type of catalyst employed, and the effect of the recycling scheme adopted for the reutilization of unreacted syngas are evaluated. The design has to cope with the limited yields and poor selectivity of catalysts developed so far. The gas cleaning is different depending on the different requirements of the catalysts as far as H2S purity. The process modelling results reveal that the hydrogenation of CO to higher alcohols is favoured by high pressure, temperature around 325 °C and high reactor residence times. A biorefinery using modified Fisher-Tropsch (FT) catalysts (MoS2) prevail over modified MeOH catalyst (Cu-Zn based) for HA production. The efficiency of HA production in HHV terms can reach up to 25%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This analysis identifies the sensitivity of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway to facility location. The economic feasibility of a 2000 metric ton per day fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing biorefinery is quantified based on 30 different state-specific facility locations within the United States. We calculate the 20-year internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) for each location scenario as a function of state- and region-specific factors. This analysis demonstrates that biorefinery IRR and NPV are very sensitive to bio-oil yield, feedstock cost, location capital cost factor, and transportation fuel market value. The IRRs and NPVs generated for each scenario vary widely as a result, ranging from a low of 7.4% and -$79.5 million in Illinois to a high of 17.2% and $165.5 million in Georgia. The results indicate that the economic feasibility of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway is strongly influenced by facility location within the United States. This result could have important implications for cellulosic biofuel commercialization under the revised Renewable Fuel Standard. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has been produced from various vegetable oils, such as palm, canola (rapeseed), cottonseed, sunflower, and soybean oils as well as a variety of less common oils. This study evaluated the production of biodiesel using tea seed (Camellia sinensis) oil as a raw material. Methyl ester was produced by transesterification of tea seed oil with methanol in the presence of a catalyst (NaOH). The fuel properties such as pour point (PP), kinematic viscosity, cetane number, flash point, density, copper strip corrosion, and heating value were determined and discussed in light of American (ASTM D6751) and European (EN 14214) biodiesel standards. Not only the specifications of pure biodiesel but also its blends with diesel fuel were analyzed. Biodiesel produced from tea seed oil exhibit a low pour point value of -5°C, one of the lowest found for a biodiesel fuel. The cold flow properties of tea seed methyl ester (TSME) demonstrate its operational viability during the cold weather conditions. As a result, tea seed oil, as agricultural crop, might be a reasonable raw material for the biodiesel production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The design of biofuel cell anodes with substantially decreased potential is a prerequisite for the development of biofuel cells with large open-circuit voltage and power density. Redox polymers with covalently attached phenothiazine derivatives such of thionine acetate, toluidine blue, azure B simultaneously providing epoxide functions for covalent binding to suitably modified electrode surfaces and crosslinking were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to transfer electrons from the FAD cofactor of the flavodehydrogenase domain of cellobiose dehydrogenase from Myriococcum thermophilum (FAD-MtCDH), the flavodehydrogenase domain of cellobiose dehydrogenase from Corynascus thermophilus (FAD-CtCDH), or glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (GOx). Polymer/enzyme films were covalently bound via polymer bound epoxy groups to terminal amino functions introduced to graphite electrode surfaces by electrochemically induced grafting of diaminoheptane or Boc-protected ethylene diamine (EDA). The electrodes were optimized for biocatalytic glucose oxidation with respect to the hydrophilicity of the polymer backbone, the nature of the phenothiazine derivative, the pH value, as well as the relative amount of enzyme, polymer and crosslinker. Biofuel cells based on toluidine blue-modified redox polymers with integrated FAD-MtCDH, FAD-CtCDH, or GOx in combination with a bilirubin oxidase based biocathode exhibited open-circuit voltages of more than 0.7 V and maximum power densities in the range of 4 to 6 μW cm -2 at a pH value of 7.8. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is increasingly utilized as an alternative to petroleum-based polymers in order to reduce their impact on the environment. The monomer of PLA is mainly produced from corn, which, in addition to its food utilization, can be also used for the production of bioethanol or biofuels. In this work the depolymerization (chemical recycling) of PLA pellets in a batch reactor at temperatures near the melting temperature of solid PLA has been investigated to produce lactic acid. New experimental data are presented and a kinetic model is provided for a first analysis. With a residence time less than 120 min, a yield of lactic acid greater than 95 % has been obtained at temperatures of 160 and 180 °C for pressure equal to water vapour pressure and a water/PLA ratio by weight equal ~10. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The interactions between oxygen permeation and homogeneous fuel oxidation reactions on the sweep side of an ion transport membrane (ITM) are examined using a comprehensive model, which couples the dependency of the oxygen permeation rate on the membrane surface conditions and detailed chemistry and transport in the vicinity of the membrane. We assume that the membrane surface is not catalytic to hydrocarbon or syngas oxidation. Results show that increasing the sweep gas inlet temperature and fuel concentration enhances oxygen permeation substantially. This is accomplished through promoting oxidation reactions (oxygen consumption) and the transport of the products and reaction heat towards the membrane, which lowers the oxygen concentration and increases the gas temperature near the membrane. Faster reactions at higher fuel concentration and higher inlet gas temperature support substantial fuel conversion and lead to a higher oxygen permeation flux without the contribution of surface catalytic activity. Beyond a certain maximum in the fuel concentration, extensive heat loss to the membrane (and feed side) reduces the oxidation kinetic rates and limits oxygen permeation as the reaction front reaches the membrane. The sweep gas flow rate and channel height have moderate impacts on oxygen permeation and fuel conversion due to the residence time requirements for the chemical reactions and the location of the reaction zone relative to the membrane surface. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An active heterogeneous catalyst, namely 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (TMG) immobilized on mesoporous SBA-15 silica (SBA-15-pr-TMG), was prepared and the catalytic activity was investigated for transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. The heterogeneous catalysts were characterized using Hammett titration method, Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. It is shown that the activity of the catalysts for the transesterification reaction is closely related to their basic properties. By using this catalyst, an environmentally benign process for biodiesel production in a heterogeneous manner was developed. When the reaction was carried out at reflux of methanol, with a molar ratio of methanol to soybean oil of 15:1, a reaction time 12h and a catalyst amount 5wt%, the oil conversion of 91.7% was achieved. The catalyst could be recovered easily and reused without significant degradation in activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel cells are important to generate alternative energy. This paper evaluates the electroactivity of a carbon cloth platform containing immobilized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), a NAD+- dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (ADH), poly-methylene green (poly-MG), and an anchoring agent (PAMAM dendrimer, modified NAFION (m-NAFION), or polypyrrole (poly-Pyr)). The PAMAM dendrimer is an excellent medium to achieve ADH immobilization on the carbon nanostructured platform. We obtained power density and open circuit potential (OCP) of 0.278 ± 0.038 mW cm-2 and 0.459 ± 0.025 V, respectively, for PAMAM modified with MWCNTs. This new anode configuration is potentially applicable for small energy devices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cu, Ni and Fe oxides supported on ceria were investigated for their performance as oxygen carriers during the chemical looping combustion of biomass-derived syngas. A complex gas mixture containing CO, H2, CO2, CH4 and other hydrocarbons was used to simulate the complex fuel gas environment derived from biomass gasification. Results show that the transfer of the stored oxygen into oxidants for the supported Cu and Ni oxides at 800°C for the combustion of syngas was effective (&gt;85%). The unsupported Cu oxide showed high oxygen carrying capacity but particle sintering was observed at 800°C. A reaction temperature of 950°C was required for the supported Fe oxides to transfer the stored oxygen into oxidants effectively. Also, for the complex fuel gas environment, the supported Ni oxide was somewhat effective in reforming CH4 and other light hydrocarbons into CO, which may have benefits for the reduction of tar produced during biomass pyrolysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The base (such as CaO)-catalyzed heterogeneous preparation of biodiesel encounters a number of obstacles including the need for CaO pretreatment and the reactions being incomplete (typically 90-95% yields). In this study, a number of glymes were investigated as benign solvents for the CaO-catalyzed transesterification of soybean oil into biodiesel with a high substrate loading (typically soybean oil &gt;50% v/v). The triglyceride-dissolving capability of glymes led to a much faster reaction rate (&gt;98% conversions in 4h) than in methanol alone (typically 24h) and minimized the saponification reaction when catalyzed by anhydrous CaO or commercial lime without pre-activation. The use of glyme (e.g. P2) as co-solvent also activates commercial lime to become an effective catalyst without calcination pretreatment. The SEM images suggest a dissolution-agglomeration process of CaO surface in the presence of P2, which could remove the CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 layer coated on the surface of lime. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel cells (BFCs) use enzymes and microbial cells to produce energy from bioavailable substrates and treat various wastewaters, and cathodic oxygen reduction is a key factor governing the efficiency of BFCs. In this study, we demonstrated that a green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, could directly mediate oxygen reduction. Cyclic voltammogram analysis revealed that the C. reinhardtii biofilm formed on a solid electrode was responsible for oxygen reduction without dosing of electron mediator. Furthermore, 4-electron oxygen reduction pathway was found in this self-sustained, light-responded BFC. The results of this study could expand our understanding and viewpoints of biocathode catalysis, which is essential for novel catalyst design and development for BFCs. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The chemical composition of liquid products of cellulose and lignin co-pyrolysis with polypropylene at 450°C with and without the potassium carbonate or zinc chloride as an catalyst was investigated. The yield of liquid products of pyrolysis was in the range of 26-45 wt% and their form was liquid or semi-solid highly depending on the composition of sample and pyrolysis conditions. The potassium carbonate and zinc chloride addition to blends has also influenced the range of samples decomposition as well as the chemical composition of resulted bio-oils. All bio-oils from biopolymer and polypropylene mixtures were three-phase (water, oil and solid). While zinc chloride acted as catalyst, all bio-oils obtained from biopolymer and polypropylene mixtures were yellow liquids with well-separated water and oil phases. All analyses proved that the structure and quality of bio-oil strongly depends on both the composition of the blend and the presence of the additive. The FT-IR and GC-MS analyses of oils showed that oxygen functionalities and hydrocarbons contents highly depend on the composition of biomass/polypropylene mixture. Results confirmed the significant removal and/or transformation of oxygen containing organic compounds, i.e. levoglucosan, 1,6-anhydro-β-d-glucofuranose and phenol derivatives due to the zinc chloride presence during pyrolysis process. All analyses showed that zinc chloride as catalyst was generally much more effective for removal of hydroxyl and methoxy groups than was potassium carbonate. It was demonstrated in this study that catalysts used in present work lead to the increased char yield and improved the fuel quality of bio-oil. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The rapid determination of the release of structural sugars from biomass feedstocks is an important enabling technology for the development of cellulosic biofuels. An assay that is used to determine sugar release for large numbers of samples must be robust, rapid, and easy to perform, and must use modest amounts of the samples to be tested.In this work we present a laboratory-scale combined pretreatment and saccharification assay that can be used as a biomass feedstock screening tool. The assay uses a commercially available automated solvent extraction system for pretreatment followed by a small-scale enzymatic hydrolysis step. The assay allows multiple samples to be screened simultaneously, and uses only ∼3 g of biomass per sample. If the composition of the biomass sample is known, the results of the assay can be expressed as reactivity (fraction of structural carbohydrate present in the biomass sample released as monomeric sugars). Results: We first present pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis experiments on a set of representative biomass feedstock samples (corn stover, poplar, sorghum, switchgrass) in order to put the assay in context, and then show the results of the assay applied to approximately 150 different feedstock samples covering 5 different materials. From the compositional analysis data we identify a positive correlation between lignin and structural carbohydrates, and from the reactivity data we identify a negative correlation between both carbohydrate and lignin content and total reactivity. The negative correlation between lignin content and total reactivity suggests that lignin may interfere with sugar release, or that more mature samples (with higher structural sugars) may have more recalcitrant lignin. Conclusions: The assay presented in this work provides a robust and straightforward method to measure the sugar release after pretreatment and saccharification that can be used as a biomass feedstock screening tool. We demonstrated the utility of the assay by identifying correlations between feedstock composition and reactivity in a population of 150 samples. © 2013 Wolfrum et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this research work is to investigate the possibility of using methyl esters from animal fats as an alternative fuel for diesel. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel produced from different kinds of vegetable oils and animal fats. It is an oxygenated, non-toxic, sulfur free, biodegradable, and renewable fuel which can be used in diesel engines without any significant modification. In this research work, waste pork lard methyl ester (WPLME) is obtained from inedible animal tallow, namely, waste pork lard by base-catalyzed transesterification with methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst. Properties of pure diesel, pure biodiesel (B100), and its blends of 25%, 50%, and 75% by volume called B25, B50, and B75 are determined. The effects of waste pork lard methyl ester (biodiesel) addition to pure diesel on the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of naturally aspirated, direct injection, diesel engine have been experimentally investigated at the maximum torque and constant engine speed of 1500 rpm. The experimental test results showed that the addition of WPLME to diesel slightly decreases the brake thermal efficiency of the engine and increases specific fuel consumption when compared to pure diesel. This is due to lower calorific value of WPLME. The brake thermal efficiency is decreased by 6.2% and specific fuel consumption is increased by 23.5% for pure WPLME (B100) when compared to pure diesel at full load of the engine. However for B25 biodiesel blend, the brake thermal efficiency is very close to pure diesel at full load of the engine. The significant improvement in reduction of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and smoke emission is found for WPLME and its blends during higher loading conditions. For pure WPLME, CO, HC, NOx, and smoke emission are decreased by 23.1%, 31.5%, 5.15%, and 64%, respectively, when compared to pure diesel at full load of the engine. WPLME exhibited lower heat release rate and shorter ignition delay when compared to pure diesel at full load conditions. On the whole, methyl esters of waste pork lard and its blends can be used as an alternative fuel for diesel in direct injection diesel engine without any significant engine modification. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Though n-butanol has been proposed as a potential transportation biofuel, its toxicity often causes oxidative stress in the host microorganism and is considered one of the bottlenecks preventing its efficient mass production. Results: To relieve the oxidative stress in the host cell, metallothioneins (MTs), which are known as scavengers for reactive oxygen species (ROS), were engineered in E. coli hosts for both cytosolic and outer-membrane-targeted (osmoregulatory membrane protein OmpC fused) expression. Metallothioneins from human (HMT), mouse (MMT), and tilapia fish (TMT) were tested. The host strain expressing membrane-targeted TMT showed the greatest ability to reduce oxidative stresses induced by n-butanol, ethanol, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, and nickel. The same strain also allowed for an increased growth rate of recombinant E. coli under n-butanol stress. Further experiments indicated that the TMT-fused OmpC protein could not only function in ROS scavenging but also regulate either glycine betaine (GB) or glucose uptake via osmosis, and the dual functional fusion protein could contribute in an enhancement of the host microorganism's growth rate. Conclusions: The abilities of scavenging intracellular or extracellular ROS by these engineering E. coli were examined, and TMT show the best ability among three MTs. Additionally, the membrane-targeted fusion protein, OmpC-TMT, improved host tolerance up to 1.5% n-butanol above that of TMT which is only 1%. These results presented indicate potential novel approaches for engineering stress tolerant microorganism strains. © 2013 Chin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: One route for producing cellulosic biofuels is by the fermentation of lignocellulose-derived sugars generated from a pretreatment that can be effectively coupled with an enzymatic hydrolysis of the plant cell wall. While woody biomass exhibits a number of positive agronomic and logistical attributes, these feedstocks are significantly more recalcitrant to chemical pretreatments than herbaceous feedstocks, requiring higher chemical and energy inputs to achieve high sugar yields from enzymatic hydrolysis. We previously discovered that alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment catalyzed by copper(II) 2,2-bipyridine complexes significantly improves subsequent enzymatic glucose and xylose release from hybrid poplar heartwood and sapwood relative to uncatalyzed AHP pretreatment at modest reaction conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure). In the present work, the reaction conditions for this catalyzed AHP pretreatment were investigated in more detail with the aim of better characterizing the relationship between pretreatment conditions and subsequent enzymatic sugar release. Results: We found that for a wide range of pretreatment conditions, the catalyzed pretreatment resulted in significantly higher glucose and xylose enzymatic hydrolysis yields (as high as 80% for both glucose and xylose) relative to uncatalyzed pretreatment (up to 40% for glucose and 50% for xylose). We identified that the extent of improvement in glucan and xylan yield using this catalyzed pretreatment approach was a function of pretreatment conditions that included H2O2 loading on biomass, catalyst concentration, solids concentration, and pretreatment duration. Based on these results, several important improvements in pretreatment and hydrolysis conditions were identified that may have a positive economic impact for a process employing a catalyzed oxidative pretreatment. These improvements include identifying that: (1) substantially lower H 2O2 loadings can be used that may result in up to a 50-65% decrease in H2O2 application (from 100 mg H 2O2/g biomass to 35-50 mg/g) with only minor losses in glucose and xylose yield, (2) a 60% decrease in the catalyst concentration from 5.0 mM to 2.0 mM (corresponding to a catalyst loading of 25 μmol/g biomass to 10 μmol/g biomass) can be achieved without a subsequent loss in glucose yield, (3) an order of magnitude improvement in the time required for pretreatment (minutes versus hours or days) can be realized using the catalyzed pretreatment approach, and (4) enzyme dosage can be reduced to less than 30 mg protein/g glucan and potentially further with only minor losses in glucose and xylose yields. In addition, we established that the reaction rate is improved in both catalyzed and uncatalyzed AHP pretreatment by increased solids concentrations. Conclusions: This work explored the relationship between reaction conditions impacting a catalyzed oxidative pretreatment of woody biomass and identified that significant decreases in the H2O 2, catalyst, and enzyme loading on the biomass as well as decreases in the pretreatment time could be realized with only minor losses in the subsequent sugar released enzymatically. Together these changes would have positive implications for the economics of a process based on this pretreatment approach. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Aldehyde inhibitors such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are generated from biomass pretreatment. Scheffersomyces stipitis is able to reduce furfural and HMF to less toxic furanmethanol and furan-2,5-dimethanol; however, the enzymes involved in the reductive reaction still remain unknown. In this study, transcription responses of two known and five putative alcohol dehydrogenase genes from S. stipitis were analyzed under furfural and HMF stress conditions. All the seven alcohol dehydrogenase genes were also cloned and overexpressed for their activity analyses. Our results indicate that transcriptions of SsADH4 and SsADH6 were highly induced under furfural and HMF stress conditions, and the proteins encoded by them exhibited NADH- and/or NADPH-dependent activities for furfural and HMF reduction, respectively. For furfural reduction, NADH-dependent activity was also observed in SsAdh1p and NAD(P)H-dependent activities were also observed in SsAdh5p and SsAdh7p. For HMF reduction, NADPH-dependent activities were also observed in SsAdh5p and SsAdh7p. SsAdh4p displayed the highest NADPH-dependent specific activity and catalytic efficiency for reduction of both furfural and HMF among the seven alcohol dehydrogenases. Enzyme activities of all SsADH proteins were more stable under acidic condition. For most SsADH proteins, the optimum temperature for enzyme activities was 30 C and more than 50 % enzyme activities remained at 60 C. Reduction activities of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, isovaleraldehyde, benzaldehyde, and phenylacetaldehyde were also observed in some SsADH proteins. Our results indicate that multiple alcohol dehydrogenases in S. stipitis are involved in the detoxification of aldehyde inhibitors derived from lignocellulosic biomass conversion. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This work presents a kinetic model for the aqueous phase reforming of sorbitol that uses a lumping scheme of intermediates and approximates the complex path to gas products via a reforming route and liquid oxygenate route including hydrodeoxygenation, decarbonylation and dehydrogenation reactions. The model was tested at temperatures ranging from 473 K to 523 K, using monometallic Ni and bimetallic Ni-Pd catalysts supported on γ-Al 2O3, ZrO2 and CeO2. The model revealed that the relevant competing paths were a function of the composition of catalyst and the conversion to the carbon gaseous products. Paths of reforming and CO2 methanation were more important than decarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation at small conversions for all catalysts whereas the hydrodeoxygenation-decarbonylation towards alkanes release was more competitive than the reforming at high conversions with Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-Pd catalysts supported on ZrO2 and CeO2 but was still less competitive with Ni-Pd catalyst supported on γ-Al2O 3. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of a proposed simple bio-oil upgrading technique and test its suitability for bio-oil products. The upgrading technique consisted of vacuum distillation for preliminary water removal, deep water removal, using etylchloride, and catalytic esterification and neutralisation. Two bio-oil samples were produced from slow pyrolysis of sawdust pellets and fast pyrolysis of wheat straw powder. Some activated carbon obtained from slow pyrolysis was the catalyst carrier and p-toluene sulfonic acid was the catalyst. The conditions of the esterification reaction were identified by serious experiments. As a result, the qualities of both bio-oil samples are significantly improved through the upgrade. The heat value of both oils ranged from 14-17MJkg-1 to 25-29MJkg-1. The final neutralisation step using triethylamine increased the oil pH value close to neutral. The chemical/physical properties of the produced bio-oils were in accordance with the standards for engine fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The marine transportation sector, responsible for consuming a large amount of degraded fuel oil, is one of the major contributors to global warming and air pollution. These effects are responsible for a large number of premature deaths in the US and throughout the world. The international regulation known as the 2008 MARPOL Annex VI Amendment, which is enforced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has imposed progressively more stringent limits on emissions from marine vessels. Biodiesel, an environmentally friendly, renewable, clean, and low-carbon fuel, is regarded as the most appropriate alternative fuel for marine vessels. However, the promotion of biodiesel use in water-borne transportation is considered to be a bigger challenge than its more successful development in land-based applications. The major obstacles to promoting biodiesel blends in marine transportation are examined in this study. The strategies proposed to overcome these obstacles include the comprehensive field testing of the biodiesel blends in marine vessels of various representative types, establishing a marine-grade biodiesel specification, increasing the price competitiveness of marine-grade biodiesel by reducing its manufacturing costs, providing tax cuts, exemptions, and government subsidies, increasing the amount of biodiesel use in marine applications, adopting compatible elastomers and metallic materials in fuel feeding systems and storage tanks, applying approaches or technologies suitable for improving the low-temperature fluidity of biodiesel blends, and increasing the added value of purified glycerol. The effective application of these strategies will enable the more widespread use of biodiesel in marine applications, significantly reducing emissions from ships, improving global air quality, protecting the ecological environment and improving people's health. © 2013.

AB  - An engine cylinder liner-piston ring tribotester was used to investigate the effects of different diesel fuels on the tribological properties of a cylinder liner-piston ring. The wear surface morphology and roughness were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope and a surface profiler. The chemical structures and components of the tested oils were characterized using a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The chemical components and element distribution on the rubbed surface were studied using energy-dispersive X-ray spectra. The results showed that the cylinder liner-piston ring lubricated with bio-oil (BO) had a lower friction coefficient but higher wear mass and greater surface roughness than one lubricated with diesel oil (DO), and emulsified bio-oil (EBO) can decrease the wear weight loss and surface roughness of the friction pairs. The protective film created by BO between the cylinder liner and piston ring lowered the friction coefficient due to the adsorption of polar groups of carboxylic acids and alcohols on the rubbing surface. However, these oxygen-containing organics in the BO also corroded the rubbing surfaces, which resulted in higher wear mass compared to that caused by DO. The main wear mechanisms can be identified as corrosive wear for BO and abrasive wear for EBO and DO. The EBO showed promising potential becaus its use resulted in lower corrosion and lower wear. © Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers.

AB  - The acidic hydrolysis of biomass generates numerous inhibitors of fermentation, which adversely affect cell growth and metabolism. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of fermentation inhibitors on growth and glucose consumption by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also conducted in situ adsorption during cell cultivation in synthetic broth containing fermentation inhibitors. In order to evaluate the effect of in situ adsorption on cell growth, five inhibitors, namely 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid, furfural, formic acid, and acetic acid, were introduced into synthetic broth. The existence of fermentation inhibitors during cell culture adversely affects cell growth and sugar consumption. Furfural, formic acid, and acetic acid were the most potent inhibitors in our culture system. The in situ adsorption of inhibitors by the addition of activated charcoal to the synthetic broth increased cell growth and sugar consumption. Our results indicate that detoxification of fermentation media by in situ adsorption may be useful for enhancing biofuel production. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Turnip oil (TO; Raphanus sativus L.) produces seeds that contain around 26 wt% of inedible base stock that are suitable as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. A turnip oil methyl ester (TME) was prepared from acid-catalyzed pretreated TO in an effort to evaluate important fuel properties of turnip oil-based biodiesel, such as kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point (PP), cold filter plugging point, acid value, oxidative stability and lubricity. A comparison was made with soybean oil methyl esters (SME) as per biodiesel fuel standards such as ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. TME was characterized using FTIR, HPLC and 1H NMR. Except PP property, SME displays superior fuel properties compared to TME. Blends (B5 and B20) of TME in ultra-low sulphur diesel fuel (ULSD) were also assessed for the aforesaid fuel properties and compared to an analogous set of blends of soybean oil methyl ester in ULSD as per petro diesel fuel standards such as ASTM D975 and D7467. TME B5 blends in ULSD displayed improved PP property in comparison to neat ULSD and blends of SME in ULSD. It was demonstrated that the B5 and B20 blends of TME in ULSD had acceptable fuel properties as per ASTM D975 (for B5 blend) and ASTM D7467 (for B20 blend). In summary, turnip oil has potential as an alternative, non-food feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Seed processing and oil pre-treatment were optimised to improve the yield and quality of biodiesel obtained from Sinapis alba. By using solvent extraction or mechanical pressing followed by solvent extraction, an oil extraction yield greater than 41 wt.% and a de-oiled cake with less than 2 wt.% of oil could be obtained. The oil characterisation showed that erucic acid was the most predominant fatty acid in the oil composition (>50 wt.%). A high phosphorous content (>36 mg/kg) and acid value (>1.5 mg KOH/g) were obtained. To obtain a biodiesel with a high methyl ester content, it was necessary to carry out an oil refining process (acid degumming and chemical de-acidification) followed by a standard transesterification with methanol and sodium methoxide as a catalyst. Finally, the quality of the purified biodiesel was tested according to the EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. The results of this work revealed the possibility of using the oil from Sinapis alba seeds as a suitable source for biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to improve the property of Nannochloropsis oculata as biodiesel feedstock, a L9(34) orthogonal test on limited nitrogen supplementation (0, 0.22 and 0.44mmolNL-1), high iron concentration (1.2×10-2, 1.2×10-1 and 1.2mmolFeL-1) and culture temperature (10, 20 and 30°C) was conducted to select the most effective combinational measurement. Results showed that microalgae displayed the highest total lipid content (60.44±0.68%), the highest neutral lipid proportion (90.74±0.18%), the highest lipid yield (152.70±7.40mgL-1) and the largest cetane number (CN, 64.34±0.13) under different combined conditions. There were significant interaction among nitrogen supplementation, iron concentration and culture temperature on the lipid yield and CN of N. oculata. Nitrogen supplementation, followed by iron concentration and temperature orderly, was the most influential factor in lipid yield. It is therefore suggested that the combination of 0.44mmolNL-1, 1.2×10-1mmolFeL-1 and 20°C was the best measurement for improving the property of N. oculata as biodiesel feedstock. © 2013.

AB  - In this investigation ozonolysis in the presence of ethanol was used to depolymerise lignin, resulting in a low conversion of oxygenated aromatics over short reaction times, or a range of saturated esters over 24. h. Short chain oxygenates can be used as fuel additives, displacing a percentage of a hydrocarbon fuel while leading to improvement in some of the fuel properties. The utility of the resulting bio-oils was therefore assessed by blending with a range of fuels. Guaiacol, a potential antioxidant, was formed over short reaction times and was found to be completely miscible with low-sulphur petrol (ULSP), diesel, aviation kerosene and rapeseed methyl ester. The mainly aliphatic proportion of the bio-oil produced over 24. h could be blended with the fuels replacing a maximum of 12-17. wt.% of the hydrocarbon fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Miscanthus plants were sampled from several plantations in Ireland over the harvest window (October-April). These were separated into their anatomical components and the loss of leaves monitored. Three distinct phases were apparent: there was minimal loss in the "Early" (October to early December) and "Late" (March and April) phases, and rapid leaf loss in the interim period. Samples were analysed for constituents relevant to biorefining. Changes in whole-plant composition included increases in glucose and Klason lignin contents and decreases in ash and arabinose contents. These changes arose mostly from the loss of leaves, but there were some changes over time within the harvestable plant components. Although leaves yield less biofuel than stems, the added biomass provided by an early harvest (31.9-38.4%) meant that per hectare biofuel yields were significantly greater (up to 29.3%) than in a late harvest. These yields greatly exceed those from first generation feedstocks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw was used for production of bioethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and carotene-enriched biomass by red yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis, Cystofilobasidium capitatum and Sporobolomyces roseus. To evaluate the convertibility of pretreated wheat straw into ethanol, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of S. cerevisiae was performed under semi-anaerobic conditions. The highest ethanol production efficiency of 65-66% was obtained following pretreatment at 200°C without the catalytic action of acetic acid, and at 195 and 200°C respectively in the presence of catalyst. Red yeast strain S. roseus produced 1.73-2.22mgg-1 of ergosterol on the filter cake, 1.15-4.17mgg-1 of ergosterol and 1.23-1.56mgg-1 of β-carotene on pretreated wheat straw hydrolysates and also the highest amount of carotenoids and ergosterol on untreated wheat straw (1.70 and 4.17mgg-1, respectively). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In-situ alkaline transesterification of rapeseed oil with methanol for the production of biodiesel and nontoxic rapeseed meal was carried out. Water removal from milled rapeseed by methanol washing was more effective than vacuum drying. The conversion rate of rapeseed oil into FAME was 92%, FAME mass was 8.81. g, glucosinolates content in remaining rapeseed meal was 0.12% by methanol washing, while by vacuum drying the values were 46%, 4.44. g, 0.58%, respectively. In the presence of 0.10. mol/L NaOH in methanol, with methanol/oil molar ratio of 180:1 and a 3. h reaction at 40°C, a conversion rate of 98% was achieved, and the glucosinolates content was reduce to 0.07%, a value which below the GB/T 22514-2008 standard in China. Thus the rapeseed meal can be used as a source of protein in animal feed. The FAME prepared through in-situ alkaline transesterification met the ASTM specifications for biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A xylanase gene (thxyn11A) from the Thermobifida halotolerans strain YIM 90462T was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The open reading frame (ORF) of thxyn11A has 1,008 bp encoding a mature xylanase with a high degree of similarity (80 %) to the xylanase from Nocardiopsis dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111. This enzyme (Thxyn11A) also possesses a glycosyl hydrolases family 11 (GH11) domain and a high isoelectric point (pI = 9.1). However, Thxyn11A varies from most GH11 xylanases, due to its large molecular mass (34 kDa). Recombinant Thxyn11A demonstrated a strong pH and temperature tolerance with a maximum activity at pH 9.0 and 70 °C. Xylotriose, the end-product of xylan hydrolysis by Thxyn11A, serves as a catalyst for hemicellulose pretreatment in industrial applications and can also function as a food source or supplement for enterobacteria. Due to its attractive biochemical properties, Thxyn11A may have potential value in many commercial applications. © 2012 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Biodiesel, a mixture of long chain fatty acid esters, is an environmental friendly alternative to fossil fuel. This fuel is produced by a transesterification reaction between vegetable oils or animal fats and a short chain alcohol, usually methanol, in the presence of a catalyst. European governments are targeting the incorporation of 10% of biofuels in transportation fuels by 2020. Therefore, the global market for biodiesel is expected to have a significant growth in the next 10 years. According to the European legislation, from the 25 parameters that have to be analyzed to certify biodiesel quality, oxidative stability is of concern, especially when storing biodiesel for long periods. In fact, that property measures the susceptibility of biodiesel to oxidative degradation and is strongly dependent on the type of oil used in the production process and on storage conditions. Thus, EN 14214 establishes a minimum value of 6 h for the oxidative stability of biodiesel under stressed conditions of a standardized assay. This work reports the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), coupled with multivariable classification and calibration techniques, to determine the oxidative stability of biodiesel with and without antioxidants. Therefore, biodiesel samples produced from soybean, palm, rapeseed, sunflower and waste frying oils, from mixtures of these oils and also several of these samples after different storage conditions and storage periods some of them containing antioxidants (induction periods between 0.66 and 17.75 h) were used to develop the calibration models. The model for samples without antioxidants is able to estimate the oxidative stability of unknown samples with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.6 h, which is similar to the reference method error (0.5 h). The introduction of samples containing antioxidants in the calibration/validation sets led to higher prediction errors (RMSEP = 1.28 h) that may be considered acceptable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fatty acid esters (biodiesel) were produced from the enzymatic transesterification of Persea americana mill oil (in South America known as Aguacate) with methanol, ethanol, propanol, 2,2-dimethyl-1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and 3-methyl-1-butanol were studied. Candida antarctica B lipase was immobilised on mesoporous foam synthesised using nonylphenol ethoxylated with n = 4 (FC-4), and the enzyme was supported on foam carbon with ethoxylated nonylphenol n = 6 (FC-6) for obtaining the biocatalyst. In the conversion of Persea americana mill oil to alkyl esters using (FC-6) as a support, 3-methyl-1-butanol gave the highest conversion of 100%, 2-methyl-1-butanol 92%, 2,2-dimethyl-1-propanol 81%, propanol 70% and ethanol 60%, and 48% methyl ester was observed with methanol. With FC-4 used to support the enzyme, 3-methyl-1-butanol gave the highest conversion of 70%, 2-methyl-1-butanol 65%, 2,2-dimethyl-1-propanol 58%, propanol 50% and ethanol 45%, and 37% methyl ester was observed with methanol. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Escherichia coli has the potential to be a powerful biocatalyst for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into useful materials such as biofuels and polymers. One important challenge in using E. coli for the transformation of biomass sugars is diauxie, or sequential utilization of different types of sugars. We demonstrate that, by increasing the intracellular levels of the transcription factor XylR, the preferential consumption of arabinose before xylose can be eliminated. In addition, XylR augmentation must be finely tuned for robust coutilization of these two hemicellulosic sugars. Using a novel technique for scarless gene insertion, an additional copy of xylR was inserted into the araBAD operon. The resulting strain was superior at cometabolizing mixtures of arabinose and xylose and was able to produce at least 36% more ethanol than wild-type strains. This strain is a useful starting point for the development of an E. coli biocatalyst that can simultaneously convert all biomass sugars. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Biomass in general and solid biofuels in particular has gained increased attention as a renewable source of energy that can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emission as well as the security of supply. Hence, it is increasingly used with an array of different technologies. These different conversion technologies are based on the principles of thermo-chemical conversion. Against this background, the goal of this paper is it to draw an overall picture of the differences and the dependencies of these different thermo-chemical conversion options. To achieve this aim, the influence of fuel composition related as well as process related parameters on the course and the products of the various thermo-chemical conversion processes are analysed and assessed in detail. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This article addresses the life-cycle assessment of an energy conversion system for the coproduction of fuels and electricity from a gasification-based biosyngas feedstock via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis coupled with a combined-cycle process. Inventory data obtained mainly through process simulation are used to evaluate the environmental performance of the system in terms of abiotic depletion, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification, and eutrophication. Furthermore, the cumulative non-renewable energy demand of the system is quantified and used in the calculation of the life-cycle energy balance of the system, which is found to be positive.Biosyngas generation arises as the main source of impact, with a much higher contribution than the rest of processes (production of catalysts, waste treatment, etc.). Electricity, diesel, gasoline and surplus hydrogen are the products of the system. The environmental profiles of these bioproducts are calculated and compared with those of fossil diesel, rapeseed biodiesel, soybean biodiesel, fossil gasoline, corn bioethanol, steam-methane reforming hydrogen, and the EU electrical grid. Overall, the bioproducts from the evaluated system are found to be promising alternatives to current energy products from a life-cycle environmental perspective. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To develop a robust whole-cell biocatalyst that works well at moderately high temperature (40-50. °C) with organic solvents, a thermostable lipase from Geobacillus thermocatenulatus (BTL2) was introduced into an Aspergillus oryzae whole-cell biocatalyst. The lipase-hydrolytic activity of the immobilized A. oryzae (r-BTL) was highest at 50. °C and was maintained even after an incubation of 24-h at 60. °C. In addition, r-BTL was highly tolerant to 30% (v/v) organic solvents (dimethyl carbonate, ethanol, methanol, 2-propanol or acetone). The attractive characteristics of r-BTL also worked efficiently on palm oil methanolysis, resulting in a nearly 100% conversion at elevated temperature from 40 to 50. °C. Moreover, r-BTL catalyzed methanolysis at a high methanol concentration without a significant loss of lipase activity. In particular, when 2 molar equivalents of methanol were added 2 times, a methyl ester content of more than 90% was achieved; the yield was higher than those of conventional whole-cell biocatalyst and commercial Candida antarctica lipase (Novozym 435). On the basis of the results regarding the excellent lipase characteristics and efficient biodiesel production, the developed whole-cell biocatalyst would be a promising biocatalyst in a broad range of applications including biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of NH4Cl and MgCl 2 on pretreatment and xylan hydrolysis of miscanthus straw for biofuels production. It was observed that increasing the pretreatment temperature decreased the remaining solid, increased the enzymatic digestibility, and increased the xylan removal. When 0.2-5.0% NH4Cl and MgCl2 were employed in pretreatments, increasing the inorganic salt concentration slightly diminished the remaining solid, though the enzymatic digestibility was enhanced. Under the higher-than-2% condition, no xylan remained in the solid residues after pretreatment. With pretreatment time, the remaining solid slightly decreased, but the enzymatic digestibility was increased. Moreover, xylan removal was linearly increased to 15 min, after which it was completely hydrolyzed. Overall, these results indicated that pretreatment by 2% NH4Cl or MgCl2 at 185 °C for 15 min completely hydrolyzes the xylan of miscanthus straw. In scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the physical surface of the miscanthus straw showed an apparently damaged surface area and exposure of the internal structure after pretreatment with NH4Cl and MgCl2 by SEM. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Quantification of a pH change that was observed over the course of the transesterification reaction that converts vegetable oil to biodiesel may provide a simple method to monitor the reaction. Transesterification of canola oil at 6:1 methanol to oil ratio with 0.5wt.% KOH as catalyst was studied at 25, 35, and 45°C. Reaction conversion was correlated to pH measurements and the results were shown to be in agreement with an independent measure of conversion using an enzymatic assay for glycerol. Rate constants obtained from these measurements are consistent with those in the literature. The measured pH change appears to be related to dilution of OH- ions as the oil is converted to products rather than to depletion of OH- due to reaction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Steam reforming of bio-oil derived from the fast pyrolysis of biomass is an economic and renewable process for hydrogen production. The main objective of the present work has been to investigate the effects of the preparation method of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts on their performance in hydrogen production by bio-oil steam reforming. The Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation, co-precipitation, and sol-gel methods. XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, SEM, TEM, TG, and N2 physisorption measurements were performed to characterize the texture and structure of the catalysts obtained after calcination and after their subsequent use. Ethanol and bio-oil model compound were selected for steam reforming to evaluate the catalyst performance. The catalyst prepared by the co-precipitation method was found to display better performance than the other two. Under the optimized reaction conditions, an ethanol conversion of 99% and a H2 yield of 88% were obtained. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The decomposition of vegetable and microalgal oils was herein analysed as a process of high interest for the production of both hydrogen and carbon, which potentially entails the advantage of attaining a negative CO 2 balance through carbon fixation. The feasibility of a series of oil decarbonization systems was evaluated by means of energy and CO 2 balances, which comprised not only the direct decarbonization process itself but also the cultivation and oil extraction stages. Three potential scenarios were assessed, embracing different options to meet the energy requirements of the systems. For each scenario, a wide range of case studies were evaluated, involving the use of rapeseed, sunflower, soybean, jatropha, Botryococcus braunii and Chlorella vulgaris oils as raw materials. Favourable energy and CO 2 balances were found for a variety of crops in different scenarios. In particular, jatropha oil from high seed yield crops and rapeseed oil from high seed yield and high oil content crops were identified as the most promising biomass feedstocks for oil decarbonization since they led to net hydrogen production as well as to negative balances of CO 2 emissions, therefore showing a carbon fixation effect. When compared to vegetable/microalgal oil transesterification to produce biodiesel, oil decomposition proved to be a more suitable alternative from a combined energy and environmental approach. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Castor oil glycerides were obtained from the glycerolysis of castor oil or its methyl esters with alkaline-crude glycerol. High monoglyceride yields were obtained between 20-30min and 180-200°C with both substrates. The glycerolysis of castor oil afforded highest yield of products at 180°C and 30min (50.4 of monoglycerides and 35% of diglycerides). However, the glycerolysis of methyl esters was more selective toward the formation of monoglycerides. Castor oil glycerides were further esterified with maleic anhydride without catalyst. Reaction was followed by acid value and 1H NMR. ca. 87% conversion of hydroxyl groups was obtained at 90°C. The final product contained 2.6 maleate groups per glyceride molecule. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over 9 million dairy cows generate an estimated 226 billion kg of wet manure annually in the USA. To help mitigate dairy greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the degradation of this organic-rich waste, manure can be processed via anaerobic digestion (AD) to methane and ultimately electricity. This potential value of AD has generated high-level dairy-industry support for broad-scale technology deployment; however, on-the-ground AD realization has been impeded by process stability/reliability concerns and poor economics. Considering these challenges but recognizing that AD represents a fundamentally sound manure-management approach, an interdisciplinary research team has completed proof-of-concept investigations on an integrated process that will concurrently improve manure management economics and reduce dairy GHG emissions. The integrated processes center on a two-stage fermentation/AD system that can generate methane quantity/quality comparable to conventional single-stage AD. Molecular level investigations confirm that the AD is highly enriched with a unique and synergistic microbial population which yielded a more resilient and stable process. Beyond AD, algae grown on nitrogen/phosphorus-rich AD supernatant in a photobioreactor yielded biomass concentrations approaching 1.0 g L-1; despite an apparent growth lag/inhibition associated with excess organic acids and ammonia, algae growth was significant. Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) demonstrated that the two-stage AD configuration coupled with algae production can reduce GHG emissions by approximately 60% as compared with a traditional anaerobic lagoon. The end result is a manure-management platform that can increase US dairy viability and sustainability. Ongoing investigations are aimed at process refinement with an ultimate commercialization goal. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Free lipase-mediated alcoholysis offers an effective alternative approach to biodiesel production due to its merits of faster reaction rate and lower preparation cost. Further promoting the application of free lipase in catalyzing the transesterification of crude renewable oils is of significance since the cost of oil feedstock accounts for a major part in biodiesel production. Crude renewable oils typically contain a certain amount of phospholipids and it has been found that the phospholipids have inhibitory effect on lipase's catalytic performance during immobilized lipase-catalyzed biodiesel production. However, the influence of phospholipids on free lipase-mediated alcoholysis in oil/water biphasic system has not been reported. In this work, free lipase from Aspergillus niger was employed as the catalyst for biodiesel production and the effect of phospholipids on free lipase's catalytic performance was explored for the first time. It was found that both the reaction rate and the final FAME content increased and the free lipase exhibited better reuse stability in the presence of phospholipids. Further study on the distribution of phosphorous showed that within 2% phospholipids contained in the oil feedstock, only less than 4 ppm phosphorous remained in the final methyl esters, which well met the phosphorous demand of biodiesel standard. The above results demonstrated that free lipase-mediated alcoholysis was promising for biodiesel production especially with low quality crude vegetable oils as the feedstock. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Renewable fuels could in the future be produced in a biorefinery which involves highly integrated technologies. It has been reported that thermochemical conversion (gasification) of lignocellulosic biomass has a high potential for end production of renewable biofuels. In this work, lignin residue from biochemical conversion of wheat straw was gasified in an oxygen blown pressurized entrained flow gasifier (PEBG) at 0.25-0.30 MWth, 0.45 &lt; λ &lt; 0.5 and 1 bar (g). A video camera mounted inside the PEBG was used to observe the flame during start up and during operation. Hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were the main gas components with H2/CO ratios varying during the gasification test (0.54-0.63). The methane (CH4) concentration also varied slightly and was generally below 1.7% (dry and N2 free). C2-hydrocarbons (&lt; 1810 ppm) and benzene (&lt; 680 ppm) were also observed together with low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S, &lt; 352 ppm) and carbonyl sulfide (COS, &lt; 131 ppm). The process temperature in the reactor was around 1200 C. The slag seemed to consist of Cristobalite (SiO2) and Berlinite (AlPO4) and Na, Ca, Mg, K and Fe in lower concentrations. Cooling of the burner will be necessary for longer tests to avoid safety shut downs due to high burner temperature. The cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion was estimated but more accurate measurements, especially the syngas flow, needs to be determined during a longer test in order to obtain data on the efficiency at optimized operating conditions. The syngas has potential for further upgrading into biofuels, but will need traditional gas cleaning such as acid gas removal and water gas shifting. Also, higher pressures and reducing the amount of N2 is important in further work. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For the first time, a fast and versatile technique, an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ), has been used to functionalise graphite carbon electrodes for biofuel cell applications. The bioelectrode was functionalized by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) system using air, oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) plasmas applied for only a few seconds. XPS analysis showed that carboxylic groups were created on the carbon substrates using both air and O2 plasmas, while mainly carbonyl and amine/amide functionalities were generated using N2 plasmas. A purified laccase from Trametes versicolor was both adsorbed and covalently bound (NHS/EDC method) to the plasma modified carbon. Higher laccase activity was obtained for the covalently grafted laccase compared to the physically adsorbed one: 13.2 (±2) 10-3U of laccase on air treated graphite and two-fold less (5.3 (±1.1) 10-3U) were obtained on N2 plasma treated surfaces (1mM ABTS as a substrate, 30°C, pH=3.0), one unit (U) being the quantity of ABTS (μmole) oxidized by laccase per minute. Dioxygen reduction was performed by direct electron transfer (DET). The highest current density, 108μA/cm2 (at 0.2V (vs. SCE), pH 4.2, room temperature), was recorded for covalently immobilized laccase on N2 plasma treated surfaces (geometric surface=0.38cm2). This could be explained by the fact that the highly conductive graphite structure was retained in the case of this surface treatment and could also suggest a preferential orientation of the T1 Cu center of the laccase toward the surface of the N2 plasma treated electrode. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this review, the recent advancements and technical challenges associated with the production of ethanol, butanol, and isobutanol via bioconversion routes from celluloses of woody materials are reviewed. Physicochemical processes, e.g. steam explosion, seem to be the most viable process for pretreating woody materials. Although enzymatic hydrolysis is selective, it is rather a slow process. Acid hydrolysis is a relatively fast process with a high yield, but it produces inhibitory compounds of fermentation, which necessitates a detoxification process before the fermentation. Presently, the major challenges in the production of ethanol, butanol, and isobutanol via biological conversions are the rather low production yield and the sensitivity of microorganisms to the presence of inhibitors and products in fermentation media. In this study, the recent advancements in the applications of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, the most promising microorganisms, for ethanol, butanol, and isobutanol production are also discussed. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The inclusion complex of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 with bridged bis-cyclodextrin (CsPW/B) is prepared as a highly efficient catalyst for the direct production of biodiesel via the transesterification of waste cooking oil. CsPW/B is characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the biodiesel is analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer. The conversion rate of waste cooking oil is up to 94.2% under the optimum experimental conditions that are methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1, catalyst dosage of 3wt%, temperature of 65°C and reaction time of 180min. The physical properties of biodiesel sample satisfy the requirement of ASTM D6751 standards. The novel CsPW/B catalyst used for the transesterification can lead to 96.9% fatty acid methyl esters and 86.5% of the biodiesel product can serve as the ideal substitute for diesel fuel, indicating its excellent potential application in biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the current study is to investigate the feasibility of thermo-chemical conversion of rice husk in hot-compressed water via ultrasonic pretreatment to increase the bio-oil yield. The results show that ultrasonic pretreatment remarkably changes the structures of the rice husk, such as enhancing swelling and surface area, eroding lignin structure, and resulting in more exposure of the cellulose and hemicellulose. The highest bio-oil yield of 42.8% was obtained from the thermo-chemical conversion at 300. °C and 0. min of the residence time for the 1. h pretreated rice husk. GC-MS analysis indicates that the relative contents of phenols, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, and lactic acid are higher in bio-oils obtained from the pretreated rice husks than that from the raw rice husk. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The fast pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris was carried out in a quartz tube reactor under different pyrolysis temperature levels. The product fractional yields, gaseous products and the evaluation method based on heating value and energy consumption were analyzed in order to obtain the optimal condition to produce syngas. The results indicated that the higher the pyrolysis temperature level was, the higher the bio-fuel yield was. 900°C is the best temperature to obtain the maximum bio-fuel yield (91.09wt.%). And the highest emission of CO and H2 were achieved under the pyrolysis temperature of 800 and 900°C, respectively. According to the evaluation method based on heating value and energy consumption, there was a significant impact on the syngas production under different pyrolysis temperatures. Furthermore, the evaluation method based on energy consumption indicated that 800°C was the optimal pyrolysis temperature to produce syngas. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrothermal Treatment (HTT) of microalgae produces an organic liquid (HTT oil) with potentiality as feedstock in biofuel development. Through this process, an oil with oxygen content intermediate between pyrolysis oil from lignocellulosic biomass and fossil oil can be obtained even from lipid-poor microalgal species. However, the elevated content of nitrogen-containing organic compounds derived from algal proteins represents one of the main drawbacks. In this study, catalytic pyrolysis of HTT oil with H-ZSM-5 zeolite was investigated as an upgrading process, in order to reduce the nitrogen content and improve fuel quality. Oils obtained at various HTT experimental conditions from Desmodesmus sp. were mixed with H-ZSM-5 and pyrolyzed at 600 C within a Py-GC-MS system for the analysis of the evolved pyrolysis products. The results were compared with those resulting from catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose, n-hexatriacontane (C36H74) and pyrolysis oils from poplar (original and after hydrogenation). The relative comparison showed that hydrocarbon yields from pyrolysis of HTT oils over H-ZSM-5 were intermediate between those of hexatriacontane and cellulose. The high nitrogen content of the HTT oils did not show any marked effect on yields of hydrocarbons and nitrogen removal was remarkably high in all the investigated HTT oils. Although the data should be confirmed on larger scale, and recycling of catalyst has to be proven, obtained results indicate that it would be possible to introduce HTT oil from microalgae in existing refineries. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study explores the characteristics of the bio-oil literature published during the last three decades based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and its implications using the scientometric techniques. The results of this study reveal that the bio-oil research output and the citations received have grown exponentially during the last decade after two decades of low performance with paralleling enormous changes in the research landscape. The US, China, and Turkey have been the three most prolific countries. The "Univ Sci Technol China" of China has been the most prolific institution and "Park YK" of South Korea has been the most prolific author.

AB  - The development of solid acid catalysts that contain a high density of Brànsted acid sites with suitable acidity, as well as a long lifetime, is one of great challenges for the efficient dehydration of glycerol to acrolein. Herein, we report on a mesoporous siliconiobium phosphate (NbPSi-0.5) composite, which is a promising solid Brànsted acid that is a potential candidate for such a high-performance catalyst. A variety of characterization results confirm that NbPSi-0.5 contains nearly pure Brànsted acid sites and has well-defined large mesopores. In addition, NbPSi-0.5 contains a similar amount of acid sites and exhibits weaker acidity than that of the highly acidic niobium phosphate and HZSM-5 zeolite. NbPSi-0.5 is quite stable and has a high activity for the dehydration of glycerol. The stability of NbPSi-0.5 is about three times higher than that of the reported catalyst. The significantly enhanced catalytic performance of NbPSi-0.5 can be attributed to 1) nearly pure Brànsted acidity, which suppresses side reactions that lead to coke formation; 2) a significant reduction of pore blocking due to the mesopores; and 3) a decrease in the amount and oxidation temperature of coke. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The use of microalgae for biofuel production has the potential to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Ideal candidate species of microalgae for bio-oil production need both relatively high growth rates and lipid content. Here, we report on the effects of temperature, nutrients (N, Si), and salinity on growth rates and lipid content of the common freshwater diatom, Fragilaria capucina (Desm), isolated from western Lake Erie. At low NaCl salinity, growth rate increased rapidly from 10 to 20°C, and then further increased slowly from 20 to 30°C, with a maximum specific growth rate of 0. 61 day -1. Growth rate declined with increasing salinity (e. g., reduced by ca. 50 and 100% at 137 and 274 mmol L -1 NaCl, respectively), and increased with increased N and Si concentration until ca. 100 μmol L -1 for each (with &gt;85% of maximum growth rate at 10 μmol L -1). Lipid content (% total lipid per dry mass) in nutrient-replete cultures was 14% and (1) increased to &gt;30% at low N and, especially, low Si; (2) was lower at 30°C vs. 20 or 10°C; and (3) decreased with salinity. Thus, F. capucina accumulates lipid to high levels even under N, Si, and temperature levels that permit a high growth rate for this species, and hence, this species is a candidate for use in biofuel production. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Syngas derived from biomass and coal gasification for fuel synthesis or electricity generation contains sulfur species that are detrimental to downstream catalysts or turbine operation. Sulfur removal in high temperature, high steam conditions has been known to be challenging, but experimental reports on methods to tackle the problem are not often reported. We have developed sorbents that can remove hydrogen sulfide from syngas at high temperature (700°C), both in dry and high steam conditions. The syngas composition chosen for our experiments is derived from statistical analysis of the gasification products of wood under a large variety of conditions. The two sorbents, Cu-ceria and manganese-based, were tested in a variety of conditions. In syngas containing steam, the capacity of the sorbents is much lower, and the impact of the sorbent in lowering H 2S levels is only evident in low space velocities. Spectroscopic characterization and thermodynamic consideration of the experimental results suggest that in syngas containing 45% steam, the removal of H 2S is primarily via surface chemisorptions. For the Cu-ceria sorbent, analysis of the amount of H 2S retained by the sorbent in dry syngas suggests both copper and ceria play a role in H 2S removal. For the manganese-based sorbent, in dry conditions, there is a solid state transformation of the sorbent, primarily into the sulfide form. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organosolv methods can be used to delignify lignocellulosic crop residues for pulp production or to pretreat them prior to enzymatic hydrolysis for bioethanol production. In this study, organic solvent was used as an acidic hydrolysis catalyst to produce glucose. Hydrolysis experiments were carried out in 5-20% formic acid at 180-220 °C. Wheat straw pulp delignified with a formicodeli™ method was used as a raw material. It was found that glucose yields from pulp are significantly higher than yields from microcrystalline cellulose, a model component for cellulose hydrolysis. The results indicate that cellulose hydrolysis of real fibers takes place more selectively to glucose than hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose particles does. The effect of the particle size on pulp hydrolysis was investigated, the crystallinity of hydrolyzed pulp was measured by XRD analysis, and the product distribution and its influence on the process was discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study provides a novel methodology for biodiesel (FAME) production under ambient pressure, which resolves most drawbacks of current commercialized biodiesel conversion via the transesterification reaction. This has been achieved by means of a thermo-chemical process and a true continuous flow system. This also enables combination of esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) and transesterification of triglycerides into a single process without utilizing a catalyst, and leads to a 98-99 ± 0.5 % conversion efficiency of FAME within 1. min in the temperature range of 350-500 °C. High FFA content in oil feedstock is not a matter of the new process, which enables the use of a broader variety of feedstocks, including all edible and inedible fats. Another feature of this novel method is that it does not produce wastewater. Thus, the new process has potential to spur a breakthrough in the lowest cost of biodiesel production. Moreover, this method also requires utilization of carbon dioxide during biodiesel production, an additional environmental benefit. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algal biofuels are a growing interest worldwide due to their potential in terms of sustainable greenhouse gas displacement and energy production. This article describes a comparative survey of biodiesel production and conversion yields of biodiesel via alkaline transesterification of acylglycerols extracted from the microalgae Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, grown under silicate or nitrate limitation, and that of model vegetable oils: soybean, and rapeseed oil. Acylglycerols were extracted with n-hexane and the total yield per biomass was determined by gravimetric assay. Under our conditions, the total acylglycerol yield from the microalgae studied was 13-18% of total dry weight. The biodiesel samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector to determine quantitative information of residual glycerol, mono-, di-, and tri-acylglycerol concentrations in the biodiesel. All of the algal-based biodiesel demonstrated less mono-, di-, and tri-acylglycerol concentrations than the vegetable-based biodiesel under identical transesterification conditions. The fatty acid compositions of all the feedstock oils and their resultant biodiesel were also analyzed and reported. Based on the fatty acid methyl ester compositions of our samples we qualitatively assessed the suitability of the algal-derived biodiesel in terms of cetane number (CN), cold-flow properties, and oxidative stability. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012;109: 1146-1154. Published 2011. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. This work presents the feasibility of producing biodiesel, at the bench-scale, from extracted algal acylglycerols produced by Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira Pseudonana under targeted environmental conditions. Using GC-FID the authors quantified the residual glycerol, MAGs, DAGs, TAGs, and total free glycerol within the resultant biodiesel. The fatty acid profiles for the feedstock oils and their resultant biodiesel methyl esters are also presented along with a qualitative assessment of the suitability of the diatom-based biodiesel in terms of cetane number (CN), cold-flow properties, and oxidative stability. © 2011.

AB  - Accurate analytical methods are required to develop and evaluate the quality of new renewable transportation fuels and intermediate organic liquid products (OLPs). Unfortunately, existing methods developed for the detailed characterization of petroleum products, are not accurate for many of the OLPs generated from non-petroleum feedstocks. In this study, a method was developed and applied to the detailed characterization of complex OLPs formed during triacylglyceride (TG) pyrolysis which is the basis for generating one class of emerging biofuels. This method uses gas chromatography coupled simultaneously with flame ionization and mass spectrometry detectors (GC-FID/MS). The FID provided accurate quantification of carbonaceous species while MS enabled identification of unknown compounds. A programed temperature vaporizer using a 25°C, 0.1min, 720°Cmin -1, 350°C, 5min temperature program is employed which minimizes compound discrimination better than the more commonly utilized split/splitless injector, as verified with injections at 250 and 350°C. Two standard mixtures featuring over 150 components are used for accurate identification and a designed calibration standard accounts for compound discrimination at the injector and differing FID responses of various classes of compounds. This new method was used to identify and quantify over 250 species in OLPs generated from canola oil, soybean oil, and canola methyl ester (CME). In addition to hydrocarbons, the method was used to quantify polar (upon derivatization) and unidentified species, plus the unresolved complex mixture that has not typically been determined in previous studies. Repeatability of the analytical method was below 5% RSD for all individual components. Using this method, the mass balance was closed for samples derived from canola and soybean oil but only ca. 77wt% of the OLP generated from CME could be characterized. The ability to close the mass balance depended on sample origin, demonstrating the need for an accurate quantification method for biofuels at various stages of production. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - By using 1,3-specific Pig Pancreatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3 or PPL), covalently immobilized on AlPO4/Sepiolite support as biocatalyst, a new second-generation biodiesel was obtained in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol and other alcohols of low molecular weight. The resulting biofuel is composed of fatty acid ethyl esters and monoglycerides (FAEE/MG) blended in a molar relation 2/1. This novel product, which integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols (MG) into the biofuel composition, has similar physicochemical properties compared to those of conventional biodiesel and also avoids the removal step of this by-product. The biocatalyst was found to be strongly fixed to the inorganic support (75%). Nevertheless, the efficiency of the immobilized enzyme was reduced to half (49.1%) compared to that of the free PPL. The immobilized enzyme showed a remarkable stability as well as a great reusability (more than 40 successive reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. Immobilized and free enzymes exhibited different reaction mechanisms, according to the different results in the Arrhenius parameters (Ln A and Ea). However, the use of supported PPL was found to be very suitable for the repetitive production of biofuel due to its facile recyclability from the reaction mixture. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper studies the characteristics of blends of biodiesel and a new type of SSPO (sewage sludge derived intermediate pyrolysis oil) in various ratios, and evaluates the application of such blends in an unmodified Lister diesel engine. The engine performance and exhaust emissions were investigated and compared to those of diesel and biodiesel. The engine injectors were inspected and tested after the experiment. The SSPO-biodiesel blends were found to have comparable heating values to biodiesel, but relatively high acidity and carbon residue. The diesel engine has operated with a 30/70 SSPO-biodiesel blend and a 50/50 blend for up to 10h and there was no apparent deterioration in operation observed. It is concluded that with 30% SSPO, the engine gives better overall performance and fuel consumption than with 50% SSPO. The exhaust temperatures of 30% SSPO and 50% SSPO are similar, but 30% SSPO gives relatively lower NOx emission than 50% SSPO. The CO and smoke emissions are lower with 50% SSPO than with 30% SSPO. The injectors of the engine operated with SSPO blends were found to have heavy carbon deposition and noticeably reduced opening pressure, which may lead to deteriorated engine performance and exhaust emissions in extended operation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study reports a method for the quantification of alkali and alkaline earth metallic (AAEM) species in bioslurry fuels. The so-called evaporation-ashing-digestion-ion chromatography (IC) method consists of four steps, including evaporation that converts bioslurry into solid-like residue, ashing that converts the residue into ash, acid digestion that dissolves the ash into a solution, and IC analysis that quantifies the AAEM species in the solution. The novelty of the method is the combination of the evaporation step with the existing ashing-digestion-IC method that is developed for solid fuels but not suitable for bioslurry fuels. The evaporation step consists of multi-steps of slow heating and holding at various segment temperatures corresponding to the boiling points of the major compounds in bio-oil, resulting in progressive evaporation of bio-oil vapors with little carry-over of biochar particles. The method has been successfully applied for quantifying AAEM species in bioslurry fuels with various biochar loading levels (5-20 wt %), with small relative standard errors (within ±3%) and low limitations of quantification (0.4-3.0 ppm). It also overcomes the biochar incomplete oxidation issue associated with the microwave-digestion-based methods, which considerably underestimate the concentrations of AAEM species in bioslurry fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The objective of this work is to present a systematic approach for conceptual design of an integrated biorefinery with maximum economic potential accounting for the predefined uncertainties in energy economics. Various parameters commencing from raw biomass feedstock, desired end products, to market price trend, technological constraints and system uncertainties at multiperiods are to be considered. A structural framework, integrated biorefinery pathway map which embeds and interconnects the latest processing technologies is first developed. Then, a robust optimisation model is adopted to determine the optimum network which handles the predefined sets of uncertainties in energy economics. To illustrate the proposed approach, a case study with two different scenarios of uncertainties is solved. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is also performed to identify the critical parameters of an integrated biorefinery. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

AB  - Background: While most resources in biofuels were directed towards implementing bioethanol programs, 1-propanol has recently received attention as a promising alternative biofuel. Nevertheless, no microorganism has been identified as a natural 1-propanol producer. In this study, we manipulated a novel metabolic pathway for the synthesis of 1-propanol in the genetically tractable bacterium Escherichia coli. Results: E. coli strains capable of producing heterologous 1-propanol were engineered by extending the dissimilation of succinate via propionyl-CoA. This was accomplished by expressing a selection of key genes, i.e. (1) three native genes in the sleeping beauty mutase (Sbm) operon, i.e. sbm-ygfD-ygfG from E. coli, (2) the genes encoding bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) from several microbial sources, and (3) the sucCD gene encoding succinyl-CoA synthetase from E. coli. Using the developed whole-cell biocatalyst under anaerobic conditions, production titers up to 150 mg/L of 1-propanol were obtained. In addition, several genetic and chemical effects on the production of 1-propanol were investigated, indicating that certain host-gene deletions could abolish 1-propanol production as well as that the expression of a putative protein kinase (encoded by ygfD/argK) was crucial for 1-propanol biosynthesis. Conclusions: The study has provided a novel route for 1-propanol production in E. coli, which is subjected to further improvement by identifying limiting conversion steps, shifting major carbon flux to the productive pathway, and optimizing gene expression and culture conditions. © 2013 Srirangan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The influence of different parameters on the conversion of carbohydrates and biomass into the potential biofuel intermediate 5-bromomethylfurfural (BMF) has been studied. Our optimized conditions avoid the use of lithium salt additives, making this method cheaper and environmentally more benign compared to previously reported methods. Different wood species and their potential as a raw material in BMF and furfural production have also been evaluated. In addition, we report a very simple and efficient procedure for conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into BMF or 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF). © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels, especially biodiesel, have become commonplace over the last couple of decades. The conventional transesterification process used for biodiesel production leaves manufacturers with a byproduct, glycerol, that is of low value. Dimethyl carbonate has been studied as an alternate methylating agent to methanol and alters the chemistry such that glycerol is not formed. Triazabicyclodecene was chosen as the catalyst due to its ability to easily ionize the dimethyl carbonate and ease of separation post reaction. This paper reports on the development of specific processing steps to convert canola oil to FAMEs and fatty acid glycerol carbonate (FAGCs) compounds. The process flow diagram was developed using Aspen Plus simulation software and verified through laboratory testing. Process conditions were adjusted until a glycerol-free biofuel was produced that meets the ASTM D6751 standard for biodiesel. By utilizing the glycerol moiety within the final product, about 9.7% increase (by mass) of biofuel was obtained compared to the traditional methanol synthesis route.

AB  - Copper(II) 2,2′-bipyridine (CuII(bpy))-catalyzed alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment was performed on three biomass feedstocks including alkali pre-extracted switchgrass, silver birch, and a hybrid poplar cultivar. This catalytic approach was found to improve the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of plant cell wall polysaccharides to monosaccharides for all biomass types at alkaline pH relative to uncatalyzed pretreatment. The hybrid poplar exhibited the most significant improvement in enzymatic hydrolysis with monomeric sugar release and conversions more than doubling from 30% to 61% glucan conversion, while lignin solubilization was increased from 36.6% to 50.2% and hemicellulose solubilization was increased from 14.9% to 32.7%. It was found that CuII(bpy)-catalyzed AHP pretreatment of cellulose resulted in significantly more depolymerization than uncatalyzed AHP pretreatment (78.4% vs. 49.4% decrease in estimated degree of polymerization) and that carboxyl content the cellulose was significantly increased as well (fivefold increase vs. twofold increase). Together, these results indicate that CuII(bpy)-catalyzed AHP pretreatment represents a promising route to biomass deconstruction for bioenergy applications. Biotechnol.

AB  - Thermochemical processing methods such as pyrolysis are of growing interest as a means of converting biomass into fuels and commodity chemicals in a sustainable manner. Macroalgae, or seaweed, represent a novel class of feedstock for pyrolysis that, owing to the nature of the environments in which they grow coupled with their biochemistry, naturally possess high metal contents. Although the impact of metals upon the pyrolysis of terrestrial biomass is well documented, their influence on the thermochemical conversion of marinederived feeds is largely unknown. Furthermore, these effects are inherently difficult to study, owing to the heterogeneous character of natural seaweed samples. The work described in this paper uses copper(II) alginate, together with alginic acid and sodium alginate as model compounds for exploring the effects of metals upon macroalgae thermolysis. A thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic study revealed that, unusually, Cu2+ ions promote the onset of pyrolysis in the alginate polymer, with copper(II) alginate initiating rapid devolatilization at 143°C, 14°C lower than alginic acid and 61°C below the equivalent point for sodium alginate. Moreover, this effect was mirrored in a sample of wild Laminaria digitata that had been doped with Cu2+ ions prior to pyrolysis, thus validating the use of alginates as model compounds with which to study the thermolysis of macroalgae. These observations indicate the varying impact of different metal species on thermochemical behaviour of seaweeds and offer an insight into the pyrolysis of brown macroalgae used in phytoremediation of metal-containing waste streams. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Melon seed oil was successfully converted into biodiesel fuels via alkali catalyzed transesterification. Transesterification parameters such as base concentration, methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst type, and step multiplicity were investigated. The results indicated that (0.75% KOH w/w of oil, a 6: 1 methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature of 60°C, and a duration of 1 h) where the optimal experimental conditions for the transesterification. The Fourier transform infra red spectra of the biodiesel was also specified and found differs greatly from that of the parent oil confirming the formation of biodiesel. Properties of the produced fuels were determined and found enhanced compared to those of the parent oil. Besides, the optimal biodiesel sample was blended with petro diesel in various volume percentages. However, the results showed that biodiesel had slight influence on the original properties of petro diesel. Copyright © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A conventional trickle bed reactor and its modified type both packed with Ca/Al composite oxide-based alkaline catalysts were studied for biodiesel production by transesterification of rapeseed oil and methanol. The effects of the methanol usage and oil flow rate on the FAME yield were investigated under the normal pressure and methanol boiling state. The oil flow rate had a significant effect on the FAME yield for the both reactors. The modified trickle bed reactor kept over 94.5% FAME yield under 0.6. mL/min oil flow rate and 91. mL catalyst bed volume, showing a much higher conversion and operational stability than the conventional type. With the modified trickle bed reactor, both transesterification and methanol separation could be performed simultaneously, and glycerin and methyl esters were separated additionally by gravity separation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is the most effective and commercially feasible technology for the production of bio-oil from biomass. Upgrading of lignin fraction bio-oil into liquid hydrocarbon is the main route for utilization of bio-oil. Increasing the amount of sugars in the aqueous fraction bio-oil will critically increase the importance of this fraction through conversion of sugars into more valuable liquid fuels and chemicals. In this study, a new application for membrane filtration technology to concentrate and separate sugars from aqueous fraction bio-oil was used. Green pinewood was pretreated with phosphoric acid under different acid concentrations and biomass/pretreating solution ratio to increase the yield of sugars in the bio-oil. The pretreated biomass was pyrolyzed in an auger reactor and the concentration of sugars in the bio-oil was determined by HPLC. The yield of sugars was increased from 15% to 25% at the optimum pretreatment condition. Lignin and aqueous fractions were fractionated from the bio-oil by adding an equivalent amount of water. Soluble phenolic compounds were removed from the aqueous fraction through solvent–solvent separation step using n-butanol or ethyl acetate. The produced sugar rich aqueous fraction was concentrated with Alfa Laval M20 membrane filtration system using Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes. The concentrated sugar solution was dried by freeze dryer and the remaining sugars were isolated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An active heterogeneous Al2O3 modified MgZnO (MgZnAlO) catalyst was prepared and the catalytic activity was investigated for the transesterification of different vegetable oils (refined palm oil, waste cooking palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil) with methanol to produce biodiesel. The catalyst was characterized by using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectra, thermo gravimetric and differential thermal analysis to ascertain its versatility. Effects of important reaction parameters such as methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature and reaction time on oil conversion were examined. Within the range of studied variability, the suitable transesterification conditions (methanol/oil ratio 16:1, catalyst loading 3.32 wt.%, reaction time 6h, temperature 182°C), the oil conversion of 98% could be achieved with reference to coconut oil in a single stage. The catalyst can be easily recovered and reused for five cycles without significant deactivation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A molecular level understanding of the structure, dynamics and mechanics of cellulose fibers can aid in understanding the recalcitrance of biomass to hydrolysis in cellulosic biofuel production. Here, a residue-scale REACH (Realistic Extension Algorithm via Covariance Hessian) coarse-grained force field was derived from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the crystalline Iβ cellulose fibril. REACH maps the atomistic covariance matrix onto coarse-grained elastic force constants. The REACH force field was found to reproduce the positional fluctuations and low-frequency vibrational spectra from the all-atom model, allowing elastic properties of the cellulose fibril to be characterized using the coarse-grained force field with a speedup of >20 relative to atomistic MD on systems of the same size. The calculated longitudinal/transversal Young's modulus and the velocity of sound are in agreement with experiment. The persistence length of a 36-chain cellulose microcrystal was estimated to be ∼380 μm. Finally, the normal-mode analysis with the REACH force field suggests that intrinsic dynamics might facilitate the deconstruction of the cellulose fibril from the hydrophobic surface. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study presents a parametric fitting of the economics of bio-oil stabilization and hydroprocessing to naphtha and diesel range blend fuel. The data is fit with a response surface model (RSM). Technical variables evaluated in this study are rate of bio-oil upgrading and natural gas input rate. Economic variables considered include bio-oil, natural gas, hydrogen, catalyst, capital, and fossil carbon costs. Our base case consists of a 1440 tonnes per day bio-oil upgrading biorefinery concept design for the production of naphtha and diesel range blend stock fuels. The RSM represents variation around this base case. The process model includes reforming, stabilization, and hydroprocessing sections. Total project investment for this concept is $171.5 million or $2.34 per gallon of bio-oil input capacity. This base case biorefinery generates 71.8 million gallons of fuel (5182 barrels per day) at a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $2.48 per gallon. We investigated the techno-economic impacts of different hydrogen sources on the bio-oil upgrading process. Hydrogen from bio-oil reforming results in the lowest biofuel emissions but is not always economical. A portion of available bio-oil should be converted to hydrogen under two main conditions: the cost of hydrogen from bio-oil is lower than procuring hydrogen from other sources and the lost income due to a lower biofuel output; and/or when there is a market or policy constraint limiting fossil fuel use. Results indicate that to minimize fuel costs, the amount of bio-oil upgraded should decrease from ≥90% to 80% as bio-oil prices decline from $1.37 to $0.70 per gallon depending on market conditions. Carbon emission constrains such as those mandated by the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) could force bio-oil upgrading rates to less than 90%. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We report the synthesis of needle-shaped nanocrystals of Ni 5TiO 7 utilizing a solid-phase reaction of NiO with a porous and rough TiO 2 surface produced by plasma electrolytic oxidation. The single crystalline orthorhombic nanocrystals are grown along the [010] axis, featuring a length of ∼10 μm and diameters varying from several tens of nanometers up to 200 nm. The resulted novel Ni 5TiO 7/TiO 2/Ti nanoarchitectured compound composite has been proven outstandingly active as a catalyst and appears most suitable for high-temperature operation in biomass gasification. The findings may pave the way to an improved and environmentally friendly technology of energy generation. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Waste oils are a promising alternative feedstock for biodiesel production due to the decrease of the industrial production costs. However, feedstock with high free fatty acids (FFA) content presents several drawbacks when alkaline-catalyzed transesterification reaction is employed in biodiesel production process. Nowadays, to develop suitable processes capable of treating oils with high free fatty acids content, a two-step process for biodiesel production is being investigated. The major problem that it presents is that two catalysts are needed to carry out the whole process: an acidic catalyst for free fatty acids esterification (first step) and a basic catalyst for pretreated product transesterification (second step). The use of a bifunctional catalyst, which allows both reactions to take place simultaneously, could minimize the production costs and time. In the present study, the behavior of pumice, a natural volcanic material used as a heterogeneous catalyst, was tested using oils with several FFA and water contents as feedstock in the transesterification reaction to produce biodiesel. Pumice as a bifunctional solid catalyst, which can catalyze simultaneously the esterification of FFA and the transesterification of fatty acid glycerides into biodiesel, was shown to be an efficient catalyst for the conversion of low-grade, nonedible oil feedstock into biodiesel product. Using this solid catalyst for the transesterification reaction, high FAME yields were achieved when feedstock oils presented a FFA content until approximately 2% wt/wt and a water content until 2% wt/wt. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The amenability of three brown algal species, Sargassum fulvellum, Laminaria japonica and Undaria pinnatifida, to hydrolysis were investigated using the ionic liquid (IL), 1- n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl). Compositional analyses of the brown algae reveal that sufficient amounts of sugars (15.5-29.4. wt.%) can be recovered. Results from hydrolysis experiments show that careful selection of the type of mineral acid as catalyst and control of acid loading could maximize the recovery of sugars. Optimal reaction time and temperature were determined from the kinetic studies on the sequential reducing sugar (TRS) formation and degradation. Optimal reaction times were determined based on the extent of furfurals formation as TRS degradation products. X-ray diffraction and environmental scanning electron microscopy confirmed the suitability of [BMIM]Cl as solvent for the hydrolysis of the three brown algae. Overall results show the potential of brown algae as renewable energy resources for the production of valuable chemicals and biofuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The synthesis, characterization and catalytic capability of the NiW-nano-hydroxyapatite (NiW-nHA) composite were investigated in this paper. The NiW-nHA catalyst was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Then Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) were used to analyze this material. In addition, the catalytic capacity of the NiW-nHA composite was also examined by FT-IR and gas chromatography (GC). The results of FT-IR analysis indicated that Ni, W and nHA combined closely. TEM observation revealed that this catalyst was needle shaped and the crystal retained a nanometer size. XRD data also suggested that a new phase of CaWO4 appeared and the lattice parameters of nHA changed in this system. nHA was the carrier of metals. The rates of Ni/W-loading were 73.24% and 65.99% according to the EDX data, respectively. Furthermore, the conversion of 91.88% Jatropha oil was achieved at 360 °C and 3 MPa h-1 over NiW-nHA catalyst. The straight chain alkanes ranging from C15 to C18 were the main components in the production. The yield of C15-C18 alkanes was up to 83.56 wt%. The reaction pathway involved hydrocracking of the CC bonds of these triglycerides from Jatropha oil. This paper developed a novel non-sulfided catalyst to obtain a "green biofuel" from vegetable oil. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Cellulose and cellulose/montmorillonite K10 mixtures of different ratio (9:1, 3:1, 1:1) were subjected to pyrolysis at temperatures from 350 to 500°C with different heating rate (10°C/min, 100°C/s) to produce bio-oil and selected chemicals with high yield. The pyrolytic oil yield was in the range of 46-73.5 wt% depending on the temperature, the heating rate and the amount of catalyst. The non-catalytic fast pyrolysis at 500°C gives the highest yield of bio-oil (84 wt%). The blending cellulose with increasing amount of montmorillonite K10 results in significant, linear decrease in bio-oil yield. The great influence of montmorillonite K10 amount on the distribution of bio-oil components was observed at 450°C with a heating rate of 100°C/s. The addition of catalyst to cellulose promotes the formation of 2-furfural (FF), various furan derivatives, levoglucosenone (LGO) and (1R,5S)-1-hydroxy-3, 6-dioxabicyclo-[3.2.1]octan-2-one (LAC). Simultaneously, the share of levoglucosan (LG) in bio-oil decreases from 6.92 wt% and is less than 1 wt% when cellulose:MK10 (1:1, w/w) mixture at 450°C is rapidly pyrolyzed. Additionally, several other compounds have been identified but in minor quantities. Their contributions in bio-oil also depend on the amount of catalyst. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A process integrating the extraction and transesterification of lipid from jatropha kernel powder for the production of biodiesel with methanol assisted by hexane is reported in this paper. The effects of catalyst amount, reaction time, reaction temperature, and siphon tube height on the yield and characteristics of biodiesel were investigated. It was found that hexane played the role of both co-solvent and co-extractant, which enhanced the efficiency of lipid extraction and the formation of a single phase containing methanol and lipid, facilitating mass transfer. Therefore, the reaction system had liquid-flow-solid-catalyzed character. The flow velocity of extraction liquor was controlled to fit for the rate of transesterification via controlling the reaction conditions. The products containing 80.2% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) were obtained and its high heating value was 37.43. MJ/kg. In this process, the residue of kernel powder, catalyst and products were simultaneously separated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this report, we introduce a novel and commercially viable method to recover renewable hydrogen and carbon nanotubes from waste glycerol produced in the biodiesel process. Gas-phase catalytic reforming converts glycerol to clean hydrogen fuel and by replacing the problematical coke formed on the catalyst with high value carbon nanotubes, added value can be realised. Additional benefits of around 2.8âkg CNTs from the reforming of 1 tonne of glycerol and the production of 500âNm 3 H 2 could have a considerable impact on the economics of glycerol utilization. Thereby, the contribution of this research will be a significant step forward in solving a current major technical and economic challenge faced by the biofuels industry.

AB  - Bio-fuel production provides an alternative non-fossil fuel without the need to redesign current engine technology. This study presents an experimental investigation into the effects of using biodiesel blends on diesel engine performance and its emissions. The biodiesel fuels were produced from Sunflower oil using the transesterification process with low molecular weight alcohols and sodium hydroxide then tested on a steady state engine test rig using a Euro 4 four cylinder CI (compression ignition) engine. This study also shows how by blending biodiesel with diesel fuel at intervals of B5, B10, B15, and B20 can decrease harmful gas emissions significantly while maintaining similar performance output and efficiency. Production optimization was achieved by changing the variables which included methanol/oil molar ratio, NaOH catalyst concentration, reaction time, reaction temperature, and rate of mixing to maximize biodiesel yield. The technique used was the RSM (response surface methodology). In addition, a second-order model was developed to predict the biodiesel yield if the production criteria is known. The model was validated using additional experimental testing. It was determined that the catalyst concentration and molar ratio of methanol to sunflower oil were the most influential variables affecting percentage conversion to fuel and percentage initial absorbance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The first demonstration of heterogeneous catalysis within an oscillatory baffled flow reactor (OBR) is reported, exemplified by the solid acid catalysed esterification of organic acids, an important prototypical reaction for fine chemicals and biofuel synthesis. Suspension of a PrSO3H-SBA-15 catalyst powder is readily achieved within the OBR under an oscillatory flow, facilitating the continuous esterification of hexanoic acid. Excellent semi-quantitative agreement is obtained between OBR and conventional stirred batch reaction kinetics, demonstrating efficient mixing, and highlighting the potential of OBRs for continuous, heterogeneously catalysed liquid phase transformations. Kinetic analysis highlights acid chain length (i.e. steric factors) as a key predictor of activity. Continuous esterification offers improved ester yields compared with batch operation, due to the removal of water by-product from the catalyst, evidencing the versatility of the OBR for heterogeneous flow chemistry and potential role as a new clean catalytic technology. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Nitrogen-containing species in bio-oils obtained from fast pyrolysis of switchgrass were studied using high resolution mass spectrometry at various harvest times throughout the year. Almost three hundred chemical compositions of nitrogen species were determined through efficient ionization and accurate mass information. N2 is the most abundant heteroatom class, followed by NO, N2O, NO2, and N1 compounds. Nitrogen species, especially N2 compounds, dominate the bio-oil spectra in early summer, but decrease significantly in later harvest times. From the contour plots of double bond equivalent versus carbon number and tandem mass spectrometric analysis, the major structural motif for N1 and NO class compounds are assigned as pyridine and that of N2 class compounds as imidazole. The dramatic decrease of N2 class compounds in delayed harvest bio-oils is well correlated with the decomposition of proteins, represented by imidazole as a pyrolysis product of histidine, as the senescence of the perennial plant proceeds. Some of the heterocyclic aromatic compounds are also found in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, further supporting our analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOx) catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to form gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide, a reaction with important applications in food preservation, the manufacture of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and the development of glucose monitoring devices and biofuel cells. We expressed Aspergillus niger wild type GOx and the B11 mutant, which has twice the activity of the wild type enzyme at pH 5.5, as C-terminal fusions with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Aga2 protein, allowing the fusion proteins to be displayed on the surface of yeast EBY100 cells. After expression, we extracted the proteins from the yeast cell wall and purified them by ion-exchange chromatography and ultrafiltration. This produced a broad 100-140 kDa band by denaturing SDS-PAGE and a high-molecular-weight band by native PAGE corresponding to the activity band revealed by zymography. The wild type and B11 fusion proteins had k cat values of 33.3 and 61.3 s-1 and Km values for glucose of 33.4 and 27.9 mM, respectively. The pH optimum for both enzymes was 5.0. The kinetic properties of the fusion proteins displayed the same ratio as their native counterparts, confirming that yeast surface display is suitable for the high-throughput directed evolution of GOx using flow cytometry for selection. Aga2-GOx fusion proteins in the yeast cell wall could also be used as immobilized catalysts for the production of gluconic acid. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant biomass holds a promise for the production of second-generation ethanol via enzymatic hydrolysis, but its utilization as a biofuel resource is currently limited to a large extent by the cost and low efficiency of the cellulolytic enzymes. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to elucidate the mechanisms of the enzymatic process. It is well known that most cellulases possess a catalytic core domain and a carbohydrate binding module (CBM), without which the enzymatic activity can be drastically reduced. However, Cel12A members of the glycosyl hydrolases family 12 (GHF12) do not bear a CBM and yet are able to hydrolyze amorphous cellulose quite efficiently. Here, we use X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations to unravel the molecular basis underlying the catalytic capability of endoglucanase 3 from Trichoderma harzianum (ThEG3), a member of the GHF12 enzymes that lacks a CBM. A comparative analysis with the Cellulomonas fimi CBM identifies important residues mediating interactions of EG3s with amorphous regions of the cellulose. For instance, three aromatic residues constitute a harboring wall of hydrophobic contacts with the substrate in both ThEG3 and CfCBM structures. Moreover, residues at the entrance of the active site cleft of ThEG3 are identified, which might hydrogen bond to the substrate. We advocate that the ThEG3 residues Asn152 and Glu201 interact with the substrate similarly to the corresponding CfCBM residues Asn81 and Arg75. Altogether, these results show that CBM motifs are incorporated within the ThEG3 catalytic domain and suggest that the enzymatic efficiency is associated with the length and position of the substrate chain, being higher when the substrate interact with the aromatic residues at the entrance of the cleft and the catalytic triad. Our results provide guidelines for rational protein engineering aiming to improve interactions of GHF12 enzymes with cellulosic substrates. © 2013 Prates et al.

AB  - The diversity in the chemical composition of lignocellulosic feedstocks can affect the conversion technologies employed for biofuel production. Aqueous-phase reforming (APR) activities of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin components of lignocellulosic biomass materials were evaluated for production of hydrogen content gas mixture using platinum catalyst on activated carbon support. Wheat straw, an abundant by-product from wheat production and kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.), an annual herbaceous plant growing very fast with low lodging susceptibility were used as lignocellulosics in the present study. The hydrolysates of cellulose fractions of biomass materials showed the best performance for gasification. The results indicated that hemicellulose isolated from kenaf was more sensitive to degradation and therefore, produced more gaseous products than that of wheat straw. The hemicellulose isolated from kenaf biomass left the lowest amount of ungasified solid residue in APR among other cellulose and hemicellulose materials studied. Lignin fractions of both biomass materials were not reactive in APR to produce hydrogen rich gas mixture.Gasification efficiencies of kenaf and wheat straw's hemicelluloses were also compared with xylans from beechwood and oat spelts which were commercially available as hemicellulosic fractions.Oat spelts xylan showed better reforming activity over the beechwood xylan. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A two-stage enzymatic process for producing fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) in a packed bed reactor is reported. The process uses an experimental immobilized lipase (NS 88001) and Novozym 435 to catalyze transesterification (first stage) and esterification (second stage), respectively. Both stages were conducted in a simulated series of reactors by repeatedly passing the reaction mixture through a single reactor, with separation of the by-product glycerol and water between passes in the first and second stages, respectively. The second stage brought the major components of biodiesel to 'in-spec' levels according to the European biodiesel specifications for methanol-based biodiesel. The highest overall productivity achieved in the first stage was 2.52kg FAEE(kg catalyst)-1h-1 at a superficial velocity of 7.6cmmin-1, close to the efficiency of a stirred tank reactor under similar conditions. The overall productivity of the proposed two-stage process was 1.56kgFAEE(kg catalyst)-1h-1. Based on this process model, the challenges of scale-up have been addressed and potential continuous process options have been proposed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the increasing concerns into the utilization of lipids as renewable resources for production of biofuels, chemicals, and materials, the efficient extraction and conversion of lipid is one of most important issues for the foundation of cost competitive lipid-economy. In this study, we found that by using a range of "switchable solvents" from 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene to methanol, CO 2, a recognized greenhouse gas, can be used as a trigger to catalyze the methanolysis of soybean and microbial lipids, and facilitate the separation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and glycerol. It was found that the FAMEs can be decanted from the system in a 95.2% conversion efficiency. The produced glycerol can be extracted from the FAMEs completely by the "switchable solvents", and can be separated with high purity after recycling the DBU by an easy extraction process. Our primary investigation of the insitu extraction and conversion of microbial lipids from oleaginous yeast (Rhodosporidium toruloidesY4) shows that, although a 95.4% extraction yield was achieved, the methanolysis efficiency was only 21.9%. Our study presents an efficient and facile process for the integrated clean production of biodiesel and glycerol from soybean and microbial lipids, and the catalyst DBU can be recycled by an easy extraction process. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - Aims: To engineer acetogen biocatalyst capable of fermenting synthesis gas blend to acetone as the only liquid carbonaceous product. Methods and Results: The metabolic engineering comprised inactivation of phosphotransacetylase via integration of a cassette comprising synthetic genes erm(B), thiolase and HMG-CoA synthase. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase was inactivated via integration of a cassette consisting of synthetic genes cat, HMG-CoA lyase and acetoacetate decarboxylase. The engineered biocatalyst Clostridum sp. MAceT113 lost production of 253mmoll-1 ethanol and 296mmoll-1 acetate and started producing 1·8moll-1 acetone in single-stage continuous syngas fermentation. Conclusions: The acetone concentration in culture broth is economical for bulk manufacture because it is about twenty times of that achieved with known acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation of sugars. Significance and Impact of the Study: The process shows the opportunity to produce acetone from synthesis gas at concentrations comparable with production of acetone from products of petroleum cracking. This is the first report on elimination of acetate and acetaldehyde production and directing carbon flux from Acetyl-CoA to acetone via a non-naturally occurring in acetogen acetone biosynthesis pathway identified in eukaryotic organisms. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - The requirements of micronutrients for biomass and hydrocarbon production in Botryococcus braunii UTEX 572 were studied using response surface methodology. The concentrations of four micronutrients (iron, manganese, molybdenum, and nickel) were manipulated to achieve the best performance of B. braunii in laboratory conditions. The responses of algal biomass and hydrocarbon to the concentration variations of the four micronutrients were estimated by a second order quadratic regression model. Genetic algorithm calculations showed that the optimal level of micronutrients for algal biomass were 0.266 μM iron, 0.707 μM manganese, 0.624 μM molybdenum and 3.38 μM nickel. The maximum hydrocarbon content could be achieved when the culture media contained 10.43 μM iron, 6.53 μM manganese, 0.012 μM molybdenum and 1.73 μM nickel. The validation through an independent test in a photobioreactor suggests that the modified media with optimised concentrations of trace elements can increase algal biomass by 34.5% and hydrocarbon by 27.4%. This study indicates that micronutrients play significant roles in regulating algal growth and hydrocarbon production, and the response surface methodology can be used to optimise the composition of culture medium in algal culture. © 2012 Song et al.

AB  - Present study deals with the optimization of biodiesel production using rapeseed oil as feedstock and NaOCH3 as a catalyst. Optimization of different reaction parameters, such as catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time. and alcohol to oil molar ratio, was done using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal experimental conditions for biodiesel production were as follows: catalyst concentration (%) 0.30, reaction temperature 55°C, molar ratio 6.75, and reaction time 60 min. Under these optimal conditions, 97.5 percentage yield of biodiesel was obtained. The observed and predicted values of rapeseed oil methyl esters (ROMEs) yield showed a linear relationship. The fuel properties such as specific gravity 0.876 ± 0.01, flash point 168 ± 0.48°C, fire point 197.8 ± 0.31°C, pour point -7 ± 0.060°C, cloud point -2 ± 0.10°C kinematic viscosity 4.42 ± 0.26 mm2/sec, and sulfur content 0.002 mg/Kg of the produced biodiesel show the suitability of rapeseed oil biodiesel, as fuel. Moreover, engine performance test of the Rapeseed oil biodiesel (rapeseed oil methyl esters, ROME) was examined. The results showed that CO and particulate matter (PM) emissions of the ROME were lower than those of diesel fuel. NOX emissions of the ROME were lower for B5, B20, B40, and B50, while higher for B80 and B100. These results show the environment benefits of biodiesel. © 2012 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer.

AB  - In this study, the methanolysis process of sunflower oil was investigated to get high methyl esters (biodiesel) content using sodium methoxide. To reach to the best process conditions, central composite design (CCD) through response surface methodology (RSM) was employed. The optimal conditions predicted were the reaction time of 60min, an excess stoichiometric amount of alcohol to oil ratio of 25%w/w and the catalyst content of 0.5%w/w, which lead to the highest methyl ester content (100%w/w). The methyl ester content of the mixture from gas chromatography analysis (GC) was compared to that of optimum point. Results, confirmed that there was no significant difference between the fatty acid methyl ester content of sunflower oil produced under the optimized condition and the experimental value (P 0.05). Furthermore, some fuel specifications of the resultant biodiesel were tested according to American standards for testing of materials (ASTM) methods. The outcome showed that the methyl ester mixture produced from the optimized condition met nearly most of the important biodiesel specifications recommended in ASTM D 6751 requirements. Thus, the sunflower oil methyl esters resulted from this study could be a suitable alternative for petrol diesels. Copyright 2012 Sara KoohiKamali et al.

AB  - Sustainably producing concentrated solutions of monosaccharides from biomass is a key challenge facing the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels or bioproducts. Most pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis processes are run at low-solid concentration (&lt;10 wt%) and use chemical catalysts, while most high-solids enzymatic hydrolysis experiments are performed with air-dried pretreated materials. Using optimally two-temperature stage CO 2-H2O pretreated biomass substrates (210 °C 16 min, 160°C, 60 min for mixed hardwood and 210°C, 1 min, 160°C, 60 min), high-solids enzymatic hydrolysis reactions were performed in a novel high-solids reaction system. With this system, twelve "rotating drum" reactors were run simultaneously in a controlled environment. Without additional chemical catalysts or any drying, two-temperature stage CO2-H2O pretreatment coupled with high-solids enzymatic hydrolysis produced monosaccharide solutions of 185 g L-1 for mixed hardwood and 149 g L-1 for switchgrass. Apart from results obtained with dilute acid pretreated corn stover, these are the most concentrated solutions obtained from biomass pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis without substrate drying. The corresponding glucan to glucose yields were above 80% for both types of biomass. Notably, these high yields were obtained because, similar to dilute acid pretreatment but unlike un-catalyzed pretreatment, our approach produced biomass that did not show decreasing yields with increasing enzymatic hydrolysis solid contents. These results suggest that CO2-H2O pretreatment is an attractive alternative to chemically catalyzed processes such as dilute acid pretreatment. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biodiesel manufacture produces crude glycerol as a major byproduct. At the scale estimated for future biodiesel production, extensive quantities of crude glycerol fraction will be generated, creating a large waste stream with potentially significant environmental impacts. The magnitude of projected future crude glycerol supplies suggests that its conversion to a biofuel is the only viable route to producing a product that does not cause market saturation. Previously it was shown that crude glycerol could be converted to hydrogen, a possible future clean energy carrier, by photofermentation using Rhodopseudomonas palustris through photofermentation. Here, the effects of nitrogen source and different concentrations of crude glycerol on this process were assessed. At 20 mM glycerol, 4 mM glutamate, 6.1 mol hydrogen/mole of crude glycerol were obtained under optimal conditions, a yield of 87% of the theoretical, and significantly higher than what was achieved previously. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - The cellulose without and with catalyst (CuCl2, AlCl 3) was subjected to pyrolysis at temperatures from 350 to 500°C with different heating rate (10°C/min, 100°C/s) to produce bio-oil and selected chemicals with high yield. The pyrolytic oil yield was in the range of 37-84 wt% depending on the temperature, the heating rate and the amount of metal chloride. The non-catalytic fast pyrolysis at 500°C gives the highest yield of bio-oil. The mixing cellulose with both metal chlorides results with a significant decrease of the liquid product. The non-catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose gives the highest mass yield of levoglucosan (up to 11.69 wt%). The great influence of metal chloride amount on the distribution of bio-oil components was observed. The copper(II) chloride and aluminum chloride addition to cellulose clearly promotes the formation of levoglucosenone (up to 3.61 wt%), 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-α-d-glucopyranose (up to 3.37 wt%) and unidentified dianhydrosugar (MW = 144; up to 1.64 wt%). Additionally, several other compounds have been identified but in minor quantities. Based on the results of the GC-MS, the effect of pyrolysis process conditions on the productivity of selected chemicals was discussed. These results allowed to create a general model of reactions during the catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose in the presence of copper(II) chloride and aluminum chloride. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A sequential esterification and transesterification method was used successfully to convert high free fatty acid oil into biodiesel with almost 100% conversion. The esterification system was catalysed by ferric-alginate beads (0.16:1 ferric-alginate beads to lauric acid mass ratio, 15:1 methanol to lauric acid molar ratio, methanol refluxing temperature (65 °C), reaction time of 3 h) and transesterification was catalysed by boiler ash-calcium oxide mix (3 wt.% boiler ash, calcium oxide according to the stoichiometric amount of water produced in esterification, 15:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, methanol refluxing temperature (65 °C), reaction time of 0.5 h). Calcium oxide played a dual role to absorb the water produced by the esterification of free fatty acid and also as an active species for transesterification of triglycerides. This method was effectively used to convert palm fatty acid distillate to biodiesel with 100% conversion. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Higher heating value (HHV) is an important property of a fuel, especially for vegetable oils, fats and their derivatives which are intended to replace petroleum fuels. There are lots of methods to evaluate the HHV of a fuel. In this paper, the HHV of vegetable oils, fats and their derivatives (biodiesels) is calculated by using the HHV of their pure fatty acids/methyl esters. The study reveals that, to be in a good agreement with the experimental values, the HHV of the neat compounds must be determined with the highest accuracy. With an error inferior to 2% by comparison to the experimental values, this work shows that the HHV of pure fatty acids or that of methyl esters can be judiciously used to calculate the HHV of the biofuels which they are the components. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils, animal fats or other triacylglycerol-containing materials and an alternative to conventional petroleum-based diesel fuel, has been derived from a variety of feedstocks. Numerous feedstocks have been investigated as potential biodiesel sources, including commodity oils, however, the methyl esters of avocado and olive oil would likely be suitable as biodiesel fuel. In order to expand the database and comprehensive evaluation of the properties of vegetable oil esters, in this work the fuel-related properties of avocado and olive oil methyl esters, which exhibit similar fatty acid profiles including high oleic acid content, are determined. The cetane numbers of avocado oil methyl esters and olive oil methyl esters are relatively high, determined as 59.2 and 62.5, respectively, due to their elevated content of methyl oleate. Other properties are well within the ranges specified in biodiesel standards. The cloud points of both esters are slightly above 0°C due to their content of saturated esters, especially methyl palmitate. Overall, avocado and olive oil yield methyl esters with fuel properties comparable to methyl esters from other commodity vegetable oils.© 2013 .

AB  - Transesterification of crude Jatropha oil in the presence of cesium doped heteropolyacid catalyst and assisted by ultrasonic irradiation was investigated. Different Cs heteropolyacid catalysts with different levels of cesium exchange were synthesized and characterized for physical and chemical properties. They were subsequently tested in pre-elementary reaction conditions to identify the most active catalyst. Cs1.5H1.5PW12O40 catalyst showed the highest FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) yield of 81.3% in 60min while higher Cs levels resulted in poorer activity. Four reaction variables i.e. reaction time (10-50min), methanol to oil molar ratio (5:1-25:1), ultrasonic amplitude (30-90% of the maximum sonifier power) and catalyst amount (2.5-4.5 w/w oil) were optimized to generate mathematical representation of FAME yield. The highest yield of 90.5% was achieved in just 34min under the optimum reaction conditions i.e. at an ultrasonic amplitude of ~60%, and a molar ratio of 25:1. The catalyst was also investigated for possible reusability and leaching under ultrasonic conditions. The reaction was mostly heterogeneous in nature and the catalyst also showed minimal reduction in the activity after three successive reaction runs under the optimum reaction conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes the design and testing of a microfluidic biofuel cell that uses a flow-through bioanode and an air-breathing cathode. The bioanode is Toray carbon paper with glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and methylene green immobilized within a hydrogel. The cathode consists of a commercially available air-breathing platinum cathode hot pressed to a Nafion membrane. All remaining biofuel cell components were laser-cut from poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and silicone sheets. Half-cell experiments indicate that cathode variability limits the biofuel cell. An examination of flow rate effects on the biofuel cell showed that the current density increased sharply up to about 1 mL/min. Tested at this flow rate, the flow-through biofuel cell achieved a maximum current and power density of 705 μA/cm2 and 146 μW/cm2. This was a 6% and 29% improvement in the current and power density, respectively, compared to the previously demonstrated bioanode without flow. Fuel utilization was calculated based on the measured current and by measuring UV-Vis absorbance of the reduced form of hydroxybenzhydrazide. The maximum fuel utilization was 5.8% at a flow rate of 0.05 mL/min. Finally, a numerical model of the biofuel cell was designed and its results compare favorably to actual data. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this work is to improve some of the less desirable properties of bio-oil via the catalytic fast pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse using a novel supported molybdenum carbide (20 wt.% Mo2C/Al2O 3) catalyst. Proximate and elemental analysis of the bagasse were carried out to determine the moisture, ash, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen content. The ground pellets were classified in sieves to a size range of 0.25-1 mm and were pyrolysed in a 300 g h-1 fluidised bed reactor at 500 C. Mo2C/Al2O3 replaced the sand in the fluidised bed reactor in different proportions (0 wt.%, 12 wt.%, 25 wt.% and 50 wt.%) to investigate the effect of this catalyst on the pyrolysis products. Bio-oil yield results showed that ground sugarcane bagasse pellets gave high organic yields in the bio-oil of 60.5 wt.% on dry feed with a total liquid yield of 73.1 wt.% on dry feed without catalyst. Increasing the catalyst proportions in the fluidised bed reduced bio-oil yields, significantly reduced sugars (as α-levoglucosan) concentration and increased furanics and phenolics concentration in the bio-oil. It was observed that the higher the concentration of the 20 wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst in the fluidised bed the lower the viscosity of the bio-oil. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two potential biofuel resources, Douglas-fir and Loblolly pine bark, were subjected to extensive chemical and compositional analysis. The barks were initially extracted with dichloromethane, and the resulting extracted compounds were characterized by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric analysis. Characterization of the major bark biocomponents indicated that Douglas-fir and Loblolly pine bark contained 22. 5 and 13. 2 % tannins, 44. 2 and 43. 5 % lignin, 16. 5 and 23. 1 % cellulose, and 7. 6 and 14. 1 % hemicellulose, respectively. Of particular interest is the high content of tannins and lignin, which make these barks excellent potential precursors for bio-oils and/or other value-added chemicals. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to characterize the chemical structure of the lignin and tannins. These samples were also analyzed by 31P NMR after phosphitylation of the hydroxyl groups in lignin and tannins. The NMR spectral data indicated that the lignin in both barks contained p-hydroxyphenyl (h) and guaiacyl (g) of lignin monomers with an h/g ratio of 10:90 and 22:78 for Douglas-fir and Loblolly pine bark, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography was used to analyze the molecular weight distributions of extracted tannins, isolated cellulose, and ball-milled lignin. The pyrolysis of Douglas-fir and pine bark at 500°C in a tubular reactor generated 48. 2 and 45. 2 % of total oil, of which the light oil contents are 14. 1 and 20. 7 % and heavy oil are 34. 1 and 24. 4 %. Similarly, fast pyrolysis at 375°C yielded 56. 1 and 49. 8 % of total oil for Douglas-fir and pine bark, respectively. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Fischer-Tropsch (FT) based B-XTL processes are attractive alternatives for future energy production. These processes aim at converting lignocellulosic biomass possibly in co-processing with petcoke, coal, or vacuum residues into synthetic biofuels. A gasification step converts the feed into a synthesis gas (CO and H2 mixture), which undergoes the Fischer-Tropsch reaction after H2/CO ratio adjustment and CO2 removal. However synthesis gas also contains various impurities that must be removed in order to prevent Fischer-Tropsch catalyst poisoning. Due to the large feedstocks variety that can be processed, significant variations of the composition of the synthesis gas are expected. Especially, this affects the nature of the impurities that are present (element, speciation), as well as their relative contents. Moreover, due to high FT catalyst sensitivity, severe syngas specifications regarding its purity are required. For these reasons, synthesis gas purification constitutes a major challenge for the development of B-XTL processes. In this article, we focus on these major hurdles that have to be overcome. The different kinds of syngas impurities are presented. The influence of the nature of feedstocks, gasification technology and operating conditions on the type and content of impurities is discussed. Highlight is given on the fate of sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, halides, transition and heavy metals. Main synthesis gas purification technologies (based on adsorption, absorption, catalytic reactions, etc.) are finally described, as well as the related challenges. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Bio-methane, a renewable vehicle fuel, is today produced by anaerobic digestion and a 2nd generation production route via gasification is under development. This paper proposes a poly-generation plant that produces bio-methane, bio-char and heat via fast pyrolysis of biomass. The energy and material flows for the fuel synthesis are calculated by process simulation in Aspen Plus®. The production of bio-methane and bio-char amounts to 15.5. MW and 3.7. MW, when the total inputs are 23. MW raw biomass and 1.39. MW electricity respectively (HHV basis). The results indicate an overall efficiency of 84% including high-temperature heat and the biomass to bio-methane yield amounts to 83% after allocation of the biomass input to the final products (HHV basis). The overall energy efficiency is higher for the suggested plant than for the gasification production route and is therefore a competitive route for bio-methane production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of pretreatment conditions, dilute sulfuric acid concentration and treatment time, on the carbohydrate solubility of a mixture of barley straw and grain. The conditions were expressed as combined severity (CS) to evaluate sugar recovery from pretreated samples. Enzymatic hydrolysates from the lignocellulose pretreatment residues were also included to the results. CS was positively correlating with glucose recovery in all conditions, but in higher acid concentrations CS did not predict xylose recovery. It appeared that the residual xylan better indicate the xylose release. An optimal fermentable sugar yield from the mixture of barley straw and grain was obtained by maintaining the CS at around 1.38, corresponding to an overall glucose yield of 96% and a xylose yield of 57%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, we have explored the possibility to fabricate microbial biofuel cell operating with carbonnanotube-gold-titania nanocomposites (CNT/Au/TiO2) as anode modifier. The results demonstrate thatthe CNT/Au/TiO2electrode could be utilized as a new and effective microbial fuel cell (MFC) anode, whichintegrate the advantages of relevant nanocomposites such as high conductivity, high specific surface area,and easy adsorption of the microorganism. It is evident that the three-dimensional network nanostruc-tures of CNT/Au/TiO2are propitious to improve the relevant anode surface area and thus the adsorptionof the microorganism, which can efficiently promote the electronic transfer rate between the probe andelectrode. Meanwhile, it is noted that open circuit voltage of the CNT/Au/TiO2nanocomposites modi-fied carbon paper anode increased to 0.77 V, which is more than twice that of the open circuit voltageobtained with bare carbon paper anode (0.36 V). And the MFC equipped with CNT/Au/TiO2nanocom-posites modified carbon paper anode delivers a maximum power density of 2.4 mW m-2, which is threetimes larger than that obtained from the MFC with bare carbon paper. This observation illustrates that theCNT/Au/TiO2nanocomposites modified electrode could obviously increase the relevant electron trans-fer rate and promote the electron exchange at electrode surface, which could readily provide enhancedstability and relatively long life-span to facilitate the high electricity production efficiency, suggesting itspromising prospect application in MFCs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrolysis of lipids from microalgae under high water content was investigated as a pretreatment of direct esterification. Results indicated that the hydrolysis process reduced the inhibition by water in FAME production; in addition, FAME obtained by esterification of hydrolysates was increased by 181.7% compared to FAME obtained by direct transesterification under the same amount of water content (80%). This method has great potential in terms of biodiesel production from microalgae since it uses no organic solvent, reduces the drying cost and lowers the operating cost compared to any other traditional method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pt and Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts supported on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were synthesized by a wet reduction-decoration method and tested for catalytic activity of aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol. The Pt decorated on SWNT achieves a catalyst mass time hydrogen yield of 890 micromole gcat-1 min-1, which is higher than the reported results for Pt-alumina catalyst. Experiments also show that this catalyst has better activity than Pt supported on activated carbon with a similar surface area, showing the advantage of SWNTs as a catalyst support. Factors affecting the aqueous phase reforming activity, such as temperature, pressure, WHSV, catalyst particle size, etc., were investigated. We have also explored Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts by combining the structural characterization results with the reactivity results and revealed that bimetallic catalysts may promote the catalyst performance in two different ways: either via the formation of Pt-Co alloy phase or via the synergistic catalytic activities of individual Pt and Co particles. The Pt-Co-SWNT catalyst achieved a hydrogen production activity as high as 4.6 mmol gcat-1 min-1. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The biodegradation of cellulose involves the enzymatic action of cellulases (endoglucanases), cellobiohydrolases (exoglucanases), and β-glucosidases that act synergistically. The rate and efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose in vitro decline markedly with time, limiting the large-scale, cost-effective production of cellulosic biofuels. Several factors have been suggested to contribute to this phenomenon, but there is considerable disagreement regarding the relative importance of each. These earlier investigations were hampered by the inability to observe the disruption of crystalline cellulose and its subsequent hydrolysis directly. Here, we show the application of high-resolution atomic force microscopy to observe the swelling of a single crystalline cellulose fiber and its-hydrolysis in real time directly as catalyzed by a single cellulase, the industrially important cellulase 7B from Trichoderma reesei. Volume changes, the root-mean-square roughness, and rates of hydrolysis of the surfaces of single fibers were determined directly from the images acquired over time. Hydrolysis dominated the early stage of the experiment, and swelling dominated the later stage. The high-resolution images revealed that the combined action of initial hydrolysis followed by swelling exposed individual microfibrils and bundles of microfibrils, resulting in the loosening of the fiber structure and the exposure of microfibrils at the fiber surface. Both the hydrolysis and swelling were catalyzed by the native cellulase; under the same conditions, its isolated carbohydrate-binding module did not cause changes to crystalline cellulose. We anticipate that the application of our AFM-based analysis on other cellulolytic enzymes, alone and in combination, will provide significant insight into the process of cellulose biodegradation and greatly facilitate its application for the efficient and economical production of cellulosic ethanol. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Although exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is an effective strategy for controlling the levels of nitrogen oxides (NOX) emitted from a diesel engine, the full potential of EGR in NOX/PM trade-off and engine performance (i.e., fuel economy) has not fully been exploited. Significant work into the cause and control of particulate matter (PM) has been made over the past decade with new cleaner fuels and after-treatment devices emerging to comply with the current and forthcoming emission regulations. In earlier work, we demonstrated that engine operation with oxygenated fuels (e.g., biodiesel) reduces the PM emissions and extends the engine tolerance to EGR before it reaches smoke-limited conditions. The same result has also been reported when high cetane number fuels such as gas-to-liquid (GTL) are used. To further our understanding of the relationship between EGR and PM formation, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) was integrated into the EGR loop to filter the recirculated soot particulates. The control of the soot recirculation penalty through filtered EGR (FEGR) resulted in a 50% engine-out soot reduction, thus showing the possibility of extending the maximum EGR limit or being able to run at the same level of EGR with an improved NOX/soot trade-off. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Combined acid catalysis was employed as a pretreatment alternative with combined acid catalysts blending sulfuric acid with two biomimetic acids, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and maleic acid (MA), respectively. The influences of acid blending ratio, temperature, and acid dosage on pretreatment performance were investigated. A synergistic effect on hemicellulose decomposition was observed in the combined acid hydrolysis, which greatly increased xylose yield, although TFA/MA would induce more total phenols. Besides, combined TFA pretreatment could efficiently prevent xylose degradation. Fermentation tests of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysates with overliming showed that compared to H 2SO 4 pretreatment, TFA and MA pretreatments improved overall ethanol yield with an increase by 27-54%. Combined acid catalysis was shown as a feasible pretreatment method for its improved sugar yield, reduced phenols production and catalyst costs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Milled Typha latifolia stalk mill was converted to liquid products by using organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, acetone and 2-butanol) with catalysts (10% NaOH or Na 2CO 3) and without catalyst in an autoclave at temperatures of 518, 538 and 558K. The products were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction (benzene and diethyl ether). The percentage yields from supercritical methanol, ethanol, 2-butanol and acetone conversions were 55.0, 58.5, 62.7 and 70.5 at 538K, respectively. In the catalytic run with NaOH, the highest conversion was obtained by using ethanol as a solvent at the same temperature. Conversion yields were analyzed by GC-MS. The aim of the present study was to obtain an alternative for petroleum derived fuels or chemical raw materials. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, a new thermochemical route to produce lignocellulosic ethanol based on DME (dimethyl ether) hydrocarbonylation is proposed and economically assessed. The process is designed and evaluated using current kinetic laboratory data for hydrocarbonylation reactions. Only available technologies or those expected to be available in the short term are considered for the process design, which involves biomass pretreatment and gasification (indirect circulating fluidized bed), gas clean-up and conditioning, methanol synthesis, DME production by methanol dehydration and DME hydrocarbonylation. The process is designed to be both energy self-sufficient and electrical energy neutral. For a plant size of 2140 dry tonnes/day of wood chip (500 MWHHV) the minimum selling price of ethanol (for a 10% rate of return and a biomass price of 66 $/dry tonne) ranges from 0.555 to 0.592 USD2010/L of automotive grade ethanol with fixed capital costs between 333 and 352 M USD2010. Energy efficiency of biomass to ethanol ranges from 44.35 to 45.53% (high heating value basis). These results compare favorably with the " state of the art" production of ethanol via biochemical pathway from lignocellulosic biomass, revealing that the DME hydrocarbonylation route is a promising one that could be cost-competitive in the near future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lipids of microbial origin have gained much attention due to its wide applicability and high productivity. Widely studied microbial lipids are those coming from single cell oils such as microalgae, yeast and other fungi. Many researches have focused on enhancing lipid accumulation as well as biomass productivity with hope to utilize the accumulated lipids as an alternative source for biodiesel production. Unfortunately these biological lipids have often been under utilized due to inefficient extraction technologies. In addition, in order to maximize lipid extraction toxic solvents such as chloroform are often employed. In this study subcritical water (SCW) was employed for the treatment of samples from microbial origin to enhance their extractable intracellular lipids. Optimum temperature and time for SCW treatment of wet microbial cells such as activated sludge and yeast cells was found to be 448K and 900s, respectively. After SCW treatment, a 2-4 folds increase in the extractable neutral lipid was observed without the need of using toxic solvent such as chloroform and cyclohexane. An investigation on the possible mechanism on how SCW treatment was able to improve lipid extractability was also carried out in this study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The direct catalytic cracking of biomass pyrolysis vapour into aromatics derived from Douglas fir sawdust pellets was tested using an upfront microwave pyrolysis process coupled with a packed-bed catalysis process using a ZSM-5 Zeolite catalyst. A central composite experimental design (CCD) was used to optimize the bio-oil and syngas yields. The effects of temperature and inverse weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)-1 on the bio-oil composition were determined. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis results showed that the bio-oil contained aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched and became the most abundant compounds accounting for about 15-92.6% in upgraded bio-oils, depending on the catalytic pyrolysis conditions. The aromatic hydrocarbons were mainly composed of benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, and their derivatives. When the effect of the reaction temperature on the bio-oil chemical compositions was analysed with a fixed (WHSV)-1 (0.048 h), we found that the aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 0.72% in raw bio-oil (no catalyst added) to around 92.6% when the catalysis temperature was 500 °C, clearly demonstrating that a high temperature with the ZSM-5 Zeolite catalyst favoured the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. At a lower temperature fixed at 375°C, the aromatic hydrocarbon content was increased from 0.72% to 78.1% with a (WHSV)-1 increase from 0 to 0.075. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Nanoporous and planar gold electrodes were utilised as supports for the redox enzymes Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase (GOx) and Corynascus thermophilus cellobiose dehydrogenase (CtCDH). Electrodes modified with hydrogels containing enzyme, Os-redox polymers and the cross-linking agent poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether were used as biosensors for the determination of glucose and lactose. Limits of detection of 6.0 (±0.4), 16.0 (±0.1) and 2.0 (±0.1) μM were obtained for CtCDH-modified lactose and glucose biosensors and GOx-modified glucose biosensors, respectively, at nanoporous gold electrodes. Biofuel cells composed of GOx- and CtCDH-modified gold electrodes were utilised as anodes, together with Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase (MvBOD) or Melanocarpus albomyces laccase as cathodes, in biofuel cells. A maximum power density of 41 μW/cm2 was obtained for a CtCDH/MvBOD biofuel cell in 5 mM lactose and O2-saturated buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1 M phosphate, 150 mM NaCl). © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis is one of the most promising technologies for the production of renewable aromatics and olefins directly from solid biomass. In this study, catalytic pyrolysis experiments were carried out on biomass in a fluidized bed reactor using typical metal-loaded (Mg, K, Fe, Ga, and Ni) ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts. The effects of catalysts on the product distribution and bio-oil components were investigated to determine the cheapest and most efficient metal-loaded catalyst. The results showed that bio-oil yields with metal-loaded catalysts (40 to 43.4 wt.%) were a little lower than that of pure ZSM-5 (46.4 wt.%). Metal-loaded catalysts produced more CO2 and CO than did pure ZSM-5. Fe/ZSM-5 produced the highest yield of CO2 (13.8 wt.%), as well as the highest yield of olefins (2.7 wt.%). Fe/ZSM-5 showed the same catalytic characteristics as Ga/ZSM-5 (aromatic hydrocarbon proportion in bio-oils of more than 80%), but it is much cheaper than Ga/ZSM-5.

AB  - Catalytic hydrothermal upgradation of wheat husk was performed at 280°C for 15min in the presence of alkaline catalysts (KOH and K2CO3). The effect of alkaline catalysts on the yield of bio-oil products and composition of bio-oils obtained were discussed. Total bio-oil yield (31%) comprising of bio-oil1 (ether fraction) and bio-oil2 (acetone fraction) was maximum with K2CO3 solution. Powder XRD (X-ray diffraction) analysis of wheat husk as well as bio-residue samples show that the peaks due to cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin become weak in bio-residue samples which suggest that these components have undergone hydrolytic cleavage/decomposition. The FTIR spectra of bio-oils indicate that the lignin in the wheat husk samples was decomposed to low molecular weight phenolic compounds. 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum of bio-oil1 shows more than 50% of the protons resonate in the up field region from 0.5ppm to 3.0ppm. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An efficient bifunctional catalyst lipase/organophosphonic acid-functionalized silica (SG-T-P-LS) has been successfully developed, and biodiesel production of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) from free fatty acid (FFA) oleic acid with short-chain alcohol ethanol catalyzed by SG-T-P-LS was investigated. The process optimization using response surface methodology (RSM) was performed and the interactions between the operational variables were elucidated, and it was found that the molar ratio of alcohol to acid was the most significant factor. The optimum values for maximum conversion ratio can be obtained by using a Box-Behnken center-united design, and the conversion ratio could reach 89.94. ±. 0.42% under the conditions that ethanol/acid molar ratio was 1.05:1 and SG-T-P-LS to FFA weight ratio was 14.9. wt.% at 28.6. °C. The research results show that SG-T-P and LS-20 could work cooperatively to promote the esterification reaction, and the bifunctional catalyst SG-T-P-LS is a potential catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As fossil fuels are depleting day by day, it is necessary to find an alternative fuel to fulfill the energy demand of the world. Biodiesel is considered as an environmentally friendly renewable diesel fuel alternative. The interest in using Jatropha curcas as a feedstock for the production of biodiesel is rapidly growing. On the one hand, J. curcas' oil does not compete with the food sector due to its toxic nature and to the fact that it must be cultivated in marginal/poor soil. On the other, its price is low and stable.In the last decade, the investigation on biodiesel production was centered on the choice of the suitable raw material and on the optimization of the process operation conditions. Nowadays, research is focused on the improvement of the energetic performance and on diminishing the inefficiencies in the different process components. The method of exergy analysis is well suited for furthering this goal, for it is a powerful tool for developing, evaluating and improving an energy conversion system.In this work, we identify the location, magnitude and sources of thermodynamic inefficiencies in a biodiesel production process from J. curcas by means of an exergy analysis. The thermodynamic properties were calculated from existing databases or estimated when necessary. The higher exergy destruction takes places in the transesterification reactor due to chemical reactions. Almost 95% of the exergy of the fuel is destroyed in this reactor. The exergetic efficiency of the overall process is 63%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are a potential resource for biodiesel production. A green alga, Chlorella sp., was isolated from Arctic sea ice, which was named ArM0029B. These algae displayed faster growth at a wide temperature range of 4-32. °C compared to Chlorella vulgaris. ArM0029B also accumulated high levels of total fatty acids under nitrogen starvation conditions, reaching 39% of dry cell weight, with the proportion of oleic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2) reaching 54% of total fatty acids. Taken together, these results indicate that the newly identified Chlorella species, ArM0029B, is a promising candidate for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The environmental concerns and the European liquid (bio) fuel regulations have determined a growing demand on biofuels. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can provide clean synthetic fuels containing low concentrations of sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatics. While Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using natural gas and coal is a well established and commercialized process for more than 70 years, the new technology of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using biomass as feedstock is gaining more and more attention due to the possibilities of using renewable raw materials. In this work, in order to optimize the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the influence of operating conditions has been studied in a slurry reactor using a Co-based catalyst. Experiments were performed at different syngas composition (variation of H2/CO ratio) and pressure (24, 20, and 16 bar), keeping the other parameters (temperature, 230 °C; gas flow, 5 Nm3/h) constant. The effects of pressure on CO conversion, product distribution, C5+ selectivity, Par/Ole ratio, and α value were investigated, and the results were compared with data from literature. It was found that-increasing the reaction pressure-heavier hydrocarbons were formed, and CO conversion increased from 44. 2 to 63. 7 %. A slight change has been observed in the case of an α value between 0. 89 and 0. 9, C5+ selectivity between 90. 6 and 91. 7 %, and Par/Ole ratio between 11. 4 and 14. 1. An important role for the results obtained was attributed to H2/CO ratio variation during the experiments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this study the partial oxidation of a biomass source, namely olive mill wastewater (OMW) was investigated in supercritical water. OMW is a by-product obtained in olive oil production and it has a very complex nature that is characterized by a high content of polyphenols and organic compounds. The partial oxidation experiments were carried out at five different reaction temperatures (400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 °C) and five different oxygen concentrations (9.11, 18.22, 45.55, 91.10 and 182.20 mmol O 2/L) with a reaction time of 30 s, under a pressure of 25 MPa. In addition, various OMW concentrations were tested in order to comprehend the effects on biofuel yield and composition. The gaseous products were generally composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and C 1-C 4 hydrocarbons like methane, ethane, propane and propylene. The maximum yield of the obtained gaseous product was 5.55 m 3/kg carbon in OMW with feed total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of 2500 mg/L, at a temperature of 550 °C. At these reaction conditions, the aforementioned product composition was 7.93% for hydrogen, 28.91% for methane, 5.85% for ethane, 0.47% for propane, 0.55% for propylene, 54.04% for carbon dioxide and 0.16% for minor components such as n-butane, i-butane, 1-butene, i-butene, t-2-butene, 1,3-butadiene and nitrogen. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The preparation and characterization of three-dimensional hierarchical architectures, consisting of monolithic nanoporous gold or silver films formed on highly ordered 3D microporous carbon supports, are described. The formation of these nano/microporous structures involves the electrodeposition or sputtering of metal alloys onto the lithographically patterned multi-layered microporous carbon, followed by preferential chemical dealloying of the less noble component. The resulting hierarchical structure displays a highly developed 3D interconnected network of micropores with a nanoporous metal coating. Tailoring the nanoporosity of the metal films and the diameter of the large micropores has been accomplished by systematically changing the alloy compositions via control of the deposition potential, plating solution and coarsening time. SEM imaging illustrates the formation of unique biomimetic nanocoral- or nanocauliflower-like self-supporting structures, depending on the specific preparation conditions. The new 3D hierarchical nano/microporous architectures allow for enhanced mass transport and catalytic activity compared to common nanoporous films prepared on planar substrates. The functionality of this new carbon-gold hierarchical structure is illustrated for the greatly enhanced performance of enzymatic biofuel cells where a substantially higher power output is observed compared to the bare microporous carbon substrate. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The development of biodiesels is being driven by the need for reducing emissions from diesel engines without modifying engines and for saving energy. The major obstacle to biodiesel commercialization is the high cost of raw materials. Biodiesel from waste cooking oil is an economical source and an effective strategy for reducing the raw material cost. Although biodiesels made from waste cooking oil have been previously investigated, PAH emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs) with catalyzer fueled with biodiesel from waste cooking oil and its blend with ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) for the US-HDD transient cycle have seldom been addressed. Experimental results indicate that ULSD/WCOB (biodiesel made from waste cooking oil) blends had lower PM, HC, and CO emissions but higher CO 2 and NO x emissions when compared with that of ULSD. Using ULSD/WCOB blends instead of ULSD decreased PAHs by 14.1%-53.3%, PM by 6.80%-15.1%, HC by 6.76%-23.5%, and CO by 0.962%-8.65% but increase CO 2 by 0.318-1.43% and NOx by 0.384-1.15%. Using WCOB is an economical source and an effective strategy for reducing cost, and solves the problem of waste oil disposal. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - Enzyme electrodes show great potential for many applications, as biosensors and more recently as anodes and cathodes in biocatalytic fuel cells for power generation. Enzymes have advantages over metal catalysts, as they provide high specificity and reaction rates, while operating under mild conditions. Here we report on studies related to development of mass-producible, completely enzymatic printed glucose/oxygen biofuel cells. The cells are based on filter paper coated with conducting carbon inks containing mediators and laccase, for reduction of oxygen, or aldose dehydrogenase, for oxidation of glucose. Mediator performance in these printed formats is compared to relative rate constants for the enzyme-mediator reaction in solution, for a range of anode and cathode mediators. The power output and stability of fuels cells using an acidophilic laccase isolated from Trametes hirsuta is greater, at pH 5, than that for cells based on Melanocarpus albomyces laccase, that shows optimal activity closer to neutral pH, at pH 6. Highest power output, although of limited stability, was observed for ThL/ABTS cathodes, providing a maximum power density of 3.5μWcm -2 at 0.34V, when coupled to an ALDH glucose anode mediated by an osmium complex. The stability of cell voltage above a threshold of 200mV under a moderate 75kΩ load is used to benchmark printed fuel cell performance. Highest stability was obtained for a printed fuel cell using osmium complexes as mediators of glucose oxidation by aldose dehydrogenase, and oxygen reduction by T. hirsuta laccase, maintaining cell voltage above 200mV for 137h at pH 5. These results provide promising directions for further development of mass-producible, completely enzymatic, printed biofuel cells. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..

AB  - Many research reported vegetable oil as a potential substitute for diesel engines with its ester form known as biodiesel. The biodiesel can be prepared by different process using vegetable oil and alcohol. The common process used for biodiesel preparation is known as transesterification. This paper presents the transesterification of Sal oil (Shorea robusta) into Sal oil methyl ester (SOME) and its performance in direct injection diesel engine. Several process parameters such as catalyst quantity, molar ratio of alcohol, reaction temperature and reaction time were studied and the optimized process conditions are amount of catalyst (NaOH) - 0.25wt%, alcohol (methanol) - 150% excess, reaction temperature - 65°C and reaction time - 1.5h. The studies with SOME as fuel in the direct injection diesel engine shows that the exhaust emissions such as CO, HC and NO x are reduced by 25%, 45% and 12%, respectively compared to diesel without significant difference in thermal efficiency. Based on this study it is concluded that the SOME can be used as fuel without any modifications in the engine and hence this biodiesel can be a potential substitute to standard diesel fuel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The activities of single step sol-gel made calcium oxide on alumina catalysts were studied as a function of CaO loading, methanol/oil molar ratio and the amount of the catalyst in the transesterification of sunflower oil at 50°C. Also, the turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalysts was calculated to better understand the relationship between the basicity/basic strength and the catalytic activity. From volcano curve (TOF vs. basic strength), it was found that under 50°C and methanol/oil molar ratio of 9, 60% CaO/Al 2O 3 had the highest turnover frequency, 0.028s -1, whereas 85% CaO/Al 2O 3 showed the highest biodiesel yield, ∼96.6%, but TOF obtained on it was 0.012s -1. It seemed that 60% CaO catalyst had the proper basic strength to obtain the highest TOF. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increased acceptance of climate change induced by human activities and raising oil demand with unsecure deliverance compels the searching for alternative fuels. The problems with environmental degradation due to industrial wastes can be reduced by converting some of them into bio-oil. In the present work, the waste from fish processing industry is converted to bio-oil by catalytic cracking. Experiments were conducted in a direct injection diesel engine of 4.5. kW at 1500. rpm. The different test fuels of diesel, fish oil at 75 °C, bio-oil UD (undistilled bio-oil), B20D80 (20% bio-oil in fossil diesel), B80D20 (80% bio-oil in fossil diesel) and neat bio-oil were tested to assess the suitability in diesel engines through combustion, emission and performance characteristics. Experimental results show that the brake thermal efficiency is marginally higher with neat bio-oil over other test fuels. It is lower with preheated fish oil and it is almost same for both bio-oil and bio-oil UD. NOx, HC, CO and PM emissions are higher with bio-oil UD compared to bio-oil. PM, CO and HC emissions are lower with bio-oil over diesel. NOx emissions are lower with bio-oil compared to bio-oil UD but it is still higher than diesel fuel. Addition of diesel with bio-oil reduces the NOx emissions marginally. Intensity of premixed combustion is strong with bio-oil. Ignition delay and combustion duration are reduced with bio-oil due to high cetane number and oxygen concentration. Bio-oil from waste fish fat by catalytic cracking can be used as a fuel for diesel engines and also the waste to energy may reduce the environmental and climate change issues due to industrial wastes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work proposes an innovative catalytic pyrolysis process that converts bio-refinery residues, such as spent grains, into intermediate bio-oil with improved properties compared to traditional bio-oils, which allows the use of existing crude-oil refinery settings for bio-oil upgrading into fuels. The integration of bio-oil into a crude-oil refinery would decrease the economic disadvantage of biomass compared to fossil fuels. The catalytic pyrolysis was able to produce bio-oil with a lower O and N content and high levels of aliphatics and H by using activated serpentine and olivine at 430-460 °C. The activated materials seem to be beneficial to the bio-oil energy content by increasing it from less than 20 MJ kg-1 in the original biomass to 26 MJ kg-1. Approximately 70-74 % of the starting energy remains in the bio-oil using activated olivine (ACOL) and activated serpentine (ACSE) at 430 °C, whereas only 52 % is retained using alumina (ALU) at the same temperature. There was a strong reduction of the O content in the bio-oils, and the deoxygenation power decreased in the following order: ACOL&gt;ACSE&gt;ALU. In particular, ACOL at 430-460 °C was able to reduce the O content of the bio-oil by 40 %. The oxygenated bio-oil macromolecules interact in the catalyst's active sites with the naturally present metallic species and undergo decarboxylation with the formation of C5-C6 O-depleted species. Grains of truth: Catalytic pyrolysis is able to produce bio-oil with a low O and N content and high levels of aliphatics and H from spent grains by using activated serpentine and olivine at 430-460 °C. The biomass oxygenated vapours and aerosols interact in the macro- and mesoporous active sites with the naturally present metallic species to undergo decarboxylation with the formation of CO2 and C5-C6 O-depleted species. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - What is the algal energy? What kinds of energy are there in algae? How is energy obtained from algae? Algae can be grown almost anywhere. Algae are photosynthetic organisms that can produce lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in large amounts over short periods of time. These products can be processed into both biofuels and useful chemicals. Algae can be converted to bioethanol, bio-oil, biohydrogen and biomethane via thermochemical and biochemical methods. Algal oil can be converted to biodiesel with methyl alcohol transesterification. Algal technology also covers the economic, ecological, and biotechnological applications of algae, algal biodiversity, classification systems, molecular phylogenetics. Use of biodiesel from oilgae is a promising alternative to solve air pollution problems. © Sila Science.

AB  - Microwave-assisted direct liquefaction (MADL) of Ulva prolifera was performed in ethylene glycol (EG) using sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a catalyst. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed to optimize the conditions of three independent variables (catalyst content, solvent-to-feedstock ratio and temperature) for the liquefaction yield. And the bio-oil was analyzed by elementary analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis (FT-IR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The maximum liquefaction yield was 93.17%, which was obtained under a microwave power of 600W for 30min at 165°C with a solvent-to-feedstock ratio of 18.87:1 and 4.93% sulfuric acid. The bio-oil was mainly composed of phthalic acid esters, alkenes and a fatty acid methyl ester with a long chain from C16 to C20. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Different loading of palladium (Pd) nanoparticles were successfully fabricated on multi-walled carbon nanotubes using Pd acetylacetonate as the precursor via a simple liquid impregnation method. The crystal phase, morphology, textural structure and the chemical state of the resulting Pd nanoparticles (Pd/CNT) catalysts were studied and the characterization results indicated that the uniform dispersion of small Pd nanoparticles with the size range of 1.0-4.5 nm was achieved. The synthesized Pd/CNT catalysts exhibited efficient performance for the catalytic hydrogenation of biomass-derived levulinic acid into biofuel γ-valerolactone. In comparison with the commercial 5 wt% Pd/C and the 5 wt% Pd/CNT catalyst prepared by Pd nitrate precursor, much higher activities were achieved, whereas the biofuel γ-valerolactone was highly produced with 56.3 % yield at 57.6 % conversion of levulinic acid on the 5 wt% Pd/CNT catalyst under mild conditions. The catalyst developed in this work may be a good candidate for the wide applications in the hydrogenation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - Biodiesel, using microalgae as feedstocks, is being explored as the most potent form of alternative diesel fuel for sustainable economic development. A comparative assessment of various protocols for microalgal lipid extraction was carried out using five green algae, six blue-green algae and two diatom species treated with different single and binary solvents both at room temperature and using a soxhlet. Lipid recovery was maximum with chloroform-methanol in the soxhlet extractor. Pre-treatments of biomass, such as sonication, homogenization, bead-beating, lyophilization, autoclaving, microwave treatment and osmotic shock did not register any significant rise in lipid recovery. As lipid recovery using chloroform-methanol at room temperature demonstrated a marginally lower value than that obtained under the soxhlet extractor, on economical point of view, the former is recommended for microalgal total lipid extraction. Transesterification process enhances the quality of biodiesel. Experiments were designed to determine the effects of catalyst type and quantity, methanol to oil ratio, reaction temperature and time on the transesterification process using response surface methodology. Fatty acid methyl ester yield reached up to 91% with methanol:HCl:oil molar ratio of 82:4:1 at 65°C for 6.4 h reaction time. The biodiesel yield relative to the weight of the oil was found to be 69%. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - In this paper, we present a superstructure optimization approach for the integration of the simultaneous production of liquid fuels and hydrogen from switchgrass and shale gas. The process is based on Fischer-Tropsch technology in which the shale gas is reformed with steam, while the switchgrass is gasified and reformed (with steam or partial oxidation). The raw gas is cleaned up and its composition may be adjusted (using either water gas shift reaction or pressure swift adsorption). Next, the sour gases are removed before the liquid fuels are produced using an FT reactor. The heavy liquids are upgraded using hydrocracking to increase the yield towards FT-diesel. A sensitivity study on the raw material prices reveals that production costs for the biomass-shale gas facility are below $1/gal as long as biomass price is below $100/t and the price of the shale gas is not higher than $11.5/MMBTU. Furthermore, hydrogen is produced as long as the demand for liquid fuels can be met and there is enough shale gas available. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The zeolite catalyzed gas phase alkylation of phenol with propylene is studied with an aim to maximize the production of 2-isopropylphenol instead of the usual focus with zeolites of producing the para product, in this case 4-isopropylphenol. The reaction pathway studies show that 2-isopropylphenol and 4-isopropylphenol are the primary products of the alkylation reactions, as expected. Additionally, it is determined that 3-isopropylphenol and 4-isopropylphenol do not participate in secondary reactions once they are formed, while 2-isopropylphenol and isopropylphenyl ether are more likely to de-alkylate than isomerize in secondary reactions. Of the zeolite topologies studied (FAU, BEA, MOR, MFI, TUN, MEL, MWW, MTT, CHA), maximum 2-isopropylphenol selectivity is obtained when the reactions are not restricted in the zeolite pores and the conversion occurs predominantly on the external surface. For intrazeolitic reactions, BEA zeolite maximizes the 2-isopropylphenol selectivity by balancing diffusion and steric limitations with secondary reactions producing di-alkylated products. The sensitivity of the product selectivity to zeolite pore size when the reaction occurs mainly in the pores suggests this reaction could be used as a test to estimate the pore size of an unknown zeolite. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel consists of fatty acids short chain alkyl esters produced through transesterification and esterification of fats and oils. Production of biodiesel is strongly affected by the purity of raw lipids, and catalysts play important role in these processes. Although direct utilization of impure feedstocks is more economical, their use necessitates development of effective catalysts to overcome hindering influences of impurities. In this study, sulfuryl chloride, thionyl chloride, acetyl chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, dimethylsulfate and sulfuric acid were investigated as catalysts for the production of biodiesel because acids have higher tolerance to water and free fatty acids in oils and can simultaneously catalyze both the esterification and transesterification reactions. Sulfuryl chloride was found to be an effective catalyst for production of biodiesel from soybean oil, its waste oil and microalgal lipids. © 2013 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A three-step bio-oil production process involving torrefaction pretreatment (at 225, 250, or 275 °C with a 20 min hold time), pyrolysis (at 500 °C with two heating rates), and secondary catalytic processing over HZSM-5 (at 400, 450, or 500 °C) was studied to determine process effects, particularly of torrefaction, on the yield of liquid and aromatic hydrocarbons and the quality of upgraded bio-oil. When bio-oils derived from torrefied biomass were catalytically cracked, average yields (%, w/w of feed) of reactor char (100% reduction), catalyst coke (21.4%), and catalyst tar (8.1%) were significantly reduced relative to the best-case conditions using non-torrefied feedstock. The reduction in coke (%, w/w of feed) as a result of torrefaction was 28.5% relative to the respective control for slow-pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading and 34.9% for fast-pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading. The concentration of aromatic product (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, i.e., BTEX) was highest at 95 g L-1 for upgraded (at 500 °C) fast-pyrolysis bio-oil derived from biomass torrefied at 275 °C. Catalyst effectiveness for BTEX production significantly increased with increased torrefaction and catalytic cracking temperatures. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Recent metabolic engineering practice was briefly reviewed including the case where a mixture of multiple sugars obtained from lignocellulose, etc. was used as a carbon source to produce a variety of biofuels and biochemicals for the realization of green society. In the wild type Escherichia coli, sequential utilization of carbon sources is observed as known as diauxie phenomenon due to carbon catabolite repression (CCR), where much attention has been focused on co-consumption of multiple sugars to improve the productivities of the target metabolites. Although co-consumption of multiple sugars can be attained by modulating phosphotransferase system (PTS) and mgsA, pgi, etc. in E. coli, the glucose uptake rate inherently became lower, and thus the productivity of such metabolite as ethanol may not be improved, where this may be improved by amplifying the non-PTS pathway genes such as galP and glk. It should be noted that the modulation of PTS gene might change the robustness from the systems biology point of view. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An environmentally friendly pretreatment process was developed to fractionate hemicelluloses and lignin from poplar wood by ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment coupled with mild alkaline extraction. Hemicellulosic and lignin fractions were obtained in high yields, amounting to 59.3% and 74.4%, respectively, which can served as raw materials for production of value-added products. The yield of glucose for the integrated pretreated poplar wood was 99.2%, while it was just 19.2% for the untreated material. The synergistic benefits of the removal of lignin and hemicelluloses, the increase of the cellulose surface area, and the conversion of cellulose fibers from the cellulose I to the cellulose II crystal phase resulted in the high glucose yield for the integrated pretreated substrate. Therefore, the IL based biorefining strategy proposed can integrate biofuels production into a biorefinery scheme in which the major components of poplar wood can be converted into value-added products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A raw bio-oil from pine sawdust, the liquid product from its thermal conditioning and a synthetic bio-oil composed by eight model compounds representing the main chemical groups in bio-oils, were converted thermally and over a commercial equilibrium FCC catalyst. The experiments were performed in a fixed bed reactor at 500. °C. The highest hydrocarbon yield (53.5. wt.%) was obtained with the conditioned liquid. The coke yields were significant in all the cases, from 9 to 14. wt.%. The synthetic bio-oil produced lesser hydrocarbons and more oxygenated compounds and coke than the authentic feedstocks from biomass. The previous thermal treatment of the raw bio-oil had the positive effects of increasing 25% the yield of hydrocarbons, decreasing 55% the yield of oxygenated compounds and decreasing 20% the yield of coke, particularly the more condensed coke. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using glycerol from biodiesel production as a fuel in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) will generate electricity and value-added by-products from what is currently considered waste. This research screened Escherichia coli W3110 (ATCC 27325) and a mixed culture enriched from compost (AR2) as anodic biocatalysts in a mediatorless glycerol-oxidizing MFC. In an H-type MFC, the mixed culture AR2 biocatalyst produced a maximum power density of 11.7mWm-2 compared to 9.8mWm-2 using E. coli W3110 as the anodic catalyst. In batch operation of the fuel cell, the mixed culture AR2 was able to anaerobically consume 29g/L of glycerol compared to only 3.3g/L using the E. coli strain. The mixed culture was also shown to concurrently produce 1,3-propanediol, a value-added product, and electricity from a pure glycerol feedstock in an MFC. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) has recently become a redox enzyme at focus in bioelectrochemistry especially for the construction of sugar biosensors and biofuel cell anodes. The present study shows that an increase in the CaCl 2 concentration to up to 100 mM led to an increase in the maximal catalytic current generated by two different Ascomycete and one Basidiomycete CDH immobilised on a spectroscopic graphite electrode. For the Ascomycete Myriococcum thermophilum CDH the catalytic current was increased 5.1 fold, whereas Ascomycete Humicola insolens CDH showed a four-fold increase and Basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium CDH showed an increase by a factor of 2.4. On the other hand, the addition of a monovalent cation salt, KCl (up to 100 mM), to the buffers increased the catalytic currents only up to 2-fold for Myriococcum thermophilum CDH. Activity assays in solution with cyt c accepting solely the electrons from the CYT CDH domain also revealed an increased activity in the presence of CaCl 2. Experiments with the isolated DH CDH domain from Humicola insolens have shown that the catalytic turnover is totally independent on the addition of KCl or CaCl 2 to the solution. The results indicate a positive effect of metal cations, particularly Ca 2 +, on the electron transfer between the DH CDH and the CYT CDH domains or between the CYT CDH domain and the final electron acceptor, whereas the first hypothesis is favoured. These findings are of interest both for the construction of 3 rd generation biosensors and biofuel cell anodes, and also for a deeper understanding of the electron transfer mechanism in CDH. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Efficient recovery of ionic liquid (IL) from aqueous mixture of ILs and sugars (which derived from enzymatic or chemical catalyzed hydrolysis of ILs-pretreated biomass) is a major drawback for commercialization of biofuel and platform chemicals production from biomass utilized ILs as pretreatment solvent. In this study, simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography equipped with ion exclusion column (containing [Emim] + cation) was investigated to separate sugars (glucose and xylose) which are the main products from biomass hydrolysate and 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EmimAc) which is the ILs used for biomass pretreatment. A four-zone SMB system with a configuration of 2-2-2-2 (2 ion exclusion columns in each zone) was used to recover glucose, xylose and EmimAc from their aqueous mixture with yield of 71.38, 99.37 and 98.92%, respectively. Moreover, the optimization of SMB zone configuration by simulation results in a complete recovery of ILs. This result indicates that for the first time, ion exclusion SMB chromatography could be used for complete recovery of ILs from aqueous sugar mixture. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Solar fuels, such as hydrogen gas produced from water and methanol produced from carbon dioxide reduction by artificial photosynthesis, have received considerable attention. In natural leaves the photosynthetic proteins are well-organized in the thylakoid membrane. To develop an artificial leaf device for solar low-carbon fuel production from CO 2, a chlorophyll derivative chlorin-e 6 (Chl-e 6; photosensitizer), 1-carboxylundecanoyl-1′-methyl-4,4′-bipyrizinium bromide, iodide (CH 3V(CH 2) 9COOH; the electron carrier) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) (the catalyst) immobilised onto a silica-gel-based thin layer chromatography plate (the Chl-V-FDH device) was investigated. From luminescence spectroscopy measurements, the photoexcited triplet state of Chl-e 6 was quenched by the CH 3V(CH 2) 9COOH moiety on the device, indicating the photoinduced electron transfer from the photoexcited triplet state of Chl-e 6 to the CH 3V(CH 2) 9COOH moiety. When the CO 2-saturated sample solution containing NADPH (the electron donor) was flowed onto the Chl-V-FDH device under visible light irradiation, the formic acid concentration increased with increasing irradiation time. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Production of biodiesel from crude palm oil (CPO) with 6 wt% of free fatty acid (FFA) using a low-frequency ultrasonic irradiation (40 kHz) technique was investigated in the present work. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between various important parameters of the alkaline catalyzed transesterification process to obtain a high conversion to biodiesel. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to statistically analyze and optimize the operating parameters of the process. A central composite design (CCD) was adopted to study the effects of the methanol to oil molar ratio, the catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and irradiation time on conversion to biodiesel. RESULTS: The result from the RSM analysis indicated that the methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration and irradiation time have the most significant effects on the conversion to biodiesel. Moreover, a coefficient of determination (R 2) value of 0.93 shows the fitness of a second-order model for the present study. Based on this second-order model, the optimum conditions for alkaline catalyzed transesterification of CPO were found to be a methanol to oil molar ratio of 6.44:1, catalyst concentration 1.25 wt%, reaction temperature 38.44 °C and irradiation time 25.96 min. At the calculated optimum condition, the conversion to biodiesel reached 97.85%. Under these same conditions, the experimental value was 98.02 ± 0.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model developed has been proven to adequately describe the range of the experimental parameters studied and provide a statistically accurate prediction of the optimum conversion to biodiesel. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Biodiesel was obtained by transesterification of Jatropha curcus oil with anhydrous methanol, ethanol, and various mixtures of methanol/ethanol system. The present research work ultrasonic assisted transesterification of J. curcus oil was carried out in the presence of various mixtures of methanol/ethanol system and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst, keeping the molar ratio of oil to alcohol 1:6. The methodology allows for the reaction to be run under atmospheric conditions. The ethanomethanolysis and ultrasonic mixing promote the rate of transesterification reaction due to the better solubility of oil with ethanol in reaction mixture and obtained methyl esters as well as ethyl esters. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The reaction pathways of co-liquefaction of swine manure and crude glycerol to bio-oil (ester compounds) were investigated. Swine manure was hydrothermal treated (340°C, 27.5MPa, 15min) with a number of model compounds in a high pressure batch reactor under inert atmosphere. The compounds were methanol, pure glycerol, mixture of pure glycerol, pure methanol and H 2O, and commercial fatty acids (linoleic acid). The chemical composition of the bio-oil was analyzed by GC/MS. Glycerol, methanol and water showed synergistic effects on manure liquefaction, increasing the oil yield as high as 65%. A maximum oil yield of 79.96% was obtained when linoleic acid reacted with swine manure. Based on the results, the reaction pathways were proposed. Esterification reactions occurred not only because the crude glycerol have methanol, but also because methanol can be produced from hydrothermal reactions of glycerol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study describes the cooperative effect of the two biocatalysts Acetobacter aceti and Gluconobacter roseus for biodegradation as well as current generation. The electro activity of the biofilms of these two microorganisms was investigated by the bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol and glucose using cyclic voltammetry. Two chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were constructed using single culture of A. aceti (A-MFC), and G. roseus (G-MFC) and also using mixed culture (AG-MFC). Each MFC was fed with four different substrates viz., glucose, ethanol, acetate and bad wine. AG-MFC produced higher power density with glucose (1.05W/m 3), ethanol (1.97W/m 3), acetate (1.39W/m 3) and bad wine (3.82W/m 3). COD removal (94%) was maximum for acetate fed MFCs. Higher coulombic efficiency was obtained with bad wine (45%) as the fuel. This work provides the scope of using these biofuel cells in wineries for performing the dual duty of bad wine degradation along with current generation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of Ni/Mg mole ratio of Ni-MgO/γ-Al2O3 cordierite monolithic catalysts on dry reforming of model biomass fuel gas(H2/CO/C2H4/CH4/CO2/N2=16.0/12.1/2.5/15.1/22.0/32.3, vol.%) was investigated in a lab-scale stainless steel tubular reactor. The results showed that CH4 and CO2 conversions, H2 and CO yields and H2/CO ratio in the tail gas was 87.2%, 54.4%, 65.2%, 43.0%, and 1.17 respectively at 750°C over the optimized MCNi0.51Mg0.49O (the ratio was 0.51:0.49 with 8.3wt% NiO loading amount) during 60h of time on stream (TOS). And the formation of NiO-MgO solid solution structure would restrain the active Ni0 centers from agglomeration and decrease carbon deposition. Cold test of the vertical-placed tubular reformers (packed by monolith of 7mm cell spacing) indicated that the pressure drop was as low as 850Pa at 1.57m/s of gas velocity with 330g/m3 fly ash added. The reforming of real biomass fuel gas (H2/CO/C2H4/CH4/CO2/N2=10.2/16.8/0.5/6.4/15.2/51.0, vol.%, from air gasification of 200-250kg/h pine sawdust in the pilot plant) in the multi-tube reformer packed with MCP (larger in size than MCNi0.51Mg0.49O) exhibits the pressure drop of less than 700Pa, CH4 and CO2 conversions of about 84% and 38.5% and the decrease of tar content from 4.8-5.3g/m3 to 0.12-0.14g/m3 during 60h TOS at 670°C. The characterization of the spent catalysts by TG, XRD and ICP-AES proved the anti-sintering and anti-carbon deposition properties of NiO-MgO solid solution monolithic catalyst. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study of the production of glycerol ethyl acetal, through the acetalization of glycerol with acetaldehyde in a simulated moving bed reactor requires the selection of a suitable solvent/desorbent for the process. The methodology described in this paper, based on reaction, adsorption and environmental variables, lead to the identification of dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent that best fitted the specifications of such reactive-adsorptive processes. Furthermore, a detailed study of the acetalization of glycerol in the presence of this solvent and using Amberlyst-15 as catalyst, allowed the determination of its reaction activation energy, 77.7kJmol-1. The reaction rate was described by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson model, and was obtained from batch experiments with a complete model considering diffusion inside the catalyst particles. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Boron is a potential choice as a fuel additive, especially for biofuels, because it has a high volumetric heating value among different practical metal additives. Although theoretically it can yield a great amount of energy upon complete combustion, its combustion is retarded by the initial presence of boron oxide which coats the particle surface. The present study deals with an experimental investigation of the ignition and combustion behaviors of boron and ball-milled samples of boron and rare earth oxide catalysts in an ethanol spray flame. Commercial boron nanoparticles and both commercial and synthesized ceria-based catalysts have been used for this study. A simple ball-milling technique was employed to prepare the catalyst coated samples, and this technique can be easily adapted for production of large batches. It was observed that the addition of nano-sized catalyst particles to boron nanoparticles improved the ignition characteristics (significant reduction in ignition delay) of the boron. Three different percentages of catalyst loading were tested to determine the effects of catalyst loading on both the ignition behavior of the boron and the primary combustion reaction. Analysis of BO2* emissions and of the exiting particles confirmed complete boron combustion in the combustor geometry. The nanoparticles containing ceria demonstrated improvements in both boron ignition (reduced ignition delay time) and (less significantly) the ethanol combustion. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Biorefineries are expected to take over the production of chemicals and biofuels in the coming decades, in parallel to the depletion of fossil resources. Considerable research efforts have been made to develop efficient (bio)catalytic systems for the production of bio-based solvents and novel products with improved ecological footprints and "smart" properties. Among other challenges, water consumption will be an important aspect to assess in the full sustainability of biorefineries, which are envisaged for large-scale operations. The already existing fresh water shortage in many regions of our overpopulated planet has brought more pressure and uncertainties to these aims. Thus, over the past years, a number of enzymatic, fermentative, and chemocatalytic applications using seawater as a reaction medium for large-scale biorefineries have been reported by several research groups, which emphasize the use of nonpotable water resources for coastal regions and for locally available biomass (e.g., algae). This article contextualizes in detail these seawater-based applications for biorefineries. Overall, the use of such nonpotable water resources is promising, provided that applied catalytic systems can lead to straightforwardly treatable waste(sea)water effluents. Opportunities at the interface between biology, chemistry, and chemical engineering are foreseeable for (holistic) innovation and further research. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - A recent metagenomic analysis sequenced a switchgrass-adapted compost community to identify enzymes from microorganisms that were specifically adapted to switchgrass under thermophilic conditions. These enzymes are being examined as part of the pretreatment process for the production of "second- generation" biofuels. Among the enzymes discovered was JMB19063, a novel three-domain β-glucosidase that belongs to the GH3 (glycoside hydrolase 3) family. Here, we report the structure of JMB19063 in complex with glucose and the catalytic variant D261N crystallized in the presence of cellopentaose. JMB19063 is first structure of a dimeric member of the GH3 family, and we demonstrate that dimerization is required for catalytic activity. Arg-587 and Phe-598 from the C-terminal domain of the opposing monomer are shown to interact with bound ligands in the D261N structure. Enzyme assays confirmed that these residues are absolutely essential for full catalytic activity.

AB  - Hydroxypropanone was selected as the model compound of bio-oil ketones to study its cracking behavior for bio-gasoline production. The cracking of pure hydroxypropanone generated inferior oil phase which had a content of high oxygenated compounds. The quality of oil phase was obviously improved when ethanol was adopted as the co-reactant. Furthermore, increasing cracking pressure also benefited the yield and quality of the oil phase. The conversion yield of the reactants reached 100% and the selectivity of the oil phase reached 31.9 wt.% in the co-cracking process under 400 C and 2 MPa. The oil phase also had an outstanding quality with a hydrocarbon content of 100% and mainly contained hydrocarbons with carbon numbers ranging from 7 to 10, which are also important components in commercial gasoline. Based on the results, a co-cracking mechanism was proposed to illustrate the role of ethanol in promoting hydroxypropanone cracking. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Production of biodiesel from non-edible oils is receiving increasing attention. Tung oil, called China wood oil is one kind of promising non-edible biodiesel oil in China. To our knowledge, tung oil has not been used to produce biodiesel by enzymatic method. The enzymatic production of biodiesel has been investigated extensively by using Rhizopus oryzae lipase as catalyst. However, the high cost of R. oryzae lipase remains a barrier for its industrial applications. Through different heterologous expression strategies and fermentation techniques, the highest expression level of the lipase from R. oryzae reached 1334 U/mL in Pichia pastoris, which is still not optimistic for industry applications. Results: The prosequence of lipases from Rhizopus sp. is very important for the folding and secretion of an active lipase. A chimeric lipase from R. oryzae was constructed by replacing the prosequence with that from the R. chinensis lipase and expressed in P. pastoris. The maximum activity of the chimera reached 4050 U/mL, which was 11 fold higher than that of the parent. The properties of the chimera were studied. The immobilized chimera was used successfully for biodiesel production from tung oil, which achieved higher FAME yield compared with the free chimeric lipase, non-chimeric lipase and mature lipase. By response surface methodology, three variables, water content, methanol to tung oil molar ratio and enzyme dosage were proved to be crucial parameters for biosynthesis of FAME and the FAME yield reached 91.9±2.5% at the optimized conditions by adding 5.66 wt.% of the initial water based on oil weight, 3.88 of methanol to tung oil molar ratio and 13.24 wt.% of enzyme concentration based on oil weight at 40°C. Conclusions: This is the first report on improving the expression level of the lipase from R. oryzae by replacing prosequences. The immobilized chimera was used successfully for biodiesel production from tung oil. Using tung oil as non-edible raw material and a chimeric lipase from R. oryzae as an economic catalyst make this study a promising one for biodiesel applications. © 2013 Yu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the utilization of waste coffee ground for biodiesel production was investigated. Waste coffee ground sample was collected from TOMOCA PLC, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The oven dried sample was then soxhlet extracted using n-hexane to yield 19.73 %w/w oil. The biodiesel was obtained by a two-step process, i.e. acid catalyzed esterification followed by base catalyzed transesterification using catalysts sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide respectively. The conversion of waste coffee ground oil in to biodiesel, was about 73.4%w/w. Various parameters that are essential for biodiesel quality were evaluated using the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM D 6751- 09) and all comply with the specification except acid value. The fatty acid composition of the biodiesel was analyzed by Gas chromatography and the major fatty acids were found to be linoleic acid (39.8%), palmitic acid (37.6%), oleic (12.7%), and stearic acid (7.6%). In addition, preliminary investigation on the solid waste remaining after oil extraction was conducted for possible use as a feedstock for the production of bioethanol. Hydrolysis of the spent of waste coffee ground was carried out using dilute sulphuric acid followed by fermentation using Saccharomyces cereviciae, and resulted in bioethanol yield of 8.3 %v/v. Furthermore, the solid waste remaining after bioethanol production was evaluated for compost (21.9:1 C/N) and solid fuel (20.8 MJ/Kg) applications. The results of this research work give insights on the production of biofuel from waste ground coffee. In addition, the preliminary analysis on the solid waste after the extraction of the oil suggests that it can be used as fuel hence alleviating major disposal problems. © 2018, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - In the present paper consideration is being given to the use of bioethanol in the schemes of thermochemical recovery of heat contained in exit flue gases. Schematic diagrams illustrate the realization of thermochemical heat recovery by implementing ethanol steam conversion and conversion of ethanol by means of products of its complete combustion. The feasibility of attaining a high degree of recovery of heat contained in flue gases at the moderate temperature (up to 450 C) of combustion components is demonstrated in the example of the energy balance of the system for thermochemical heat recovery. The simplified thermodynamic analysis of the process of ethanol steam conversion was carried out in order to determine possible ranges of variation of process variables (temperature, pressure, composition) of a reaction mixture providing the efficient heat utilization. It was found that at the temperature above 600 K the degree of ethanol conversion is near unity. The equilibrium composition of products of reaction of ethanol steam conversion has been identified for different temperatures at which the process occurs at the ratio H 2O/EtOH = 1 and at the pressure of 0.1 MPa. The obtained results of calculation agree well with the experimental data. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The effect of a "controlled temperature" approach was investigated in the microwave-enhanced simultaneous extraction and transesterification of dry algae. Experimental runs were designed using a response surface methodology (RSM). The process parameters such as dry algae to methanol ratio, reaction time, and catalyst concentrations were optimized to evaluate their effects on the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield under the "controlled temperature" conditions. Thermal energy associated with the microwave transesterification process was calculated at various temperature levels using the optimized process parameters. Algal biomass characterization and algal biodiesel analysis were carried out using various analytical instruments such as FTIR, TEM, GC-MS and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis under both nitrogen and oxygen environments was performed to examine the thermal and oxidative stability of the algal fatty acid methyl esters. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global biodiesel production is continuously increasing and it is proportionally accompanied by a huge amount of crude glycerol (CG) as by-product. Due to its crude nature, CG has very less commercial interest; although its pure counterpart has different industrial applications. Alternatively, CG is a very good carbon source and can be used as a feedstock for fermentative hydrogen production. Further, a move of this kind has dual benefits, namely it offers a sustainable method for disposal of biodiesel manufacturing waste as well as produces biofuels and contributes in greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Two-stage fermentation, comprising dark and photo-fermentation is one of the most promising options available for bio-hydrogen production. In the present study, techno-economic feasibility of such a two-stage process has been evaluated. The analysis has been made based on the recent advances in fermentative hydrogen production using CG as a feedstock. The study has been carried out with special reference to North American biodiesel market; and more specifically, data available for Canadian province, Québec City have been used. Based on our techno-economic analysis, higher production cost was found to be the major bottleneck in commercial production of fermentative hydrogen. However, certain achievable alternative options for reduction of process cost have been identified. Further, the process was found to be capable in reducing GHG emissions. Bioconversion of 1 kg of crude glycerol (70 % w/v) was found to reduce 7.66 kg CO2 eq (equivalent) GHG emission, and the process also offers additional environmental benefits. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This study looks at the possibility of wet air oxidation (WAO) based pretreatment of complex effluent to selectively enhance the biodegradability (without substantial COD destruction) and facilitate biogas generation potential. A lab-scale wet air oxidation reactor with biomethanated distillery wastewater (B-DWW) as a model complex effluent (COD 40,000mgL-1) was used to demonstrate the proof-of-concept. The studies were conducted using a designed set of experiments and reaction temperature (150-200°C), air pressure (6-12bar) and reaction time (15-120min) were the main process variables of concern for WAO process optimization. WAO pretreatment of B-DWW enhanced the biodegradability of the complex wastewater by the virtue of enhancing its biodegradability index (BI) from 0.2 to 0.88, which indicate favorable Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) for biogas generation. The kinetics of COD destruction and BI enhancement has also been reported. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The raw material supply bottleneck is one of the obstacles currently facing the development of China's biodiesel industry. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the demands, possibilities, difficulties and suggestions surrounding the participation of restaurant enterprises in the biodiesel supply chain. Based on an analysis of the overall situation of China's biodiesel supply chain, the authors designed a structured questionnaire to survey 246 restaurant enterprises in Nanjing. The questionnaire mainly included basic aspects of restaurant enterprises, disposal of waste cooking oil (WCO), awareness and attitudes towards WCO recycling, understanding and opinion of biodiesel, and willingness and requirements for participating in the production of biodiesel. Factor analysis was then conducted on the motives of industrial restaurant enterprises for disposing of or recycling their WCO, and cluster analysis was used to classify the 246 restaurant enterprises into three clusters. Finally, the authors suggested ways to promote the development of Nanjing's biodiesel supply chain. The significant findings obtained in this paper will help to encourage restaurant enterprises to become suppliers of biodiesel production and promote the healthy development of the biodiesel industry in China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is generally acknowledged that the continuous production of rich hydrogen is made by using a sequential biomass pyrolysis reactor which combines the pyrolysis of rice husks with the secondary decomposition of gaseous intermediate. Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The result shows that Fe/γ-Al2O3 could fully convert biomass pyrolysis volatile into gaseous products, such as H2,CH4,CO etc. And the reaction activities of the catalysts are greatly influenced by the calcination temperature of catalysts, the secondary catalytic pyrolysis temperature and Fe/Al mass ratio. The catalyst is characterized by temperature programmed revification (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scan electron microscope (SEM) and thermogravimetry(TG). The result indicates that the activity centre of Fe/γ-Al2O3 is Fe2+ and Fe0. In brief, the main processes are that large molecule organics in bio-oil decompose into gaseous products, meanwhile the gases are catalytic reformation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The alkaline-catalyzed ethanolysis of rapeseed oil was studied. In the case of homogeneous catalysis (KOH), the effects of various reaction conditions on the quantity and quality of biodiesel (yield, purity, acid number, carbon residue, free glycerol, potassium content) and the glycerol phase (weight, soaps and ethyl esters content) were studied. The studied reaction conditions were: the reaction temperature and time, the catalyst concentration, the molar ratio of ethanol to oil, the revolutions of stirring, the temperature and time of deethanolisation and the initial temperature of the separation. Data was evaluated by linear regression on the statistical basis of multivariable systems. The final linear models were verified by independent experiments and they are able to predict the biodiesel quantity and quality in the range of the reaction conditions. Finally, the factor analysis of the ester phase variables was carried out. Moreover, ethanolysis was catalyzed by a heterogeneous catalytic system; attention was focused not only on catalyst activity but also on catalyst stability, which was determined by potassium leaching. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Prairies used for bioenergy production have potential to generate marketable products while enhancing environmental quality, but little is known about how prairie species composition and nutrient management affect the suitability of prairie biomass for bioenergy production. We determined how functional-group identity and nitrogen fertilization affected feedstock characteristics and estimated bioenergy yields of prairie plants, and compared those prairie characteristics to that of corn stover. We tested our objectives with a field experiment that was set up as a 5 × 2 incomplete factorial design with C3 grasses, C4 grasses, legumes, and multi-functional-group mixtures grown with and without nitrogen fertilizer; a fertilized corn treatment was also included. We determined cell wall, hemicellulose, cellulose, and ash concentrations; ethanol conversion ratios; gross caloric ratios; aboveground biomass production; ethanol yields; and energy yields for all treatments. Prairie functional-group identity affected the biomass feedstock characteristics, whereas nitrogen fertilization did not. Functional group and fertilization had a strong effect on aboveground biomass production, which was the major predictor of ethanol and energy yields. C4 grasses, especially when fertilized, had among the most favorable bioenergy characteristics with high estimated ethanol conversion ratios and nongrain biomass production, relatively high gross caloric ratios, and low ash concentrations. The bioenergy characteristics of corn stover, from an annual C4 grass, were similar to those of the biomass of perennial C4 grasses. Both functional-group composition and nitrogen fertility management were found to be important in optimizing bioenergy production from prairies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The use of biomass as an alternative energy resource requires its prior processing. Many options are possible. The present paper focuses on thermochemical routes and more specifically on fast pyrolysis carried out for the preparation of so called bio-oils. The optimization and scaling up of fast pyrolysis processes for improving bio oils yields and properties come up against several difficulties. The aim of the paper is to show that some of them are related to the lack of several basic scientific knowledges, more specifically at the level of the high temperature fast pyrolysis reactor. The analysis of these challenges (biomass sample thermal decomposition, biomass-reactor interactions, secondary reactions) suggests the development of several research topics. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Hydroprocessing catalysts, sulfided Ni-W (on mesoporous silica-alumina) and Ni-Mo (on mesoporous γ-alumina), under typical hydroprocessing conditions, can very effectively produce liquid fuel from mixtures of waste vegetable oil and refinery gas oil. The acidity of the catalyst controls the relative amount of diesel range (straight chain) alkanes and cracked lighter products. The yield of diesel range (250-380°C) product varied between 60 and 90%, while kerosene (jet) range product varied between 10 and 35% depending upon the reaction conditions and type of catalyst used. The hydrodeoxygenation pathway for oxygen removal from triglyceride seems to be favored over the Ni-Mo catalyst, while decarboxylation+decarbonylation pathway is favored over the Ni-W catalyst and the respective pathways becomes more dominant with increasing vegetable-oil content in the feed. Vegetable oil conversion does not adversely influence hydrodesulfurization of gas oil indicating viability of co-processing. The activation energy for overall S-removal is much lower than that for overall O-removal. Density and acidity (TAN) of the products meet the required specification and cetane number is better than that for pure diesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biology sustains itself by converting solar energy in a series of reactions between light harvesting components, electron transfer pathways, and redox-active centers. As an artificial system mimicking such solar energy conversion, porous chalcogenide aerogels (chalcogels) encompass the above components into a common architecture. We present here the ability to tune the redox properties of chalcogel frameworks containing biological Fe 4S4 clusters. We have investigated the effects of [Sn nS2n+2]4- linking blocks ([SnS 4]4-, [Sn2S6]4-, [Sn 4S10]4-) on the electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties of the chalcogels, as well as on the photophysical properties of incorporated light-harvesting dyes, tris(2,2′-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+). The various thiostannate linking blocks do not alter significantly the chalcogel surface area (90-310 m2/g) or the local environment around the Fe4S4 clusters as indicated by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. However, the varying charge density of the linking blocks greatly affects the reduction potential of the Fe4S4 cluster and the electronic interaction between the clusters. We find that when the Fe4S 4 clusters are bridged with the adamantane [Sn4S 10]4- linking blocks, the electrochemical reduction of CS2 and the photochemical production of hydrogen are enhanced. The ability to tune the redox properties of biomimetic chalcogels presents a novel avenue to control the function of multifunctional chalcogels for a wide range of electrochemical or photochemical processes relevant to solar fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Conversion of palm oil over stabilized alumina catalyst are performed in liquid phase at 623K. Additionally, ethyl acetate (EA) and acetic acid (AA) conversion as model reactions are investigated over the same catalyst at atmospheric pressure with 5800h-1 and 11,600h-1 GHSV. Both EA and palm oil decomposition over the alumina catalyst are also studied in an in situ Infrared (IR) spectroscopy cell. Similarly, the reaction of acetic, palmitic and oleic acids on alumina is also studied in order to elucidate the reaction mechanisms at molecular level. The main products from EA and palm oil arise from ester group cracking and ketonization and decarboxylation of both the ester and the acid. IR experiments show that the main activation steps of esters on alumina consist in their adsorption on the Lewis sites of alumina through the carbonyl oxygen lone pair. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of Japanese cedar charcoal as a support material for microbial attachment could enhance methane production during anaerobic digestion of crude glycerol and wastewater sludge. Methane yield from a charcoal-containing reactor was approximately 1.6 times higher than that from a reactor without charcoal, and methane production was stable over 50days when the loading rate was 2.17g chemical oxygen demand (COD) L-1d-1. Examination of microbial communities on the charcoal revealed the presence of Uncultured Desulfovibrio sp. clone V29 and Pelobacter seleniigenes, known as 1,3-propandiol degraders. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens were also detected in the archaeal community on the charcoal. Methanosaeta, Methanoregula, and Methanocellus were present in the charcoal-containing reactor. The concentration of propionate in the charcoal-containing reactor was also lower than that in the control reactor. These results suggest that propionate degradation was enhanced by the consumption of hydrogen by hydrogenotrophic methanogens on the charcoal. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Acidic ionic liquids (AILs) as a novel catalyst in biomass liquefaction can accord with the demand of green chemistry and enhance the development of biomass thermal chemical conversion. A series of AILs containing HSO4- were synthesized by the imidazolium cation functionalization and applied to the Chinese fir sawdust liquefaction in 1-octanol in this paper. The experimental results showed that the liquefaction rate was gradually improved with the AILs acidity increasing, and reached 71.5% when 1-(4-sulfobutyl)-3-methylmidazolium hydrosulfate was used as catalyst with the 6:1 mass ratio of 1-octanol to sawdust at 423. K after 60. min. Lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose were orderly desquamated, and then depolymerized and liquefied with the catalyst acidity increasing in the sawdust liquefaction process. The light oil was mainly composed of the octyl ether and the octyl ester compounds, suggesting that the solvent may play an important role in producing the high octane rating biofuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An alternative fuel production was investigated through catalytic hydroliquefaction of three different carbonaceous sources: solid municipal wastes (MW), primary sludges (PS), and microalgae (MA). The reaction was carried out under hydrogen pressure, at different temperatures (330, 380 and 450. °C), with a Raney nickel catalyst and two different hydrogen donor solvents: a "fossil solvent" (tetralin) and a "green solvent" (2-methyl-hydro-furan).The feeds analyses (TDA-TGA, ICP-AES, lipids quantification) showed that MW and PS had similar characteristics and physico-chemical properties, but different from those of MA. The hydroliquefaction of these feeds allowed to obtain high oil yields, with a significant energetic value, similar to that of a bio-petroleum. 2-methyl-hydro-furan was more efficient than tetralin for the treatment of the strongly bio-degraded biomasses MW and PS, while better results were obtained with tetralin in the case of MA. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermal cracking experiments were carried out to promote the conversion of waste cooking oil into a biofuel which is similar to gasoline (light-naphtha). Temperature and residence time were varied in order to analyze their effects on the light-naphtha characteristics in terms of acid value and chemical composition, (paraffins, i-paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, oxygenates and aromatics). The PIONA analysis was used to determine the composition of chemical groups in the light naphtha obtained and its benzene concentration. The results show that at higher temperatures and with longer residence times the benzene concentration increases, but the values obtained are close to the limits of the regulatory specifications of European and Brazilian laws. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work demonstrates the efficient hydrogenolysis of cellulose to C4-C7 alcohols and gas products (reaction 1) by coupling it with the reforming reaction of methanol (reaction 2) over bi-functional CuO-based catalysts. In this process, the CuO-based catalysts catalyze both the reactions 1 and 2, and the in situ regenerated H2 in the reaction 2 is used for the reaction 1. A series of CuO-MO/Al2O3 (M=Ce, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) catalysts were prepared by the co-precipitation method. Among these catalysts, CuO-ZnO/Al2O3 exhibited the highest activity to generate a high cellulose conversion of 88% and a high C4-C7 alcohols content above 95% in the liquid products. The CuO-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was stable under the reaction conditions and reusable after 4 runs. This work provides a cost-effective route to convert abundant renewable cellulose to liquid fuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Animal fat residues (AFR) from waste water were used as feedstock to produce biodiesel by a two-step acid-catalyzed process. Treatment of the AFRs with 5.4% (w/w) of 17M H2SO4 at a methanol/AFR ratio of 13:1 (50%w/w) at 60°C converted more than 95% of the triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with an acid value (AV) of 1.3mgKOH/gbiodiesel. Response surface methodology indicated that a lower AV cannot be reached using a one-step acid catalyzed process. Thus a two-step acid catalyzed process was employed using 3.6% catalyst and 30% methanol for 5h for the first step and 1.8% catalyst and 10% methanol for 1h in the second step, resulting in a yield higher than 98% and an AV of 0.3mgKOH/gbiodiesel. The product thus conforms to the European norm EN14214 concerning biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A continuous-flow integration process was developed for biodiesel production using rapeseed oil as feedstock, based on the countercurrent contact reaction between gas and liquid, separation of glycerol on-line and cyclic utilization of methanol. Orthogonal experimental design and response surface methodology were adopted to optimize technological parameters. A second-order polynomial model for the biodiesel yield was established and validated experimentally. The high determination coefficient (R2=98.98%) and the low probability value (Pr&lt;0.0001) proved that the model matched the experimental data, and had a high predictive ability. The optimal technological parameters were: 81.5°C reaction temperature, 51.7cm fill height of catalyst KF/CaO and 105.98kPa system pressure. Under these conditions, the average yield of triplicate experiments was 93.7%, indicating the continuous-flow process has good potential in the manufacture of biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOx) is an enzymatic workhorse used in the food and wine industries to combat microbial contamination, to produce wines with lowered alcohol content, as the recognition element in amperometric glucose sensors, and as an anodic catalyst in biofuel cells. It is naturally produced by several species of fungi, and genetic variants are known to differ considerably in both stability and activity. Two of the more widely studied glucose oxidases come from the species Aspergillus niger (A. niger) and Penicillium amagasakiense (P. amag.), which have both had their respective genes isolated and sequenced. GOx from A. niger is known to be more stable than GOx from P. amag., while GOx from P. amag. has a six-fold superior substrate affinity (KM) and nearly four-fold greater catalytic rate (kcat). Here we sought to combine genetic elements from these two varieties to produce an enzyme displaying both superior catalytic capacity and stability. A comparison of the genes from the two organisms revealed 17 residues that differ between their active sites and cofactor binding regions. Fifteen of these residues in a parental A. niger GOx were altered to either mirror the corresponding residues in P. amag. GOx, or mutated into all possible amino acids via saturation mutagenesis. Ultimately, four mutants were identified with significantly improved catalytic activity. A single point mutation from threonine to serine at amino acid 132 (mutant T132S, numbering includes leader peptide) led to a three-fold improvement in kcat at the expense of a 3% loss of substrate affinity (increase in apparent KM for glucose) resulting in a specify constant (kcat/KM) of 23.8 (mM-1 · s-1) compared to 8.39 for the parental (A. niger) GOx and 170 for the P. amag. GOx. Three other mutant enzymes were also identified that had improvements in overall catalysis: V42Y, and the double mutants T132S/T56V and T132S/V42Y, with specificity constants of 31.5, 32.2, and 31.8 mM-1 · s-1, respectively. The thermal stability of these mutants was also measured and showed moderate improvement over the parental strain. © 2012 Holland et al.

AB  - Most biomass pretreatment processes for monosaccharide production are run at low-solid concentration (&lt;10wt%) and use significant amounts of chemical catalysts. Biphasic CO 2-H 2O mixtures could provide a more sustainable pretreatment medium while using high-solid contents. Using a stirred reactor for high solids (40wt%, biomass water mixture) biphasic CO 2-H 2O pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass allowed us to explore the effects of particle size and mixing on mixed hardwood and switchgrass pretreatment. Subsequently, a two-temperature stage pretreatment was introduced. After optimization, a short high-temperature stage at 210°C (16min for hardwood and 1min for switchgrass) was followed by a long low-temperature stage at 160°C for 60min. Glucan to glucose conversion yields of 83% for hardwood and 80% for switchgrass were obtained. Total molar sugar yields of 65% and 55% were obtained for wood and switchgrass, respectively, which consisted of a 10% points improvement over those obtained during our previous study despite a 10-fold increase in particle size. These yields are similar to those obtained with other major pretreatment technologies for wood and within 10% of major technologies for switchgrass despite the absence of chemical catalysts, the use of large particles. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is capable of direct electron transfer (DET) on various carbon and thiol-modified gold electrodes. As a result, these systems have been utilized as biocatalyst in biosensors and biofuel cell anodes. Class I CDHs, from basidiomycetous fungi, are highly specific to cellulose or lactose, and DET is only observed at pH values below 5.5. To extend the applicability of CDH-based electrodes, the catalytic properties and the behavior on electrode surfaces of ascomycetous class II CDHs from Chaetomium attrobrunneum, Corynascus thermophilus, Dichomera saubinetii, Hypoxylon haematostroma, Neurospora crassa, and Stachybotrys bisbyi were investigated. We found that class II CDHs have diverse properties but generally show a lower substrate specificity than class I CDHs by converting also glucose and maltose. Intramolecular electron transfer (IET) and DET at neutral and alkaline pH were observed and elucidated by steady-state kinetics, pre-steady-state kinetics, and electrochemical measurements. The CDHs ability to interact with the electron acceptor cytochrome c and to communicate with electrode surfaces through DET at various pH conditions was used to classify the investigated enzymes. In combination with stopped-flow measurements, a model for the kinetics of the pH-dependent IET is developed. The efficient glucose turnover at neutral/alkaline pH makes some of these new CDHs potential candidates for glucose biosensors and biofuel cell anodes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The production of biodiesel from algae is optimized using bioethanol following four different transesterification paths: alkali, enzymatic, and heterogeneous catalysts and supercritical conditions. The reactors are modeled using response surface methodology based on experimental results from the literature. These reactor models are implemented together with short-cut methods for the other equipment (distillation columns, gravity separators, etc.) in order to recover the ethanol, separate the polar and nonpolar phases, and purify the glycerol and biodiesel produced to formulate the problem as a superstructure of alternatives. The aim is to simultaneously optimize and heat integrate the production of biodiesel using ethanol in terms of the reaction technology and the operating conditions. The optimal conditions in the reactors differ from the ones traditionally used because these results take the separation stages into account. In terms of the optimal process, the alkali catalyzed process is the most profitable, while the enzymatic one is also promising due to the lower consumption of energy and water, although it requires significant enzyme cost. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Pyrolysis-gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used to determine the yield and chemical composition of the pyrolysis products of Schizochytrium limacinum. The pyrolysis was carried out by varying the temperature from 300 °C to 800 °C. It was found that the main decomposition temperature of Schizochytrium limacinum was 428.16 °C, at which up to 66.5% of the mass was lost. A further 18.7% mass loss then occurred in a relatively slow pace until 760.2 °C due to complete decomposition of the ash content of Schizochytrium limacinum. The pyrolysis of Schizochytrium limacinum at 700 °C produced the maximum yield (67.7%) of pyrolysis products compared to 61.2% at 400 °C. While pollutants released at 700 °C (12.3%) was much higher than that of 400 °C (2.1%). Higher temperature will lead to more pollutant (nitrogen compounds and PAHs) release,which is harmful to the environment. Considering the reasonably high yield and minimum release of pollutants, a lower pyrolysis temperature (400 °C) was found to be optimum for producing biofuel from Schizochytrium limacinum. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - Pine liquefaction (PL) and re-liquefaction of its liquefaction residues in sub- and supercritical methanol, water or methanol/water mixed solvents (MWMSs) was investigated. The results show that isometric MWMS has the highest synergic effect on PL. Moreover, the total yield of bio-oil (BO) and conversion from pine and its residue both liquefied in the MWMS were obvious higher than those from PL in methanol (water) and re-liquefaction of its residue in water (methanol), suggesting that the interaction between the two solvents is responsible for synergic effect. This approach facilitates understanding the mechanism for biomass liquefaction in mixed solvents and developing efficient utilization process of biomass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This life cycle assessment evaluates and quantifies the environmental impacts of the production of hydrogen and transportation fuels from the fast pyrolysis and upgrading of corn stover. Input data for this analysis come from Aspen Plus modeling, a GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) model database and a US Life Cycle Inventory Database. SimaPro 7.3 software is employed to estimate the environmental impacts. The results indicate that the net fossil energy input is 0.25 MJ and 0.23 MJ per km traveled for a light-duty vehicle fueled by gasoline and diesel fuel, respectively. Bio-oil production requires the largest fossil energy input. The net global warming potential (GWP) is 0.037 kg CO2eq and 0.015 kg CO2eq per km traveled for a vehicle fueled by gasoline and diesel fuel, respectively. Vehicle operations contribute up to 33% of the total positive GWP, which is the largest greenhouse gas footprint of all the unit processes. The net GWPs in this study are 88% and 94% lower than for petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuel (2005 baseline), respectively. Biomass transportation has the largest impact on ozone depletion among all of the unit processes. Sensitivity analysis shows that fuel economy, transportation fuel yield, bio-oil yield, and electricity consumption are the key factors that influence greenhouse gas emissions. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the catalytic pyrolysis of mandarin residue from the mandarin juice processing industry was carried out using pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and employing microporous zeolite catalysts, HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3=23 and 80) and HBeta (SiO2/Al2O3=25). The effect of acidity of the catalyst was investigated by comparing the activity of two HZSM-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. The effect of catalyst structure was explored by comparing the results obtained using HZSM-5 (23) and HBeta. Most oxygenates produced from non-catalytic pyrolysis were removed by catalytic upgrading, whereas the yields of mono-aromatics, which are important feedstock materials for the chemical industry, increased considerably, improving the quality of the bio-oil produced. HZSM-5 (23), having the highest acidity among the catalysts used in this study, showed superior catalytic activity to those of HZSM-5 (80) and HBeta. Pt/HZSM-5 (23) and Ga/HZSM-5 (23) resulted in an even higher yield of aromatics. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alkylation of phenolics with alcohols is an efficient way to retain carbon from small oxygenates in the liquid products of pyrolysis bio-oil. In this contribution, we have investigated the alkylation of m-cresol with several alkylating agents over H-Beta zeolite. The alkylation activity follows the sequence 2-propanol &gt; propylene &gt; 1-propanol. In all cases, propylene is the actual alkylation agent since the alcohols dehydrate at a faster rate than the rate of alkylation. A two-stage process is proposed to convert fractions of bio-oil rich in small aldehydes and ketones together with phenolics. In the first stage, aldehydes and ketones are selectively hydrogenated to alcohols. In the second stage, the resulting alcohols alkylate the phenolic compounds and get incorporated into the upgraded liquid. To illustrate this concept, two consecutive catalyst beds have been used. The first bed contains a metal catalyst for the selective hydrogenation. Among several catalysts investigated, Cu/SiO2 and Pt-Fe/SiO2 were found to exhibit good selectivity to hydrogenate the aldehyde and ketone, respectively, while preserving the aromatic ring of the phenolic compound. The second bed contains an H-Beta zeolite for the alkylation stage. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Maximizing methane production while maintaining an appreciable level of process stability is a crucial challenge in the anaerobic digestion industry. In this study, the role of six parameters: the type of immobilizing supports, loading rate, inoculum levels, C:N ratio, trace nutrients concentrations and mixing rate, on methane production were investigated under thermophilic conditions (55±1°C) with synthetic substrate medium. The immobilizing supports were Silica gel, Sand, Molecular Sieve and Dowex Marathon beads. A Taguchi Design of Experiment (DOE) methodology was employed to determine the effects of different parameters using an L16 orthogonal array. Overall, immobilizing supports influenced methane production substantially (contributing 61.3% of the observed variation in methane yield) followed by loading rate and inoculum which had comparable influence (17.9% and 17.7% respectively). Optimization improved methane production by 153% (from 183 to 463ml CH4l-1d-1). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study deals with the determination of the activation energy for the thermal decomposition of two renewable fuels - crude glycerin and beef tallow. The activation energies were investigated by using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in the temperature range of 25-600 °C in atmosphere of synthetic air. The TG curves of the thermal decomposition process of both samples were divided into several phases and the second, called PH2, was chosen for the kinetic study because it is associated with the combustion ignition. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) showed an endothermic event at the PH2 region for the crude glycerin corresponding to devolatilization, while for beef tallow, this step presented an exothermic event, called LTO (low-temperature oxidation), which is correlated with devolatilization followed by combustion. For the entire PH2, activation energy values for crude glycerin were between 90 kJ mol -1 and 42 kJ mol -1, while for the beef tallow they ranged from 50 kJ mol -1 to 113 kJ mol -1. The activation energy values obtained at the pre-ignition stage - conversion between 0 and 0.45 - showed that the crude glycerin with higher values requires an additional energetic support at the start of combustion processes and the beef tallow ignites more easily, presenting lower values. According to the Wolfer's equation, a direct relation between the activation energy and the ignition delay is established and the results of this study provides useful data for the development and design of new combustion chambers and engines when non-traditional fuels are used as feedstock. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The petroleum fuel is nearing the line of extinction. Recent research and technology have provided promising outcomes to rely on biodiesel as the alternative and conventional source of fuel. The use of renewable source - vegetable oil constitutes the main stream of research. In this preliminary study, Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) was used as the substrate for biodiesel production. Lipase enzyme producing fungi Rhizopus oryzae 262 and commercially available pure lipase enzyme were used for comparative study in the production of Fatty Acid Alkyl Esters (FAAE). The whole cell (RO 262) and pure lipase enzyme (PE) were immobilized using calcium alginate beads. Calcium alginate was prepared by optimizing with different molar ratios of calcium chloride and different per cent sodium alginate. Entrapment immobilization was done for whole cell biocatalyst (WCB). PE was also immobilized by entrapment for the transesterification reaction. Seven different solvents - methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, iso-propanol, iso-butanol and iso-amyl alcohol were used as the acyl acceptors. The reaction parameters like temperature (30°C), molar ratio (1:3 - oil:solvent), reaction time (24. h), and amount of enzyme (10% mass ratio to oil) were also optimized for methanol alone. The same parameters were adopted for the other acyl acceptors too. Among the different acyl acceptors - methanol, whose reaction parameters were optimized showed maximum conversion of triglycerides to FAAE-94% with PE and 84% with WCB. On the whole, PE showed better catalytic converting ability with all the acyl acceptor compared to WCB. Gas chromatography analysis (GC) was done to determine the fatty acid composition of WCO (sunflower oil) and FAAE production with different acyl acceptors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel produced by esterification from molar ratio of methanol to free fatty acid (FFA) as 25:1 in presence of triglyceride was carried out with cation-exchange resin as a heterogeneous catalyst in three different scales of fixed bed reactors from minireactor (6.8. mm × 110. mm) to pilot scale reactor (70. mm × 1260. mm) at 338. K. The kinetic study of esterification was undertaken in terms of pseudo-homogeneous mechanism and performed as a first order reaction with elimination of the solid-liquid internal and external mass transfer resistances. Moreover, a kinetic model of FFA esterification was developed to illustrate the relationship between the FFA conversion and the catalyst bed height of fixed bed reactor. The model was also suitable for various resins in fixed bed reactor. The theoretical predictions were in agreement with the experimental data with root mean square (RMS) errors <10. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas seeds afford non edible oil seed source for biodiesel, therefore, production of biodiesel from this oil would avoid food versus fuel controversy. However, Jatropha seed oil contains higher amounts of free fatty acids (about 12%). Therefore this requires a two step acid-base catalyzed treatment for the trans-esterification to obtain biodiesel. However, the use of lipase enzymes affords the trans-esterification of seed oil in a single step only. Therefore, presently the research work was performed to study the trans-esterification of Jatropha seed oil by using lipase enzymes obtained from the two microbes i.e., Pseudomonas sp. and Rhizopus sp., respectively. The lipase enzyme obtained from Pseudomonas sp. was found to show more than ten times higher activity in comparison to that of Rhizopus sp. Thus, the use of Psedomonas sp. lipase also showed higher yields of biodiesel in comparison to that of Rhizopus sp. Bioprocessing of J. curcas seed oil by single step process was compared with the two step chemical process to obtain biodiesel. A comparison of the two processes has been drawn. The biodiesel obtained from the Jatropha oil seeds were characterized for physical properties like kinematic viscosity, density, flash point, pour point, acid number and water content. The residual seeds obtained after the recovery of oil were found to be good substrate for the biogasification to obtain biomethane. Bioprocesses for obtaining added value chemical from the byproduct glycerol are being developed currently. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Worldwide, algal biofuel research and development efforts have focused on increasing the competitiveness of algal biofuels by increasing the energy and financial return on investments, reducing water intensity and resource requirements, and increasing algal productivity. In this study, analyses are presented in each of these areas-costs, resource needs, and productivity-for two cases: (1) an Experimental Case, using mostly measured data for a lab-scale system, and (2) a theorized Highly Productive Case that represents an optimized commercial-scale production system, albeit one that relies on full-price water, nutrients, and carbon dioxide. For both cases, the analysis described herein concludes that the energy and financial return on investments are less than 1, the water intensity is greater than that for conventional fuels, and the amounts of required resources at a meaningful scale of production amount to significant fractions of current consumption (e.g., nitrogen). The analysis and presentation of results highlight critical areas for advancement and innovation that must occur for sustainable and profitable algal biofuel production can occur at a scale that yields significant petroleum displacement. To this end, targets for energy consumption, production cost, water consumption, and nutrient consumption are presented that would promote sustainable algal biofuel production. Furthermore, this work demonstrates a procedure and method by which subsequent advances in technology and biotechnology can be framed to track progress. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - Transesterification of soybean oil with methanol was carried out in the presence of CaO-MgO and KF-modified CaO-MgO catalysts at atmospheric pressure. While the methyl ester yield for the CaO-MgO catalyst with a ratio of 8:2 (CaO:MgO) was 63.6%, it was 97.9% for the KF-modified catalyst at a 2% catalyst to the reactants (methanol/oil mixture) weight ratio, a temperature of 65°C, a methanol-soybean oil ratio of 9:1 and a reaction time of 2.5h. The KF/CaO-MgO catalyst still yielded 86.7% after four successive uses. The catalytic performance of the KF/CaO-MgO catalyst was attributed to the formation of active KCaF 3 and K 2MgF 4 centers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrous ethanol is a worldwide used biofuel. According to Brazilian regulations, the concentration of ethanol in hydrous ethanol can be accepted at a maximum concentration of 93.8% and a minimum of 92.6% by mass. The aim of this study is to identify the possible changes in hydrous ethanol fuel using ultrasonic attenuation and propagation velocity. The experiments were performed in the Laboratory of Ultrasound of the Brazilian National Institute of Metrology (Inmetro). The experiments and uncertainties in the methodology were evaluated according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, JCGM 100:2008. The test samples used in this study were mixtures of ethanol and water with ethanol concentrations varying from 89.84% to 93.71% by mass; and a commercial fuel ethanol bought from a local distributor. The correlation coefficient between ethanol concentrations and ultrasonic propagation velocity was 0.99 (in modulus), and the maximum combined uncertainty was 0.60 m s -1. Considering attenuation, the correlation coefficient was 0.97, and the maximum combined uncertainty was 0.085 dB cm-1. However, its signal is not stable resulting an unreliable parameter. Within the tested concentration range, the highest concentration that is statistically different (p &lt; 0.002, α = 5%) from 92.60% is 92.25%, considering propagation velocity as parameter. To validate the methodology, a commercial ethanol fuel was tested using the proposed method as well as the gas chromatography analytical method (gold standard). Result was statistically identical for propagation velocity when compared to the gold standard. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest harvest residues can be a cost-effective feedstock for a biorefinery, but the high lignin content of forest residues is a major barrier for enzymatic sugar production. Sulfite pretreatment to overcome strong recalcitrance of lignocelluloses (SPORL) was applied to a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco var. menziesii) forest residue in a range of sulfite and acid loadings at 165°C for 75min with liquid to wood ratio of 3:1. Sodium bisulfite and sulfuric acid charge as mass fraction of oven dry biomass of 12% and 2.21%, respectively, was optimal in terms of enzymatic cellulose saccharification, sugar yield and formation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural. Enzymatic glucose yield was 345gkg-1, or equivalent to 82.3% of theoretical at a cellulase (CTec2) dosage of 15 filter paper unit (FPU) per gram of glucan. HMF and furfural formation were low at approximately 2.5gL-1 each in the pretreatment hydrolyzate. Delignification was important to achieve good cellulose saccharification efficiency, however, approximately 80-90% hemicellulose removal is also required. Substrate enzymatic digestibility (SED) was found to correlate to a combined parameter Z(CHF) of delignification and hemicellulose dissolution well, suggesting that the combined hydrolysis factor (CHF) - a pretreatment severity measure - can be used to predict saccharification of forest residue for scale-up studies to reduce numbers of experiments. © 2013.

AB  - Spruce wood sawdust (S), as biomass waste, could be utilized as a renewable fuel, but it suffers from its bulky, low energy density, high volatiles content and NOx emission. This study investigated the possibility of conversion S into bio-char pellets (SC-Ps) as renewable and CO2-neutral bio-fuel. Sawdust derived bio-char (SC) was produced through pyrolysis, and subsequently compressed into SC-Ps bonded by lignin (L) and hardened by Ca(OH)2, NaOH, CaCl2, CaO. The combustion characteristics of S and SC, the physical properties of SC-Ps including abrasive resistances (ARs), impact resistance index (IRI) and compress strengthens (CS) were evaluated. Results showed that the high heat value (HHV) of SC increased by 95% and its NOx emission decreased due to the release of N-containing volatiles. Among these hardeners, addition of 5% Ca(OH)2-10% L reduced the disruptive force created by uptake moisture and played an effect of hydration on hardening the bonds. In addition, the catalysis of hydroxide promoted the polymer chain growing into three-dimensional cross-linking that strengthened the bonds. Thus, the mechanical strengths of the SC-Ps bonded by Ca(OH)2/L were sufficient for directly transportation and being charged into the blast furnace. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Conventional petroleum-based jet fuels, including Jet A-1, are not renewable and generate a considerable amount of particulate and gaseous pollutants. Non-edible low cost vegetable oil such as waste vegetable oil (WVO) and Jatropha curcas can be used as feedstock for jet biofuel production with positive influence on the world climate change. In this work, an aviation biofuel was produced through blending of the methyl esters of waste vegetable and jatropha oils with Jet A-1 aviation fuel. A process was designed and fabricated to pretreat the waste vegetable oil obtained from local restaurant by means of dewatering and filtration to remove water and solid contaminants, respectively. Waste oil and J. curcas oil were converted to their methyl esters through a two-step catalytic reaction. Several blends of the produced methyl esters with Jet A-1 were prepared and characterized to determine the most suitable ratio based on the jet fuel specifications. The characterizations confirm that the jet biofuel with 10 and 20% methyl ester contents have comparable properties with the commercial available aviation fuel. Production of jet biofuel from waste vegetable and jatropha oil can be an alternative to reduce the amount of waste oil being disposed, to address the problems of energy and food self-sufficiency and to produce a clean fuel. © 2013 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation of model phenol compounds (phenol and 2-ethylphenol) was carried over unpromoted Mo/Al2O3 and promoted CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts. Hydrodeoxygenation proceeds by two pathways: - hydrogenation of the aromatic ring followed by Csp3-O bond cleavage (HYD pathway, (hydrogenation of the aromatic ring followed by Csp3-O bond cleavage)); - direct cleavage of the Csp2-O bond (DDO pathway). Both routes were favored by the presence of Co on the catalyst, while the presence of the alkyl substituent on the phenolic ring favors the DDO route but inhibits the HYD pathway. IR (InfraRed) spectroscopy shows that while phenol mostly dissociates on these catalysts, a significant fraction of 2-ethylphenol remains non dissociated. The adsorption energies of both reactants and possible reaction intermediates on promoted and non-promoted sulfide phases as computed by DFT (Density-Functional Theory) confirm these findings and allow rationalizing the catalytic activity trends observed experimentally. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - A large abundance of environmentally harmful biomass waste is generated by water blooms. In order to provide an applicable solution for the relief of the environmental pressure, natural algae of Taihu Lake water blooms (CTL), mainly cyanobacteria, were catalytically pyrolyzed over silica-supported nickel phosphide to produce bio-oil. The properties of the bio-oil, such as chemical composition, elemental composition, and higher heating value (HHV), were examined. The composition of the gas product was also detected. The results suggest that catalytic pyrolysis could effectively convert the algae to a high quality bio-oil, in which the oxygen content was considerably reduced from 41.7 wt% in the algae to 8.0 wt% in the bio-oil. Long-chained alkanes became the primary component (59.4%). The HHV of the bio-oil obtained from catalytic pyrolysis was 37.2 MJ kg-1. The results indicate that it is possible to achieve high-grade renewable transportation fuels via catalytic pyrolysis of environmentally harmful CTL, and nickel phosphide is an applicable and effective catalyst. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Glycerol is at present abundantly co-produced in the biodiesel fabrication and can be used as fuel in Direct Glycerol Fuel Cells (DGFC) for cogeneration of electricity, value-added chemicals and heat. With this motivation, in the present work, we investigated at a fundamental level the oxidation of glycerol over glassy carbon (GC) supported Au nanoparticles in alkaline medium using cyclic voltammetry. By controlling the Au deposition time, we varied the GC supported Au coverage from 0.4% to 30% maintaining a regular particle size distribution with a mean particle size of about 200 nm. An influence of the carbon support on the activity of the GC-supported Au nanoparticles was evidenced. Results from studies on the oxidation of glycerol and ethylene glycol on Au and Pt nanoparticles supported on a glassy carbon, highly ordered pyrolytic graphite and dimensionally stable anode under different pH conditions indicate that the carbon support participates actively in the oxidation of glycerol and other alcohols. We propose that active oxygenated species are gradually formed on the glassy carbon by potential cycling (up to the saturation of the carbon area) and these oxygenated species are additional oxygen suppliers for the oxidation of glycerol residues adsorbed on the Au particles, following a mechanism consisting of the synergism of two active elements: gold and carbon. © 2013 the Owner Societies.

AB  - Macroalgae commonly found in the ocean around Hawaii were collected from near shore locations and their potential as biomass feedstock for fermentative ethanol was investigated. A green alga, Ulva reticulata, was selected for further analysis. This species forms large complex structures that grow quickly and has high dry biomass percentage (20%), soluble carbohydrates (18%), and high total carbohydrates along with low quantities of lignin (13%). During acid saccharification, it was determined that 49% of the total mass was observed as sugars in the hydrolysate; however, fermentation was problematic. Enzymatic saccharification using cellulase from Trichoderma reesei was attempted which recovered a measured maximum of 20% glucose based on the initial dry mass. Fermentation successfully converted all the glucose to ethanol. The measured ethanol yield corresponded to approximately 90 L per tonne of dried macroalgae. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Biofuel cells (BFCs), which use enzymes as catalysts to harvest energy from green and sustainable fuels abundantly producible from biological systems, are promising next-generation energy devices. However, the poor stability and high specificity to only one fuel type of these bio-catalysts largely limits the practical use of current BFCs. In this contribution, we demonstrate a unique fuel cell which, equipped with two identical enzyme-free electrodes based on Co3O4 coated 3D graphene, is able to efficiently harvest electricity from various sweet biofuels (glucose, sucrose, or lactose). Taking advantage of the dual catalytic ability of nanostructured Co3O 4 for both glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction as well as the exceptional electrical and structural properties of 3D graphene, our glucose-powered fuel cell, with good long-term stability, offers high open circuit voltage (∼1.1 V) and power density output (2.38 ± 0.17 mW cm-2). © 2013 the Owner Societies.

AB  - Biofuels derived from microalgae are considered a viable alternative energy resource that eliminates the major drawbacks associated with biofuels produced from land crops. Strain selection is a critical factor for the success of microalgal production systems. This study evaluates Picochlorum oklahomensis (PO) as a potential microalga strain for biofuel and bioproduct applications. Nannochloropsis oculata (NO) was included in the study as a well-studied reference strain with biomass properties suitable for commercial applications. Growth pattern including specific growth rates, generation time and maximum biomass concentrations in culture media were determined for both PO and NO. Oil and protein contents and fatty acid composition of both strains were analyzed. PO had a higher biomass concentration in the medium and shorter generation time than NO. Both strains were rich in oil, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids. This study indicates that PO can be a viable strain for bioproduct manufacturing because of its high oil and protein content and biomass productivity. © 2013 AOCS.

AB  - Steam reforming of bio-oils is a viable way to produce syngas, but certain challenges need to be overcome before its commercial application. One of the main issues is the formation of tar and coke. Investigation of the evolution/formation of aromatic structures in steam reforming is an effective way to understand the mechanism of tar/coke formation. In this study, the pyrolysis, steam reforming and catalytic steam reforming of mallee wood bio-oil and its lignin-derived oligomers were conducted in a quartz reactor at various temperatures (500-850°C). The product tars were characterised by ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence spectroscopy. The results indicate that the interactions among the compounds degraded from lignin and cellulose/hemicellulose obviously affect the evolution of aromatic structures during the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy of the catalyst provided information on the interactions of the volatile compounds and the deposit on the catalysts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrocarbon derived from fast pyrolysis of plantation wood is a potential feedstock for the production of transportation fuels. Unfortunately, the cost to produce and upgrade this feedstock is highly uncertain, and its current technological state is not competitive with crude oil. Additional R&D will be needed to achieve the significant cost reductions required for competitiveness. Significant technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve a commercially ready, cost competitive technology. This paper identifies the most promising areas for the needed future research. Identification of a stable upgrading catalyst, definition of the maximum level of oxygen that can be tolerated by the existing refining infrastructure, and improved oxygen removal during the pyrolysis step emerge as the most prospective research areas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An amperometric enzyme biosensor for continuous detection of cellobiose has been implemented as an enzyme assay for cellulases. We show that the initial kinetics for cellobiohydrolase I, Cel7A from Trichoderma reesei, acting on different types of cellulose substrates, semi-crystalline and amorphous, can be monitored directly and in real-time by an enzyme-modified electrode based on cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Pc). PcCDH was cross-linked and immobilized on the surface of a carbon paste electrode which contained a mediator, benzoquinone. An oxidation current of the reduced mediator, hydroquinone, produced by the CDH-catalyzed reaction with cellobiose, was recorded under constant-potential amperometry at +0.5V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The CDH-biosensors showed high sensitivity (87.7μAmM-1cm-2), low detection limit (25nM), and fast response time (t95%~3s) and this provided experimental access to the transient kinetics of cellobiohydrolases acting on insoluble cellulose. The response from the CDH-biosensor during enzymatic hydrolysis was corrected for the specificity of PcCDH for the β-anomer of cello-oligosaccharides and the approach were validated against HPLC. It is suggested that quantitative, real-time data on pure insoluble cellulose substrates will be useful in attempts to probe the molecular mechanism underlying enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Microwave induced reactions for immobilizing platinum and palladium nanoparticles on multiwall carbon nanotubes are presented. The resulting hybrid materials were used as catalysts for direct methanol, ethanol and formic acid oxidation in acidic as well as alkaline media. The electrodes are formed by simply mixing the hybrids with graphite paste, thus using a relatively small quantity of the precious metal. We report Tafel slopes and apparent activation energies at different potentials and temperatures. Ethanol electro-oxidation with the palladium hybrid showed an activation energy of 7.64 kJ mol -1 which is lower than those observed for other systems. This system is economically attractive because Pd is significantly less expensive than Pt and ethanol is fast evolving as a commercial biofuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Algae have contributed greatly to the creation of the Earth's environment and the development of human civilization. Currently, microalgae are considered to be among the most promising sources for biofuel. Most microalgae accumulate triacylglycerols; however, fatty acid methyl esters produced from triacylglycerols by transesterification have critical end-use issues. Hydrocarbons produced by Botryococcus and Aurantiochytrium are the most suitable algal oils for replacing existing transportation fuels and are highly compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure. Over the years, many technologies have been investigated for achieving sustainable biofuel production using oleaginous microalgae; however, existing techniques of algal fuel production are suitable mainly for small-scale procedures or for the recovery or removal of high-value products. This situation strongly influences life cycle assessment studies for algal fuel production, and published life cycle assessments show different and discrepant results - reliable data on inputs and outputs from industrial-scale experiments are needed for solving these problems. The estimated cost of algal fuel production is still high compared with that of fossil crude oils. The integration of water treatment and algal biomass production, in a coupled hybrid production system comprising of phototrophic and heterotrophic algae, has tremendous potential for improving the economy of future algal fuels. © 2012 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Recently, novel biofuel candidates have been proposed by catalysis research. To guide follow-up research activities efficiently, it must be assessed whether large-scale production of such next-generation biofuels is competitive in comparison with established biofuels like ethanol. However, it is very time-consuming to provide complete process designs for all alternatives, especially as important data are missing in the early development phase. Instead, reaction network flux analysis (RNFA) has been introduced recently for rapid screening of production routes to bridge the gap between catalysis research and process design. Using this approach, mass balances are formulated for a network of possible reactions such that multi-objective optimization techniques can be applied to identify the attractive pathways with high performance. Typical performance indicators like total annualized cost or environmental impact are adapted to the requirements of the early design phase and integrated in the flux analysis. In this paper, production performance indicators of ten novel biofuel candidates are compared to those of methanol, ethanol, butanol, and methane as reference fuels using RNFA. While some pathways already show an encouraging performance, the reaction yield of others must be increased significantly, if the target product should qualify as promising fuel candidates. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative study on the use of three after-treatment technologies: i) EGR + DPF, ii) SCR + Urea and iii) 3-way catalyst when implemented in urban buses, to determinate the energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), direct Land Use Change (dLUC), abiotic depletion of fossil energy by means of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).The process of production, conditioning and transporting of the fuels used by the buses (diesel, biodiesel (B100), a blended biodiesel at 20% (B20) and natural gas) were also analyzed (Well-to-Tank analysis) along with the environmental impact due to its combustion in the bus (Tank-to-Wheel analysis). The environmental impact of the manufacturing, maintenance and recycling process of the urban buses and exhaust after-treatment systems has also been evaluated.Main results shows that Life Cycle of SCR + Urea technology reduces environmental impact to a greater extent than its global Life Cycle increases it when gasoil is used resulting in a final balance more efficient than the other options, the same behavior is observed with the use of B20 and B100 but only when 0%dLUC is assumed since if the percentage of dLUC increases the effectiveness of the SCR + Urea technology in the reduction of environmental impact tend to decrease. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Phenylalanine (1), which could be potentially obtained from biofuel waste streams, is a precursor of cinnamic acid (2) that can be converted into two bulk chemicals, styrene (3) and acrylic acid (4), via an atom efficient pathway. With 5 mol% of Hoveyda-Grubbs 2nd generation catalyst, 1 bar of ethylene, and using dichloromethane as solvent, cinnamic acid (2) can be converted to acrylic acid and styrene at 40 °C in 24 h with 13% conversion and 100% selectivity. Similar results are obtained using cinnamic acid esters (methyl, ethyl and n-butyl) as substrates and optimisation leads to higher conversions (up to 38%). For the first time, cross-metathesis of these types of electron deficient substrates was achieved. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells and bioelectrochemical sensors are often limited in performance because of their inability to utilize all of the energy confined in chemical bonds of complex molecules. Multi-enzyme cascade catalysis provides a means to remedy this limitation, but efficiencies of such electrodes can be further enhanced by improving interenzyme substrate mass transport. This consideration is demonstrated to be advantageous in biological systems, as displayed by nearly ubiquitous organization of sequential enzymes in natural metabolic pathways. This sequential organization, termed a metabolon, is examined in this work for a two-enzyme pentose phosphate pathway bioelectrode for the oxidation of glucose. This two-enzyme electrode is compared with a single enzyme, glucose dehydrogenase, and demonstrates increased performance. In addition, increases in efficiency are demonstrated through the creation of a synthetic two-enzyme metabolon versus randomly suspended enzymes immobilized within a hydrogel matrix. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Reactivity and product distributions in the conversion of five different compounds representing typical species in bio-oils were studied over an equilibrium FCC catalyst at 500°C during 60s in a fixed bed reactor. Acetic acid, methyl acetate, furfural, 3-methyl-2-pentanone and 2-hidroxy-3-methylcyclopentenone were dissolved at 5%wt. in water. Thermal conversions were performed under the same conditions with inert SiC in the bed. The test compounds converted very differently, deoxygenation being produced by decarboxylation and dehydration. Furfural and 3-methyl-2-pentanone gave the highest yields of hydrocarbons, with high selectivity to light olefins and, when liquid (case of ketones), to aromatics. Methyl acetate gave the highest yield of oxygenated compounds. Coke yields were important (maximum 12.8%wt., 2-hidroxy-3-methylcyclopentenone). Thermal conversions were similar to the catalytic ones with acetic acid and methyl acetate, and much lower for the other reactants. Compared catalytic experiments, the thermal yields of hydrocarbons were much higher with acetic acid, and the yields of oxygenated higher with methyl acetate ester. Much less hydrocarbons were produced thermally with the other reactants. This information may be useful for predicting contributions if these compounds are to be co-processed in existing FCC units or upgraded over acidic catalysts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sapindus mukorossi is a tree available in northeastern region of India. Fruit of S.mukorossi has some traditional usage and its kernel contains 39% (w/w) oil. Prospect of S.mukorossi oil for biodiesel production is investigated with reference to some relevant properties. The fatty acid profile of oil extracted from S.mukorossi is found comparable with similar seed oils attempted for biodiesel production in this region. Since the acid value of S.mukorossi is found to be 15.6mgKOH/g, so biodiesel is prepared using two stage transesterification. In the first step, alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 with 1wt% of H2SO4, results the maximum reduction in acid value (acid value 1.89mgKOH/g) within 60min. In the second step, 10:1 alcohol to oil molar ratio and 1wt% NaOCH3 gives the optimum yield of biodiesel. Finally, the biodiesel is confirmed by the peaks appeared in 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The properties of the biodiesel are obtained using standard ASTM techniques and found to conform to the existing norms. •Produced biodiesel from high acid value Sapindus mukorossi oil using two step transesterification.•The product formation is confirmed using NMR spectroscopy.•Properties are obtained using standard ASTM techniques and most of these are found to conform to the existing norms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, acorn kernel oil with high free fatty acid content is used as feedstock to produce biodiesel. Two stages are used to produce biodiesel after obtaining the acorn kernel oil. The 3.38% free fatty acid content is decreased to 0.14% in the first stage, whereas the acid ester biodiesel is produced using alkaline transesterification reaction in the second stage. The biodiesel production process parameters are the alcohol:oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time. Taguchi experimental design is used for acorn kernel oil methyl ester production via process parameter optimisation. The optimal process parameters are determined to be a catalyst concentration of 0.7 wt%, an 8:1 alcohol:oil molar ratio, a 50 °C reaction temperature and 40 min of reaction time using a KOH catalyst in experimental studies. According to the Taguchi method, the most efficient process parameter in acorn kernel oil methyl ester production. Finally, the acorn kernel oil methyl ester yield is 90% under the optimal process parameters obtained by the Taguchi method. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The operating characteristics of a single-cylinder four-stroke variable compression ratio engine fueled with esterified tamanu oil were investigated. The suitability of esterified Tamanu oil produced from pinnai oil by transesterification process has been studied in variable compression ratio engine. Experiment has been conducted at various loads like 0 kg, 3 kg, 6 kg, 9 kg, and 12 kg with engine speed of 1500 rpm and at compression ratio varies from 14:1 to 18:1. The impact of compression ratio on fuel consumption, combustion parameters, and exhaust gas emissions is investigated. In order to vary the compression ratio, the clearance volume is changed geometrically by tilting cylinder block arrangement. The performance characteristics like specific fuel consumption, brake power, mean effective pressure, brake thermal efficiencies, and exhaust gas temperature are analyzed for Tamanu oil in the variable compression ratio engine. The emission characteristics like hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide emissions are also measured for Tamanu oil in the same engine. The effect of intake valve closing event-timing modulation on effective compression ratio was also investigated. The motivation behind this analysis was to fix the effective compression ratio for biodiesel. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The kinetics of the enzymatic conversion of coconut oil to biodiesel (fatty acid alkyl esters) have been investigated using ethanol and 1% (w/v) lipase at 50°C. Coconut oil is being evaluated for biofuel production and an enzymatic process was selected to minimize side reactions (such as saponification) which can occur with the alkali-catalysed route if free fatty acid (FFA) concentration is significant. Rate data comparison showed that the NaOH-promoted conversion was about 2 orders of magnitude faster than the lipase-catalysed system but resulted in saponification/partial solidification of the reaction mixture. Analysis also revealed that the ratios of the kinetic constants for ester:glycerol (1:1.12) and that for ester:ethanol (1:3.11) during enzymatic transesterification are in agreement with reaction stoichiometry. Additionally, FFA esterification rates were higher (1.5 to 2.5) than triglyceride transesterification rates under similar conditions. Supplementation with ultrasonics at 43 kHz also permitted nearly 20-fold improvement in conversion rate. The study also demonstrated that with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the growth yield on glycerol of 0.77 g g- 1 is greater than that usually found for growth of yeast on glucose (viz. 0.4-0.45 g g- 1). Thus, opportunities for process enhancement exist through the use of increased enzyme concentrations, ultrasound techniques and growth of yeast on residual by-product glycerol. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, activities of HUSY and Ce/HUSY zeolites were studied in transesterification cycles of soybean oil and ethanol to produce biodiesel. The characterization of the materials was performed by FT-IR, XRD, BET method and pyridine adsorption followed by thermal analyses. TG/DTG results indicated a decrease of acid sites for both samples after each reaction cycle. However, Ce/HUSY zeolite showed a superior stabilization of acidic sites after three catalytic cycles and intermediary activation procedures. Biodiesel production exhibited high conversion levels (>96%) for both zeolites in all transesterification cycles. Surface area and pore volume measurements evidenced that cerium incorporation reduced the number of acid sites by interacting with OH groups in the micropore and external area of the zeolitic surface. This interaction resulted in an acid and structural stability, which provided a better activity (99%) than HUSY (96%). The higher conversion values obtained by zeolites showed a final product with a different distribution when compared with the traditional transesterification process. The identification of free fatty acids, diethyl and glycerol ethers in the final products and the reduction of unsaturated compounds indicated that parallel reactions also occurred in the studied systems. Nonetheless, the biofuel produced showed high ester content and did not present changes in its calorific power. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The simultaneous production of high quality biodiesel and glycerin was realized by a bench-scale process using expanded-bed reactors packed with cation- and anion-exchange resins. The mixed-solution of crude Jatropha oil and methanol at a stoichiometric molar ratio was supplied to the process. The free fatty acid as well as triglyceride was completely converted to biodiesel. All by-products were adsorbed on the resin and the effluent from the process was free from them. The effluent fully met the international biodiesel standard specifications without any downstream purification processes except for removing methanol. The glycerin adsorbed on the resin was completely recovered as a transparent methanol solution during regeneration of the resin. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Density is a very important fuel property because it influences production, transportation, and distribution processes as well as all processes that take place in the internal combustion engine. Elaborating models to describe the density of biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol blends with a high content of biofuel facilitates the production of blends that comply with the standard quality requirements for density and the modeling and simulation of injection and combustion processes. For predicting density of rapeseed oil biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol and used cooking oil biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol blends, 2 x 15 ternary mixtures were prepared, having a maximum amount of biofuel of 30% v/v. The concentration of biodiesel and bioethanol varies between 5% and 25%, in increments of 5%. Their density values were determined in 15 steps in the temperature range of 273.15-343.15 K. Based on experimental density values of components and blends, common linear mixing rules were evaluated, obtaining an average relative deviation under 0.125% and a regression coefficient above 0.996. In order to improve accuracy, four new mixing rules with different complexities were elaborated. The temperature dependent density of components was modeled based on experimental density values and constituents composition by linear and polynomial regression, by free version of Rackett equation and by group contribution methods. The elaborated mixing rules were tested for various combinations of component densities, yielding a very good accuracy, with an average deviation of under 0.053%. Taking into account the complexity and accuracy of the elaborated models, recommendations were made regarding their uses according to their concrete applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chlorella vulgaris ESP-31 containing 22.7% lipid was harvested by coagulation (using chitosan and polyaluminium chloride (PACl) as the coagulants) and centrifugation. The harvested ESP-31 was directly employed as the oil source for biodiesel production via transesterification catalyzed by immobilized Burkholderia lipase and by a synthesized solid catalyst (SrO/SiO2). Both enzymatic and chemical transesterification were significantly inhibited in the presence of PACl, while the immobilized lipase worked well with wet chitosan-coagulated ESP-31, giving a high biodiesel conversion of 97.6% w/w oil, which is at a level comparable to that of biodiesel conversion from centrifugation-harvested microalgae (97.1% w/w oil). The immobilized lipase can be repeatedly used for three cycles without significant loss of its activity. The solid catalyst SrO/SiO2 worked well with water-removed centrifuged ESP-31 with a biodiesel conversion of 80% w/w oil, but the conversion became lower (55.7-61.4% w/w oil) when using water-removed chitosan-coagulated ESP-31 as the oil source. © 2013.

AB  - The current research investigates synthesis of methyl esters by transesterification of waste cooking oil in a heterogeneous system, using barium meliorated construction site waste marble as solid base catalyst. The pretreated catalyst was calcined at 830 °C for 4. h prior to its activity test to obtained solid oxide characterized by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy, BET surface area and pore size measurement. It was found that the as prepared catalyst has large pores which contributed to its high activity in transesterification reaction. The methyl ester yield of 88% was obtained when the methanol/oil molar ratio was 9:1, reaction temperature at 65 °C, reaction time 3. h and catalyst/oil mass ratio of 3.0. wt.%. The catalyst can be reused over three cycles, offer low operating conditions, reduce energy consumption and waste generation in the production of biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pretreatment of OPEFB (oil palm empty fruit bunch) by NMMO (N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide) on its subsequent digestions was investigated. The pretreatments were carried out at 90 and 120°C for 1, 3, and 5h in three different modes of dissolution (by 85% NMMO solution), ballooning (79% NMMO solution), and swelling (73% NMMO solution). The total solid recovery after the pretreatment was 89-94%. The pretreatment process did not have a major impact on the composition of OPEFB, other than a reduction of ash from 5.4% up to 1.3%. The best improvement in biogas production was achieved by a dissolution mode pretreatment of OPEFB, using conditions of 85% NMMO, 3h, and 120°C. It resulted in 0.408Nm3/kg VS methane yield and 0.032Nm3CH4/kg VS/day initial methane production rate, which correspond in improving by 48% and 167% compared to the untreated OPEFB, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Thioesterases remove the fatty acyl moiety from the fatty acyl-acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), releasing them as free fatty acids (FFAs), which can be further used to produce a variety of fatty acid-based biofuels, such as biodiesel, fatty alcohols and alkanes. Thioesterases play a key role in the regulation of the fatty acid synthesis in Escherichia coli. Therefore, exploring more promising thioesterases will contribute to the development of industrial microbial lipids production. Results: We cloned and expressed a cytosolic Acinetobacter baylyi thioesterase ('AcTesA) in E. coli by deleting its leader sequence. Protein sequence alignment, structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Ser10, Gly48, Asn77, Asp158 and His161 residues composed the active centre of 'AcTesA. The engineered strain that overexpressed 'AcTesA achieved a FFAs titer of up to 501.2 mg/L in shake flask, in contrast to only 20.5 mg/L obtained in wild-type E. coli, demonstrating that the expression of 'AcTesA indeed boosted the synthesis of FFAs. The 'AcTesA exhibited a substrate preference towards the C8-C16 acyl groups, with C14:0, C16:1, C12:0 and C8:0 FFAs being the top four components. Optimization of expression level of 'AcTesA made the FFAs production increase to 551.3 mg/L. The FFAs production further increased to 716.1 mg/L by optimization of the culture medium. Fed-batch fermentation was also carried out to evaluate the FFAs production in a scaleable process. Finally, 3.6 g/L FFAs were accumulated within 48 h, and a maximal FFAs yield of 6.1% was achieved in 12-16 h post induction. Conclusions: For the first time, an A. baylyi thioesterase was cloned and solubly expressed in the cytosol of E. coli. This leaderless thioesterase ('AcTesA) was found to be capable of enhancing the FFAs production of E. coli. Without detailed optimization of the strain and fermentation, the finally achieved 3.6 g/L FFAs is encouraging. In addition, 'AcTesA exhibited different substrate specificity from other thioesterases previously reported, and can be used to supply the fatty acid-based biofuels with high quality of FFAs. Altogether, this study provides a promising thioesterase for FFAs production, and is of great importance in enriching the library of useful thioesterases. © 2012 Zheng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The radiation processing technology for industrial and environmental applications has been developed and used worldwide. In Latin America and the Caribbean and particularly in Brazil there are 24 and 16 industrial electron beam accelerators (EBA) respectively with energy from 200keV to 10MeV, operating in private companies and governmental institutions to enhance the physical and chemical properties of materials. However, there are more than 1500 high-current electron beam accelerators in commercial use throughout the world. The major needs and end-use markets for these electron beam (EB) units are R and D, wire and electric cables, heat shrinkable tubes and films, PE foams, tires, components, semiconductors and multilayer packaging films. Nowadays, the emerging opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean are paints, adhesives and coatings cure in order to eliminate VOCs and for less energy use than thermal process; disinfestations of seeds; and films and multilayer packaging irradiation. For low-energy EBA (from 150keV to 300keV). For mid-energy EBA (from 300keV to 5MeV), they are flue gas treatment (SO 2 and NO X removal); composite and nanocomposite materials; biodegradable composites based on biorenewable resources; human tissue sterilization; carbon and silicon carbide fibers irradiation; irradiated grafting ion-exchange membranes for fuel cells application; electrocatalysts nanoparticles production; and natural polymers irradiation and biodegradable blends production. For high-energy EBA (from 5MeV to 10MeV), they are sterilization of medical, pharmaceutical and biological products; gemstone enhancement; treatment of industrial and domestic effluents and sludge; preservation and disinfestations of foods and agricultural products; soil disinfestations; lignocellulosic material irradiation as a pretreatment to produce ethanol biofuel; decontamination of pesticide packing; solid residues remediation; organic compounds removal from wastewater; and treatment of effluent from petroleum production units and liquid irradiation process to treat vessel water ballast. On the other hand, there is a growing need of mobile EB facilities for different applications in South America. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study presents the production of biodiesel from algae oil by transesterification using thermophilic microorganism. The microorganism used in this study was isolated from the soil sample obtained near the furnace. The organism was identified as Bacillus sp., and the lipase obtained was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography leading to 8.6-fold purification and 13% recovery. Molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it was found to be 45 kDa. The effect of pH, temperature, and solvent addition on lipase activity was investigated. The enzyme showed maximum activity at 55°C and at pH 7 and was also found to be highly active in the presence of organic solvents such as hexane and tbutanol. The isolated lipase was successfully used for the production of biodiesel. The transesterification activity of the isolated lipase showed 76% of fatty acid methyl esters yield in 40 h, which indicated that this enzyme can be used as a potential biocatalyst for the biodiesel production. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

AB  - This study investigates the evolution of fuel properties and aging of a series of bioslurry fuels prepared from fast pyrolysis bio-oil and biochar at different biochar loading levels (up to 20 wt %) for a storage period of 29 days. The results demonstrate that, at room temperature, the storage of bioslurry results in a reduction in the acidity [total acid number (TAN)], a reduction in the viscosity, and an increase in the water content of the bio-oil phase. In comparison to the blank bio-oil samples, the presence of biochar leads to more severe changes in the fuel properties of bioslurry. After 29 days of storage, the bioslurry fuels are still acidic. An increase in the biochar loading level further decreases the TAN and viscosity of bio-oil phases and increases the water content of bio-oil phases. The storage of bioslurry also results in undesired redistribution of alkali and alkaline earth metallic species between the biochar and bio-oil phase in bioslurry, via the leaching of these inorganic species from the biochar into the acidic bio-oil by two-step kinetics. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Foreseeing a promising future of utilizing bio-energy, more and more small-scale biomass power plants are recently built. Biomasses with high moisture content such as sludge or Empty Fruit Bunch are often used as fuel in small-scale power plant without proper drying. These highly moist biomasses reduce the efficiency of the boiler but on the other hand drying the biofuel is also an energy intensive process. This paper aims to investigate how drying would affect the overall energy efficiency while proper heat integration in between the drying and power plant is under consideration. A 12.5MW biomass power plant that burns EFB with 60wt% moisture is used as a base case. Two types of dryer, Hot Air Dryer (HAD) and Superheated Steam Dryer (SSD), are proposed for the drying process. These two dryers require heat at different temperature levels to provide a better chance for heat integration. Material and energy balance models of the dryers and boilers are derived in this paper and the steam power plant model is constructed in Aspen Plus. The results of this study show that with proper drying and heat integration, the overall efficiency can be improved by more than 5%, when compared to process without drying. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of CO2 capture in hydrogen production by steam reforming of the bio-oil aqueous fraction was studied. The reforming and cracking activity of the adsorbent (dolomite) and the relationship between these reactions and those corresponding to the catalyst (reforming and water gas shift (WGS)) were considered. The experiments were conducted in a two-step system with the first step at 300 C for pyrolytic lignin retention. The remaining volatiles were reformed in a subsequent fluidized bed reactor on a Ni/La2O3-α-Al2O3 catalyst. A suitable balance was stricken between the reforming and WGS reactions, on the one side, and the cracking and coke formation reactions, on the other side, at 600 C for catalyst/dolomite mass ratios ≥0.17. At this temperature and space-time of 0.45 gcatalyst h (gbio-oil)-1, bio-oil was fully converted and the H2 yield was around 99% throughout the CO2 capture step. Catalyst deactivation was very low because the cracking hydrocarbon products (coke precursors) were reformed. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work the economic feasibility of biodiesel production in Brazil by using the Macauba oil as raw matter is studied. The software SIMB-E, in which a cash flow model applied to biodiesel production is implemented, was used during simulations. Economic indexes related to biodiesel production features, as well as the competitiveness between selling prices of biodiesel and petrodiesel were considered. It was found that all of the 8 simulated scenarios were potentially profitable, but only 2 of them presented competitive biodiesel selling prices, being considered as worthwhile projects. These were seed-oil plants with alkaline transesterification. Results also indicated that the success of biodiesel production still requires additional revenues beyond that derived from biodiesel itself, including income from the feedstock coproducts and glycerol. Macauba showed to be a potential crop to be used in biodiesel production. However, the domestication and improvement on processing of this species are indispensable to ensure its availability of long-term use. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Decreasing oil supplies and increasing energy demand provide incentives to find alternative fuels. First, the valorisation of edible crops for ethanol and biodiesel production led to first generation biofuels. Nowadays, research is focused on lignocellulosic biomass as a source of renewable carbon (second generation biofuels). Whereas the cellulosic ethanol production is in progress, a new way consisting of the transformation of ex-lignocellulose sugars and polyols towards light hydrocarbons by heterogeneous catalysis in aqueous phase has been recently described. This process is performed under mild conditions (T < 300°C and P < 50 bar). It requires on one hand hydrogen formation by catalytic reforming of carbohydrates in aqueous phase and on the other hand, the dehydration/hydrogenation of polyols leading to alkanes by selective C-O bond cleavages. The challenge here is to conceive multifunctional catalytic systems that are stable, active and selective under the reaction conditions. The aim of this article is to present the involved reactions, the catalytic systems described in literature for that kind of transformation and examples of industrial applications. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of biomass can be used to produce a raw bio-oil product, which can be upgraded by catalytic hydroprocessing to hydrocarbon liquid products. In this study, the upgraded products were distilled to recover light naphtha and oils and to produce a distillation residue with useful properties for coker processing and production of a renewable low-sulfur electrode carbon. For this hydroprocessing work, phase separation of the bio-oil was applied as a preparatory step to concentrate the heavier, more phenolic components, thus, generating a more amenable feedstock for residue production. Low residual oxygen content products were produced by continuous-flow catalytic hydroprocessing of the phase separated bio-oil. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The generation of a current through interaction between bacteria and electrodes has been explored by various methods. We demonstrate the attachment of living bacteria through a surface displayed redox enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase II. The unnatural amino acid para-azido-l-phenylalanine was incorporated into a specific site of the displayed enzyme, facilitating electron transfer between the enzyme and an electrode. In order to attach the bacteria carrying the surface displayed enzyme to a surface, a linker containing an alkyne and a thiol moiety on opposite ends was synthesized and attached to the dehydrogenase site specifically through a copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Using this approach we were able to covalently link bacteria to gold-coated surfaces and to gold nanoparticles, while maintaining viability and catalytic activity. We show the performance of a biofuel cell using these modified bacteria at the anode, which resulted in site-specific dependent fuel cell performance for at least a week. This is the first example of site-specific attachment of a true living biohybrid to inorganic material. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Bioproducts and biofuels production from pyrolysis might benefit from recycling CO2 within the process instead of using conventional inert gases such as N2. In this study switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) was pyrolyzed within CO2 and N2 environments at 300, 400, and 500 °C for 2.5 min in a labscale fixed-bed reactor of 25 g/batch capacity. Chars, liquids, and noncondensable gases were monitored and characterized and yields were compared. A significantly lower liquid yield was observed at 300 °C-CO2 in comparison to a 300 °C-N2 environment, which was reflected with the char volatile content being higher under 300 °C-CO2 and within the elemental composition of the solid and liquid products. Carbon dioxide also showed an effect at 500 °C, where liquid and gas yields significantly reduced and increased, respectively. At 400 °C-CO2, CO concentrations were lower and CO2 was higher compared to the levels at 400 °C-N2, while at 500 °C-CO2, CO concentrations were higher, CO2 was lower, and CH4 was lower compared to levels at 500 °C-N2. At 500 °C, a significant ash content reduction with respect to original biomass was observed only in the CO2 environment, suggesting that CO 2 may effect inorganic content and subsequently the feedstock conversions since some feedstock inorganic elements are known to play a catalyst role along these reactions. Additional tests were conducted by following regular 500 °C tests with a char air quench. This resulted in a char specific surface increase of about 20 times; CO2 and N2 initial environments confounded. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This work shows the performance and emissions profile of a diesel engine operating with ethanol injected into the air of the inlet manifold in time with the high-pressure injection of a mixture of diesel and biodiesel. The ethanol injection uses an electronic management system that detects the high-pressure pulse in the diesel injection line as the injection trigger. The air intake temperature reduction caused by the ethanol injection could be evaluated. The tests were made in an engine at 1800. rpm, connected to an electric generator. The high-pressure injection fuel was always a binary blend of diesel and biodiesel, which was supplemented by injected ethanol, producing 5 different fuel compositions. The first of the tested compositions was the binary blend without ethanol, while the others had increasing alcohol content. The fifth composition used 15% of ethanol but had a 0.4% of the additive di-tert-butyl peroxide mixed in the main fuel. The addition of ethanol led to a reduction in diesel fuel consumption, although the overall energy expenditure was increased. The emissions profile showed a consistent reduction in NOx emissions and opacity with the addition of ethanol, breaking up the traditional inverse relationship between NOx and PM emissions, but shown an increase in CO and THC emissions. The energy analysis showed a decrease in engine efficiency with the addition of ethanol. The use of the additive showed a slight increase of engine efficiency and the reduction of the CO and THC emissions. There was a significant reduction in the air intake temperature with the use of ethanol, suggesting that part of the reduction of NOx may be attributed to this temperature reduction. It was proven that the ethanol addition can be an important method to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust gases of diesel engines. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Preparation of biodiesel from vegetable oils, such as rapeseed oil, soybean oil and sunflower oil, catalyzed by an alkaline ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium imidazolide ([Bmim]Im) was investigated in this work. The results demonstrated that [Bmim]Im exhibited high activity and the yield of biodiesel was up to 95% or more when molar ratio of methanol to vegetable oil was 6:1, ionic liquid dosage was 6. wt.%, reaction temperature was 60. °C, and reaction time was 60. min. After [Bmim]Im was used for the sixth time, the yield of biodiesel still remained at about 95%. The effects of the biodiesels on the lubricity of low-sulfur diesel fuel were also investigated using the High Frequency Reciprocating Rig method, and the results showed that sunflower biodiesel and soybean biodiesel had higher lubrication performance than that of rapeseed biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to improve the quality of bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala trunks via catalytic deoxygenation using Pt/Al2O3 (Pt content=1.32% (w/w)). The minimum molar ratio of oxygen/carbon (O/C) at 0.14 was achieved when the amount of catalyst was 10% (w/w, bio-oil) and was applied under 4bar of initial nitrogen pressure at 340°C for 1h. The reaction mechanism of the catalytic deoxygenation, in terms of reforming, water-gas shift and dehydration reactions, was proposed. To consider the effect of different biomass types on the efficiency of catalytic deoxygenation, the bio-oils obtained from the pyrolysis of sawdust, rice straw and green microalgae were likewise evaluated for direct comparison. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main objective of rapeseed oil hydrogenation tests was the production of liquid bio-chemicals to be used as renewable raw material for the production of several chemicals and in chemical synthesis to substitute petroleum derived stuff. As, hydrogenation of vegetable oils is already applied for the production of biofuels, the work done focused in producing aromatic compounds, due to their economic value. The effect of experimental conditions on rapeseed oil hydrogenation was studied, namely, reaction temperature and time with the aim of selecting the most favourable conditions to convert rapeseed oil into liquid valuable bio-chemicals. Rapeseed oil was hydrogenated at a hydrogen initial pressure of 1.10. MPa. Reaction temperature varied in the range from 200 °C to 400 °C, while reaction times between 6 and 180. min were tested. The performance of a commercial cobalt and molybdenum catalyst was also studied. The highest hydrocarbons yields were obtained at the highest temperature and reaction times tested. At a temperature of 400 °C and at the reaction time of 120. min hydrocarbons yield was about 92% in catalyst presence, while in the absence of the catalyst this value decreased to 85%. Hydrocarbons yield was even higher when the reaction time of 180. min was used in the presence of catalyst, as the yield of 97% was observed. At these conditions hydrocarbons formed had a high content of aromatic compounds, around 50%. For this reason, the viscosity values of hydrogenated oils were lower than that established by EN590, which together with hydrogenated liquids composition prevented its use as direct liquid fuel to substitute fossil gas oil for transport sector. However, hydrocarbons analysis showed the presence of several valuable compounds that encourages their use as a raw material for the production of several chemicals and in chemical synthesis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The unstable nature of biocrude oils produced from conventional pyrolysis of biomass is one of the properties that limits its application. In the disposal of poultry litter via pyrolysis technology, the biocrude oil produced as a value-added product can be used for on farm applications. In this study, we investigated the influence of bedding material (wood shavings) on the storage stability of biocrude oils produced from the fast pyrolysis of poultry litter. The biocrude oils produced from manure, wood (pine and oak), and mixtures of manure and wood in proportions (75:25 50:50, and 25:75. w/w%) were stored under ambient conditions in sealed glass vials for a period of 6. months and their stability were monitored by measuring the changes in viscosity over time. The manure oil had the lowest rate of viscosity change and thus was relatively the most stable and the oils from the 50:50. w/w% litter mixtures were the least stable. The rate of viscosity change of the manure biocrude oil was 1.33. cP/day and that of the 50/50 litter mixture was 7.6. cP/day for pine and 4.17. cP/day for oak.The spectrometric analyses of the biocrude oils showed that the presence of highly reactive oxygenated functionalities in the oil were responsible for the instability characteristic of the litter biocrude oils. The poor stability of the biocrude oil from the 50:50. w/w% litter mixtures was attributed to reactions between nitrogenous compounds (amides) from protein degradation and oxygenated compounds from the decomposition of polysaccharides and lignin. The addition of 10% methanol and 10% ethanol to the oil from 50% manure and 50% pine reduced the initial viscosity of the oil and was also beneficial in slowing down the rate of viscosity change during storage. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil from biomass fast pyrolysis can be transformed into hydrogen (H2) or alkanes (C1-C6) by aqueous phase processing (APP). Low temperature hydrogenation of the water-soluble portion of bio-oil is a useful intermediate step of APP. In the present work, the anhydrosugar levoglucosan (LG) was selected as a model compound of the bio-oil aqueous fraction. LG hydrogenation was studied in a slurry reactor using heterogeneous Ru/C catalyst. Kinetic data were obtained experimentally in the range of temperatures, 398 to 433 K, H2 partial pressures, 0.69 to 2.07 MPa, initial LG concentrations, 0.6 to 3.1 mM and catalyst loading, 0.5 to 1.5 kg/m3. Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) kinetics was used for modeling initial rates of LG disappearance. Two kinetic models assuming that surface reaction is rate-controlling reasonably represented the kinetic data. Model 1 assumed competitive adsorption of dissociatively chemisorbed H2 and LG, whereas model 2 was based on competitive adsorption of molecular H2 and LG. However, model II seemed to be not feasible, because of the low activation energy value and the assumption of reaction with molecular H2. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A hybrid adsorbent-catalytic nanostructured material consisting of aminopropyl groups and nickel nanoparticles immobilized in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (AP-Ni-MSN) was employed to selectively capture free fatty acids (FFAs) and convert them into saturated hydrocarbons. The working principle of these sorbent-catalytic particles was initially tested in the hydrogenation of oleic acid. Besides providing selectivity for the capture of FFAs, the adsorbent groups also affected the selectivity of the hydrogenation reaction, shifting the chemistry from hydrocracking-based (Ni) to hydrotreating-based and improving the carbon economy of the process. This approach was ultimately evaluated by the selective sequestration of FFAs from crude microalgal oil and their subsequent conversion into liquid hydrocarbons, demonstrating the suitability of this design for the refinery of renewable feedstocks. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The structural characterization of lignin improves the understanding of the complex lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment which is vital for the economic success of biofuels production. In this study, water-only flowthrough pretreatment is employed to Miscanthus at 160. °C for various reaction times to derive the mode of depolymerization process of Miscanthus lignin. Thus, after aqueous phase depolymerization, lignin-derived entities in the pretreated biomass and hydrolyzates were chemically characterized with the aid of various advanced analytical techniques, such as 1D and 2D NMR, FTIR, Py-GC/MS and GC/MS. Both FTIR and Py-GC/MS analysis of pretreated solid residues revealed progressive reduction in H, G and S lignin during flowthrough pretreatment. There was over 60% reduction of S/G ratio, indicative of lignin monomeric compositional change through water-only flowthrough reaction. In agreement with compositional analysis, the FTIR and NMR (1D and 2D) analysis of pretreated hydrolyzate strongly suggested for selective removal and degradation of S-lignin over H and G-lignin. In addition, low content of monomeric and dimeric lignin derivatives were detected by GC-MS analysis of the liquid hydrolyzate, indicating the possibility for existence of soluble oligomeric lignin-derived entities in the hydrolyzates. Our results suggested that under water-only flowthrough pretreatment conditions with Miscanthus samples, lignin depolymerization reactions were associated with selective hydrolysis of 8-O-4' sub-structures along with cleavage of cinnamic and/or coumarylate ester linkages followed by oxidative cleavage at Cα-Cβ position, in conjunction with the preferential removal of S-lignin during the delignification process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Directive 2009/28/EC established the overall target that 20% of energy consumption should be represented by renewable energy sources by 2020 in each European member state. Furthermore, the Directive sets a mandatory 10% minimum target for biofuels in the transport sector. Biofuels are potentially an important alternative to mineral diesel. We propose a pilot production line of biodiesel from sunflower on local scale in the Province of Siena (Tuscany) to research a possible reduction of fossil fuel consumption in the transport sector. This study might represent an opportunity to reduce petroleum dependence in the transport sector. Environmental Impact Indicators were provided by Material Flow Accounting, Embodied Energy Analysis and Emergy Accounting. Results showed that agricultural phase is the critical step in the production line. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment analysis for the biodiesel production line with mineral diesel production showed environmental advantages of the biofuel production, however requiring a higher land demand. Therefore, biodiesel may not the optimal solution on large scale but might be a good alternative to fossil fuel. This would depend upon the entire production cycle taking place in a limited area. This is necessary in order to fulfill the needs of local farms and small enterprises. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass conversion into benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) can provide basic feedstocks for the petrochemical industry, which also serve as the most important aromatic platform molecules for development of high-end chemicals. Present work explored a new route for transformation of bio-oil tar into BTX through current-enhanced catalytic conversion (CECC), involving the synergistic effect between the zeolite catalyst and current to promote the deoxygenation and cracking reactions. The proposed transformation shows an excellent BTX aromatics selectivity of 92.9. C-mol% with 25.1. wt.% yield at 400 °C over usual HZSM-5 catalyst. The study of the model compounds revealed that the groups such as methoxy, hydroxyl and methyl in aromatics can be effectively removed in the CECC process. Present transformation potentially provides an important approach for production of the key petrochemicals of BTX and the overall use of bio-oil tar derived from bio-oil or biomass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Initial process studies carried out in Aspen Plus on an integrated thermochemical conversion process are presented herein. In the simulations, a hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) plant is combined with a biogas plant (BP), such that the digestate from the BP is converted to a biocrude in the HTL process. This biorefinery concept offers a sophisticated and sustainable way of converting organic residuals into a range of high-value biofuel streams in addition to combined heat and power (CHP) production. The primary goal of this study is to provide an initial estimate of the feasibility of such a process. By adding a diesel-quality-fuel output to the process, the product value is increased significantly compared to a conventional BP. An input of 1000kgh-1 manure delivers approximately 30-38kgh-1 fuel and 38-61kgh-1 biogas. The biogas can be used to upgrade the biocrude, to supply the gas grid or for CHP. An estimated 62-84% of the biomass energy can be recovered in the biofuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel bilirubin oxidase (BOD), from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, has been identified and isolated. The 64-kDa protein containing four coppers was successfully overexpressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity in one step. Protein yield is more than 100 mg for 2 L culture, twice that of Myrothecium verrucaria. The kcat/Km ratio for conjugated bilirubin (1,513 mM-1 s-1) is higher than that obtained for the BOD from M. verrucaria expressed in native fungus (980 mM-1 s-1), with the lowest Km measured for any BOD highly desirable for detection of bilirubin in medical samples. In addition, this protein exhibits a half-life for deactivation &gt;300 min at 37 °C, high stability at pH7, and high tolerance towards urea,making it an ideal candidate for the elaboration of biofuel cells, powering implantable medical devices. Finally, this new BOD is efficient in decolorizing textile dyes such as Remazol brilliant Blue R, making it useful for environmentally friendly industrial applications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

AB  - Acetone was electrocatalytically reduced to isopropanol in a proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) reactor on an unsupported platinum cathode. Protons needed for the reduction were produced on the unsupported Pt-Ru anode from either hydrogen gas or electrolysis of water. The current efficiency (the ratio of current contributing to the desired chemical reaction to the overall current) and reaction rate for acetone conversion increased with increasing temperature or applied voltage for the electrocatalytic acetone/water system. The reaction rate and current efficiency went through a maximum with respect to acetone concentration. The reaction rate for acetone conversion increased with increasing temperature for the electrocatalytic acetone/hydrogen system. Increasing the applied voltage for the electrocatalytic acetone/hydrogen system decreased the current efficiency due to production of hydrogen gas. Results from this study demonstrate the commercial feasibility of using PEM reactors to electrocatalytically reduce biomass-derived oxygenates into renewable fuels and chemicals. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Fossil fuels are the chief contributors to urban air pollution and major source of green house gases and are considered to be the prime cause behind the global climate change. Biofuels are renewable, can supplement fossil fuels, reduce green house gases, and mitigate their adverse effects on the climate resulting from global warming. In the present study, biodiesel produced from karanja oil is evaluated as alternative fuel in a diesel engine. The experiments are conducted on a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct-injection CI engine and the experimental parameters include the percentage of karanja biodiesel in the blend, engine load, injection pressure, and compression ratio. Comparative measures of brake thermal efficiency, brake-specific fuel consumption, smoke opacity, and HC, CO, and NOX emissions are presented and discussed. Results show that the performance of the engine fuelled with karanja biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel is generally comparable to that when the engine is fuelled with pure diesel. At higher compression ratios, the engine gives lesser emission and better performance. Genetic algorithm optimization technique was used to optimize the parameters. With respect to maximum efficiency and minimum emissions, the optimum values of load, compression ratio, injection pressure, and blend were 6 kg, 18, 247 bar, and B95, respectively.

AB  - Pennycress is currently being developed as an oilseed crop for biofuel production. Pennycress seeds harvested from a field near Peoria, Illinois, provided our first opportunity to conduct an oil extraction study on a pilot scale. The goals of this study were to determine the effects of seed moisture and cooking on the pressing characteristics of pennycress seeds and to evaluate the quality of the oils extracted. Pennycress seeds (60. kg) with 9.5 and 16% moisture contents (MC) were cooked and dried (82-104 °C) using a steam-heated 3-deck laboratory seed cooker. The residence times were varied to produce cooked seeds with MCs ranging from 1.0 to 13.0%. The cooked seeds were pressed immediately using a heavy duty laboratory screw press. Pressing rate, press load, and residual oil in the press cakes were determined. The oils extracted were analyzed for solids content (foots), free fatty acid (FFA) content, color, and phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S) contents. Pressing uncooked pennycress seeds with 9.5% MC produced press cake with 10.7% oil (db), extracting 75.1% of the oil in the seed. Cooking and drying the seeds between 3 and 4% MC provided the highest oil recovery at 86.3 and 88.0% for seeds with 9.5 and 16% starting seed MC, respectively. The pressing rates and press loads at these MCs were similar. Compared to the oil from uncooked seeds, the oils from cooked seeds had higher foots (1.55-1.73% vs. 0.52%), slightly higher FFA contents (0.40-0.46% vs. 0.30%), and slightly higher red values in AOCS RY color scale (4.1R-6.2R vs. 2.4R). Cooking increased the phosphatide content but the amount was still comparable to degummed oils. The sulfur levels in the expelled oil were higher than the amounts found in rapeseed oil and varied considerably depending on the seed moisture and the extent of cooking employed. © 2011.

AB  - In Brazil, and mainly in the State of Bahia, crude vegetable oils are widely used in the preparation of food. Street stalls, restaurants and canteens make a great use of palm oil and soybean oil. There is also some use of castor oil, which is widely cultivated in the Sertão Region (within the State of Bahia), and widely applied in industry. This massive use in food preparation leads to a huge amount of waste oil of different types, which needs either to be properly disposed of, or recovered. At the Laboratorio Energia e Gas-LEN (Energy & Gas lab.) of the Universidade Federal da Bahia, a cycle of experiments were carried out to evaluate the recovery of waste oils for biodiesel production. The experiences were carried out on a laboratory scale and, in a semi-industrial pilot plant using waste oils of different qualities. In the transesterification process, applied waste vegetable oils were reacted with methanol with the support of a basic catalyst, such as NaOH or KOH. The conversion rate settled at between 81% and 85% (in weight). The most suitable molar ratio of waste oils to alcohol was 1:6, and the amount of catalyst required was 0.5% (of the weight of the incoming oil), in the case of NaOH, and 1%, in case of KOH. The quality of the biodiesel produced was tested to determine the final product quality. The parameters analyzed were the acid value, kinematic viscosity, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, free glycerine, total glycerine, clearness; the conversion yield of the process was also evaluated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We performed kinetics experiments and quantum calculations to investigate the reaction of furan to benzofuran catalyzed by the acidic zeolite HZSM-5, which is a key step in the conversion of biomass to biofuels through catalytic fast pyrolysis. The reaction was studied experimentally by placing the zeolite in contact with solution-phase furan and detecting the benzofuran product over the temperature range 270-300 C, yielding an apparent activation energy of 72 ± 3 kJ/mol. The reaction was modeled in gas and zeolite phases to determine the energetics of the following two competing pathways: a Diels-Alder mechanism often assumed in interpretations of experimental data and a ring-opening pathway predicted by the chemoinformatic software RING. Quantum calculations on the zeolite/guest system were performed using the ONIOM embedded cluster approach. We computed the energetics of reactants, products, and all intermediate steps. Locating relevant transition states fell beyond our computational resources because of system size and the ruggedness of the energy landscape. The Diels-Alder mechanism in the gas phase was found to pass through a high-energy intermediate roughly 380 kJ/mol above the reactant energy, which reduces to approximately 200 kJ/mol in HZSM-5. In contrast, the ring-opening mechanism passes through a gas-phase intermediate roughly 500 kJ/mol above the reactant energy, which falls to approximately 50 kJ/mol in HZSM-5. The energy of the ring-opening mechanism over HZSM-5 fits into the experimentally determined energy "budget" of 72 ± 3 kJ/mol. These experimental and computational results highlight the importance of the ring-opening mechanism for this key step in making biofuels. Our results strongly indicate that, in the cavities of HZSM-5, the condensation of two furan molecules to form benzofuran and water does not proceed by a Diels-Alder reaction between the reactants. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Here we report a novel family of crystalline, supermicroporous iron(III) phosphonate nanomaterials (HFeP-1-3, HFeP-1-2, and HFeP-1-4) with different FeIII-to-organophosphonate ligand mole ratios. The materials were synthesized by using a hydrothermal reaction between benzene-1,3,5-triphosphonic acid and iron(III) chloride under acidic conditions (pH≈4.0). Powder X-ray diffraction, N2 sorption, transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM) image analysis, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA), and FTIR spectroscopic tools were used to characterize the materials. The triclinic crystal phase [P1(2) space group] of the hybrid iron phosphonate was established by a Rietveld refinement of the PXRD analysis of HFeP-1-3 by using the MAUD program. The unit cell parameters are a=8.749(1), b=8.578(1), c=17.725(3) Å; α=104.47(3), β=97.64(1), γ=113.56(3)°; and V=1013.41 Å3. With these crystal parameters, we proposed an 24-membered-ring open framework structure for HFeP-1. Compound HFeP-1-3, with an starting Fe/ligand molar ratio of 3.0, shows the highest Brunauer-Emmett-Telller (BET) surface area of 556 m2g -1 and uniform supermicropores of approximately 1.1 nm. The acidic surface of the porous iron(III) phosphonate nanoparticles was used in a highly efficient and recyclable catalytic transesterification reaction for the synthesis of biofuels under mild reaction conditions. Iron brews biofuels: Highly crystalline, supermicroporous iron(III) phosphonate nanoparticles have been synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction between benzene-1,3,5- triphosphonic acid and FeCl3. The resulting material was used as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for the synthesis of biofuels under mild reaction conditions (see scheme). Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - Recently, the steam reforming of biofuels has been presented as a potential hydrogen source for fuel cells. Because this scenario represents an interesting opportunity for Colombia (South America), which produces large amounts of bioethanol, the steam reforming of ethanol was studied over a bimetallic RhPt/La2O3 catalyst under bulk mass transfer conditions. The effect of temperature and the initial concentrations of ethanol and water were evaluated at space velocities above 55,000 h-1 to determine the conditions that maximize the H2/CO ratio and reduce CH4 production while maintaining 100% conversion of ethanol. These requirements were accomplished when 21 mol% H2O and 3 mol% C2H 5OH (steam/ethanol molar ratio = 7) were reacted at 600 °C. The catalyst stability was assessed under these reaction conditions during 120 h on stream, obtaining ethanol conversions above 99% during the entire test. The effect of both H2 and air flows as catalyst regeneration treatments were evaluated after 44 and 67 h on stream, respectively. The results showed that H2 treatment accelerated catalyst deactivation, and air regeneration increased both the catalyst stability and the H2 selectivity while decreasing CH4 generation. Fresh and spent catalyst samples were characterized by TEM/EDX, XPS, TPR, and TGA. Although the Rh and Pt in the fresh catalyst were completely reduced, the spent samples showed a partial oxidation of Rh and small amounts of carbonaceous residue. A possible Rh-Pt-Rh2O3 structure was proposed as the active site on the catalyst, which was regenerated by air treatment. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuels and increasing public awareness of environmental issues has stimulated the search for alternative energy sources. Biofuels are recognised as one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels, as they can be produced from various types of feedstock. The efficiency and sustainability of biomass-based production can be maximised by producing biofuels along with other valuable coproducts in a " biorefinery" This concept was proposed to make the production of biofuels and biochemicals more economically viable by taking advantage of opportunities for process integration and waste recovery. In this work, a novel hybrid optimisation model that combines superstructure-based optimisation approach and insight-based automated targeting for the synthesis of a sustainable integrated biorefinery is presented. In addition, fuzzy optimisation is also adapted to synthesize such integrated facility with the simultaneous consideration of both economic and environmental performance. Note that the proposed approach is a generic synthesis strategy that can be applied even without detailed modelling of individual processes. © 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to address the issue of the production cost of second generation biofuels via the thermo-chemical route. The last decade has seen a large number of technical-economic studies of second generation biofuels. As there is a large variation in the announced production costs of second generation biofuels in the literature, this paper clarifies some of the reasons for these variations and helps obtain a clearer picture. This paper presents simulations for two pathways and comparative production pathways previously published in the literature in the years between 2000 and 2011. It also includes a critical comparison and analysis of previously published studies. This paper does not include studies where the production is boosted with a hydrogen injection to improve the carbon yield. The only optimisation included is the recycle of tail gas. It is shown that the fuel can be produced on a large scale at prices of around 1.0-1.4 € per l. Large uncertainties remain however with regard to the precision of the economic predictions, the technology choices, the investment cost estimation and even the financial models to calculate the production costs. The benefit of a tail gas recycle is also examined; its benefit largely depends on the selling price of the produced electricity. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Due to depletion and higher prices of crude oil, biodiesel is gaining more importance day by day. Biodiesel is renewable and eco-friendly and its emission profile is much lower than fossil fuels. A large number of researches have been done on identification of new feedstocks and cheaper technologies for biodiesel production. Among many feedstocks used oils have been reported as a cheaper feedstock for biodiesel production. Transesterification of veg fried oil and non-veg fried oil was studied in a batch type reactor with NaOH and methanol. The reactions were optimized, veg fried oil and non-veg fried oil gave an maximum ester yield of 91% and 87% respectively for 0.6 wt.% of NaOH with a molar ratio of 6:1 for 3 h at 65 °C. Fatty acid profile of these two methyl esters were similar and their parent oil was found to be palm olein. Fuel properties were some what closer to each other. These esters (B100) and their blends with diesel (B25, B50, B75) when utilized in DI diesel engine showed better emission profile. B75 was found to be the best. An artificial neural network (ANN) was created with brake power and biofuel blend as input and brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, NO X, HC, CO and smoke density as output. Back propagation algorithm was used and the data obtained from engine test was utilized for training the network. The SIMULINK model of the trained neural network was generated to predict the fuel emissions and performance. The trained neural network with a correlation coefficient of 0.9989 and 0.999 gave better predictions for B15, B30, B60 and B90, the results were found to be acceptable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Escherichia coli has been engineered to produce a variety of biofuel and biorefinery products. However, it can only produce these products from simple sugars, requiring large amounts of enzymes to depolymerize cellulose into monomer sugars. Engineering E. coli to directly use cellodextrin, the partial hydrolysis product of cellulose, potentially could reduce the requirement of enzyme thereby the overall cost. Through a combination of gene deletion, introduction of a synthetic operon, and periplasmic expression of a Saccharophagus cellodextrinase, we engineered, for the first time, an E. coli biocatalyst capable of producing BDO from cellodextrin. The success of the engineering strategy is evidenced by the high BDO yield (>80%) from cellodextrin. We additionally demonstrate that the engineered biocatalyst can be advantageously used in a SSF process for BDO production from cellulose as the expression of cellodextrinase from a BDO producer augments the insufficient β-glucosidase activities in a commercial cellulase cocktail. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration/dehydration of carbon dioxide/bicarbonate. As such, there is enormous industrial interest in using CA as a bio-catalyst for carbon sequestration and biofuel production. However, to ensure cost-effective use of the enzyme under harsh industrial conditions, studies were initiated to produce variants with enhanced thermostability while retaining high solubility and catalytic activity. Kinetic and structural studies were conducted to determine the structural and functional effects of these mutations. X-ray crystallography revealed that a gain in surface hydrogen bonding contributes to stability while retaining proper active site geometry and electrostatics to sustain catalytic efficiency. The kinetic profiles determined under a variety of conditions show that the surface mutations did not negatively impact the carbon dioxide hydration or proton transfer activity of the enzyme. Together these results show that it is possible to enhance the thermal stability of human carbonic anhydrase II by specific replacements of surface hydrophobic residues of the enzyme. In addition, combining these stabilizing mutations with strategic active site changes have resulted in thermostable mutants with desirable kinetic properties. © The Author 2012.

AB  - The influence of reaction temperature (160-200. °C), residence time (45-90. min), and liquid-solid ratio (8-16. v/w) on oil palm frond (OPF) pre-treated with hot compressed water (HCW) was evaluated using severity factors. Effect of the process parameters studied on pulps composition and digestibility were found to be complex. The results revealed that digestibility could not be predicted merely according to composition. Severity factor was correlated with compositional changes and digestibility with good R-squared values at varied liquid-solid ratios (8-16. v/w), but not with overall glucose yield. HCW pretreatment significantly improved the overall glucose yield up to 83.72% with severity of 3.31 and liquid-solid ratio of 8.0 compared to untreated raw OPF which only recorded an overall glucose yield of 30.97%. HCW is therefore an effective method for pretreatment of OPF for glucose recovery. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-refinery concepts are currently receiving much attention due to the drive toward flexible, highly efficient systems for utilization of biomass for food, feed, fuel and bio-chemicals. One way of achieving this is through appropriate process integration, in this particular case combining enzymatic bio-ethanol production with catalytic liquefaction of the wet distillers grains with soluble, a byproduct from the bio-ethanol process. The catalytic liquefaction process is carried out at sub-critical conditions (280-370 °C and 25 MPa) in the presence of a homogeneous alkaline and a heterogeneous Zirconia catalyst, a process known as the Catliq ® process. In the current work, catalytic conversion of WDGS was performed in a continuous pilot plant with a maximum capacity of 30 dm 3 h -1 of wet biomass. In the process, WDGS was converted to bio-oil, gases and water-soluble organic compounds. The oil obtained was characterized using several analysis methods, among them elementary analysis and GC-MS. The study shows that WDGS can be converted to bio oil with high yields. The results also indicate that through the combination of bio-ethanol production and catalytic liquefaction, it is possible to significantly increase the liquid product yield and scope, opening up for a wider end use applicability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalyst-free biodiesel production from non-edible Ceiba pentandra (kapok) oil via supercritical methanol transesterification was demonstrated in this work. The supercritical transesterification experiments were performed in a batch reactor at temperatures of 250-350°C, pressures of 10-18MPa, reaction times of 120-600s, and methanol to oil molar ratios of 15:1-35:1. Response surface methodology (RSM) and four-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied for the design and optimization of the experiments with respect to temperature, pressure, reaction time, and molar ratio of methanol to oil simultaneously. The response (i.e., FAME yield) was fitted by a quadratic polynomial regression model using least square analysis in a five-level-four-factor central composite design (CCD). The optimum conditions were found as follows: methanol to oil molar ratio of 30:1, temperature of 322°C, pressure of 16.7MPa, and reaction time of 476s with FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) yield of 95.5%. The significance of the reaction parameters toward FAME yield was in the order of methanol to oil molar ratio>reaction time>pressure>temperature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis of Jatropha residue was performed over SiO 2 catalysts with different pore sizes (SiO2-Q3, -Q10, -Q30, and -Q50 with pore diameters of 3, 16, 45, and 68 nm, respectively) at 500 C using a pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system. SiO 2-Q10, which combined weak acidity and medium porosity, was the most effective catalyst in removing oxygenated compounds such as acids, ketones, and aldehydes, which are the principal reason for the polymerization of hydrocarbons from bio-oil, and in inhibiting coke and polycyclic aromatic compound formation. SiO2-Q10 is also useful for stabilizing bio-oil and has potential for catalytic fast pyrolysis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Utilization of macroalgae biomass for bioethanol production appears as an alternative source to lignocellulosic materials. In this study, for the first time, Amberlyst (TM)-15 was explored as a potential catalyst to hydrolyze carbohydrates from Eucheuma cottonii extract to simple reducing sugar prior to fermentation process. Several important hydrolysis parameters were studied for process optimization including catalyst loading (2-5%, w/v), reaction temperature (110-130 °C), reaction time (0-2.5 h) and biomass loading (5.5-15.5%, w/v). Optimum sugar yield of 39.7% was attained based on the following optimum conditions: reaction temperature at 120 °C, catalyst loading of 4% (w/v), 12.5% (w/v) of biomass concentration and reaction time of 1.5 h. Fermentation of the hydrolysate using Saccharomyces cerevisiae produced 0.33 g/g of bioethanol yield with an efficiency of 65%. The strategy of combining heterogeneous-catalyzed hydrolysis and fermentation with S. cerevisiae could be a feasible strategy to produce bioethanol from macroalgae biomass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Au/α-Fe2O3 catalyst was synthesized using a modified co-precipitation method to generate an inverse catalyst model. The effects of introducing CO2 and H2O during preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO were investigated. The goal of this work was ≥99.8% CO conversion at 80°C. There was an increase in the conversion at all temperatures with the introduction of CO2 and 100% of the CO was converted at the target temperature of 80°C for any amount of CO 2. Furthermore, there was an increase in conversion to 100% for water fractions ranging from 3% to 10%. Finally, for realistic conditions of (bio-)fuel reforming, 24% CO2 and 10% water, 99.85% conversion was achieved. A long-term test of 200 h showed no significant deactivation of the catalyst at a temperature of 80°C in presence of 24% CO2 and 3% water. The mechanism for PROX is not known definitively; however, current literature believes the gold particle size is the key. In contrast, we emphasize the tremendous role of the support particle size.

AB  - The work reported in this article is a thermodynamic and kinetic study of the acetalization reaction between acetaldehyde and glycerol to produce glycerol ethyl acetal (GEA). A catalyst screening was performed allowing for the choice of Amberlyst-15 wet resin as the most suitable catalyst for this reaction. Through the study of the reaction thermodynamic equilibrium, it was possible to determine the value of the equilibrium constant as a function of temperature, ln(K) = 1.419 + 1055/T, and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters ΔH298 K0 = -8.77 kJ·mol-1 and ΔG298 K0 = -12.3 kJ·mol-1. Additionally, the standard enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of formation of GEA were also obtained, as -584.4 and -387.0 kJ·mol-1, respectively. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson model considering internal mass-transfer limitations presented the best fitting of the reaction kinetic behavior. The parameters estimated for this model were kc (mol· gcat-1·s-1) = 3.13 × 10 9 - 6223/T and KS,W = 1.82 × 10-3 exp(2361/T). The acetalization of glycerol with acetaldehyde presents an activation energy of 51.7 kJ·mol-1. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - For enzymatic biodiesel production from plant oil hydrolysates, an Aspergillus oryzae whole-cell biocatalyst that expresses Candida antarctica lipase B (r-CALB) with high esterification activity was developed. Each of soybean and palm oils was hydrolyzed using Candida rugosa lipase, and the resultant hydrolysates were subjected to esterification where immobilized r-CALB was used as a catalyst. In esterification, r-CALB afforded a methyl ester content of more than 90% after 6. h with the addition of 1.5. M equivalents of methanol. Favorably, stepwise additions of methanol and a little water were unnecessary for maintaining the lipase stability of r-CALB during esterification. During long-term esterification in a rotator, r-CALB can be recycled for 20 cycles without a significant loss of lipase activity, resulting in a methyl ester content of more than 90% even after the 20th batch. Therefore, the presented reaction system using r-CALB shows promise for biodiesel production from plant oil hydrolysates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Non-catalytic hydropyrolysis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa was studied by using a stainless-steel batch reactor at different temperature (150-450°C), time (5-120min) and initial hydrogen pressure (1atm-8MPa), aiming to find how these parameters affect the product (oil, gas and solid) yields and properties of the hydropyrolysis oil (HPO). Temperature was the most influential factor to the relative amount of each product and properties of the HPOs. The hydrogen favored the stabilization of the active intermediates but cannot guarantee to produce HPOs in higher hydrogen at its higher initial pressure. The HPO, which showed much difference in component strongly depending on the reaction conditions, mainly consisted of aromatics and straight-chain hydrocarbons, amides, amines, nitriles and carboxylic acids at moderate temperatures. The main gas products detected during the hydropyrolysis were unreacted H2, CO2, CO and CH4. About 85% of energy originally present in the microalgae was recovered as oil under the optimal conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) offers the only sustainable alternative to the use of fossil fuels as oil by employing its main components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) as a carbon source for the production of biofuels, energy and value-added chemicals. The aim of the present study was to investigate ethanol production from organosolv pretreated Eucalyptus globulus wood, carrying out the simultaneous sacharification and fermentation (SSF) process at a substrate loading of 10 and 15% (w/v) and using concentrations of 6 and 12 g L-1 of the thermally acclimatized S. cerevisiae IR2T9-a strain. These SSF experiments were also evaluated by increasing the enzyme loading in the reaction medium. Finally, a comparison was made between separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and SSF processes. With the information obtained and from published information, a general mass balance was developed. RESULTS: The highest ethanol concentration (∼42 g L-1) in the fermentation broth was obtained at a substrate consistency of 15% (w/v), enzyme loading of 20 FPU cellulase 40 UI β-glucosidase g-1 of pretreated material and using both S. cerevisiae strain IR2-9a concentrations (6 and 12 g L-1). CONCLUSION: The results of enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) show that increasing substrate content from 10 to 15% (w/v) decreases the conversion efficiency of cellulose to glucose. Furthermore, the mass balances of the process indicate that the SSF process is a better alternative than the SHF configuration, because larger amounts of ethanol can be obtained. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative and renewable fuel made from plant and animal fat or cooked oil through a transesterification process to produce a short chain ester (generally methyl ester). Biodiesel fuels have been worldwide studied in Diesel engines and they were found to be compatible in blends with Diesel fuel to well operate in modern Common Rail engines. Also throughout the world the diffusion of biofuels is being promoted in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the environmental impact of transport, and to increase security of supply. To meet the current exhaust emission regulations, after-treatment devices are necessary; in particular Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) are essential to reduce particulate emissions of Diesel engines. A critical requirement for the implementation of DPF on a modern Biodiesel powered engine is the determination of Break-even Temperature (BET) which is defined as the temperature at which particulate deposition on the filter is balanced by particulate oxidation on the filter. To fit within the exhaust temperature range of the exhaust line and to require a minimum of active regeneration during the engine running, the BET needs to occur at sufficiently low temperatures. In this paper, the results of an experimental campaign on a modern, electronic controlled fuel injection Diesel engine are shown. The engine was fuelled either with petroleum ultralow sulphur fuel or with Biodiesel: BET was evaluated for both fuels. Results show that on average, the BET is lower for biodiesel than for diesel fuel. The final goal was to characterize the regeneration process of the DPF device depending on the adopted fuel, taking into account the different combustion process and the different nature of the particulate matter. Overall the results suggest significant benefits for the use of biodiesel in engines equipped with DPFs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hydrothermal stability of mesoporous silica is critical for applications including catalytic processing of biofuels due to the presence of significant amounts of water. We have combined neutron diffraction intensity analysis with NLDFT analysis of nitrogen sorption isotherms to characterize the spatial distribution of the secondary pore network in SBA-15 following postcalcination hydrothermal treatment in both liquid and vapor phase water at temperatures from 115 to 155 °C under autogenous pressure. The results are consistent with a degradation mechanism in which silica dissolves from regions of small positive curvature, e.g., near the entrance to the secondary pores, and is redeposited deeper into the framework. Pore volumes decrease fastest for the micropores and more slowly for larger secondary mesopores. Under water treatment at 115 °C, the mesopore diameter increases and the intrawall void fraction decreases significantly. The behavior is similar for steam treatment but occurs more slowly. Differences in the chemical environment and transport limitations are discussed. At higher temperatures of 155 °C, pores in the region surrounding the mesopore are nearly eliminated, trapping water deeper in the matrix, which can be seen with neutron scattering but is inaccessible to nitrogen isotherm measurements. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Increasing energy demand and dwindling natural resources have led to wide interest in developing synthetic fuels and chemicals that can supplement and replace the fuels and chemicals obtained from conventional petroleum based feedstocks. Alternative fuels and chemicals can be derived from non petroleum based feedstocks such as coal and biomass. Biomass is considered particularly attractive because of the potential sustainability and carbon neutrality associated with its use. Thus great effort is being dedicated to the use and conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals. Cellulose is the most abundant renewable carbon source present in the lignocellulosic (non edible biomass) realm, and has a rigid structure consisting of a number of glucose units linked together. Consequently effort has focused on the catalytic conversion of glucose and also cellulose directly to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a versatile intermediate for synthesis of fuels and chemicals. A number of studies have claimed that Cr catalysts in ionic liquid solvents convert glucose and fructose to HMF in unprecedentedly high yields. However, ambiguity over the oxidation state of Cr has remained. Knowledge of the specific metal oxidation state is essential to gain an understanding of the reaction mechanism and to design still more active catalysts. Herein we demonstrate Cr(III) to be the active species, rather than Cr(II) which had previously been implicated and subsequently assumed by others. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A whole-cell based solvent-free system was developed for efficient conversion of waste grease to biodiesel via one-pot esterification and transesterification. By isolation and screening of lipase-producing strains from soil, Serratia marcescens YXJ-1002 was discovered for the biotransformation of grease to biodiesel. The lipase (SML) from this strain was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as an intracellular enzyme, showing 6 times higher whole-cell based hydrolysis activity than that of wild type strain. The recombinant cells were used for biodiesel production from waste grease in one-pot reactions containing no solvent with the addition of methanol in several small portions, and 97% yield of biodiesel (FAME) was achieved under optimized conditions. In addition, the whole-cell biocatalysts showed excellent reusability, retaining 74% productivity after 4 cycles. The developed system, biocatalyst, and process enable the efficient, low-cost, and green production of biodiesel from waste grease, providing with a potential industrial application. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Activated sludge contains a microbial population responsible for the biological treatment of wastewater. This microbial population mostly consists of heterothrophic bacteria which utilize the organic content of the wastewater for growth, either as part of their cellular structures or as energy and carbon storage compounds. These compounds are mostly lipidic in nature and are or could be important raw materials for a multitude of applications in biofuel and oleochemical industries. In this study, a municipal activated sludge was analyzed for lipid storage compounds and other compound classes present in significant concentrations. Three extraction techniques, namely; Bligh & Dyer (applied on dried and partially dewatered samples) and accelerated solvent extractions, were initially investigated to identify the one resulting in the highest gravimetric and biodiesel yields. The highest yields were obtained using the Bligh & Dyer of partially dewatered sludge samples and thus, the extracts from this extraction technique were subjected to a series of analytical procedures such as precipitation, solid phase extraction, thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to characterize the major compound classes present. Results indicated that the major compounds in the samples were polyhydroxyalkanoates, wax esters, steryl esters, triacylglycerides, free fatty acids, free sterols and phospholipids. Hydrocarbons, diacylglycerides and monoacylglycerides were also detected. These compounds are either synthesized by microorganisms or from exogenous contributions. Regardless of the source of these compounds, their persistent presence in activated sludge offers another feedstock for a wide range of applications. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Platform chemicals such as furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural are major products formed during the acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in second generation biorefining processes. Solid hydrolysis residues (HR) can amount to 50. wt.% of the starting biomass materials. Pyrolysis of the HRs gives rise to biochar, bio-liquids, and gases. Time and temperature were variables during the pyrolysis of HRs in a fixed bed tubular reactor, and both parameters have major influences on the amounts and properties of the products. Biochar, with potential for carbon sequestration and soil conditioning, composed about half of the HR pyrolysis product. The amounts (11-20. wt.%) and compositions (up to 77% of phenols in organic fraction) of the bio-liquids formed suggest that these have little value as fuels, but could be sources of phenols, and the gas can have application as a fuel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper an exergy analysis of thermochemical ethanol production from biomass is presented. This process combines a steam-blown indirect biomass gasification of woody feedstock, with a subsequent conversion of produced syngas into ethanol. The production process involves several process sections, including biomass drying and gasification, syngas cleaning, reforming, conditioning, and compression, ethanol synthesis, separation of synthesis products, and heat recovery. The process is simulated with a computer model using the flow-sheeting software Aspen Plus. The exergy analysis is performed for various ethanol catalysts, including Rh-based and MoS2-based (target) catalysts as well as for various gasification temperatures. The exergetic efficiency is 43.5% for Rh-based and 44.4% for MoS2-based (target) catalyst, when ethanol is considered as the only exergetic output. In case when by-products of ethanol synthesis are considered as the additional output the exergetic efficiency for Rh-based catalyst increases to 58.9% and 65.8% for MoS2-based (target) catalyst. The largest exergy losses occur in biomass gasifier and ethanol synthesis reactor. The exergetic efficiency for both ethanol catalysts increases with decreasing gasification temperature. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Heterogeneous basic catalysts can be used for biodiesel production. The performances of several types of such materials are described in the literature but small attention is given to its deactivation in reaction medium. This paper put in evidence that catalysts are not static identities in the reaction medium, and relates the physical characteristics of fresh and post reaction samples with deactivation mechanisms.Catalysts, tested during the methanolysis of soybean oil, were prepared by thermal activation of Ce modified Mg-Al hydrotalcites (Mg/Al = 3, Ce/Mg < 0.1 atomic ratios). Calcination at 575 °C allows to nanostructured samples with main XRD lines belonging to periclase and cerianite. Additionally, calcined samples containing 3% and 5% of Ce showed hydrotalcite patterns pointed out that cerium promotes the fast rehydration and restructuration. All the prepared samples showed contamination with sodium aluminate which masks the Ce effect on the catalysts basicity due to its strong basicity. In the tested conditions, the catalysts with Ce/Mg > 0.03 (atomic ratio) presented FAME yields higher than 90%. Thermogravimetry analysis of post reaction catalysts evidenced that cerium influences the reaction mechanism. The post reaction catalysts evidenced that surface restructuring occurs during reaction with sizeable change of the elements distribution which as beneficial effect on the catalytic performances. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The one-step synthesis of biodiesel from waste oil with high FFAs (free fatty acids) content was developed under mild condition (70°C, 1atm) using novel acidic ionic liquid immobilization on PDVB (poly divinylbenzene) as catalyst. The solid acid owns high activities for both the esterification of FFAs and transesterification of triglyceride with total yield over 99.0%. The novel solid acid combined the high activities of acidic ionic liquids and the easy separation of solid catalysts. The mild reaction conditions, high catalytic activities, high total yield, reusability and high stability were the key properties of the novel methodology, which would greatly reduce the production cost for the industrial application. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial lipase from Candida rugosa (Amano AY-30) has good transesterification activity and can be used for biodiesel production. In this study, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was grafted with 1,4-diaminobutane and activated by glutaraldehyde for C. rugosa lipase immobilization. After immobilization, the biocatalytic membrane was used for producing biodiesel from soybean oil and methanol via transesterification. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in combination with a 5-level-5-factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed to evaluate the effects of reaction time, reaction temperature, enzyme amount, substrate molar ratio and water content on the yield of soybean oil methyl ester. By ridge max analysis, the predicted and experimental yields under the optimum synthesis conditions were 97% and 95%, respectively. The lipase-immobilized PVDF membrane showed good reuse ability for biodiesel production, enabling operation for at least 165. h during five reuses of the batch, without significant loss of activity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Corncob was pyrolyzed using ZnCl2 in a pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor to co-produce furfural and acetic acid. The effects of reaction conditions, the ZnCl2 content and contacting method of ZnCl2 with corncob on the yields of furfural and acetic acid were investigated. The pyrolysis was performed within the temperature range between 310 and 410°C, and the bio-oil yield were 30-60wt% of the product. The furfural yield increased up to 8.2wt%. The acetic acid yield was maximized with a value of 13.1wt%. A lower feed rate in the presence of ZnCl2 was advantageous for the production of acetic acid. The fast pyrolysis of a smaller corncob sample mechanically mixed with 20wt% of ZnCl2 gave rise to a distinct increase in furfural. A high selectivity for furfural and acetic acid in bio-oil would make the pyrolysis of corncob with ZnCl2 very economically attractive. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel composite catalytic membrane (CCM) was prepared from sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) and polyethersulfone (PES) blend supported by non-woven fabrics, as a heterogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel from continuous esterification of oleic acid with methanol in a flow-through mode. A kinetic model of esterification was established based on a plug-flow assumption. The effects of the CCM structure (thickness, area, porosity, etc.), reaction temperature and the external and internal mass transfer resistances on esterification were investigated. The results showed that the CCM structure had a significant effect on the acid conversion. The external mass transfer resistance could be neglected when the flow rate was over 1.2mlmin-1. The internal mass transfer resistance impacted on the conversion when membrane thickness was over 1.779mm. An oleic acid conversion kept over 98.0% for 500h of continuous running. The conversions obtained from the model are in good agreement with the experimental data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermochemical biorefinery based on dimethyl ether (DME) as an intermediate is studied. DME is converted into methyl acetate, which can either be hydrogenated to ethanol or sold as a co-product. Considering this option together with a variety of technologies for syngas upgrading, 12 different process concepts are analyzed. The considered products are ethanol, methyl acetate, H2, DME and electricity. The assessment of each alternative includes biomass pretreatment, gasification, syngas clean-up and conditioning, DME synthesis and conversion, product separation, and heat and power integration. A plant size of 500MWth processing poplar chips is taken as a basis. The resulting energy efficiency to products ranges from 34.9% to 50.2%. The largest internal rate of return (28.74%) corresponds to a concept which produces methyl acetate, DME and electricity (exported to grid). A sensitivity analysis with respect to total plant investment (TPI), total operation costs (TOC) and market price of products was carried out. The overall conclusion is that, despite its greater complexity, this kind of thermochemical biorefinery is more profitable than thermochemical bioprocesses oriented to a single product. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Wheat bran, an abundant residue of the flour milling industry, is a promising feedstock for bioethanol production. The first objective of the present study was to define the optimised hydrolysis conditions for wheat bran that gave both high sugars concentration and little or no inhibitors formation. This low-cost material was subjected to acid treatment and then hydrolysed using increasing dosages of commercial enzymes. With the aim of selecting a robust yeast suitable for industrial ethanol production, new Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts were isolated. Among the strains having remarkable ethanol yields from glucose in a minimal broth with high sugars concentrations, S. cerevisiae MEL2 was selected to be used for wheat bran fermentation. The strain produced ethanol levels higher than the benchmark industrial yeast S. cerevisiae DSM70449, exhibiting an outstanding ethanol yield of 96% of the theoretical and also showing promising fermentative activity on the whole unfiltered hydrolysates. This study demonstrated that dilute acid pre-treatment and the use of a properly selected yeast had a great impact on the overall ethanol yield from wheat bran. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production by non-catalytic supercritical methyl acetate (SCMA) reaction has been developed and optimized in previous study using Jatropha oil as oil feedstock. The reaction produces fatty methyl acid esters (FAME) as well as triacetin as the co-product. Due to the requirement of high reaction temperatures in SCMA treatment, thus the thermal stability of methyl oleate and methyl linoleate which are the major FAME in SCMA was investigated at temperature ranging from 330. °C to 420. °C. In addition, thermal stability of triacetin which was utilized as fuel additive in biodiesel was also investigated. The results revealed that the thermal stability of poly-unsaturated methyl linoleate decreases dramatically as temperature is increased from 330. °C to 420. °C while degradation of methyl oleate was only significant at 390. °C and above. Similar behaviour was also observed for triacetin which was found to degrade at high temperatures, resulting in low yield of biodiesel fuel even at optimum conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, a novel multiple-cascade automated targeting (MCAT) approach is proposed for determining the maximum economic performance of a gasification-based integrated biorefinery. Since multiple process parameters (i.e.; heat input of biomass gasifier, syngas specification for downstream synthesis process, gasification temperature, etc.) should be taken into consideration simultaneously in order to optimize such system, this work extends the previously developed single-cascade automated targeting (SCAT) to allow such problems to be dealt with more effectively. This proposed approach, is based on pinch analysis, and can be used to identify the performance targets based on different optimization objectives prior to detailed design of the integrated biorefinery. An industrial case study is solved to illustrate the approach. Copyright © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study demonstrates the production of biodiesel from used cooking oil containing high free fatty acid by a two-step heterogeneously catalyzed process. The free fatty acids were first esterified with methanol using a 25wt.% TPA/Nb2O5 catalyst followed by transesterification of the oil with methanol over ZnO/Na-Y zeolite catalyst. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, BET surface area and CO2-TPD. In the case of transesterification the effect of reaction parameters, such as catalyst concentration, methanol to oil molar ratio and reaction temperature, on the yield of ester were investigated. The catalyst with 20wt.% ZnO loading on Na-Y exhibited the highest activity among the others. Both the solid acid and base catalysts were found to be reusable for several times indicating their efficacy in the two-step process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - WO3/AlPO4 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of AlPO4 with ammonium metatungstate. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and thermo gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) demonstrated that the tungsten compound was incorporated into AlPO4 forming the catalyst with an enhanced acidity. When transesterification of soybean oil over the catalysts was performed, the catalyst with 30wt.% WO3 loading and calcined at 1073K, exhibited the best catalytic activity with a conversion of 72.5%. The transesterification was optimal at 453K for 5h with a methanol/oil ratio of 30:1 and catalyst dosage of 5wt.%. Free fatty acid (FFA) and water did not affect the catalytic activity. The catalyst proved to be stable over four transesterification cycles as it lost only 4% of its activity after being reused four times. The catalyst could be used for the transesterification of low-cost oils for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new class of zirconia supported mixed metal oxides (ZnO-TiO 2-Nd 2O 3/ZrO 2 and ZnO-SiO 2-Yb 2O 3/ZrO 2) has demonstrated the ability to convert low quality, high free fatty acid (FFA) bio-oils into biodiesel. Pelletized catalysts of ZrO 2 supported metal oxides were prepared via a sol-gel process and tested in continuous flow packed bed reactors for up to 6months. In a single pass, while operating at mild to moderate reaction conditions, 195°C and 300psi, these catalysts can perform simultaneous esterification and transesterification reactions on feedstock of 33% FFA and 67% soybean oil to achieve FAME yields higher than 90%. Catalytic activity of the ZrO 2 supported metal oxide catalysts was highly dependent on the metal oxide composition. These heterogeneous catalysts will enable biodiesel manufacturers to avoid problems inherent in homogeneous processes, such as separation and washing, corrosive conditions, and excessive methanol usage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Optimal conditions for the microwave-assisted enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel have been developed by a full 22 factorial design leading to a set of seven runs with different combinations of molar ratio and temperature. The main goal was to reduce the reaction time preliminarily established by a process of conventional heating. Reactions yielding biodiesel, in which beef tallow and ethanol used as raw materials were catalyzed by lipase from Burkholderia cepacia immobilized on silica-PVA and microwave irradiations within the range of 8-15 W were performed to reach the reaction temperature. Under optimized conditions (1:6 molar ratio of beef tallow to ethanol molar ratio at 50°C) almost total conversion of the fatty acid presented in the original beef tallow was converted into ethyl esters in a reaction that required 8 h, i.e., a productivity of about 92 mg ethyl esters g -1 h -1. This represents an increase of sixfold for the process carried out under conventional heating. In general, the process promises low energy demand and higher biodiesel productivity. The microwave assistance speeds up the enzyme catalyzed reactions, decreases the destructive effects on the enzyme of the operational conditions such as, higher temperature, stability, and specificity to its substrate, and allows the entire reaction medium to be heated uniformly. © Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology 2011.

AB  - A central composite design of experiments was performed to optimize a free-fall reactor for the production of bio-oil from red oak biomass. The effects of four experimental variables including heater set-point temperature, biomass particle size, sweep gas flow rate and biomass feed rate were studied. Heater set-point temperature ranged from 450 to 650. °C, average biomass particle size from 200 to 600. μm, sweep gas flow rate from 1 to 5. sL/min and biomass feed rate from 1 to 2. kg/h. Optimal operating conditions yielding over 70. wt.% bio-oil were identified at a heater set-point temperature of 575. °C, while feeding red oak biomass sized less than 300. μm at 2. kg/h into the 0.021. m diameter, 1.8. m tall reactor. Sweep gas flow rate did not have significant effect on bio-oil yield over the range tested. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The work was to investigate the influence of microwave power, metal oxides and metal salts onto the pyrolysis of algae (4.55wt.% moisture). It was found that the heating rate and the final temperature would increase as enhancing the microwave power. When microwave power increased from 750W to 2250W, the yield of solid residue decreased by 22.05%, and gas yield increased 39.45%. After adding 5% (mass basis) CuO and MgO, the yield of solid residue and bio-oil appeared the greatest decreasing ranges of 14.35% and 11.04%, respectively. Electrical energy consumption increased by 1.44% and reduced by 40.76% after CuO and MgO was added, separately. When algae was mixed with 5% (mass basis) MgCl2, ZnCl2 and NaH2PO3, respectively, the yield of solid residue increased by 3.98%, 1.13% and 2.31%, and the bio-oil yield increased by 6.3%, 16.92% and 0.71%, respectively. The effect of microwave absorption was ZnCl2&gt;NaH2PO3&gt;MgCl2. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A solid base catalyst was prepared by the sodium potassium tartrate doped zirconia and microwave assisted transesterification of soybean oil was carried out for the production of biodiesel. It was found that the catalyst of 2.0(n(Na)/n(Zr)) and calcined at 600°C showed the optimum activity. The base strength of the catalysts was tested by the Hammett indicator method, and the results showed that the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield was related to their total basicity. The catalyst was also characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD and TEM. The experimental results showed that a 2.0:1 volume ratio of methanol to oil, 65°C reaction temperature, 30min reaction time and 10wt.% catalyst amount gave the highest the yield of biodiesel. Compared to conventional method, the reaction time of the way of microwave assisted transesterification was shorter. The catalyst had longer lifetime and maintained sustained activity after being used for four cycles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We have designed a kinetic model of biodiesel production using Novozym 435 (Nz435) with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a catalyst. The scheme assumed reversibility of all reaction steps and imitated phase effects by introducing various molecular species of water and methanol. The global model was assembled from separate reaction blocks analyzed independently. Computer simulations helped to explore behavior of the reaction system under different conditions. It was found that methanolysis of refined oil by CALB is slow, because triglycerides (T) are the least reactive substrates. Conversion to 95% requires 1.5-6 days of incubation depending on the temperature, enzyme concentration, glycerol inhibition, etc. Other substrates, free fatty acids (F), diglycerides (D) and monoglycerides (M), are utilized much faster (1-2 h). This means that waste oil is a better feedstock for CALB. Residual enzymatic activity in biodiesel of standard quality causes increase of D above its specification level because of the reaction 2M ↔ D + G. Filtration or alkaline treatment of the product prior to storage resolves this problem. The optimal field of Nz435 application appears to be decrease of F, M, D in waste oil before the conventional alkaline conversion. Up to 30-fold reduction of F-content can be achieved in 1-2 h, and the residual enzyme (if any) does not survive the following alkaline treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, Escherichia coli MG1655 was engineered to produce ethanol and evolved in a laboratory process to obtain an acetate tolerant strain called MS04 (E. coli MG1655: ΔpflB, ΔadhE, ΔfrdA, ΔxylFGH, ΔldhA, PpflB::pdcZm-adhBZm, evolved). The growth and ethanol production kinetics of strain MS04 were determined in mineral medium, mainly under non-aerated conditions, supplemented with glucose in the presence of different concentrations of sodium acetate at pH 7.0 and at different values of acid pH and a constant concentration of sodium acetate (2 g/l). Results revealed an increase in the specific growth rate, cell mass formation, and ethanol volumetric productivity at moderate concentrations of sodium acetate (2-10 g/l), in addition to a high tolerance to acetate because it was able to grow and produce a high yield of ethanol in the presence of up to 40 g/l of sodium acetate. Genomic analysis of the ΔpflB evolved strain identified that a chromosomal deletion of 27.3 kb generates the improved growth and acetate tolerance in MG1655 ΔpflB derivative strains. This deletion comprises genes related to the respiration of nitrate, repair of alkylated DNA and synthesis of the ompC gene coding for porin C, cytochromes C, thiamine, and colonic acid. Strain MS04 is advantageous for the production of ethanol from hemicellulosic hydrolysates that contain acetate. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

AB  - Aldol condensations between sugar-derived dehydrated aldehydes (e.g. furfural) and acetone have been proposed as a route to provide useful biomass-derived chemicals. In the quest of sustainable catalytic ways for such aldol condensations, this paper assesses the use of dried chitosan-gels as naturally-immobilized, readily available and non-hazardous amino-based organocatalysts. At room temperature chitosan dried gels are not suitable catalysts for the desired reaction. However, at higher temperatures (&gt;90 °C) reaction proceeds efficiently either in solvent-free systems (with addition of catalytic amounts of water) or in water. The set-up of closed reactor set-ups (thermoshakers or microwave reactions) proved highly beneficial for the reaction outcome. Furthermore, chitosan dried gels were successfully re-used for a number of cycles. An efficient catalyst drying method (either lyophilization or scCO2 drying) was crucial to achieve virtually full conversions in 4 h. After pertinent further process optimization, dried chitosan-gels may become very useful catalysts for their use in biomass-based reactions in biorefineries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable production of renewable energy is being hotly debated globally since it is increasingly understood that first generation biofuels, primarily produced from food crops and mostly oil seeds are limited in their ability to achieve targets for biofuel production, climate change mitigation and economic growth. These concerns have increased the interest in developing second generation biofuels produced from non-food feedstocks such as nonedible oils which potentially offer greatest opportunities in the longer term. A large variety of plants that produce non-edible oils can be considered for biodiesel production such as Madhuca Indica (Mahua),Jatropha curcas(Ratan Jyot), Pongamia pinnata (Karanja), Soapnut (Sapindus mukorossi) and Melia azadirachta (Neem) etc., are easily available in developing countries and are very economical comparable to edible oils. This review paper assesses and integrates about the different tree borne oilseeds, extraction of oil, biodiesel processing and effect of different parameters on production of biodiesel. If the developed process is scaled up to commercial levels then excellent business opportunity will be offered by the biodiesel and it could be a major step towards the creation of an eco-friendly transportation fuel that is relatively clean on combustion.

AB  - Methyl esters were synthesized from crude karanj oil (CKO) by single step esterification with methanol using sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) and phosphoric acid (H 3PO 4) as catalysts in a homogeneous batch process. H 3PO 4 was less active than H 2SO 4 during the process as it presented very low ester yields (&lt;20%) for the various molar ratios of fatty acid to alcohol studied. With H 2SO 4 as catalyst, the yield was as high as 89.8% at 65°C after 5h. The fatty acids profile of the oil (palmitic acid: ∼12%; stearic acid: ∼8%; oleic acid: ∼52% and linolenic acid of 17%) and the different reactivities of the acids were responsible for the observed differences in conversion to methyl esters. The findings attained with this study might contribute to the economic utilization of a non-edible feedstock. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A high-performance bioanode based on the composite of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-immobilized mediator and silk film (SF)-immobilized glucose oxidase (GOD) was developed for glucose/O 2 biofuel cell (BFC). Ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (Fc) was used as the mediator and covalently immobilized on the ethylenediamine (EDA)-functionalized CNTs (CNTs-EDA). GOD was cross-linked on the SF with glutaraldehyde (GA) as the cross-linking agent. The resulting electrode (CNTs-Fc/SF-GOD/glassy carbon (GC) electrode) exhibited good catalytic activity towards glucose oxidation and excellent stability. For the assembled glucose/O 2 BFC with the CNTs-Fc/SF-GOD/GC electrode as the bioanode and a commercial E-TEK Pt/C modified GC electrode as the cathode, the open circuit potential is 0.48V and the maximum power density of 50.70μWcm -2 can be achieved at 0.15V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The growing need to address current energy and environmental problems has sparked an interest in developing improved biological methods to produce liquid fuels from renewable sources.While microbial ethanol production is well established, higher-chain alcohols possess chemical properties that are more similar to gasoline. Unfortunately, these alcohols (except 1-butanol) are not produced efficiently in natural microorganisms, and thus economical production in industrial volumes remains a challenge. Synthetic biology, however, offers additional tools to engineer synthetic pathways in user-friendly hosts to help increase titers and productivity of these advanced biofuels. This review concentrates on recent developments in synthetic biology to produce higher-chain alcohols as viable renewable replacements for traditional fuel. © 2012 Lamsen and Atsumi.

AB  - Catalyses of electrode reactions by oxidoreductases or living electroactive bacteria are compared and recent advances reviewed. The relation between the biological and nevertheless inert nature of enzymes and the living machinery of electroactive microbes is discussed. The way these biocatalysts may be electrically contacted to anodes or cathodes is considered with a focus on their immobilization at electrodes and on the issue of time stability of these assemblies. Recent improvements in power output of biofuel cells are reviewed together with applications that have appeared in the literature. This account also reviews new approaches for combining enzymes and living microbes in bioelectrochemical systems such as reproducing microbial metabolisms with enzyme cascades and expressing oxidoreductases on genetically engineered microbes. Finally, the use of surface chemistry for studying the microbe-electrode interface and bioelectrodes with cell organelles, such as mitochondria, or with higher organisms, such as yeasts, are discussed. Some perspectives for future research to extend this field are offered as conclusions. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - The current energy crisis greatly affects worldwide economic development. Therefore, identifying for new energy resources is critically important. In this study, we introduce a potential biodiesel source: Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) larvae (CML), which are proliferative and can be fed with a variety of low cost materials, such as manure, wheat bran, rotted meat and decayed vegetation. The potential of C. megacephala (Fabricius) larvae oil (CMLO) for biodiesel applications was explored. Oil was extracted from the CML raised by feeding on restaurant garbage for five days. The oil content obtained from the dehydrated CML ranged from 24.40% to 26.29% since restaurant garbage varies in composition day to day. The acid value of the CMLO was tested to be 1.10. mg. KOH/g. Four factors were subsequently considered to optimize the transesterification of CMLO to biodiesel. The optimized conditions included a 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 1.6% KOH catalyst, a reaction temperature of 55 °C and a reaction time of 30. min. Under these conditions, the maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from CMLO was 87.71%. Finally, properties of the FAME were within the specifications of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards. Therefore, we concluded that C. megacephala (Fabricius) larvae represent a potential alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Production of 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) from glycerol hydrogenolysis was carried out in bio-ethanol solvent over small amount of Rh-promoted Cu/solid-base catalysts prepared via layered double hydroxide precursors. It was found that glycerol hydrogenolysis proceeded easily on Rh-Cu/solid-base catalysts than separated Rh and Cu/solid-base. The conversion of glycerol and selectivity to 1,2-PDO over Rh 0.02Cu 0.4/Mg 5.6Al 1.98O 8.57 reached 91.0% and 98.7%, respectively, at 2.0MPa H 2, 180°C. And this catalyst was stable in five consecutive hydrogenolysis tests in ethanol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Holistic evaluation via a life cycle based approach is critical for guiding the environmentally conscious development of emerging microalgal biofuel pathways. This study models the energy return on investment (EROI) and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for producing algal derived biodiesel and renewable diesel under different production pathways - consisting of a combination of algal cultivation, harvesting, extraction, and coproduct utilization scenarios. The results indicate that in the base-case scenario(s) the EROI for microalgae fuels range from 0.26 to 1.20 with GHG emissions ranging from 50 to 240 gCO2 equivalent/MJ-fuel depending on the choice of cultivation variables, coproduct utilization options, and processing technologies. In the improved scenario(s), algal fuels have an EROI ranging from 0.81 to 2.01 and GHG emissions ranging from 30 to 90 gCO2 eq./MJ-fuel. Furthermore, improved scenarios with favorable EROI and GHG emissions profile for microalgal biofuels are plagued with high technological uncertainty. This suggests that broad advances in algal technologies are required if algal fuels are to be competitive with other leading second generation and advanced biofuels. The choice of fuel conversion technology was found to have a comparatively small impact on overall life-cycle energy use and GHG emissions. Therefore, the choice of fuel product may be based on other criteria such as fuel storage stability and compatibility with transportation fuel infrastructure. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 926-936, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - A genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain displaying glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) with ice-nucleation protein (INP) as the anchoring motif was first constructed. The surface localization and functionality of the fusion protein containing GDH were verified by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and enzymatic activity assay. The fusion of INP had no effects on the functionality of GDH cofactor binding domain. The activity assay showed that 74.6% of the cell lysate GDH activity was detected in the outer membrane fractions. Compared with the crude enzyme solution from E. coli expressing intracellular GDH, the GDH-displaying bacteria (GDH-bacteria) was stable within pH 6-10 below 40 °C. Further, a novel electrochemical glucose biosensor was developed by construction of Nafion/GDH-bacteria/multiwalled-carbon-nanotube modified electrode. The as-prepared biosensor is linear with the concentration of d-glucose within the range of 50-800 μM and a low detection limit of 4 μM d-glucose (S/N=3). Excess saccharides including d-galactose, d-fructose, d-cellbiose, l-arabinose and d-sucrose, d-maltose, d-mannose and d-xylose as well as common interfering substances (acetaminophen, ascorbic acid and uric acid) did not affect the detection of d-glucose (0.1. mM). The proposed biosensor is stable, specific, reproducible, simple, rapid and cost-effective, which can be used for detection of real samples. It is envisioned that this GDH-bacteria will be found promising applications in biofuel cell, glucose detection and cofactor reproduction system. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The daunting energy challenges in the 21st century are a result of over-reliance on limited fossil fuels coupled with ever-increasing energy demand. Among the solutions is the development of technologies and infrastructures to help in the smooth transition to alternative and renewable energy sources. Nanotechnology, a combination of chemistry and engineering, is viewed as the new candidate for clean energy applications. It involves the manipulation of nanoscale structures to integrate them into larger material components and systems. In comparison to bulk materials, nanomaterials have high surface areas and are expected to exhibit higher activities. They also demonstrate better stability and durability and are more cost-effective with high recycling potential. This paper reviews selected recent advances in the development of nanotechnology in the emerging solar energy and biofuel fields. Special emphases are given to studies on photovoltaics (including Schottky junction solar cells, organic solar cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, and earth-abundant Cu2ZnSnS4 materials) and artificial photosynthesis. As for the biofuel section, a review on the use of nanotechnology in transesterification, gasification, pyrolysis, and hydrogenation, as well as in the reforming of biomass-derived compounds is given. As these technologies become more mature, efficient, and economical, they could eventually replace traditional fossil fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study has investigated the observed product distribution as a function of temperature and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) from the continuous hydrotreatment of pyrolysis bio-oil in a packed-bed catalytic reactor using a Pd/C catalyst. Our results show that, at a constant overall LHSV value, the time required to achieve a steady state formation rate varies widely among the various species in the raw bio-oil and hydrotreated product. Due to the complexity of bio-oil composition, LHSV is not an accurate parameter to evaluate the residence time of various species in a continuous catalytic reactor. The holdup of heavy species in the catalyst must have occupied some active sites while the heavy compounds were slowly hydrogenated. This caused the active sites to be unavailable for other reactions during the continuous hydrotreatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel, as an alternative and renewable fuel, has been studied and developed in recent years. In the present paper, a continuous enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel pilot plant using waste cooking oil, with production capacity of 6482 ton/yr, was simulated by Aspen Plus. Detailed operating conditions and equipment designs were obtained. Five reactions were applied to represent the transesterification of the biodiesel production. The simulation results were in good agreement with the real data. Based on the simulation of the original process, five optimization processes, were proposed focusing on energy saving and methanol recovery. Pinch technology was also used to develop heat exchange networks. Throughout the different optimizations, the quality of biodiesel was still kept at a high purity (>98.5%). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethyl valerate (EV) as a promising fuel additive was produced by esterification of valeric acid with ethanol over Brønsted acidic amino acid ionic liquids. Hammett method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were preformed to evaluate the acidities of the catalysts. The composition of catalyst, reaction temperature, reaction time, molar ratio of reactants, amount of catalyst, and recycling ability of the catalyst were investigated. Proline bisulfate (ProHSO4) ionic liquid has the highest catalytic activity and the best recyclability under the optimized esterification conditions. A high conversion of valeric acid (&gt;99.9%) was obtained for 7 h at 80 °C, with 100% selectivity of EV. The density, viscosity, melting point, boiling point, elemental analysis and heat of combustion of the EV product were measured. The density of EV is 0.896 g cm -3. The viscosity of EV was 1.7 cP at room temperature. The heating values of EV are 4158.1 kJ mol-1 and 31.9 kJ g-1. EV obtained from esterification has higher energy density than methanol, ethanol, γ-valerolactone, and valeric acid, which illustrates that EV is a promising biofuel candidate. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The objective of this study is to conduct a comparative life cycle assessment of eight hydrogen production scenarios. The analysis enables a comparison of the sustainability performance of H2 production alternatives, as well as the identification of the key elements of each option. The scenarios investigated are based on (1) fossil CH4 reforming processes, namely steam reforming, partial oxidation and auto-thermal reforming; (2) biological CH4 reforming, i.e., steam CH4 reforming, partial oxidation and auto-thermal reforming; and (3) bioethanol-to-hydrogen systems, namely steam reforming and auto-thermal reforming. The assessment is carried out with the SimaPro 7.1 program. Both CML baseline 2000 and Eco-indicator 99 are used as life cycle impact assessment methods. The results indicate that the biomethane reforming systems have the lowest impact of all of the systems. The fossil CH4 reforming scenarios produce the highest emissions of global warming gas and have the greatest contribution to the abiotic depletion potential impact. Although wheat-derived bioethanol is considered to be a biofuel, bioethanol-to-hydrogen production systems have a higher impact than fossil CH4 on acidification, eutrophication, ozone layer depletion and toxicological impacts. This research provides regulators and policy makers with a basis upon which to guide further research and development in the H2 sector.

AB  - The use of inexpensive vegetable oils as feedstock for biodiesel production is an effective way to reduce biodiesel costs. Here we report production and properties of biodiesel produced from Amygdalus pedunculata which is widespread in arid area in China. Biodiesel produced from A. pedunculata conformed EN 14214, ASTM D6751, and GB/T20828 standards, except for those cetane number and oxidative stability. Cold flow and transportation safety properties were excellent (cold filter plugging point -11. °C, flash point 169. °C). Additives and antioxidants would be required to meet cetane number and oxidative stability specifications. The addition of 500. ppm tert-butylhydroquinone resulted in a higher induction period (6.7. h), bringing oxidative stability into compliance with all three biodiesel standards. © 2012.

AB  - When making biodiesel, slow separation of glycerol; the main by-product of the transesterification reaction, could lead to longer operating times, bigger equipment and larger amount of steel and consequently increased production cost. Therefore, acceleration of glycerol/biodiesel decantation could play an important role in the overall biodiesel refinery process. In this work, NaCl-assisted gravitational settling was considered as an economizing strategy. The results obtained indicated that the addition of conventional NaCl salt decreased the glycerol settling time significantly up to more than five times. However, NaCl inclusion rates of more than 3. g to the mixture (i.e. 5 and 10. g) resulted in significantly less methyl ester purity due to the occurrence of miniemulsion phenomenon. Overall, addition of 1. g NaCl/100. ml glycerol-biodiesel mixture was found as optimal by accelerating the decantation process by 100% while maintaining the methyl ester purity as high as the control (0. g NaCl). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several homogeneous acid catalysts (nitric, sulfuric, and hydrochloric acids), were selected to investigate their recoverability and reusability for esterifying enzyme-hydrolyzed FFAs and methanol to produce biodiesel. Although all of the three catalysts drove the reaction at high yield, hydrochloric acid is the only recoverable and reusable catalyst, as indicated by partitioning data. Hence, esterifying FFAs and methanol was catalyzed using hydrochloric acid; and the reaction conversion, which was affected by the reaction conditions, was optimized using response surface methodology. A maximal reaction conversion of 98.19% was obtained at 76.67. °C, at a methanol/FFAs molar ratio of 7.92, a catalyst concentration of 0.54. M, and after a reaction time of 103.57. min. The catalyst could be reused at least five times to drive the reaction to a conversion of 97%. This study demonstrated that recoverable and reusable hydrochloric acid is promising for potential applications, including biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials generates a liquid stream rich in pentose sugar oligomers. Cost-effective hydrolysis and utilization of these soluble sugar oligomers is an integral process of biofuel production. We report integrated rate equations for hydrolysis of xylo-oligomers derived from pretreated hardwood by dicarboxylic maleic and oxalic acids. The highest xylose yield observed with dicarboxylic acids was 96%, and compared to sulfuric acid, was 5-15% higher with less xylose degradation. Dicarboxylic acids showed an inverse correlation between xylose degradation rates and acid loadings unlike sulfuric acid for which less acid results in less xylose degradation to aldehydes and humic substances. A combination of high acid and low-temperature leads to xylose yield improvement. Hydrolysis time course data at three different acid concentrations and three temperatures between 140 and 180°C were used to develop a reaction model for the hydrolysis of xylo-oligosaccharides to xylose by dicarboxylic acids. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Novel heterogeneous catalysts from calcium oxide (CaO)/calcined calcium carbonate (CaCO3) loaded onto different palm oil mill boiler ashes were synthesised and used in the transesterification of crude palm oil (CPO) with methanol to yield biodiesel. Catalyst preparation parameters including the type of ash support, the weight percentage of CaO and calcined CaCO3 loadings, as well as the calcination temperature of CaCO3 were optimised. The catalyst prepared by loading of 15wt% calcined CaCO3 at a fixed temperature of 800°C on fly ash exhibited a maximum oil conversion of 94.48%. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the CaCO3 was transformed into CaO at 770°C and interacted well with the ash support, whereas rich CaO, Al2O3 and SiO2 were identified in the composition using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The fine morphology size (&lt;5μm) and high surface area (1.719m2/g) of the fly ash-based catalyst rendered it the highest catalytic activity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - [NiFe]-hydrogenases are fascinating biological catalysts with potential application in biofuel cells. However, a severe problem in practical application is the strong sensitivity of hydrogenase to gaseous inhibitor molecules such as CO and O 2. Recently, a number of successful protein engineering studies have been reported that aimed at lowering the access of diatomic inhibitors to the active site pocket, but the molecular mechanism conferring increased resistance remained unclear. Here we use a multiscale simulation approach combining molecular dynamics with a master equation formalism to explain the steady drop in CO diffusion rate observed for the mutants V74M L122A, V74M L122M, and V74M of Desulfovibrio fructosovorans [NiFe]-hydrogenase. We find that diffusion in these variants is controlled by two gates, one between residues 74 and 476 and the other between residues 74 and 122. The existence of two control points in different locations explains why the reduction in the experimental diffusion rate does not simply correlate with the width of the main gas channel. We also find that in the more effective mutation (V74M) CO molecules are still able to reach the active site through transitions that are gated by the microsecond dihedral motions of the side chain of R476 and the thermal fluctuations of the width of the gas channel defined by M74 and L122. Reflecting on the molecular information gained from simulation, we discuss future mutation experiments that could further lower the diffusion rates of small ligands inhibiting [NiFe]-hydrogenase.

AB  - Microbial lipids are potential alternative feedstock for biofuel and oleochemical industries. The oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides AS 2.1389 is an excellent lipid producer. To attain parameters for the understanding of the lipid production process, we performed continuous cultivation experiments under either carbon or nitrogen limitation. The maintenance coefficient and maximum cell mass yield for this yeast were determined as 5.7mg glucose/g cell/h and 0.42g cell/g glucose, respectively, under carbon limitation. Under nitrogen limitation, the highest lipid yield of 0.19g/g was observed at the dilution rate of 0.02h-1 while the highest specific lipid formation rate of 0.058g/g cell/h at the dilution rate of 0.08h-1. A kinetic model of lipid formation under steady state conditions was developed, parameters estimated, and optimal continuous cultivation conditions forecasted. These data should be very helpful to develop and design more efficient bioprocesses for microbial lipid production. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Olive milling produces huge amounts of wastewater (OMWW) characterized by an extremely high organic load. Its polyphenols content is a hindrance to conventional biological treatment and to using it as growing medium for common microbial biomasses. The practice to dump it on soil is in conflict with the latest EU directives about waste management.OMWW can be effectively and efficiently treated by means of membrane technology to a fraction of the initial volume, but membrane processing concentrates still require treatment. Reversing the overall cost balance of membrane processing and subsequent treatment requires valorizing the concentrates through their reuse, as well as ensuring long-term service of the membrane system through effective wastewater pretreatment and sustainable, fouling-controlling, membrane operation conduite.Aim of this work is to reuse and valorize the ultra- and nanofiltration membrane concentrates as media for biomass production of microalgae and cyanobacteria. Scenedesmus dimorphus and Arthrospira platensis, usable as a food, feed, nutraceutical component or feedstock for biofuels, were selected for this investigation. Microalgal growth was experimentally determined and related to the composition of the concentrate-based media and to the irradiance distribution within the photobioreactor volume to decouple light limitation and medium chemical composition effects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes the synthesis of a rubber seed supply network to support the green energy demand in Malaysia. An optimised rubber seed supply network design, which maximises biomass utilisation, secures local biomass supply as well as reduces material loss and emissions resulted from inefficient logistic activities has been carried out. The utilisation of rubber seed oil (RSO) for biofuel production in Malaysia and its contribution to the national biomass renewable energy portion is forecasted. The supply network of the biomass is synthesised through mixed integer linear programming. Both centralised and de-centralised rubber seed processing facilities are studied. The network model shows that the selection of rubber seed processing plant is highly dependant on the volume of feedstock. A simplified real case study is presented to demonstrate the optimisation model. In addition, biodiesel price is largely dependent on the feedstock market. Thus, comparison of crude palm oil (CPO) and RSO production processes have been made in term of (i) energy and utility consumptions, (ii) feedstock price and (iii) environmental impact. Sensitivity analysis of rubber seed oil price for obtaining optimal blending ratio of rubber seed oil and crude palm oil has been performed in order to determine the market uncertainty of the biodiesel price. The potential of substituting rubber seed oil for crude palm oil as an alternative blending feedstock for biodiesel production has been validated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although upgrading bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of biomass is an attractive pathway for biofuel production, nitrogen (N) and mineral matter carried over from the feedstock to the bio-oil represents a serious contaminant in the process. Reducing the N and ash content of biomass feedstocks would improve process reliability and reduce production costs of pyrolytic biofuels. This study investigated: (1) How does switchgrass harvest date influence the yield, N concentration ([N]), and ash concentration of biomass and fast pyrolysis products? and (2) Is there a predictive relationship between [N] of switchgrass biomass and [N] of fast pyrolysis products? Switchgrass from five harvest dates and varying [N] from central Iowa were pyrolyzed using a free-fall reactor. Harvestable biomass peaked in August (8. 6 Mg ha-1), dropping significantly by November (6. 7 Mg ha-1, P = 0. 0027). Production of bio-oil per unit area mirrored that of harvested biomass at each harvest date; however, bio-oil yield per unit dry biomass increased from 46. 6 % to 56. 7 % during the season (P = 0. 0018). Allowing switchgrass to senesce lowered biomass [N] dramatically, by as much as 68 % from June to November (P &lt; 0. 0001). Concurrently, bio-oil [N] declined from 0. 51 % in June to 0. 17 % by November (P &lt; 0. 0001). Significant reductions in ash concentration were also observed in biomass and char. Finally, we show for the first time that the [N] of switchgrass biomass is a strong predictor of the [N] of bio-oil, char, and non-condensable gas with R2 values of 0. 89, 0. 94, and 0. 88, respectively. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - We examined the chemical composition and properties of several diesel fuels and blendstocks derived from Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, hydroisomerization of lipids, and fermentation of sugar via the terpenoid metabolic pathway. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic analysis with nonpolar and polar columns, 13C NMR, GC-MS, and elemental analysis were used to assess fuel chemistry. Performance properties included density, heat of combustion, cetane number, and cloud point, as well as other properties. The fuels consisted almost entirely of normal and iso-paraffins. Three samples contained residual oxygen below 0.1 mass %. All of the renewable and synthetic diesel fuels have significantly lower density than is typical for a petroleum-derived diesel fuel. As a result, they have slightly higher net heat of combustion on a mass basis (2%-3% higher), but lower heat of combustion on a volume basis (3%-7% lower). Two critical diesel performance properties, cetane number and cloud point, were correlated with iso-paraffin content and chain length. The results confirm that properties of hydroisomerized fats and oils, as well as FT diesel, can be tuned by increasing the degree of isomerization to lower cloud point which also lowers the cetane number. In spite of this trade-off between cloud point, and cetane number, the cetane numbers were still over 70 for fuels with cloud points as low as -27 C. The terpenoid biofuel exhibited a cloud point below -70 C and a cetane number of 58. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Green and efficient production of biodiesel (FAME) from waste grease containing high amount of free fatty acid (FFA) was achieved by using novel magnetic nanobiocatalyst aggregates (MNA). Thermomyces lanuginosus Lipase (TLL) and Candida antartica Lipase B (CALB) were covalently immobilized on core-shell structured iron oxide magnetic nanoparticle (80. nm), respectively, followed by freeze-dry to give MNA (13-17. μm) with high yield (80-89%) and high enzyme loading (61. mg TLL or 22. mg CALB per gram MNA). MNA TL showed the best performance among immobilized enzymes known thus for the production of FAME from grease (17. wt.% FFA) with methanol, giving 99% yield in 12. h (3.3. wt.% catalyst). MNA TL was easily separated under magnetic field and reused, retaining 88% productivity in 11th cycle. MNA CA converted >97% FFA in grease (17. wt.% FFA) to FAME in 12. h (0.45. wt.% catalyst), being useful in two-step transformation of grease to biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The liquid phase esterification of butyric acid with a series of linear and branched alcohols is examined. Four strong cation exchange resins, Amberlyst™ 15, Amberlyst™ 36, Amberlyst™ BD 20, and Amberlyst™ 70, were used along with para-toluenesulfonic acid as a homogeneous catalyst. The effect of increasing alcohol carbon chain length and branching on esterification rate at 60. °C is presented. For all catalysts, the decrease in turnover frequency (TOF) with increasing carbon chain length of the alcohol is described in terms of steric hindrance, alcohol polarity, and hydroxyl group concentration. The kinetics of butyric acid esterification with 2-ethylhexanol using Amberlyst™ 70 catalyst is described with an activity-based, pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model that includes autocatalysis by butyric acid. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new catalyst composed of Pd nanoparticles supported on MgO has been prepared by the room temperature NaBH4 reduction of Na 2PdCl4 in methanol in the presence of the support. TEM measurements reveal well-dispersed Pd particles of mean diameter 1.7 nm attached to the MgO surface. Further characterization was achieved by ICP-AES, XPS, XRD, H2 pulse chemisorption and H2-TPR. The new catalyst is efficient for the regioselective hydrogenation of the heterocyclic ring of quinolines, as well as for the mild reduction of a variety of alkenes representative of fuel components, and the partial saturation of biodiesel. The new material is considerably more reactive than commercial Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts under analogous reaction conditions. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the microwave-assisted direct liquefaction of Sargassum polycystum C. Agardh in ethylene glycol (EG) with H2SO4 as a catalyst. Based on the results of single factor experiments, EG-to-feedstock ratio, temperature and catalyst content were chosen as independent variables for a central composite rotatable design (CCRD). The optimal liquefaction conditions were estimated as: the EG-to-feedstock ratio of 18.50:1 (w/w), the temperature of 170°C, the reaction time of 15min, catalyst content of 9.6% (catalyst/EG, w/w%) and microwave power of 400W with the liquefaction yield of 87.70%. The bio-oils were mainly composed of fatty acid methyl ester and alkane with a long chain from C17 to C20. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel synthesis from rice bran fatty acids (RBFA) was carried out using cesium exchanged 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) catalysts. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of NH 3 and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characterization techniques revealed that the Keggin structure of TPA remained intact as Cs replaced protons. The partial exchange of Cs for protons resulted in an increase in acidity and the catalysts with one Cs + (Cs 1H 2PW 12O 40) showed highest acidity. Under optimized conditions about 92% conversion of RBFA was obtained. The catalyst was reused for five times and retained of its original activity. Pseudo-first order model was applied to correlate the experimental kinetic data. Modified tungstophosphoric acids are efficient solid acid catalysts for the synthesis of biodiesel from the oils containing high FFA. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pretreatment is the first step to open up lignocellulose structure in the conversion of biomass to biofuels. Extrusion can be a viable pretreatment method due to its ability to simultaneously expose biomass to a range of disruptive conditions in a continuous flow process. Extruder screw speed, barrel temperature, and feedstock moisture content are important factors that can influence sugar recovery from biomass. Hence, the current study was undertaken to investigate the effects of these parameters on extrusion pretreatment of pine wood chips. Pine wood chip at 25, 35, and 45 % wb moisture content were pretreated at various barrel temperatures (100, 140, and 180°C) and screw speeds (100, 150, and 200 rpm) using a screw with compression ratios of 3:1. The pretreated pine wood chips were subjected to standard enzymatic hydrolysis followed by sugar and byproducts quantification. Statistical analyses revealed the existence of significant differences in sugar recovery due to independent variables based on comparing the mean of main effects and interaction effects. Pine wood chips pretreated at a screw speed of 150 rpm and a barrel temperature of 180°C with a moisture content of 25 % resulted in a maximum cellulose, hemicellulose, and total sugar recoveries of 65.8, 65.6, and 66.1 %, respectively, which was about 6.7, 7.9, and 6.8 fold higher than the control (unpretreated pine chips). Furthermore, potential fermentation inhibitors such as furfural, hydroxyl methyl furfural, and acetic acid were not found in any of the treatment combinations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural, two of the most important intermediates derived from biomass, were directly produced from the hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) with metal ions in ionic liquids as catalyst under mild conditions. Various ionic liquids were tested to obtain the most efficient catalyst, 1-(4-sulfonic acid) butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (IL-1) showed the highest catalytic activity than others, and SO 3H-functionalized ionic liquids exhibited better activity than non-functionalized ILs. The co-catalysis effect of Cr 3+, Mn 2+, Fe 3+, Fe 2+, Co 2+ were much better than other metal ions, with a catalytic amount of these metal ions, MCC conversion increased by 10-19%, and the selectivities of products were also improved obviously. The promoting catalysis of metal nitrates were not as expected as that of chlorides and sulfates, we suggested that nitrate anion may have a negative effect on the hydrolysis of MCC. Reaction conditions were optimized and reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the improved catalysis of metal chlorides and sulfates. Also, the recycling of catalyst was put forward in our system for MCC hydrolysis and these catalysts maintained good performances even after five runs. This simple and effective catalytic system may be valuable to facilitate energy-efficient conversion of cellulose into biofuels and platform chemicals. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts with different Ni loadings were prepared by impregnation method, and their catalytic performance was evaluated in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) upgrading of the model reactant methyl hexadecanoate (MHD) to liquid alkane fuels. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, NH 3-TPD, and BET. Ni loadings were obviously influenced by the acidity, and thus significantly affected their catalytic performance. Over 7 wt.% Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst, MHD conversion of more than 90% and total liquid C 5-C 16 hydrocarbon selectivity of 83% were obtained under the optimum reaction condition, possibly due to the synergistic effect of metal Ni and acid HZSM-5. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ultimate and proximate analyses and thermal degradation of bio-oils from pinewood and palm empty fruit bunches (PEFB) were carried out to evaluate the oils' potential for production of fuels for transport, heat and power generation, and of hydrogen via the calculation of performance indicators. The pinewood and PEFB oils indicated good theoretical hydrogen yields of 13.7 and 15.9wt.% via steam reforming, but their hydrogen to carbon effective ratios were close to zero, and their propensity for fouling and slagging heat exchanger surfaces via combustion was high. Both oils exhibited two phases during mass loss under nitrogen flow at heating rates of 3-9Kmin -1, but the kinetics of their thermal degradation from TGA-FTIR analysis indicated different degradation mechanisms that were well reproduced by a nth order reaction model for pinewood and Jander's 3D-diffusion model for PEFB. These findings lead to recommendations on pretreatments prior to the oils' utilisation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study demonstrates a new electrochemical method for continuous neurochemical sensing with a biofuel cell-based self-powered biogenerator as the detector for the analysis of microdialysate continuously sampled from rat brain, with glucose as an example analyte. To assemble a glucose/O2 biofuel cell that can be used as a self-powered biogenerator for glucose sensing, glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was used as the bioanodic catalyst for the oxidation of glucose with methylene green (MG) adsorbed onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as the electrocatalyst for the oxidation of dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Laccase crosslinked onto SWNTs was used as the biocathodic catalyst for the O2 reduction. To enable the bioanode and biocathode to work efficiently in their individually favorable solutions and to eliminate the interference between the glucose bioanode and O2 biocathode, the biofuel cell-based biogenerator was built in a co-laminar microfluidic chip so that the bioanodic and biocathodic streams could be independently optimized to provide conditions favorable for each of the bioelectrodes. By using a home-made portable voltmeter to output the voltage generated on an external resistor, the biogenerator was used for glucose sensing based on a galvanic cell mechanism. In vitro experiments demonstrate that, under the optimized conditions, the voltage generated on an external resistor shows a linear relationship with the logarithmic glucose concentration within a concentration range of 0.2 mM to 1.0 mM. Moreover, the biogenerator exhibits a high stability and a good selectivity for glucose sensing. The validity of the biofuel cell-based self-powered biogenerator for continuous neurochemical sensing was illustrated by online continuous monitoring of striatum glucose in rat brain through the combination of in vivo microdialysis. This study offers a new and technically simple platform for continuously monitoring physiologically important species in cerebral systems. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - After initial testing and optimization of anode biocatalysts, a membraneless glucose/oxygen enzymatic biofuel cell possessing high coulombic efficiency and power output was fabricated and characterized. Two sugar oxidizing enzymes, namely, pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus meleagris (AmPDH) and flavodehydrogenase domains of various cellobiose dehydrogenases (DHCDH) were tested during the pre-screening. The enzymes were mixed, "wired" and entrapped in a low-potential Os-complex-modified redox-polymer hydrogel immobilized on graphite. This anode was used in combination with a cathode based on bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria adsorbed on graphite. Optimization showed that the current density for the mixed enzyme electrode could be further improved by using a genetically engineered variant of the non-glycosylated flavodehydrogenase domain of cellobiose dehydrogenase from Corynascus thermophilus expressed in E. coli (ngDHCtCDHC310Y) with a high glucose-turnover rate in combination with an Os-complex-modified redox polymer with a high concentration of Os complexes as well as a low-density graphite electrode. The optimized biofuel cell with the AmPDH/ngDHCtCDHC310Y anode showed not only a similar maximum voltage as with the biofuel cell based only on the ngDH CtCDHC310Y anode (0.55 V) but also a substantially improved maximum power output (20 μW cm-2) at 300 mV cell voltage in air-saturated physiological buffer. Most importantly, the estimated half-life of the mixed biofuel cell can reach up to 12 h, which is apparently longer than that of a biofuel cell in which the bioanode is based on only one single enzyme.

AB  - "Imaging" biomass conversion: pyrolysis is the first reaction involved in all thermal processes for biofuels and green chemicals production. Synchrotron light ionisation and mass spectrometry is used for the first time to investigate biomass pyrolysis. The soft and tunable ionisation source coupled with ab initio calculations reveals chemical mechanisms and new major intermediate species. This methodology could be extended to the thermal and catalytic conversion of all other materials. Primary volatile products are analysed online as a function of photon energy, biomass composition (cellulose, xylan, lignin), reactor temperature and time of conversion. Hydroxyacetaldehyde was detected at very minor yields for cellulose pyrolysis confirming that it is a secondary product. The effect of cellulose structure and ash content on primary tar formation was also studied. The mechanism of levoglucosan dissociative photoionisation is depicted. A new major intermediate product which could be a precursor of furanone-based species from cellulose is evidenced thanks to the soft ionisation and MSMS structural analysis of ions. Different lignin markers and evolutions upon time of conversion are shown for miscanthus and oak pyrolysis. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Long-term operation of the biomass-to-liquid (BTL) process was conducted with a focus on the production of bio-syngas that satisfies the purity standards for the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. The integrated BTL system consisted of a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) gasifier (20kWth), gas cleaning unit, syngas compression unit, acid gas removing unit, and an FT reactor. Since the raw syngas from the gasifier contains different types of contaminants, such as particulates, condensable tars, and acid gases, which can cause various mechanical problems or deactivate the FT catalyst, the syngas was purified by passing through cyclones, a gravitational dust collector, a two-stage wet scrubber (packing-type), and a methanol absorption tower. The integrated system was operated for 500h over several runs, and stable operating conditions for each component were achieved. The cleaned syngas contained no sulfur compounds (under 1ppmV) and satisfied the requirements for the FT process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fifty-one fungal isolates were screened for their biological pretreatment of bamboo culms (. Phyllostachys pubescence) by enzymatic saccharification. These fungi were isolated from the interior of decayed bamboo culms or from basidiomata on bamboo culms. The white rot basidiomycete Punctularia sp. TUFC20056 and an unidentified basidiomycete TUFC20057 showed high lignin degradation (>50%) and high lignin/holocellulose loss ratios (>6) after 12 weeks of treatment. Other Punctularia sp. strains also showed high lignin/holocellulose ratios (>4). In residual component of Punctularia sp. TUFC20056-treated bamboo, glucose and total sugar were increased (42.9 ± 10.9 and 60.3 ± 16.1%, respectively). Pretreatment of bamboo culms with Punctularia sp. TUFC20056 improved the effect of enzymatic hydrolysis. Total reducing sugar yields reached 10.1 ± 1.2% with 1 month of treatment, and higher than that of two famous white rot fungi. Punctularia sp. TUFC20056 may be suitable for the biological pretreatment of bamboo for bioethanol production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hybrid catalytic membranes consisting of cation ion-exchange resin particles (CERP) and polyethersulfone (PES) were prepared by immersion phase inversion and used as heterogeneous catalysts for the esterification of acidified oil with methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. The membranes were characterized by ion exchange capacity and swelling degree tests. The membranes were annealed at different temperatures to improve catalytic activity and membranes annealed at 393. K had the highest catalytic activity. Butanol allowed the highest free fatty acids (FFAs) conversion of 95.28% since it has better miscibility than the other alcohols which strengthened mass and heat transfer. Furthermore, pseudo-homogeneous kinetic models of the esterification of acidified oil with the four alcohols were established according to the experimental data. The kinetic models can well predict the FFA conversion. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermophilic cellulases and hemicellulases are of significant interest to the biofuel industry due to their perceived advantages over their mesophilic counterparts. We describe here biochemical and mutational analyses of Caldicellulosiruptor bescii Cel9B/ Man5A (CbCel9B/Man5A), a highly thermophilic enzyme. As one of the highly secreted proteins of C. bescii, the enzyme is likely to be critical to nutrient acquisition by the bacterium. CbCel9B/Man5A is a modular protein composed of three carbohydratebinding modules flanked at the N terminus and the C terminus by a glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) module and a GH5 module, respectively. Based on truncational analysis of the polypeptide, the cellulase and mannanase activities within CbCel9B/ Man5A were assigned to the N- and C-terminal modules, respectively. CbCel9B/Man5A and its truncational mutants, in general, exhibited a pH optimum of~5.5 and a temperature optimum of 85°C. However, at this temperature, thermostability was very low. After 24 h of incubation at 75°C, the wild-type protein maintained 43% activity, whereas a truncated mutant, TM1, maintained 75% activity. The catalytic efficiency with phosphoric acid swollen cellulose as a substrate for the wild-type protein was 7.2 s-1 ml/mg, and deleting the GH5 module led to a mutant (TM1) with a 2-fold increase in this kinetic parameter. Deletion of the GH9 module also increased the apparent kcat of the truncated mutant TM5 on several mannan-based substrates; however, a concomitant increase in the Km led to a decrease in the catalytic efficiencies on all substrates. These observations lead us to postulate that the two catalytic activities are coupled in the polypeptide. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Conditions for optimal pretreatment of eucalypt (Eucalyptus dunnii) and spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora) forestry thinning residues for bioethanol production were empirically determined using a 3 3 factorial design. Up to 161mg/g xylose (93% theoretical) was achieved at moderate combined severity factors (CSF) of 1.0-1.6. At CSF&gt;2.0, xylose levels declined, owing to degradation. Moreover at high CSF, depolymerisation of cellulose was evident and corresponded to glucose (155mg/g, ∼33% cellulose) recovery in prehydrolysate. Likewise, efficient saccharification with Cellic® CTec 2 cellulase correlated well with increasing process severity. The best condition yielded 74% of the theoretical conversion and was attained at the height of severity (CSF of 2.48). Saccharomyces cerevisiae efficiently fermented crude E. dunnii hydrolysate within 30h, yielding 18g/L ethanol, representing a glucose to ethanol conversion rate of 0.475g/g (92%). Based on our findings, eucalyptus forest thinnings represent a potential feedstock option for the emerging Australian biofuel industry. © 2012.

AB  - Low-temperature gasification of biomass is a primary process step for production of biofuels or electricity using gas-fired engines or turbines. In addition to the desired product gas, the raw gas produced through gasification inevitably contains condensable hydrocarbons, known collectively as tar. The amount and composition of the tar have relevance for the efficiencies of the downstream processes. Tar can be measured using both online and off-line methods. However, many of these methods currently lack information regarding their implementation and accuracy levels for large-scale systems. In this work, the Solid-Phase Adsorption (SPA) method for measuring tar in industrial applications is evaluated. The individual steps of the method were examined for their effects on the overall performance of the analysis. Sample collection was found to be the most prominent source of error, and this was mainly due to human factors. Omitting to determine the temperature and pressure of the sampled gas contributed to this error, as the sampled volume of gas under normal conditions could not be correctly calculated. Inconsistencies in the treatment and storage of the collected samples were shown to affect the more volatile species with boiling points similar to that of benzene. The gas chromatography (GC) analysis was performed with satisfying accuracy. However, the reliability of the estimations of the average composition and dew-point of the tar mixture were dependent upon the amount of the identified species. The current implementation of the SPA method yields values with a relative standard deviation within 10% for the majority of the compounds in a given sample. However, in line with the result of previous studies, the tar species with boiling points between those of benzene and xylene (i.e., the BTX compounds) were measured with a lower accuracy than those of heavier tars. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Novel, hierarchical, micro- (&lt;2 nm), meso-/small macro- (50-60 nm), and large macro- (2-5 μm) trimodal porous functional carbon monoliths with flexible pore widths and wall textures are fabricated hydrothermally via a one-pot, dual block copolymer-latex templating approach. The trimodal carbon monoliths exhibit a coral-like nanoarchitecture, consisting of a 3D continuous carbon branch network, in which an inverse opal-type nanostructure with ordered pore wall texture is embedded, possessing high surface area (e.g., &gt;800 m2 g-1), large pore volume, and highly layered porosities. The coadded block copolymer plays a triple role in the formation of the porous nanoarchitectures during hydrothermal synthesis: (1) in the formation of inverse opal pores by latex destabilization, (2) in the formation of an ordered microporous carbon wall texture by soft templating effect, and (3) in the formation of a micrometer-sized 3D continuous void by controlling the degree of spinodal phase separation. All the above nanostructuring chemistries are controllable via a simple variation in hydrothermal treatment temperature and reagent/template ratios offering nanostructural flexibility at multiple length scales, while the mild synthesis temperatures provide useful surface functionalities. The resulting materials are promising candidates for applications including (bio)electrochemistry (e.g., biofuel cells) or as biological scaffolds or separation media. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ferula orientalis L. stalks were liquefied in an autoclave in supercritical organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, acetone and 2-butanol) with (NaOH, Na2CO3, ZnCl2) and without catalyst at five different temperatures ranging from 240 C to 320 C. The amounts of solid (unconverted raw material), liquid (bio-oil) and gas produced, as well as the composition of the resulting liquid phase, were determined. The effects of various parameters such as temperature, solvent, catalyst and ratio of catalyst on product yields were investigated. The results showed that conversion highly depends on the temperature and catalyst. The highest bio-oil yield (53.97%) was obtained using acetone with 10% zinc chloride at 300 C. The liquid products were extracted with benzene and diethyl ether. Some of selected liquid products (bio-oils) were analyzed by elemental, FT-IR and GC-MS. 126 different compounds were identified by GC-MS in the liquid products obtained in ethanol at 300 C. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research on renewable fuels has to assess possible adverse health and ecological risks as well as conflicts with global food supply. This investigation compares the two newly developed biogenic diesel fuels hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and jatropha methyl ester (JME) with fossil diesel fuel (DF) and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) for their emissions and bacterial mutagenic effects. Samples of exhaust constituents were compared after combustion in a Euro III heavy duty diesel engine. Regulated emissions were analyzed as well as particle size and number distributions, carbonyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and bacterial mutagenicity of the exhausts. Combustion of RME and JME resulted in lower particulate matter (PM) compared to DF and HVO. Particle numbers were about 1 order of magnitude lower for RME and JME. However, nitrogen oxides (NOX) of RME and JME exceeded the Euro III limit value of 5.0 g/kWh, while HVO combustion produced the smallest amount of NOX. RME produced the lowest emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) followed by JME. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and several other carbonyls were found in the emissions of all investigated fuels. PAH emissions and mutagenicity of the exhausts were generally low, with HVO revealing the smallest number of mutations and lowest PAH emissions. Each fuel showed certain advantages or disadvantages. As proven before, both biodiesel fuels produced increased NOX emissions compared to DF. HVO showed significant toxicological advantages over all other fuels. Since jatropha oil is nonedible and grows in arid regions, JME may help to avoid conflicts with the food supply worldwide. Hydrogenated jatropha oil should now be investigated if it combines the benefits of both new fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biorefinery approach is introduced for the biodiesel production by utilizing low cost raw material, such as rice bran oil (RBO). The valorization of RBO was carried out by homogeneous transesterification process using response surface methodology (RSM) based on a two-variable central composition design (CCD). The process variables, temperature and catalyst concentration were found to have significant influence on biodiesel yield. The optimum combination derived via RSM for high ester yield (99.4%) was found to be 0.75% wt catalyst concentration at a reaction temperature of 45 °C. As biodiesel chemically is a long-chain alkyl methyl esters, its long-term fuel properties have become of great concern to the fuel industry. In order to determine the effects of long storage on oxidation stability, RBO biodiesel sample was stored for 24 months and the different physical-chemical properties were checked with respect to time. The results show that the acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), and viscosity (ν) increased while the iodine value (IV) decreased. Based on results, correlations were obtained in terms of AV, IV, PV and ν as a function of time. Those correlations can be used to predict how long time biodiesel can safely be stored. AV, IV and PV of the biodiesel sample which was stored were within the limits in European biodiesel specifications (EN 14214). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The second most abundant natural polymer, lignin, an under-valued co-product from the pulp and paper, and biofuel industry has a great potential to be utilized to engineer value-added, green products. Graft copolymerization of vinyl acetate (VAc) on lignin was performed using potassium persulfate as an initiator and ammonium iron (II) sulfate as a catalyst. Aqueous reaction medium is used for the preparation of graft copolymer as a cost effective and greener route. The effects of reaction conditions were studied to obtain optimal grafting percentage with very low homopolymer formation. The effects of various factors like temperature, initiator concentration, amount of monomers, and volume of catalyst found to have considerable effects on grafting efficiency. Highest grafting of 60% was observed for 1:1.5 ratio of lignin and vinyl acetate at 70°C in presence of 9.24×10-2mol/L initiator and 5.1×10-4mol/L of catalyst concentration. Graft copolymerization was identified from the new absorption peaks at wavelengths around 1720cm-1 and 1210cm-1 (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), and the new degradation peak observed at 339°C (thermogravimetric analysis). Reinforcing or blending of VAc-g-lignin with desirable polymers can yield value-added greener products. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A bioanode with high current density and coulombic efficiency was developed by co-immobilization of pyranose dehydrogenase from Agaricus meleagris (AmPDH) with the dehydrogenase domain of cellobiose dehydrogenase from Corynascus thermophiles (recDH. CtCDH) expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli. The two enzymes were entrapped in Os-complex modified electrodeposition polymers (Os-EDPs) with specifically adapted redox potential by means of chemical co-deposition. AmPDH oxidizes glucose at both the C2 and C3 positions whereas recDH. CtCDH oxidizes glucose only at the C1 position. Electrochemical measurements reveal that maximally 6 electrons can be harvested from one glucose molecule at the two-enzyme anode via a cascade reaction, as AmPDH oxidizes the products formed from of the recDH. CtCDH catalyzed substrate oxidation and vice versa. Furthermore, a significant increase in current density can be obtained by combining AmPDH and recDH. CtCDH in a single modified electrode. We propose the use of this bioanode in biofuel cells with increased current density and coulombic efficiency. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study reports the deactivation mechanisms of the solid acid catalyst Amberlyst 70 during the esterification of bio-oils from mallee biomass and the methods for catalyst regeneration. The metal ions in bio-oil deactivated Amberlyst 70 via ion exchange with the hydrogen ions on/in catalyst, which changed structure of catalysts and reduced availability of acidic sites. N-containing organics reacted with the hydrogen ions on/in catalyst, forming neutral salts and resulting in complete catalyst deactivation. Polymers formed during the esterification of bio-oils deposited on/in catalyst, reducing the accessibility of catalytic sites. Washing with solvents could remove some adsorbed organics and restore some catalytic activity but not much. In comparison, ion exchange in a concentrated sulfuric acid removes most of metal ions and the N-containing organics and significantly improves the catalytic activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An integrated process of catalytic composite membranes (CCMs) and sodium methoxide was developed to produce biodiesel from waste chicken fat. The free fatty acids (FFAs) in the chicken oil were converted to methyl esters by esterification with methanol using a novel sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES)/PES/non-woven fabric (NWF) CCMs in a flow-through catalytic membrane reactor. The CCM is that the NWF fibers were fully embedded in SPES/PES with a homogeneous and microporous structure. The oil obtained after esterification was carried out by transesterification of sodium methoxide. The results showed that the FFAs conversion obtained by CCMs with the acid capacity of 25.28mmol (H+) was 92.8% at the residence time 258s. The CCMs present a good stability during the continuous running of 500h. The conversion of transesterification was 98.1% under the optimum conditions. The quality of the biodiesel met the international standards. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Levoglucosan is the major anhydrosugar component of bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis. Previous research has shown that levoglucosan yield can be greatly increased if a mild acid pretreatment is applied to demineralize the feedstock prior to pyrolysis. The interest in levoglucosan production is that it provides a route to production of monomeric sugars, primarily glucose, which can be utilized to produce biochemically derived fuels (ethanol, butanol, etc.). This study developed a new method based on pyrolysis of clear pinewood particles with dilute acid pretreatment and modification in the pyrolysis process by applying a water spray injection directly into the pyrolysis vapor stream. This new method resulted in a significant 30.7% increase in levoglucosan weight percentage based on the bio-oil organic portion. The results indicated that this rapid quenching in pyrolysis vapor stream successfully suppressed the levoglucosan decomposition in both the vapor stream and during condensation. This increase may change the process economics of production of anhydrosugars via pyrolysis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glycerine is a chemical with a wide variety of uses. There are over 2000 known applications in cosmetics, foodstuffs, fine chemicals, and other industries. With the recent boom for liquid biofuels however, glycerine - which is a by-product mainly of biodiesel production - has become abundant. New uses for the chemical are being researched, but little attention has been paid to the production and supply of glycerine. This perspective shows that the development of liquid biofuels is a key point for the future glycerine market. Glycerine could become available in large volumes from the production not only of biodiesel but also bioethanol. Second-generation biofuels, cellulose-based bioethanol, and algal biodiesel will continue to produce large quantities of glycerine. However, new technology pathways such as glycerine-to-methanol and glycerine-to-ethanol could rapidly change the market situation. Instead of viewing glycerine as a waste, biofuel producers may come to view the by-product as a valuable resource for their own production processes. This could rapidly change the market situation for other industries which now rely on the glycerine supply from the biofuels industry. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A solid Ca/Al composite oxide-based alkaline catalyst containing Ca12Al14O33 and CaO was prepared by chemical synthesis and thermal activation from sodium aluminate solution and calcium hydroxide emulsion. The effect of calcination temperatures ranging from 120°C to 1000°C on activity of the catalyst was investigated. The catalyst calcined at 600°C showed the highest activity with &gt;94% yield of fatty acid methyl esters (i.e. biodiesel) when applied to the transesterification of rapeseed oil at a methanol:oil molar ratio of 15:1 at 65°C for 3h. Structure and properties of the catalyst were studied and the characterizations with XRD, TGA, FTIR, BET, and SEM demonstrated that the performance of the catalyst was closely related to its specific surface area and crystalline structure. In particular, the generation of crystalline Ca12Al14O33 improved the catalytic activity due its synergistic effect with CaO. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Titanosilicates with 3D-wormhole-like mesoporosity were used as support for hydroprocessing catalysts to increase the triglyceride (jatropha oil) deoxygenation and cracking activity of sulfided Ni-Mo and Co-Mo catalysts. Mesoporous titanosilicate supported Co-Mo catalyst showed improved performance in terms of higher yield of kerosene (jet-fuel) range hydrocarbons, 5-times more isomerized product and slightly improved activity than the traditional alumina supported catalyst. Higher acidity, better metal dispersion and favorable metal-support interactions could be attributed to the improved performance of the former. Among the mesoporous titanosilicate supported catalysts, sulfided Ni-Mo was more active than the Co-Mo catalyst (at lower temperature, 300 °C, 4-8 h-1) but with high selectivity for oligomeric products. But at higher temperatures the Co-Mo catalytic system showed comparable activities with increased yield of cracked products and the heavy range fraction. Response surface plots indicated that there was a combined effect of space velocity and temperature on the conversion at lower temperatures (300 °C), which was less prominent at higher temperatures (&gt;330 °C). Kinetic model fitting results at lower temperatures (300-320 °C) indicated direct conversion of triglycerides to deoxygenated products along with oligomeric and cracked products formation with no internal conversions between the products indicated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: One of the major areas for increasing the use of renewable energy is in traffic fuels e.g. bio-based fuels in diesel engines especially in commuter traffic. Exhaust emissions from fossil diesel fuelled engines are known to cause adverse effects on human health, but there is very limited information available on how the new renewable fuels may change the harmfulness of the emissions, especially particles (PM). We evaluated the PM emissions from a heavy-duty EURO IV diesel engine powered by three different fuels; the toxicological properties of the emitted PM were investigated. Conventional diesel fuel (EN590) and two biodiesels were used - rapeseed methyl ester (RME, EN14214) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) either as such or as 30% blends with EN590. EN590 and 100% HVO were also operated with or without an oxidative catalyst (DOC + POC). A bus powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) was included for comparison with the liquid fuels. However, the results from CNG powered bus cannot be directly compared to the other situations in this study.Results: High volume PM samples were collected on PTFE filters from a constant volume dilution tunnel. The PM mass emission with HVO was smaller and with RME larger than that with EN590, but both biofuels produced lower PAH contents in emission PM. The DOC + POC catalyst greatly reduced the PM emission and PAH content in PM with both HVO and EN590. Dose-dependent TNFα and MIP-2 responses to all PM samples were mostly at the low or moderate level after 24-hour exposure in a mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Emission PM from situations with the smallest mass emissions (HVO + cat and CNG) displayed the strongest potency in MIP-2 production. The catalyst slightly decreased the PM-induced TNFα responses and somewhat increased the MIP-2 responses with HVO fuel. Emission PM with EN590 and with 30% HVO blended in EN590 induced the strongest genotoxic responses, which were significantly greater than those with EN590 + cat or 100% HVO. The emission PM sample from the CNG bus possessed the weakest genotoxic potency but had the strongest oxidative potency of all the fuel and catalyst combinations. The use of 100% HVO fuel had slightly weaker and 100% RME somewhat stronger emission PM induced ROS production, when compared to EN590.Conclusions: The harmfulness of the exhaust emissions from vehicle engines cannot be determined merely on basis of the emitted PM mass. The study conditions and the engine type significantly affect the toxicity of the emitted particles. The selected fuels and DOC + POC catalyst affected the PM emission from the heavy EURO IV engine both qualitative and quantitative ways, which influenced their toxicological characteristics. The plain HVO fuel performed very well in emission reduction and in lowering the overall toxicity of emitted PM, but the 30% blend of HVO in EN590 was no better in this respect than the plain EN590. The HVO with a DOC + POC catalyst in the EURO IV engine, performed best with regard to changes in exhaust emissions. However some of the toxicological parameters were significantly increased even with these low emissions. © 2012 Jalava et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Despite their importance as a biofuel production platform, only a very limited number of butanol-tolerant bacteria have been identified thus far. Here, we extensively explored butanol- and isobutanol-tolerant bacteria from various environmental samples. A total of 16 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that could tolerate greater than 2.0% (vol/vol) butanol and isobutanol were isolated. A 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that the isolates were phylogenetically distributed over at least nine genera: Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, Rummeliibacillus, Brevibacillus, Coprothermobacter, Caloribacterium, Enterococcus, Hydrogenoanaerobacterium, and Cellulosimicrobium, within the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Ten of the isolates were phylogenetically distinct from previously identified butanol-tolerant bacteria. Two relatively highly butanol-tolerant strains CM4A (aerobe) and GK12 (obligate anaerobe) were characterized further. Both strains changed their membrane fatty acid composition in response to butanol exposure, i.e., CM4A and GK12 exhibited increased saturated and cyclopropane fatty acids (CFAs) and longchain fatty acids, respectively, which may serve to maintain membrane fluidity. The gene (cfa) encoding CFA synthase was cloned from strain CM4A and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant E. coli showed relatively higher butanol and isobutanol tolerance than E. coli without the cfa gene, suggesting that cfa can confer solvent tolerance. The exposure of strain GK12 to butanol by consecutive passages even enhanced the growth rate, indicating that yet-unknown mechanisms may also contribute to solvent tolerance. Taken together, the results demonstrate that a wide variety of butanol- and isobutanol-tolerant bacteria that can grow in 2.0% butanol exist in the environment and have various strategies to maintain structural integrity against detrimental solvents. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Rice straw can be used as a renewable fuel for heat and power generation. It is a viable mean of replacing fossil fuels and preventing pollution caused by open burning, especially in the areas where this residual biomass is generated. Nevertheless, the thermal conversion of rice straw can cause some operating problems such as slag formation, which negatively affects thermal conversion systems. So, the main objective of this research is studying the combustion behavior of rice straw samples collected from various regions by applying thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In addition, the thermal behavior of ashes from rice straw was also analyzed in order to detect their melting points, and ash sintering was detected at different temperatures within the range between 550 and 1000. °C. Since washing rice straw with water could reduce the content of undesirable inorganic compounds related to the ash fusibility, samples of washed rice straw were analyzed under combustion conditions to investigate its differences regarding the thermal behavior of rice straw. The results showed that rice straw washing led to a significant improvement in its thermal behavior, since it reduced the ash contents and sintering formation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Five non-toxin producing cyanobacterial isolates from the genera Synechococcus, Trichormus, Microcystis, Leptolyngbya and Chlorogloea were examined in terms of quantity and quality as lipid feedstock for biofuel production. Under the conditions used in this study, the biomass productivity ranged from 3.7 to 52.7 mg·L-1·day-1 in relation to dry biomass, while the lipid productivity varied between 0.8 and 14.2 mg·L-1·day-1. All cyanobacterial strains evaluated yielded lipids with similar fatty acid composition to those present in the seed oils successfully used for biodiesel synthesis. However, by combining biomass and lipid productivity parameters, the greatest potential was found for Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, M. aeruginosa NPCD-1 and Trichormus sp. CENA77. The chosen lipid samples were further characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), viscosity and thermogravimetry and used as lipid feedstock for biodiesel synthesis by heterogeneous catalysis. © 1996-2013 MDPI AG.

AB  - Microbial glycoside hydrolases play a dominant role in the biochemical conversion of cellulosic biomass to high-value biofuels. Anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria are capable of producing multicomplex catalytic subunits containing cell-adherent cellulases, hemicellulases, xylanases, and other glycoside hydrolases to facilitate the degradation of highly recalcitrant cellulose and other related plant cell wall polysaccharides. Clostridium thermocellum is a cellulosome-producing bacterium that couples rapid reproduction rates to highly efficient degradation of crystalline cellulose. Herein, we have developed and applied a suite of difluoromethylphenyl aglycone, N-halogenated glycosylamine, and 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycoside activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) probes to the direct labeling of the C. thermocellum cellulosomal secretome. These activity-based probes (ABPs) were synthesized with alkynes to harness the utility and multimodal possibilities of click chemistry and to increase enzyme active site inclusion for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. We directly analyzed ABP-labeled and unlabeled global MS data, revealing ABP selectivity for glycoside hydrolase (GH) enzymes, in addition to a large collection of integral cellulosome-containing proteins. By identifying reactivity and selectivity profiles for each ABP, we demonstrate our ability to widely profile the functional cellulose-degrading machinery of the bacterium. Derivatization of the ABPs, including reactive groups, acetylation of the glycoside binding groups, and mono- and disaccharide binding groups, resulted in considerable variability in protein labeling. Our probe suite is applicable to aerobic and anaerobic microbial cellulose-degrading systems and facilitates a greater understanding of the organismal role associated with biofuel development. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Crude canola oil (CCO) contains about 100-300. ppm of phospholipids, which have shown negative effects on biodiesel/buffer solution phase separation, resulting in low biodiesel production yield. Therefore, phospholipids should be removed before transesterification by a degumming process for efficient production of biodiesel. In this study, two-step enzymatic processes (degumming and transesterification) were carried out for the production of biodiesel from CCO. Degumming of CCO was performed using phospholipase A2 as a degumming reagent. The initial phospholipid content was reduced to less than 5. ppm by enzymatic degumming. The effects of three formulations of enzyme catalyst on the efficiency of transesterification were investigated. As a result, conversion rates of degummed CCO to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were 68.56%, 70.15%, and 84.25%, respectively. Lipase formulation composed of a 1:1 (vol:vol) enzyme mixture of Rhizopus oryzae and Candida rugosa showed the best performance among those tested. In order to recover and reuse the lipase catalyst efficiently, a 1:1 enzyme mixture of R. oryzae and C. rugosa was immobilized on silica gel. The immobilized lipase was used in subsequent transesterification optimization experiments. Optimization of transesterification was performed by response surface methodology (RSM). A total of 20 experiments based on RSM were carried out, and the optimal reaction conditions appeared to be 24.4% (w/w) immobilized catalyst, 13.5% (w/w) buffer solution, and 15.8% (w/w) methanol based on oil mass. Conversion rate of degummed CCO to FAME was determined to be 88.9% under optimal conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulose and other carbohydrates are being studied extensively as potential renewable carbon sources for liquid biofuels and other valuable chemicals. In the present study, a simple, sensitive, selective, and reliable HPLC method using a photodiode array (PDA) detector and an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) was developed for the simultaneous determination of important sugars (d(+)-cellobiose, glucose, xylose, and arabinose), furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) in lignocellulose hydrolysate. The analysis was carried out on an Aminex HPX-87H column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size). Ultra-pure water with 0.00035 M H 2SO 4 was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The temperature of the ELSD drift tube was kept at 50 °C, the carrier gas pressure was 350 kPa, and the gain was set at 7. Furfural and 5-HMF were quantified on a PDA detector at 275 nm and 284 nm, respectively. The sugar concentrations were determined by ELSD. This method was validated for accuracy and precision. The regression equation revealed a good linear relationship (r 2 = 0.9986 ± 0.0012) within the test ranges. The method showed good reproducibility for the quantification of six analytes in corncob hydrolysate, with intra- and inter-day variations less than 1.12%. This method is also convenient because it allows the rapid analysis of the primary products of biomass hydrolysis and carbohydrate degradation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - India imports more than seventy percent of the oil it uses and is looking for alternative fuel to reduce its dependence on imports. In India, bio fuels derived from non-edible oils is considered as a renewable alternative to the fossil diesel. The cost of the biodiesel is higher than diesel and hence in this work, cardanol was used as an alternative renewable fuel for the diesel engine. The engine tests were conducted on a double cylinder, direct injection, compression ignition engine. From the engine tests, it is observed that the brake power increases (by 70% approximately) as load increases. Brake specific energy conversion decreases (by 25-30% approximately) with increase in brake power. Brake thermal efficiency increases with higher brake power and emission levels (HC, CO, NOX) were nominal up to 20% blends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydropyrolysis of rice husk was performed using nickel-loaded Loy Yang brown coal char (Ni/LY) catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor at 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C with an aim to study the influence of catalyst and catalytic hydropyrolysis temperature on product yields and the composition of bio-oil. An inexpensive Ni/LY char was prepared by the ion-exchange method with nickel loading rate of 9 ± 1 wt.%. Nickel particles which dispersed well in Loy Yang brown coal char showed a large specific surface area of Ni/LY char of 350 m2/g. The effects of catalytic activity and hydropyrolysis temperature of rice husk using Ni/LY char were examined at the optimal condition for bio-oil yield (i.e., pyrolysis temperature 500 °C, static bed height 5 cm, and gas flow rate 2 L/min without catalyst). In the presence of catalyst, the oxygen content of bio-oil decreased by about 16% compared with that of non-catalyst. Raising the temperature from 500 to 650 °C reduced the oxygen content of bio-oil from 27.50% to 21.50%. Bio-oil yields decreased while gas yields and water content increased with increasing temperature due to more oxygen being converted into H2O, CO2, and CO. The decreasing of the oxygen content contributed to a remarkable increase in the heating value of bio-oil. The characteristics of bio-oil were analyzed by Karl Fischer, GC/MS, GPC, FT-IR, and CHN elemental analysis. The result indicated that the hydropyrolysis of rice husk using Ni/LY char at high temperature can be used to improved the quality of bio-oil to level suitable for a potential liquid fuel and chemical feedstock. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel, a non-toxic and biodegradable fuel, has recently become a major source of renewable alternative fuels. Utilization of lipase as a biocatalyst to produce biodiesel has advantages over common alkaline catalysts such as mild reaction conditions, easy product separation, and use of waste cooking oil as raw material. In this study, Pseudomonas cepacia lipase immobilized onto magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) was used for biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. The optimal dosage of lipase-bound MNP was 40% (w/w of oil) and there was little difference between stepwise addition of methanol at 12 h-and 24 h-intervals. Reaction temperature, substrate molar ratio (methanol/oil), and water content (w/w of oil) were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal reaction conditions were 44.2 °C, substrate molar ratio of 5.2, and water content of 12.5%. The predicted and experimental molar conversions of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were 80% and 79%, respectively. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In order to ensure the sustainability of algal biofuel production, a number of issues need to be addressed. Previously, we reviewed some of the questions in this area involving algal species and the important challenges of nutrient supply and how these might be met. Here, we take up issues involving harvesting and the conversion of biomass to biofuels. Advances in both these areas are required if these third-generation fuels are to have a sufficiently high net energy ratio and a sustainable footprint. A variety of harvesting technologies are under investigation and recent studies in this area are presented and discussed. A number of different energy uses are available for algal biomass, each with their own advantages as well as challenges in terms of efficiencies and yields. Recent advances in these areas are presented and some of the especially promising conversion processes are highlighted. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - A nickel cerium modified olivine was used as a fluidized bed material in a biomass gasifier and the impact of the modification on biomass conversion, product gas composition, and tar speciation at different temperatures of oak gasification was measured. The experiments were conducted in the pyrolysis mode, without additional input of steam or oxygen (e.g., from air) into the system. In both plain and modified olivine, carbon- and hydrogen-based yields in light gases produced increased as temperature increased from 600 to 800. °C. Using modified olivine resulted in significant improvement in carbon- and hydrogen-based yields and substantial reduction in tars and methane. With modified olivine, the biochar produced at 800. °C was 40% less than that with plain olivine. Characterization of the fresh and post-reaction catalyst showed that a fraction of the NiO was reduced in situ in the gasifier by the syngas. In addition, the catalyst was also contributing oxygen to the environment inside the gasifier in a chemical-looping like mode, resulting in less char and coke formation than that of gasification of biomass without an additional oxygen source. Statistical analysis of molecular beam mass spectrometry data provided detailed tar speciation information under different gasification conditions. At both 650 and 800. °C, the modified olivine was effective in producing more syngas either through conversion of hydrocarbon rich tars into syngas or blocking the pathway for hydrocarbon rich tar formation. However, the impact of the modified olivine in converting oxygenates (that are primarily derived from deconstruction of biomass) into deoxygenated compounds was probably minimal. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The unimolecular decomposition of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), a promising next-generation biofuel, was studied at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. As most of its decomposition routes remain unknown, a large number of pathways were explored: initial C-H bond fission, biradical ring opening, H-atom and CH 3-group transfers involving carbene intermediates. Based on the computed potential energy surfaces, thermochemical data and high-pressure limit rate constants were determined and included in a small detailed kinetic mechanism for DMF unimolecular decomposition. Simulations performed under the conditions of recent experimental data focusing on the initial steps in DMF thermal decomposition showed that the unimolecular decomposition of DMF is dominated by two product channels. For typical combustion conditions, the major product channel (∼70% at 1500 K and 1 bar) is reached by a 3,2-hydrogen transfer in DMF leading to a carbene intermediate that rearranges to hexa-3,4-dien-2-one which in turn decomposes into CH3CO and C 4H5 by initial C-C bond fission. In contrast with previous studies, the initial C-H bond fission in DMF has not been found to be the major decomposition channel (∼30% at 1500 K and 1 bar). Pressure effects were probed using a semi-quantitative approach and were found to be negligible above 1 bar. Below atmospheric pressure, initial C-H bond cleavage yields increase while CH3CO + C4H5 branching ratios decrease. This study brings a new understanding of the nature of the initial radicals and molecules created upon thermal activation of DMF. © the Owner Societies 2013.

AB  - In a bid to increase the cost competitiveness of biodiesel production against mineral diesel, process intensification has been studied for numerous biodiesel processing technologies. Subsequently, reactive extraction or in situ transesterification is actively being explored in which the solid oil-bearing seeds are used as the reactant directly with short-chain alcohol. This eliminates separate oil extraction process and combines both extraction and transesterification in a single unit. Supercritical reactive extraction takes one step further by substituting the role of catalyst with supercritical conditions to achieve higher yield and shorter processing time. In this work, supercritical reactive extraction with methanol was carried out in a high-pressure batch reactor to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from Jatropha curcas L. seeds. Material and process parameters including space loading, solvent to seed ratio, co-solvent (n-hexane) to seed ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and mixing intensity were varied one at a time and optimized based on two responses i.e. extraction efficiency, Mextract and FAME yield, Fy. The optimum responses for supercritical reactive extraction obtained were 104.17% w/w and 99.67% w/w (relative to 100% lipid extraction with n-hexane) for Mextract and Fy respectively under the following conditions: 54.0ml/g space loading, 5.0ml/g methanol to seeds ratio, 300°C, 9.5MPa (Mega Pascal), 30min reaction time and without n-hexane as co-solvent or any agitation source. This proved that supercritical reactive extraction is rather promising as another alternative for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The catalytic activity of baker's yeast, . Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a biocatalyst was investigated in a mediatorless microbial fuel cell. The yeast cells that adhered on the anode surface were the active biocatalyst for glucose oxidation in a mediatorless biofuel cell, suggesting that the electron transfer took place through the surface confined species. The species in the anolyte solution including the dispersed yeast cells did not take a part in the electron transfer and thus in the power generation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A major issue raised about development of cellulosic biomass derived fuels technologies is the concern about possible competition for land with agricultural crops and impacts on food and feed supply. However, because agave offers high productivity with low water and nutrient demands, it can thrive on semiarid lands not suitable for conventional agriculture, making it a promising lignocellulosic feedstock for biofuels production. Because agave composition will establish the maximum potential fuel yield that is vital to low cost conversion, detailed chemical composition data and cellulose characteristics were measured by standard biomass analysis procedures and solid-state NMR methods, respectively, for four agave samples: A. americana leaves, A. salmiana leaves, A. tequilana leaves, and A. americana heart. For the first time, we report substrate characteristics relevant to biochemical conversion for the tested agave species, specifically cell wall compositional data along with the relative proportions of cellulose ultra-structural components. The experimental results also provide an important baseline for further characterization and conversion of different agave species as biofuels feedstocks for semi-arid lands. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - One solution to the supply chain challenges of cellulosic biofuels is a network of local biomass processing depots (LBPDs) that can produce stable, dense, intermediate commodities and valuable co-products prior to shipping to a refinery. A techno-economic model of an LBPD facility that could incorporate multiple technologies and products was developed in Microsoft Excel to be used to economically and environmentally evaluate potential LBPD systems. In this study, three technologies (ammonia fiber expansion or AFEX™ pretreatment, fast pyrolysis, and leaf protein processing) were assessed for profitability. Pyrolysis was slightly profitable under the base conditions, leaf protein processing was highly unprofitable, and AFEX was profitable if biomass drying was not required. This model can be adapted to multiple feedstocks and end uses, including both economic and environmental modeling. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dilute sulphuric acid pretreatment followed by enzyme saccharification of Sorghum bicolor straw was undertaken to examine its potential as a feedstock in bioethanol production in Australia. Factorial design experiments evaluated the impact of pretreatment parameters on hemicellulose solubilisation and cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis. Sugar yields in prehydrolysate and saccharified liquors were found to increase with treatment severity; temperature was found to have the greatest impact. Degradation products were minimal; acetate and total phenolics peaked at 33 and 1.5mg/g respectively. Conditions for maximum hemicellulose solubilisation (2% H2SO4 for 60min at 121°C) differed to those associated with maximum glucose release from solid residue saccharifications (1% H2SO4/90min /121°C). Water extractive sugars accounted for over 20% total sugars recovered. Addition of β-glucosidase and xylanase to enzyme saccharification enhanced reaction rates and final sugar yields three-fold, whilst reducing cellulase dosage. Considering its abundance, high sugar potential and apparent ease of conversion, sorghum straw is an appropriate feedstock for the production of second generation fuels. © 2011.

AB  - We present a catalytic strategy to upgrade the light fraction of a simulated bio-oil, consisting of acetic acid, acetol, and furfural. The acid content of the feed was significantly reduced by ketonization at 623K over a ceria-zirconia (CeZrOx) mixed oxide catalyst. The presence of furfural decreased the ketonization activity; however, it was possible to regain the initial catalytic activity by removal of furfural from the feed. Acetol was highly reactive over the mixed oxide, and its presence did not influence the ketonization activity. The results from reaction kinetics measurements for conversion of acetol suggest that the primary products are pyruvaldehyde and 1,2-propylene glycol formed by transfer hydrogenation. These two primary products then undergo reactions in series and parallel to produce an array of C3-C6 carbonyl compounds, constituting an upgraded intermediate feed appropriate for further processing steps to obtain transportation fuel components. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The acidic ionic liquid (IL) functionalized polymer (PDVB–SO3H–[C3vim][SO3CF3]) possesses abundant nanoporous structures, strong acid strength and unique capability for deconstruction of crystalline cellulose into sugars in ILs. The polymer shows much improved catalytic activities in comparison with mineral acids, homogeneous acidic ionic liquids and the acidic resins such as Amberlyst 15. The enhanced catalytic activity found in the polymer is attributed to synergistic effects between the strongly acidic group and the ILs grafted onto the polymer, which by itself is capable of breaking down the crystalline structures of cellulose. This study may help develop cost-effective and green routes for conversion of biomass to fuels. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - It has been recognized that oils derived from microorganism and wastewater sludge are comparable replacements of traditional biodiesel production feedstock, which is energy intensive and costly. Energy balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are essential factors to assess the feasibility of the production. This study evaluated the energy balance and GHG emissions of biodiesel production from microbial and wastewater sludge oil. The results show that energy balance and GHG emissions of biodiesel produced from microbial oil are significantly impacted by the cultivation methods and carbon source. For phototrophic microorganism (microalgae), open pond system gives 3.6 GJ higher energy gain than photo bioreactor system in per tonne biodiesel produced. For heterotrophic microorganisms, the energy balance depends on the type of carbon source. Three carbon sources including starch, cellulose, and starch industry wastewater (SIW) used in this study showed that utilization of SIW as carbon source provided the most favorable energy balance. When oil extracted from municipal sludge is used for biodiesel production, the energy gain is up to 29.7 GJ per tonne biodiesel produced, which is higher than the energy gain per tonne of biodiesel produced from SIW cultivated microbes. GHG emissions study shows that biodiesel production from microbes or sludge oil is a net carbon dioxide capture process except when starch is used as raw material for microbial oil production, and the highest capture is around 40 tonnes carbon dioxide per tonne of biodiesel produced. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A series of fatty acids in microalgae oil, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, arachidic acid and behenic acid, were selected as the raw materials to produce aviation fuel via hydrothermal decarboxylation over a multi-wall carbon nanotube supported Pt catalyst (Pt/MWCNTs). It was found that Pt/MWCNTs catalysts exhibited higher activity for the hydrothermal decarboxylation of stearic acid with a 97% selectivity toward heptadecane compared to Pt/C and Ru/C under the same conditions. And Pt/MWCNTs is also capable for the decarboxylation of different fatty acids in microalgae oil. The reaction conditions, such as Pt/MWCNTs loading amount, reaction temperature and time were optimized. The activation energy of stearic acid decarboxylation over Pt/MWCNTs was calculated (114. kJ/mol). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Blast furnace slag (BFS), a high volume byproduct resulting from iron-making processes, was used as a low-cost and abundant precursor for preparing a hydrocalumite, and the thus prepared slag-made hydrocalumite and its derivatives were applied for transesterifications of esters including triglycerides. In the transesterification of n-ethyl butyrate, calcined samples provided higher catalytic activities than those of the as-synthesized hydrocalumite due to the interfusion of slag-derived impurity elements, such as Fe and Mn, which act as catalyst promoters. Furthermore, the catalyst calcined at 800 °C in air worked as an efficient catalyst for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol, affording up to 97% yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) after 6 h under relatively moderate reaction conditions (i.e., methanol/soybean oil = 12, reaction temperature = 60 °C, use of 1 wt% catalyst), and its catalytic performance was reproduced even after air-exposure for 1 day. It is believed that the slag-made hydrocalumite can replace existing solid base catalysts as a low-cost alternative for biodiesel production and potentially contribute to the sustainable chemical processes in an economical and ecological way. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A microbial fuel cell (MFC) was constructed to investigate the possible generation of electricity using cattle dung as a substrate. After 30days of operation, stable electricity was generated, and the maximum volumetric power density was 0.220W/m3. The total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal and coulombic efficiency (CE) of the MFC reached 73.9±1.8% and 2.79±0.6%, respectively, after 120days of operation. Acetate was the main metabolite in the anolyte, and other volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (propionate and butyrate) were present in minor amounts. The PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the following five groups of microbes were present: Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the sample; specifically, 36.3% and 24.2% of the sequences obtained were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively. Clostridium sp., Pseudomonas luteola and Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense were the most dominant groups during the electricity generation process. The diversity of archaea dramatically decreased after 20days of operation. The detected archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and the Methanobacterium genus disappeared during the periods of stable electricity generation via acidogenesis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Glycerol carbonate is one of the higher value-added products derived from glycerol. In this study, glycerol carbonate (GC) was synthesized by transesterification of glycerol and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) using Novozym 435 (Candida antarctica Lipase B) at various conditions. For the enzymatic production of GC, the optimum conditions were the amount of enzyme (75. g/L), DMC/glycerol molar ratio (2.00), reaction temperature (60 °C) and organic solvent (acetonitrile). Experimental investigation of the effect of water content revealed that the conversion of GC was maximized with no added water. The addition of surfactant such as Tween 80 increased the GC conversion, which finally reached 96.25% under the optimum condition and with surfactant addition. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Achieving efficient electrochemical communication between redox enzymes and various electrode materials is one of the main challenges in bioelectrochemistry and is of great importance for developing electronic applications. Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is an extracellular flavocytochrome composed of a catalytic FAD containing dehydrogenase domain (DHCDH), a heme b containing cytochrome domain (CYTCDH), and a flexible linker region connecting the two domains. Efficient direct electron transfer (DET) of CDH from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PcCDH) covalently attached to mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) modified gold nanoparticle (AuNP) electrode is presented. The thiols used were as follows: 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP), 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA), 4-mercaptophenol (4-MP), 11-mercapto-1-undecanamine (MUNH2), 11-mercapto-1-undecanoic acid (MUCOOH), and 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (MUOH). A covalent linkage between PcCDH and 4-ATP or MUNH2 in the mixed SAMs was formed using glutaraldehyde as cross-linker. The covalent immobilization and the surface coverage of PcCDH were confirmed with surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To improve current density, AuNPs were cast on the top of polycrystalline gold electrodes. For all the immobilized PcCDH modified AuNPs electrodes, cyclic voltammetry exhibited clear electrochemical responses of the CYTCDH with fast electron transfer (ET) rates in the absence of substrate (lactose), and the formal potential was evaluated to be +162 mV vs NHE at pH 4.50. The standard ET rate constant (ks) was estimated for the first time for CDH and was found to be 52.1, 59.8, 112, and 154 s-1 for 4-ATP/4-MBA, 4-ATP/4-MP, MUNH2/MUCOOH, and MUNH2/MUOH modified electrodes, respectively. At all the mixed SAM modified AuNP electrodes, PcCDH showed DET only via the CYTCDH. No DET communication between the DHCDH domain and the electrode was found. The current density for lactose oxidation was remarkably increased by introduction of the AuNPs. The 4-ATP/4-MBA modified AuNPs exhibited a current density up to 30 μA cm -2, which is ∼70 times higher than that obtained for a 4-ATP/4-MBA modified polycrystalline gold electrode. The results provide insight into fundamental electrochemical properties of CDH covalently immobilized on gold electrodes and promote further applications of CDHs for biosensors, biofuel cells, and bioelectrocatalysis. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the present work, temperature dependent models for the prediction of densities and dynamic viscosities of pure compounds within the range of possible alternative fuel mixture components are presented. The proposed models have been derived using machine learning methods including Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Experimental data used to train and validate the models was extracted from the DIPPR database. A comparison between models using an ample range of molecular descriptors and models using only functional group count descriptors as inputs was performed, and consensus models were created by testing different combinations of the individual models. The resulting consensus models predictions were in agreement with the available experimental data. Comparisons were also made between predictions of our models and correlations validated by the DIPPR staff. Our models were used to predict densities and dynamic viscosities of compounds for which no experimental data exists. Our models were also used to estimate other properties such as kinematic viscosities, critical temperatures, and critical pressures for compounds in the database. Finally, predictions were used to study the main trends of density and viscosity at the aforementioned temperatures as a function of the number of carbon atoms for chemical families of interest. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Increased demand in transportation fuels, environmental concerns, and depletion of fossil fuels require the development of efficient conversion technologies for second-generation biofuels. The main objective of this work is to efficiently liquefy biomass into energy-dense biocrude. A novel two-step process is proposed in which acidic subcritical water followed by alkaline supercritical water media are utilized for the liquefaction. The concept is tested with switchgrass. The first step is carried out at 200 °C in acidic subcritical water to liquefy hemicelluloses to biocrude while avoiding the repolymerization reactions that would otherwise produce char. In the second step, the remaining unliquefied biomass (biomass-H) is subjected to supercritical water at 380 °C with Ca(OH) 2 as catalyst for minimizing the formation of char, enhancing lignin solubilization and therefore increasing liquefaction of the remaining polysaccharides toward biocrude. The proposed two-step liquefaction produces a significantly higher amount of biocrude, as compared to the traditional one-step process. The yield of biocrude from the proposed process is 40% on mass basis and 67% on energy basis of the feedstock biomass. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Mesoporous sulfonated melamine-formaldehyde resin (MSMF) has been successfully synthesized from the self-assembly of a copolymer surfactant (F127) with a mixture of melamine, formaldehyde and NaHSO3 in an aqueous solution. After removal of the copolymer surfactant (F127) by ethanol extraction, the MSMF exhibits uniform mesopore sizes centered at 10.2 nm. The contact angle (0°) of water on the sample shows that the MSMF is superhydrophilic. After impregnating with a Pd species, a MSMF supported Pd catalyst (Pd/MSMF) is obtained, which shows high activity and excellent recyclability in an important model reaction for biofuel upgrade (hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin), compared with a conventional carbon supported Pd catalyst (Pd/C). The superior catalytic properties of the Pd/MSMF catalyst should be potentially important for biofuel upgrades in the future. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the kinetics of ultrasound assisted-two phase oil extraction from waste coffee grounds with high moisture content. Waste coffee grounds is the wet residue which contains approximately 13% (db) oil. Ultrasound-assisted two-phase oil extraction method successfully extracted 98% of the available oil from the waste coffee grounds in 30 min. Ultrasonication reduced the amount of hexane used for the extraction. Fatty acid methyl ester compositions of the waste coffee oil and the soybean oil were similar. The kinetics of oil extraction from waste coffee grounds were modeled using a two-exponential mathematical equation. Establishing oil extraction facilities at locations where the ready-to-drink coffee products are produced and using two-phase oil extraction eliminate major challenges of collection, transportation and drying, which makes waste coffee grounds a viable feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work has been done to find out the optimum condition of supercritical methyl acetate method in biodiesel production. The reaction temperature, pressure, time and molar ratio in methyl acetate to oil were the key parameters that must all be considered to produce an optimum condition. Evaluation of thermal decomposition on products, cis- trans isomerization and tocopherol content were required to further optimize the reaction condition. It was, therefore, concluded that for the supercritical methyl acetate method, reaction condition of 350 °C/20. MPa/45. min/42. M ratio gave the highest yields of FAME (96.7. wt.%) and triacetin (8.8. wt.%). Yet, at such a reaction condition, the optimum reaction condition was compromised due particularly to the unavoidable thermal decomposition of products, and tocopherols as natural anti-oxidants. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) covalently phenylated, naphthylated or terphenylated were used for the construction of cathodes in a biobattery, and in a biofuel cell. Zn is the anode in the biobattery and single-walled carbon nanotubes are covalently modified with glucose oxidase/catalase (SWCNT-GOx/Cat) on the biofuel cell anode. The cell parameters were determined and the potentials of each of the electrodes under cell working conditions were simultaneously measured vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. This allowed to evaluate the changes of potential under changing loads of the fuel cell or biobattery. A power density of ca. 1 mW/cm 2 was achieved using the biobattery with phenylated nanotubes at the cathode and the open circuit potential was 1.5 V. The fully enzymatic fuel cell studied had power density of 40 μW/cm 2 at 20 kΩ loading. The open circuit potential for the biofuel cell was 0.4 V. The power densities and working potentials are larger for the biobattery which is especially useful for testing novel cathodes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Esterification of oleic acid with ethanol catalyzed by organophosphonic acid-functionalized silica SG-T-P was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The interactive effect of catalyst to FFA weight ratio and molar ratio of alcohol to acid were more significant than that of reaction temperature. The optimum values for maximum conversion ratio obtained by a Box-Behnken center-united design reached 77.02. ±. 0.62% when the reaction was carried out at 112. °C for 10. h with a molar ratio of alcohol to oleic acid of 8.8:1 and a content of 14.5. wt.% triethylenetetramine bis(methylene phosphonic acid)- functionalized silica catalyst SG-T-P. The research results show that SG-T-P is a potential catalyst for biodiesel production that can adsorb water from the reaction mixture at the same time. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Surface modification has been proved to be one of the effective strategies for enhancing the properties of graphene sheets. When a non-covalent modification method is appropriately designed, novel opportunities for better performance of graphene nanosheets can be expected since this strategy can tailor the properties of graphene while its natural structure is retained. This paper introduces a simple route to prepare a highly biocompatible, stable and conductive graphene hybrid modified by poly-l-lysine (PLL) for biosensors using the non-covalent strategy. Results show that PLL adopts a random conformation with the nonpolar parts exposed to outside since its side chains are positively charged under neutral conditions. This conformation allows the strong adhesion of PLL to graphene surface via the hydrophobic interaction between butyl chains of PLL and graphene surface, cation-π interaction of protonated amine groups on PLL with the π electrons in graphene, and electrostatic interaction between the protonated amine groups on PLL and the negatively charged carboxyl groups remaining on graphene. All these interactions make the resultant PLL-G hybrid stable and dispersible in aqueous solutions. The resultant hybrid is then used to construct high performance biosensors. As demonstration, hemoglobin (Hb) carrying negative charges can be easily immobilized on the hybrid via electrostatic interactions with the positively charged lysine side chains of PLL modified on graphene surface, forming the Hb@PLL-G bionanocomposite. The immobilized protein retains its native structure and exhibits reversible direct electrochemistry. The Hb@PLL-G based enzymatic electrochemical biosensor shows excellent catalytic activity toward its substrate hydrogen peroxide. Its electrochemical response shows the linear dependence of hydrogen peroxide concentration in a range between 10 μM and 80 μM with a detection limit of 0.1 μM. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant is calculated as 0.0753 mM, demonstrating the significant catalytic ability of the protein. The present strategy can be extended to modify other carbon materials and the resultant nanocomposites are promising for construction of biosensors, bioelectronics and biofuel cells. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Bio-oil and hydrochar were produced through the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Salix psammophila (SP) branch residues with recycled processing water, in order to address the lack of water in deserts or sandy lands and the difficulty of water treatment in a batch reactor. The results indicated that the recycling of the HTL processing water could significantly improve the yield of bio-oil from 30.3% to 46.9%. The gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses of the obtained bio-oil confirmed the presence of value-added chemicals, such as phenolics, acetic acid, and furans. The acetic acid in the processing water played a key role in the HTL. The heavy oil had a high content (maximum of 42.7 wt%) of the low boiling point fraction (<300 °C), indicating its potential for further applications. The higher heating value of the hydrochar was about 27 MJ/kg, equivalent to the heating value of medium-rank and high-rank coals. These results show that HTL using recycled processing water has great potential for utilization of desert biomass wastes.

AB  - Solid wastes of organic origins are potential feedstocks for the production of liquid biofuels, which could be suitable alternatives to fossil fuels for the transport and heating sectors, as well as for industrial use. By hydrothermal liquefaction, the wet biomass is partially transformed into a water-immiscible, oil-like organic matter called bio-oil. In this study, an integrated NMR spectroscopy/mass spectrometry approach has been developed for the characterization of the hydrothermal liquefaction of bio-oil at the molecular level. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used for the identification of functional groups and gauging the aromatic carbon content in the mixture. GC-MS analysis revealed that the volatile fraction was rich in fatty acids, as well as in amides and esters. High-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) has been applied in a systematic way to fully categorize the bio-oil in terms of different classes of components, according to their molecular formulas. Most importantly, for the first time, by using this technique, and for the liquefaction bio-oil characterization in particular, FT-MS data have been used to develop a methodology for the determination of the aromatic versus aliphatic carbon and nitrogen content. It is well known that, because they resist hydrogenation and represent sources of polluting species, both aromatic molecules and nitrogen-containing species raise concerns for subsequent upgrading of bio-oil into a diesel-like fuel. From waste to fuel: Liquefaction bio-oils can be used as fuel in engines to produce heat and electricity or be upgraded as replacements for diesel and gasoline fuels. An integrated approach based on NMR spectroscopy and MS data is used to characterize a bio-oil obtained from the hydrothermal liquefaction of municipal organic wastes (see picture).

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of cornstalk at 180-300°C at ratios of water to cornstalk of 6-14 was conducted, and the reaction products were lumped into gas, water-soluble organics (ethanol-insoluble and ethanol-soluble organics), heavy oil, volatile organic compounds, and acid-soluble and acid-insoluble solid residues. Low temperature, high ratio of water to cornstalk, and short reaction time favored the formation of bio-oil (ethanol-insoluble organics, ethanol-soluble organics, and heavy oil) but inhibited the formation of acid-insoluble solid residue. Increasing temperature and reaction time increased the yields of gas and volatile organic compounds, whereas decreased the yield of acid-soluble solid residue. Bio-oil yields increased first and then decreased at a ratio of water to cornstalk higher than 10. Overall, the studied reaction parameters influenced the conversion among the lumps and product properties. This study suggests that lump analysis provides a promising approach to describe the product distributions in biomass liquefaction. © 2012.

AB  - Biodiesel production from microalgae has recently increased on interest. The objective of this work is to explore the potential of biodiesel production from the microalgae Isochrysis galbana (T-ISO). For that reason, this microalgae was cultivated for biodiesel production. The culture system equipment consisted of two methacrylate ponds, 11. mm thick. The pond has a base of 1.40. ×. 0.40. m and a height of 0.4. m. The influence of initial concentration of inoculum, stirring and carbon dioxide supply on the growth of algae were analyzed. The obtained results indicate that stirring improves the algae growth rate. The other two factors have no significant effect on final cell density. Obtained biomass was used to produce oil by extraction to use for biodiesel synthesis by means of basic-catalyzed reaction. For transesterification, microalgae oil was mixed with methanol (12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio), and sodium hydroxide (1%. g NaOH/g oil) for 3. h in a reactor at 62. °C. The best harvest shows a biomass concentration of 0.305. g/L with a FAME content of 12.5%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Palm biodiesel from crude palm oil (CPO) was prepared via transesterification in a two-stage process using acidic ionic liquid as first step catalyst as opposed to using directly the alkaline-catalyzed transesterification which was found to be unsuitable. The esterification of the free fatty acids (FFA) of the CPO was carried out using triethylammonium hydrogensulfate (Et 3NHSO 4) as the pre-catalyst in the first stage, in which the acid value was reduced from 6.98 to 1.24mgKOH/g of oil followed by the use of KOH-catalyzed transesterification in the second stage. The effects of molar ratio of methanol to crude palm oil feed, the amount of ionic liquid and the reaction temperature were evaluated for the percent conversion of FFA. The conversion rate of FFA attained was 82.1% when 5.2wt.% of Et 3NHSO 4 was used for the reaction of methanol with CPO at a ratio of 15:1 respectively, and at reaction temperature of 170°C for 3h. The second alkali-catalyze step was performed under agitation with stirrer speed of 600rpm at 60°C using 1.0% KOH for 50min. The final biodiesel product was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with a reaction yield of 96.9%. The density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, ester content and other properties of the biodiesel sample were also measured and compared to the ASTM and the European biodiesel specifications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Terracotta pots were converted into simple, single chamber, air-cathode bio-batteries. This bio-battery design used a graphite-felt anode and a conductive graphite coating without added catalyst on the exterior as a cathode. Bacteria enriched from river sediment served as the anode catalyst. These batteries gave an average OCV of 0.56V±0.02, a Coulombic efficiency of 21±5%, and a peak power of 1.06mW±0.01(33.13mW/m 2). Stable current was also produced when the batteries were operated with hay extract in salt solution. The bacterial community on the anode of the batteries was tested for air tolerance and desiccation resistance over a period ranging from 2days to 2weeks. The results showed that the anode community could survive complete drying of the electrolyte for several days. These data support the further development of this technology as a potential power source for LED-based lighting in off-grid, rural communities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diesel engine exhaust contains large numbers of submicrometer particles that degrade air quality and human health. This study examines the number emission characteristics of 10-1000nm nonvolatile particles from a heavy-duty diesel engine, operating with various waste cooking oil biodiesel blends (B2, B10 and B20), engine loads (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%) and a diesel oxidation catalyst plus diesel particulate filter (DOC+DPF) under steady modes. For a given load, the total particle number concentrations (N TOT) decrease slightly, while the mode diameters show negligible changes with increasing biodiesel blends. For a given biodiesel blend, both the N TOT and mode diameters increase modestly with increasing load of above 25%. The N TOT at idle are highest and their size distributions are strongly affected by condensation and possible nucleation of semivolatile materials. Nonvolatile cores of diameters less than 16nm are only observed at idle mode. The DOC+DPF shows remarkable filtration efficiency for both the core and soot particles, irrespective of the biodiesel blend and engine load under study. The N TOT post the DOC+DPF are comparable to typical ambient levels of ∼10 4cm -3. This implies that, without concurrent reductions of semivolatile materials, the formation of semivolatile nucleation mode particles post the aftertreatment is highly favored. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work aims to produce biofuel from fish oil industrial residue and to test the biofuel in diesel engine. A 4.5 kW at 1500 rpm single cylinder air cooled direct injection diesel engine was used for the present experimental work. The experimental results show that the brake thermal efficiency marginally increases with biofuel from 29.98% (neat diesel) to the maximum of 32.4% with biofuel at 80% of maximum load. Also experiments were conducted with different blends of biofuel and diesel (B20 and B40). Though the NOx emissions are high with neat biofuel and blends, the other emissions like CO, HC and particulate matter (PM) are decreased. The PM emissions decrease when the percentage biofuel increases in the blend. It reduces from 8271 ng/s with neat diesel to 8137 ng/s with B40. It further reduces to the minimum of 7842 ng/s with neat biofuel. The cylinder peak pressure increases as the biofuel quantity increases in the blend. The rate of premixed combustion increases with neat biofuel and its blends than neat diesel. Addition of biofuel with diesel decreases the combustion duration and ignition delay due to higher cetane number of biofuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the use of horticultural waste (HW) collected in Singapore as a renewable raw material for bioethanol production. A modified organosolv method using ethanol cooking under mild conditions followed by H 2O 2 post-treatment was investigated for HW pretreatment. It was found that the addition of acid catalysts in the pretreatment process was not critical and post-treatment using H 2O 2 was essential for the enhancement of HW digestibility. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the organosolv pretreated HW with 17.5% solid content, enzyme loading of 20FPU/gHW of filter paper cellulase, and 80CBU/gHW of β-glucosidase resulted in a HW hydrolysate containing 26.9g/L reducing sugar after 72h. Fermentation of the above hydrolysate medium produced 11.69g/L ethanol at 8h using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It proved that horticultural waste was a potential feedstock for fuel ethanol production and organosolv pretreatment method developed in this study was effective. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new process to produce YXY fuel components from carbohydrates is under development by Avantium. YXY fuel components are furan-based mono- and diethers with good fuel blending properties and a relatively high energy density. In this paper the engine performance of a wide range of Diesel-YXY mixtures was tested using an ESC test with a 6 cylinder PACCAR heavy duty engine. At all conditions tested (different blendings and different steps in the ESC cycle) no difference in the engine operation was observed. Ethoxymethyl Tetrahydrofuran Ether (ETE) gave the best results with substantial reductions in particulate matter (%) and smoke (%) at up to 30% (v/v) blending ratios while NO x and maximum cylinder pressure were only marginally changed. Furfuryl Ethyl Ether (FEE) also caused substantial reductions of soot however, at the cost of higher NO x formation and a stronger oscillating effect in the max cylinder pressure. Applying a 1:1 mixture of the ETE/FEE YXY molecules quenched the effect seen with FEE alone indicating the strength of producing mixtures of different YXY molecules as the ideal fuel component. Further research will address the elastomer compatibility of the different YXY molecules and if higher alcohols (e.g. n-butanol, t-butanol) for the etherification will make the fuels even better fitting the Diesel fuel range (improved energy content, higher flashpoint, boiling point). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pure sunflower oil was hydrotreated (T = 633 K, P = 5 MPa) aiming the production of a biofuel in the diesel range using β-Mo2C/Al 2O3 as catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized in situ using the temperature-programmed carburization (TPC) methodology with a 20% (v/v) CH4/H2 gas mixture and 923 K/2 h as synthesis temperature. The catalytic evaluation results indicate that for the employed conditions n-C18 was the major product. The association of the results of the experiments without (blank) and with catalyst suggests that the overall triglyceride transformation into linear alkanes proceeds in two steps: (i) thermal cracking of the triglyceride forming free fatty acids and (ii) hydrogenation of the double bonds and of the carboxylic group of the free fatty acid forming n-alkanes. No CO and/or CO2 formation were detected implying that decarbonylation and/or decarboxylation routes do not play an important role when molybdenum carbide is used, contrarily to what is commonly observed when supported Co-Mo or Ni-Mo sulfides are employed as catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate anaerobic digestibility of algal bioethanol residue from saccharification and fermentation processes. A series of batch anaerobic digestion tests using saccharification and fermentation residue showed that the maximum methane yields of saccharification residue and fermentation residue were 239. L/kg VS (Volatile Solids) and 283. L/kg VS (Volatile Solids), respectively. Energy recovered by anaerobic digestion of the residue was 2.24 times higher than that from the ethanol produced in the main process. 5-HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural), a saccharification byproduct, could retard methanogenesis at over 3. g/L however, the inhibition was prevented by increasing cell biomass concentration. Anaerobic digestion of residue has the potential to enhance bioenergy recovery and environmental sustainability of algal bioethanol production. © 2012.

AB  - Deoxygenation of microalgal oil obtained by pyrolysis of microalgae was carried out for the production of hydrocarbon fuel from biomass by metal supported catalyst. Oleic acid was used as a model reactant to select an optimized catalyst. Effects of support, metal species, and metal loading on catalytic performance were investigated. Activated carbon showed better performance than silica as a support. Considering various factors in model reaction, such as metal loading, reaction temperature, activity for deoxygenation, and selectivity for decarboxylation, 5. wt% platinum supported on activated carbon (5. wt% Pt/C) was selected as an optimized catalyst. Based on these results, deoxygenation of the pyrolysis oil from Chlorella sp. KR-1 was conducted at 623 and 673. K over this selected catalyst. The product after catalytic deoxygenation was mainly composed of pure hydrocarbons, and its oxygen content was below 2.0%. The fraction in the product of which the boiling point was less than 623. K was about 90%. These properties could allow this upgraded oil to be used for transportation fuel. However, the degree of oxygen removal with microalgal pyrolysis oil was lower than that with oleic acid, implying that impurities in the pyrolysis oil may inhibit the deoxygenation reaction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work attempts to develop a correlation to predict thermal NOx formation in compression ignition (CI) engine when fuelled with diesel and biodiesel. Attention was focussed on both the fuel properties (cetane number, density) and engine design factors (bore, stroke, compression ratio, fuel injection timing) while developing correlation, ensuring that it is suitable for all CI engine fuels tested on both constant and variable speed engines. It was observed that NOx emissions predicted through the correlation is comparable with those of the measured ones. The general trend is observed to be the same for both the predicted and measured NOx emission. At loads more than 25% of the rated load the difference is found to be within 10% while the difference is slightly higher at loads less than 25%. It was also observed that the error was in the range of 10-20% at modified fuel injection timings for all the three esters at standard injection timing. This correlation yields comparatively accurate results for all the fuels at loads greater than 25% of the rated load and at standard fuel injection timing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A pilot-scale microwave heating apparatus was constructed for the production of bio-oil from sewage sludge, and the effects of important microwave processing parameters and chemical additives on the quality and yield of bio-oils were investigated. It was found that bio-oil was mainly formed at the pyrolysis temperature range of 200-400 °C. A higher heating rate (faster pyrolysis) not only increased the yield of bio-oil, but also improved the quality of bio-oil according to the elemental composition and calorific values. The maximum bio-oil yield was 30.4% of organic fraction, obtained from the pyrolysis of original sewage sludge at microwave radiation power of 8.8 kW and final pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C. All of five simple additives (KOH, H2SO4, H3BO3, ZnCl2, and FeSO4) reduced the bio-oil yield, but the composition and property of bio-oil varied with the additive types greatly. KOH, H2SO 4, H3BO3 and FeSO4 were found to improve the quality of bio-oils remarkably according to the calorific value, density, viscosity and carbon content of bio-oils, but ZnCl2 treatment went against that. GC-MS analysis of the bio-oils showed that, alkali treatment promoted the formation of alkanes and monoaromatics, while acid treatment favored the formation of heterocyclics, ketones, alcohols and nitriles. Compared with sulfate slat FeSO4, chloride salt ZnCl 2 was a better catalyst for selective catalytic pyrolysis of sewage sludge. The addition of ZnCl2 only promoted the formation reactions of a few kinds of nitriles and ketones remarkably. It is technologically feasible to produce bio-oil form microwave-induced pyrolysis of sewage sludge by optimizing pyrolysis conditions and selecting appropriate additives. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Effects of reaction temperature, reaction time and water amount on the hydrothermal liquefaction of cypress, were studied in this paper. The reaction system was divided into gas lump, water-soluble oil lump, heavy oil lump, volatile organic compounds lump, and solid residue lump. Results showed that temperature was the critical parameter for 5-lump distribution in the cypress hydrothermal conversion process. The higher temperature and longer reaction time were not usually suitable for the production of bio-oil (water-soluble oil and heavy oil). The increase in the yields of gas and volatile organic compounds was also observed as temperature was increased. However, the yield of the volatile organic compounds increased first, and then decreased with the reaction time and the water amount. High amount of water led to high conversion and bio-oil yield. The FT-IR analysis of the solid residues showed that the major peaks of cypress diminished after 280 °C. The GC-MS analysis showed that the volatile organic compounds, water-soluble oil and heavy oil comprised a mixture of organic compounds of 5-7, 5-10 and 7-26 carbons, respectively, which mainly included furfural, phenol, acids, furans and their derivatives. The WSO had similar elemental compositions but the HO had a higher content of carbon and a lower concentration of oxygen as compared to cypress. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-catalytic transesterification of camelina sativa oil under supercritical ethanol (SCE) conditions with hexane as a co-solvent was investigated to study the fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) yields. This process enables simultaneous transesterification of triglycerides and ethyl esterification of fatty acids in a shorter reaction of time and may reduce the energy consumption due to simplified separation and purification steps. It was found that the co-solvent plays a vital role in reducing the severity of critical operational parameters and maximizes the biodiesel yield. The important variables affecting the ethyl ester yield during the transesterification reaction are the molar ratio of alcohol/oil, reaction time, reaction temperature and co-solvent to oil ratio. Camelina biodiesel samples were analyzed using FT-IR, GC-MS and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. The fuel properties of camelina biodiesel produced were compared with those of the regular diesel and found to be conforming to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTMs) standards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrogen production was studied in the catalytic steam reforming of a synthetic and a real aqueous fraction of bio-oil. Ni/Al coprecipitated catalysts with varying nickel content (23, 28 and 33 relative atomic %) were prepared by an increasing pH technique and tested during 2 h under different experimental conditions in a small bench scale fixed bed setup. The 28% Ni catalyst yielded a more stable performance over time (steam-to-carbon molar ratio, S/C = 5.58) at 650 C and a catalyst weight/organic flow rate (W/morg) ratio of 1.7 g catalyst min/g organic. Using the synthetic aqueous fraction as feed, almost complete overall carbon conversion to gas and hydrogen yields close to equilibrium could be obtained with the 28% Ni catalyst throughout. Up to 63% of overall carbon conversion to gas and an overall hydrogen yield of 0.09 g/g organic could be achieved when using the real aqueous fraction of bio-oil, but the catalyst performance showed a decay with time after 20 min of reaction due to severe coke deposition. Increasing the W/morg ratio up to 5 g catalyst min/g organic yielded a more stable catalyst performance throughout, but overall carbon conversion to gas did not surpass 83% and the overall hydrogen yield was only ca. 77% of the thermodynamic equilibrium. Increasing reaction temperatures (600-800 C) up to 750 C enhanced the overall carbon conversion to gas and the overall yield to hydrogen. However, at 800 C the catalyst performance was slightly worse, as a result of an increase in thermal cracking reactions leading to an increased formation of carbon deposits. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel is an environmental-friendly fuel that can replace petroleum diesel. However, after transesterification reaction of vegetable oils, the obtained crude biodiesel must be purified. The commonly applied purification step is water washing. This step is a concern in biodiesel production, since large quantities of clean water are used, generating a wastewater stream to be further treated. Here we propose the application of microand ultrafiltration processes to purify crude biodiesel. Crude biodiesel was filtrated in a dead-end process at different transmembrane pressures and using membranes of different pore sizes. Flux results showed that greater transmembrane pressures, as well as greater pore sizes, enablegreater fluxes. Density, viscosity and acid values of purified biodiesel (washed and filtrated) are in accordance to the international legislation for biodiesel quality. Both processes (water washing and membrane separation) were able to reduce the amount of soap detected in crude biodiesel. However, the proposed microfiltration membranes were not efficient as the washing method to reduce the free glycerol content. The ultrafiltration membrane of 30kDa was also not able to produce a purified biodiesel according to the international legislation for free glycerol content. Between the analyzed membranes, the glycerol content limit (less than 0.02wt%) was achieved only with the ultrafiltration membrane of 10kDa. Water addition in the crude biodiesel improved the glycerol removal by membrane filtration. The obtained results showed that the membrane separation process is a suitable alternative for biodiesel purification. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Red mud was investigated in triglyceride transesterification with a view to determine its viability as a basic catalyst for use in biodiesel synthesis. The effect of calcination temperature on the structure and activity of red mud catalysts was investigated. It was found that highly active catalyst was obtained by simply drying red mud at 200°C. Utilization of red mud as a catalyst for biodiesel production not only provides a cost-eifective and environmentally friendly way of recycling this solid red mud waste, significantly reducing its environmental effects, but also reduces the price of biodiesel to make biodiesel competitive with petroleum diesel. © 2013 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The preparation of a variety of sulfonated carbons and their use in the esterification of oleic acid is reported. All sulfonated materials show some loss in activity associated with the leaching of active sites. Exhaustive leaching shows that a finite amount of activity is lost from the carbons in the form of colloids. Fully leached catalysts show no loss in activity upon recycling. The best catalysts; 1, 3, and 6; show initial TOFs of 0.07s-1, 0.05s-1, and 0.14s-1, respectively. These compare favorably with literature values. Significantly, the leachate solutions obtained from catalysts 1, 3, and 6, also show excellent esterification activity. The results of TEM and catalyst poisoning experiments on the leachate solutions associate the catalytic activity of these solutions with carbon colloids. This mechanism for leaching active sites from sulfonated carbons is previously unrecognized. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A continuous process involving gasification, syngas cleaning, and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis was developed to efficiently produce synthetic aviation turbine fuels (SATFs). Oak-tree wood chips were first gasified to syngas over a commercial pilot plant downdraft gasifier. The raw wood syngas contains about 47% N2, 21% CO, 18% H2, 12% CO2, 2% CH4 and trace amounts of impurities. A purification reaction system was designed to remove the impurities in the syngas such as moisture, oxygen, sulfur, ammonia, and tar. The purified syngas meets the requirements for catalytic conversion to liquid fuels. A multi-functional catalyst was developed and tested for the catalytic conversion of wood syngas to SATFs. It was demonstrated that liquid fuels similar to commercial aviation turbine fuels (Jet A) was successfully synthesized from bio-syngas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel concept and efficient method for producing biodiesel (FAME) from grease (15-40. wt% free fatty acid, FFA) were developed by using tandem lipases for one-pot esterification of FFA and transesterification of triglyceride with methanol in a solvent-free system. Combining immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) (Novozyme 435) favoring the esterification and immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) (Lipozyme TLIM) preferring the transesterification at 2:8 (wt/wt) gave FAME in 80% yield, being better than that with Novozyme 435 or Lipozyme TLIM. Recombinant Escherichia coli (Calb/Tll) co-expressing CALB and TLL was engineered as a more efficient tandem-lipases system. Using wet or dry cells (4. wt%) gave FAME in 87% or 95% yield, which is much better than that with E. coli cells expressing either CALB or TLL alone. Cells of E. coli (Calb/Tll) were recycled for five times and retained 75% productivity, thus being practical for producing biodiesel from grease. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nanoporous films of indium tin oxide (ITO), with thicknesses ranging from 250 nm to 2 μm, were prepared by Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) and used as highly sensitive transparent 3D-electrodes for quantitatively interrogating, by time-resolved spectroelectrochemistry, the reactivity of microperoxidase-11 (MP-11) adsorbed within such films. The capacitive current densities of these 3D-electrodes as well as the amount of adsorbed MP-11 were shown to be linearly correlated to the GLAD ITO film thickness, indicating a homogeneous distribution of MP-11 across the film as well as homogeneous film porosity. Under saturating adsorption conditions, MP-11 film concentration as high as 60 mM was reached. This is equivalent to a stack of 110 monolayers of MP-11 per micrometer film thickness. This high MP-11 film loading combined with the excellent ITO film conductivity has allowed the simultaneous characterization of the heterogeneous one-electron transfer dynamics of the MP-11 Fe III/Fe II redox couple by cyclic voltammetry and cyclic voltabsorptometry, up to a scan rate of few volts per second with a satisfactory single-scan signal-to-noise ratio. The potency of the method to unravel complex redox coupled chemical reactions was also demonstrated with the catalytic reduction of oxygen by MP-11. In the presence of O 2, cross-correlation of electrochemical and spectroscopic data has allowed us to determine the key kinetics and thermodynamics parameters of the redox catalysis that otherwise could not be easily extracted using conventional protein film voltammetry. On the basis of numerical simulations of cyclic voltammograms and voltabsorptograms and within the framework of different plausible catalytic reaction schemes including appropriate approximations, it was shown possible to discriminate between different possible catalytic pathways and to identify the relevant catalytic cycle. In addition, from the best fits of simulations to the experimental voltammograms and voltabsorptograms, the partition coefficient of O 2 for the ITO film as well as the values of two kinetic rate constants could be extracted. It was finally concluded that the catalytic reduction of O 2 by MP-11 adsorbed within nanoporous ITO films occurs via a 2-electron mechanism with the formation of an intermediate Fe III-OOH adduct characterized by a decay rate of 11 s -1. The spectroelectroanalytical strategy presented here opens new opportunities for characterizing complex redox-coupled chemical reactions not only with redox proteins, but also with redox biomimetic systems and catalysts. It might also be of great interest for the development and optimization of new spectroelectrochemical sensors and biosensors, or eventually new photoelectrocatalytic systems or biofuel cells. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were produced from edible, non-edible and used cooking oils with different fatty acid contents by transesterification with methanol using calcined layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as solid base catalysts. Among the catalysts, calcined CaAl2-LDH (hydrocalumite) showed the highest activity with &gt;90% yield of FAME using low methanol:oil molar ratio (&lt;6:1) at 65°C in 5h. The activity of the catalyst was attributed to its high basicity as supported by Hammett studies and CO 2-TPD measurements. The catalyst was successfully reused in up to four cycles. Some of the properties such as density, viscosity, neutralization number and glycerol content of the obtained biodiesel matched well with the standard DIN values. It is concluded that a scalable heterogeneously catalyzed process for production of biodiesel in high yields from a wide variety of triglyceride oils including used oils is possible using optimized conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Refined Jatropha curcas L. oil (JCO) and methanol were used as the reactants for the transesterification reactions in a Radleys reactor in the presence of a heterogeneous ash catalyst derived from the waste aquatic plant Lemna perpusilla Torrey. Physical characterization of the catalyst showed partly crystalline behaviour and a moderate surface area 9.622m2g-1. The L. perpusilla Torrey ashes obtained from traditional combustion method were further calcined at 550±5°C before use. In addition to other non-metal and metallic constitutes the ash contains 11.3% potassium which attributed to its catalytic behaviour. The cumulative mass fraction of 89.43% of the oil was converted to biodiesel at 65±5°C in 5h at 1:9M ratio of oil to alcohol with 5% of the ash as catalyst. The biodiesel (FAME) so obtained were characterized using appropriate ASTM methods and found within the defined standard limits. The catalyst could be reused upto 3-times but there is a reduction of efficacy by about 25% for 3rd consecutive batch reaction. The activation energy was calculated for FAME and found to be 29.49kJmol-1. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Investigation of soot and ash particulate matter deposited in diesel particulate filters (DPFs) operating with biofuel (B100) and diesel (pure diesel: B0 and diesel80/biofuel20 blend: B20) by means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals the following: the rapeseed methyl ester biofuel used for this study contributes to ash production, mainly of Ca-S- and P-bearing compounds ranging in size between 50 and 300 nm. Smaller ash particles are less common and build aggregates. Ash is deposited on the inlet DPF surface, the inlet channel walls, and in B100-DPF at the plugged ends of inlet channels. The presence of Fe-Cr-Ni fragments, down to tens of nanometers in size within the ash is attributed to engine wear. Pt particles (50-400 nm large) within the ash indicate that the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) upstream of the DPF shows aging effects. Radial cracks on the coating layer of the DOC confirm this assumption. The B100-DPF contains significantly less soot than B20 and B0. Based on the generally accepted view that soot reactivity correlates with the nanostructure of its primary particles, the length and curvature of graphene sheets from biofuel- and diesel-derived soot were measured and computed on the basis of HRTEM images. The results show that biofuel-derived soot can be more easily oxidized than diesel soot, not only during early formation but also during and after considerable particle growth. Differences in the graphene sheet separation distance, degree of crystalline order and size of primary soot particles between the two fuel types are in line with this inference. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.

AB  - Miniature, self-contained biodevices powered by biofuel cells may enable a new generation of implantable, wireless, minimally invasive neural interfaces for neurophysiological in vivo studies and for clinical applications. Here we report on the fabrication of a direct electron transfer based glucose/oxygen enzymatic fuel cell (EFC) from genuinely three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured microscale gold electrodes, modified with suitable biocatalysts. We show that the process underlying the simple fabrication method of 3D nanostructured electrodes is based on an electrochemically driven transformation of physically deposited gold nanoparticles. We experimentally demonstrate that mediator-, cofactor-, and membrane-less EFCs do operate in cerebrospinal fluid and in the brain of a rat, producing amounts of electrical power sufficient to drive a self-contained biodevice, viz. 7μW cm-2 in vitro and 2μW cm-2 in vivo at an operating voltage of 0.4â.V. Last but not least, we also demonstrate an inductive coupling between 3D nanobioelectrodes and living neurons.

AB  - Fundamental insights into the macromolecular architecture of plant cell walls will elucidate new structure-property relationships and facilitate optimization of catalytic processes that produce fuels and chemicals from biomass. Here we introduce computational methodology to extract nanoscale geometry of cellulose microfibrils within thermochemically treated biomass directly from electron tomographic data sets. We quantitatively compare the cell wall nanostructure in corn stover following two leading pretreatment strategies: dilute acid with iron sulfate co-catalyst and ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX). Computational analysis of the tomographic data is used to extract mathematical descriptions for longitudinal axes of cellulose microfibrils from which we calculate their nanoscale curvature. These nanostructural measurements are used to inform the construction of atomistic models that exhibit features of cellulose within real, process-relevant biomass. By computational evaluation of these atomic models, we propose relationships between the crystal structure of cellulose Iβ and the nanoscale geometry of cellulose microfibrils. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential use of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil (WCO) in Mexico and its CO2 emission reduction potential for the Mexican transport sector and associated costs. The results show, based on 2010 data, that the potential of biodiesel from WCO is between 7.8PJ and 17.7PJ that represent between 1.5% and 3.3% of petro-diesel consumption for the road transport sector and can reduce between 0.51 and 1.02Mt of CO2, (1.0%-2.7% of CO2-associated emissions), depending on the recovery ratio of WCO from vegetable oil consumption for cooking and considering CO2 emissions for biodiesel production and methanol emissions during production and combustion in the blend. Primary energy used to produce 1MJ of WCO-biodiesel is 0.8727MJ, while literature reports 1.2007MJ to produce 1MJ of petro-diesel. Biodiesel costs are similar to petro-diesel costs if WCO is free. The paper offers suggestions for policies that promote increased recollection of WCO for biodiesel production and reduced illegal marketing of WCO, which is the main barrier to increase biodiesel production from WCO. The data used for the analysis is based on a case study of a WCO biodiesel plant that operates in Mexico City. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - NiFe bimetallic catalyst shows an excellent activity and selectivity for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of three typical model compounds of bio-oil. The conversion of furfuryl alcohol, benzene alcohol and ethyl oenanthate is 100, 95.48 and 97.89% at 400 C and the yield to 2-methylfuran, toluene and heptane is 98.85, 93.49 and 96.11% at 0.1 ml/min flow speed and atmospheric pressure. It indicates that the major reaction pathway is the cleavage of C-O rather than C-C. After the catalytic HDO of bio-oil over NiFe/Al2O3 catalyst, the heating value changes from 37.8 to 43.9 MJ/kg, the pH changes from 6.65 to 7.50. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent decades, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been considered as a green platform molecule with a wide range of applications in manufacturing fine chemicals and biofuels. As the most abundant organic material on earth, cellulose has received increasing attention as a potential material for the production of biofuels and bio-based chemicals. Efficient methods for transforming cellulose into HMF need to be developed to achieve the successful commercialization of HMF in the near future. A new process for the efficient and selective conversion of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) to HMF was developed by using an InCl3-ionic liquid catalytic system. The effect of reaction conditions, such as reaction time, temperature, catalyst dosage, and various acidic ionic liquids were investigated in detail. The results showed that 45.3% HMF yield and 84.6% MCC conversion were obtained with the presence of 1-methyl-3-(3-sulfopropyl)-imidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([C3SO 3Hmim][HSO4]) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) by adding a catalytic amount of InCl3 under atmospheric pressure within 5 h at 160 °C. Recycling of the [C3SO3Hmim][HSO4] and InCl3 catalyst exhibited an almost constant activity during five successive trials. A mechanism was proposed to explain the high activity of InCl3 in [C3SO3Hmim][HSO4]. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biodiesel production from transesterification of vegetable oils in excess methanol was performed by using as-prepared catalyst from low-cost kaolin clay. This effective heterogeneous catalyst was successfully prepared from natural kaolin firstly by dehydroxylation at 800. °C for 10. h and, subsequently, by NaOH-activation hydrothermally at 90. °C for 24. h and calcined again at 500. °C for 6. h. The as-obtained catalytic material was characterized with instruments, including FT-IR, XRD, SEM, and porosimeter (BET/BJH analysis). The as-prepared catalyst was advantageous not only for its easy preparation, but also for its cost-efficiency and superior catalysis in transesterification of vegetable oils in excess methanol to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Conversion efficiencies of soybean and palm oils to biodiesel over the as-prepared catalysts reached 97.0. ±. 3.0% and 95.4. ±. 3.7%, respectively, under optimal conditions. Activation energies of transesterification reactions of soybean and palm oils in excess methanol using these catalysts are 14.09. kJ/mol and 48.87. kJ/mol, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fuel grade bioethanol can be produced from a number of lignocellulosic biomass sources. In the present paper the enzymatic hydrolysis of giant reed (Arundo donax) at high biomass loadings up to 20% (w/v) was investigated. Two pretreatment technologies were used: one step steam explosion (SE) with and without acid catalyst and the novel pilot process from Chemtex consisting in a two steps pretreatment. The results of the biomass composition after different pretreatment conditions along with the corresponding enzymatic hydrolizability at low solids loading, indicated that the best pretreatments were the acid catalyzed steam explosion (ACSE) at 200 °C and the Chemtex process in which the SE step was carried out at 206 for 4. min. Various process configurations, including biomass and enzymes fed-batch, were investigated to avoid excessive viscosities and increase the cellulose conversion. Novel enzymatic preparations from Novozymes, Cellic™ Ctec1 and Cellic™ Ctec2, were used for the biomass saccharification. Concerning the analysis of the factors that limited the hydrolysis yields at high DM content, some evidences indicated that product inhibition by xylooligomers could have an important role. The highest solids loading investigated in the present paper was 21%. Under these conditions and by using an enzymes loading of 0.28. g Ctec2/g glucan, an overall sugars concentration of 91. g/L (glucose. +. xylose) can be obtained after 48. h from ACSE at 200 °C. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The degradation of the plant cell wall by glycoside hydrolases is central to environmentally sustainable industries. The major polysaccharides of the plant cell wall are cellulose and xylan, a highly decorated β-1,4- xylopyranose polymer. Glycoside hydrolases displaying multiple catalytic functions may simplify the enzymes required to degrade plant cell walls, increasing the industrial potential of these composite structures. Here we test the hypothesis that glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH43) provides a suitable scaffold for introducing additional catalytic functions into enzymes that target complex structures in the plant cell wall. We report the crystal structure of Humicola insolens AXHd3 (HiAXHd3), a GH43 arabinofuranosidase that hydrolyses O3-linked arabinose of doubly substituted xylans, a feature of the polysaccharide that is recalcitrant to degradation. HiAXHd3 displays an N-terminal five-bladed β-propeller domain and a C-terminal β-sandwich domain. The interface between the domains comprises a xylan binding cleft that houses the active site pocket. Substrate specificity is conferred by a shallow arabinose binding pocket adjacent to the deep active site pocket, and through the orientation of the xylan backbone. Modification of the rim of the active site introduces endo-xylanase activity, whereas the resultant enzyme variant, Y166A, retains arabinofuranosidase activity. These data show that the active site of HiAXHd3 is tuned to hydrolyse arabinofuranosyl or xylosyl linkages, and it is the topology of the distal regions of the substrate binding surface that confers specificity. This report demonstrates that GH43 provides a platform for generating bespoke multifunctional enzymes that target industrially significant complex substrates, exemplified by the plant cell wall.

AB  - A promising alternative to the first generation of bio-fuels is to produce mixed bio- and fossil fuels by co-processing mixtures of biomass pyrolysis oil with crude oil fractions obtained from distillation in a conventional oil refinery. This was demonstrated to be technically feasible for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which is the main refinery process for producing gasoline. However, co-processing leads to more coke formation and to a more aromatic gasoline fraction. A detailed understanding is necessary on how the oxygenated moieties effect the reaction mechanism to further improve the process/catalysts. Moreover, for technical and marketing reasons, it is absolutely required to accurately determine the proportion of renewable molecules in the commercialized products. The carbon-14 method (also called radiocarbon or 14C) has been used as the most accurate and powerful method to discriminate fossil carbon from bio-carbon, since fossil fuel is virtually 14C-free, while biofuel contains the present-day “natural” amount of 14C. This technique has shown that not all FCC products share bio-carbon statistically. The coke formed during a FCC cycle and to a lesser extent the gases are found richer in 14C than gasoline. This result gives valuable information on the co-processing mechanism, supporting that the bio-oil oxygenated molecules are processed more easily at the expenses of the crude oil hydrocarbons, favouring the bio-coke and the bio-light gases production. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In the present study the effect of temperature, reaction time and dilute oxalic acid (OA) concentration during steam-pretreatment of Miscanthus×gigantueus has been evaluated using the combined severity factor (CS). At the highest CS glucan and lignin content in the water insoluble fraction (WIF) increased, while xylan content decreased. While glucose recovery in the water soluble fraction (WSF) was found at low concentration when mild CS were used (≤5.0gL-1 at CS≤2.17), xylose and arabinose concentrations were higher at low-mild CS (1.58-2.17) with a concentration peak at CS 2.03 (39.9 and 3.2gL-1 for xylose and arabinose, respectively). The decrease in pentoses coincided with inhibitory formation in the WSF, namely acetic acid, furfural, HMF and phenolic compounds. Glucan conversion rose from 46.1% at CS 1.54 to 91.2% at CS 2.76. Likewise, maximum ethanol concentration was achieved at CS 2.76, corresponding to 20.2gL-1 and a volumetric ethanol productivity of 0.28gL-1h-1. Negative correlations have been found between xylan vs. glucan conversion and xylan vs. ethanol production, suggesting that decreasing the xylan content in WIF increases both saccharification rate and ethanol concentration (R2 0.91 and R2 0.93, respectively). On the other hand, a positive correlation was found between ethanol production and glucan conversion (R2 0.93). Fermentation of WSF by Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis CBS 6054 at CS 1.54 produced 12.1gL-1 of ethanol after 96h incubation with a volumetric ethanol productivity of 0.13gL-1h-1. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of spherical millimetric gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) as a catalyst support for the production of biodiesel from palm oil is demonstrated. The catalyst support was produced using a dripping method, and KF and NaNO3 catalysts were loaded on the support using the impregnation method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the formation of Na2O and NaAlO2 phases on the NaNO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and the formation of K2O and KAlF4 on the KF/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, which were possibly the active sites for the transesterification reaction. The highest number and strength of basic sites generated from the solid phase reaction of the KF/γ-Al2O3 catalyst loaded with 0.24g kF/g γ-Al2O3 and the NaNO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst loaded with 0.30g NaNO3/g γ-Al2O3 were confirmed by temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) analysis. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms also revealed a mesoporous structure of the catalysts. The biodiesel yield was comparable to that produced from smaller catalysts, and this result indicated the potential of the macrospherical catalysts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels derived from pyrolysis of microalgae can be potential alternatives for petroleum-derived fuels. Pyrolysis is an easily controllable thermochemical conversion process that yields energy fuels such as bio-oil, char and combustible gases. Microalgae is a very promising feedstock for this process since it has high lipid content, grows faster than lignocellulosic biomass, has high productivity and high photosynthetic efficiency. Several reaction parameters including temperature could affect the yield and quality of biofuels from pyrolysis. This paper aimed to evaluate the effect of temperature during pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis oculata using a pressurized fixed-bed batch-type reactor. Based on the results, the distribution of the products significantly varied with pyrolysis temperature, and the pyrolysis process can be manipulated to favor one of its products. Bio-oil with high heating value (HHV) of about 38 MJ/kg, due to its high carbon (76wt%) and hydrogen (11wt%) contents, and low oxygen content (7wt%), can be produced from N. oculata. It also consists mainly of saturated (34.95%) and unsaturated aliphatics (34.43%), and aromatics (14.19%) ranging from C8 to C21, which is comparable to diesel fuel. The HHV of the char (27 MJ/kg) and gas (27 MJ/m3) were also relatively high. Based on their heating values (HHV) and compositions, the char, bio-oil and gas produced from pyrolysis of N. oculata can be potentially used as alternative sources of energy. Mass and energy conversion efficiencies of the process were also estimated to be approximately equal to 76% and 68%, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Duckweed, a small floating aquatic plant, is a novel bioenergy crop with great potential to accumulate starch. Three factors involved in the growth and starch accumulation of duckweed were investigated in the field: population, harvesting frequency and nutrient supply. Under identical conditions, Landoltia S3 had the highest maximum growth rate at 30.35g/m2/week; Lemna P1 had the highest N and P absorption rates at 0.622gN/m2/week and 0.135gP/m2/week, respectively; Landoltia OT had the highest starch accumulation rate at 3.88g/m2/week. The protein and P contents in each population decreased as the growth rate slowed. Different harvesting frequencies resulted in different growth rates. However, their biomass had almost the same composition. The addition of 15, 30 and 45ppm NH4+-N inhibited the growth of duckweed. The addition of CaO or microelements dramatically increased duckweed growth. By adding microelements, duckweed could grow in cold weather for an increased time period. With pond water and no sediment supply, duckweed reached the highest starch content of 52.9% with the lowest growth rate, which was the highest starch content in duckweed in the field in literatures. Starch content was negatively correlated with the growth rate, protein and P contents, which suggests that a high growth rate and high starch content in duckweed could hardly be acquired simultaneously. According to this systemic study, an operation process for harvesting high starch duckweed was proposed, paving the way for the large scale exploitation and application of duckweed in bioenergy and feed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A method is proposed to estimate the enthalpy of bio-oil in the vapor phase, Hbo, as a function of temperature in the range 298.15-1000 K, of which experimental determination has not been done so far. The two equations proposed in this work allow estimation of the standard enthalpy of formation, Hbo,0, and the difference in the enthalpy between 298.15 K and a given temperature, ΔHbo(T), respectively, only based on the overall C, H, and O contents of crude bio-oil of that N and S contents are lower than 0.5 and 0.1 wt %-daf, respectively. These equations were optimized using thermodynamic data of 290 and 141 organic compounds for Hbo,0, and ΔHbo(T), respectively. Given the yields of bio-oil, char, and gas, elemental compositions of the bio-oil and char, and chemical composition of the gas, proposed equations predict the heat required for biomass pyrolysis, Qpy(Tpy), which is defined as the enthalpy difference between the products at the pyrolysis temperature, Tpy, and the biomass at 298.15 K. The predicted Qpy at Tpy = 773-823 K for five different types of dry biomass was in the range of 1.1-1.6 MJ kg -1. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Due to the high content (25-50%) of free fatty acid (FFA), crude rice bran oil usually requires a two steps conversion or one step conversion with very harsh condition for simultaneous esterification and transesterification. In this study, chlorosulfonic acid modified zirconia (HClSO3-ZrO2) with strong acidity and durability is prepared and it shows excellent catalytic activity toward simultaneous esterification and transesterification. Under a relative low reaction temperature of 120°C, HClSO3-ZrO2 catalyzes a complete conversion of simulated crude rice bran oil (refined oil with 40wt% FFA) into biodiesel and the conversion yield keep at above 92% for at least three cycles. Further investigation on the tolerance towards FFA and water reveals that it maintains high activity even with the presence of 40wt% FFA and 3wt% water. It shows that HClSO3-ZrO2 is a robust and durable catalyst which shows high potential to be commercial catalyst for biodiesel production from low grade feedstock. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to research the catalytic effects on the microwave pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and thus to discuss the reaction performance, product distribution, and kinetic analysis. With the addition of metal-oxides served as catalysts, reaction results such as mass reduction ratio and reaction rate increased, even the maximum temperature decreased. Adding either NiO or CaO slightly increased the production of H2, while adding either CuO or MgO slightly decreased it. The addition of either CaO or MgO enhanced the gaseous production, and either NiO or CuO addition enhanced the liquid production. There could be several secondary reactions such as self-gasification and interactions among the gases originally produced during the pyrolysis stage to alter the composition of gaseous product and the final three-phase product distribution. The catalyst addition slightly increased the activation energy but greatly increased the pre-exponential factor. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To examine the feasibility of integrating microbial fuel cells (MFCs) into an activated sludge process, three MFCs with different ion exchange membranes and/or cathode catalysts were installed in an aeration tank to treat primary effluent. Both contaminant treatment and electricity generation were studied during the operation for more than 400. days. The effects of membrane/catalysts on MFC performance were not observed, likely due to the low removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) (<53%) caused by low electricity generation. The MFCs did not achieve any obvious removal of nutrients. The produced energy was lower than the theoretic energy consumption. The performance was seriously affected by cathode biofouling, variation of wastewater quality, and other operating conditions. Unlike prior lab studies by others, the results of this study suggest that MFCs may not be suitable for deployment in an aeration tank, unless the key problems such as biofouling are solved. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Olive tree biomass (OTB) is an agricultural residue which can be used as raw material for bioethanol production. OTB was pretreated with 0.05-0.275M FeCl3 solutions at 120-180°C for 0-30min. Enzymatic hydrolysis yields were used for assessing pretreatment performance. Optimum FeCl3 pretreatment conditions were found to be 152.6°C, 0.26M FeCl3 for 30min. Under such conditions, 100% of hemicellulose was removed, and enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated solids resulted in a yield of 36.6g glucose/100g of glucose in the raw material. Hemicellulosic sugar recovery in the prehydrolysate was 63.2%. Results compare well with those obtained by other pretreatment strategies on the same raw material, confirming FeCl3 solutions as a new, feasible approach for bioethanol production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Etherification of glycerol (GLY) with isobutylene (IB) to produce biofuels was investigated in liquid phase using spherical silica supported Hyflon® catalysts (SSHC). As reference catalyst, Amberlyst® 15 (A-15) acid ion-exchange resin was used. Experiments were carried out in batch mode at a reaction temperature ranging from 323 to 343K. SSHC were found to be very effective systems in etherification of glycerol with IB, providing cumulative di- and tri-ethers yields higher than that obtained by using A-15 catalyst. Furthermore, such catalysts were stable and easily reusable; no leaching of active phase was observed. The formation of poly-substituted ethers, suitable additives for conventional fuels, was favored by operating at an isobutylene/glycerol molar ratio &gt;3 and low reaction time (&lt;6h); however, the concentration of mono-ether reached values lower than 3wt.% only when SSHC catalyst was used. Turnover frequency of glycerol (TOF GLY) highlighted that SSHC systems were much more active than A-15 catalyst: the accessibility and nature of active sites and the surface properties of catalysts were indicated as the main factors affecting the catalytic behavior. A lower acid site density of SSHC than that of A-15 catalyst was decisive in preventing the occurrence of oligomerization reaction which leads to the formation of di-isobutylene (DIB), precursors of gummy products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environment-friendly treatment of sewage sludge has become tremendously important. Conversion of sewage sludge into energy products by environment-friendly conversion process, with its energy recovery and environmental benefits, is being paid significant attention. Direct liquefaction of sewage sludge into bio-oils with supercritical water (SCW) was therefore put forward in this study, as de-water usually requiring intensive energy input is not necessary in this direct liquefaction. Supercritical water may act as a strong solvent and also a reactant, as well as catalyst promoting reaction process. Experiments were carried out in a self designed high-pressure reaction system with varying operating conditions. Through orthogonal experiments, it was found that temperature and residence time dominated on bio-oil yield compared with other operating parameters. Temperature from 350 to 500. °C and reaction residence time of 0, 30, 60. min were accordingly investigated in details, respectively. Under supercritical conversion, the maximum bio-oil yield could achieve 39.73%, which was performed at 375. °C and 0. min reaction residence time. Meanwhile, function of supercritical water was concluded. Fuel property analysis showed the potential of bio-oil application as crude fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Piggery effluent is one of the most highly produced wastewaters throughout the world, containing high levels of inorganic nutrient species. In this study, a microalga Scenedesmus obliquus YSW-14 (S. obliquus) was employed not only for nutrient removal from piggery wastewater effluent but also for lipid accumulation in the algal biomass as a feedstock for biofuel production. The piggery wastewater effluent was diluted up to fivefold with synthetic media to reduce the toxicity of (in)organic components, which resulted in improved microalgal growth, nutrient removal, and lipid productivity. Among the examined culture conditions, a 40% concentration of wastewater effluent was found to be most effective for microalga lipid productivity (0.13 mg L-1). S. obliquus removed 155 mg total nitrogen and 4 mg total phosphate per gram of dried algae for growth at the same dilution condition. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using microalgae for advanced wastewater treatment and subsequent production of lipids as biofuel feedstock. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - A utilization way of herb residues is designed to convert herb residues to gas fuel in industrial-scale by a circulating fluidized bed gasifier in this paper. The product gas is used in the production of Chinese medicine, and the heat of the flue gas from the boiler can be used in herb residues drying to realize the energy recycling and no herb residues discharge. The gasification characteristics of herb residues in the circulating fluidized bed of 300kg/h were investigated for about 200h. The results indicated that the gas composition and tar yield were affected by biomass flow rate, equivalence ratio (ER), moisture content and char circulating. The lower heating value of product gas was 4-5MJ/m3 using herb residues as feedstock. When mean biomass flow rate was at 5.5kgm-2s-1 and ER at 0.35, the product gas reached a good condition with lower heating value of 4.89MJ/m3 and cold gas efficiency of 62.36%. When the moisture content changed from 12.5% to 18.7%, the concentrations of H2, CO and CO2 changed from 4.66% to 6.92%, 11.23% to 10.15%, and 16.55% to 17.82% respectively, and the tar content in gas decreased from 15.1g/m3 to 14.4g/m3 when the moisture content increased from 12.5% to 15.4%. There are metal oxides in the ash of herb residues, especially CaO, MgO, K2O, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 which have obvious function on tar catalytic decomposition. The ash that attaches to the char particles can decrease the tar yield and improve the quality of gas after returning to the gasifier. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) based on cations with long alkyl side-chains (e.g. N-octadecyl-N′,N′′,N′′′- trimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C18tma] [NTf2])) are switchable ionic liquid/solid phases with temperature that behave as sponges. As liquid phases, they are excellent monophasic reaction media for lipase-catalyzed methanolysis of triolein, resulting in fast and efficient biodiesel synthesis, e.g. up to 100% yield in 8 h at 60 °C, with exceptional enzyme stability (up to 1370 days half-life time at 60 °C). As solid phases, the reaction mixture can easily be fractionated by iterative centrifugations at controlled temperature into three phases, i.e. solid IL, glycerol and pure biodiesel. A straightforward and sustainable approach for producing biodiesel has been developed, allowing full recovery and reuse of the biocatalyst-IL system for successive cycles and suitable for scaling-up. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - In this work, preparation of granular activated carbon from oil palm biodiesel solid residue, oil palm shell (PSAC) by microwave assisted KOH activation has been attempted. The physical and chemical properties of PSAC were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, volumetric adsorption analyzer and elemental analysis. The adsorption behavior was examined by performing batch adsorption experiments using methylene blue as dye model compound. Equilibrium data were simulated using the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. Kinetic modeling was fitted to the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and Elovich kinetic models, while the adsorption mechanism was determined using the intraparticle diffusion and Boyd equations. The result was satisfactory fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model with a monolayer adsorption capacity of 343.94. mg/g at 30 °C. The findings support the potential of oil palm shell for preparation of high surface area activated carbon by microwave assisted KOH activation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of reaction temperature, retention time, biomass content, and catalyst loading on bio-oil yield, carbon content, and carbon recovery of corncob hydrothermal conversion was investigated and optimized via response surface methodology (RSM). The four variables ranged from 280 to 340. °C for temperature, 12-48. min for retention time, 9-21% for biomass solid content, and 0.76-2.25% for catalyst loading. It was found from RSM modeling that higher bio-oil yield and higher carbon recovery could be achieved at relatively low temperatures and short retention times with high biomass solid contents and moderate alkaline catalyst loadings in the test ranges. A maximum bio-oil yield of 41.3% and maximum carbon recovery of 47.1% were obtained at 280. °C, 12. min, and 21% biomass solid content with 1.03-1.56% catalyst loading. Bio-oil carbon content was found affected only by the reaction temperature and biomass solid content in the RSM model. Higher temperature and lower biomass solid content were favored. The highest bio-oil carbon content of 74.8% was achieved at 340. °C with 9% biomass solid content. The predicted bio-oil yield, carbon content and carbon recovery were in close agreement with validation experiment results, indicating that the RSM models were accurate in designing and optimizing the hydrothermal conversion of corncobs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were covalently modified with anthracene and anthraquinone and used for the construction of cathodes for biocatalytic reduction of dioxygen. The nanotubes with aromatic groups casted onto the electrode increased the working surface of the electrode and enabled efficient direct electron transfer (DET) between the enzyme and the electrode. The aryl groups enter the hydrophobic pocket of the T1 center of laccase responsible for exchanging electrons with the substrate. Glassy carbon electrode covered with arylated SWCNT and coated with a layer of neutralized Nafion containing laccase was found to be a very efficient cathode in the hybrid battery. Zn wire covered with a Nafion film served as the anode. The cell parameters were determined: power density was 2mW/cm2 and the open circuit potential was 1.5V. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Detailed compositional analysis of a bio-oil (BO) from pyrolysis of rice husk was carried out. The BO was extracted sequentially with n-hexane, CCl 4, CS 2, benzene and CH 2Cl 2. In total, 167 organic species were identified with GC/MS in the extracts and classified into alkanes, alcohols, hydroxybenzenes, alkoxybenzenes, dioxolanes, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, nitrogen-containing organic compounds and other species. The benzene ring-containing species (BRCCs) were attributed to the degradation of lignin while most of the rests were derived from the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. Along with guaiacyl and p-hydroxyphenyl units as the main components, a new type of linkage was suggested, i.e., C ar-CH 2-C ar in 4,4'-methylenebis(2,6-dimethoxyphenol). Based on the species identified, a possible macromolecular structure of the lignin and the mechanism for its pyrolysis are proposed. The BO was also extracted with petroleum ether in ca. 17.8% of the extract yield and about 82.1% of the extracted components are BRCCs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, alkaline earth metal oxides (i.e., MgO, CaO, and SrO) were used as catalysts for the transesterification of olive oil with methanol. The most efficient catalyst was further doped with either CaO or SiO 2 to improve its catalytic activity, which was evaluated by conducting transesterification at different reaction temperatures, different water content, and using different types of oils. Finally, repeated tests were conducted to evaluate the reusability of the doped catalyst. The results show that the conversion of refined olive oil to biodiesel was more than 80% in 15min when SrO was applied, while using SrO doped SiO 2 (SrO/SiO 2) further increased the conversion to 95% in 10min. SrO/SiO 2 also featured good water and free fatty acids (FFAs) tolerance, as the conversion was still higher than 90% (in 20min) when the water and FFAs contents were increased to 3.23 and 3.14wt.%, respectively. Addition of hexane significantly improved the reusability of SrO/SiO 2 for transesterification, as the biodiesel production still reached nearly 80% after the catalyst was repeatedly used for four times. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Industrial biotechnology involves the replacement of petrochemical processes and inputs with more energy-efficient and renewable biological ones. It is already being used in the production of biofuels and bioplastics and has been touted as a means by which modern economies can be shifted toward a more competitive, low-carbon growth model. This paper does two things. First, it outlines the policy framework established in the European Union and the narrative of a knowledge-based bioeconomy (KBBE) underpinning this. Second, it argues that the 'win-win' rhetoric contained within the KBBE narrative is misleading. Among the different groups commenting on the use of industrial biotechnology, the paper locates cleavages between farmers and agribusiness, between those convinced and those sceptical of environmental technofixes, and between procorporate and anti-corporate NGOs. Taken together, they show the purported transition from a fossil-fuel to a bio-based economy to be a resolutely political one. © 2012 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.

AB  - Surplus of glycerol due to the increase of biodiesel production has become an economic drawback for the development of biofuel itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to take advantage of glycerol for the synthesis of derivatives such as ketals, which can be used in biodiesel blends. The synthesis of ketals has been successfully carried out in good yields by using a cheap and reusable catalyst, K10 montmorillonite. The analysis of biodiesel blends quality parameters revealed the improvement of their cold properties, but some parameters such as fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content and oxidation stability do not reached EN14214 specifications. In order to overcome this issue, esterification of the free hydroxyl group has been carried out leading to products with improved and promising properties for biodiesel blends. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic hydroprocessing is an effective technology with various applications in the petrochemical industry that are lately expanding in the area of biofuels production. The selection of a hydroprocessing catalyst is a critical step defining the hydrotreating products' yields and their corresponding quality as well as the expected run-length of the process. This work involves the process of selecting a suitable hydroprocessing catalyst for the conversion of waste cooking oil into biofuels. In particular three commercial catalysts are evaluated: a hydrotreating catalyst, a mild-hydrocracking catalyst and a severe hydrocracking catalyst. The catalyst effectiveness was assessed over a temperature range suggested by the catalyst manufacturers, covering a temperature range of 330-390 °C, under constant LHSV (1 h -1) and a range of pressure 8.27-13.79 MPa. Several parameters were considered for evaluating the effect of temperature including product yields, conversion, selectivity (diesel and gasoline), heteroatom removal (sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen) and saturation of double bonds. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, one-step and two-step pyrolysis systems were compared in the pyrolysis of pine bark. One-step pyrolysis was performed in a fixed bed reactor with and without catalyst. Two-step pyrolysis was carried out in a dual reactor system over catalyst; the first reactor containing no catalyst whereas the second reactor containing catalyst to upgrade the thermally cracked products. The catalysts used in the pyrolysis systems were ReUS-Y, red mud and ZSM-5. In thermal pyrolysis, the pyrolysis system mainly affected the relative amount of bio-oil. The bio-oil yields obtained from two-step thermal pyrolysis were higher than the yields from one-step thermal pyrolysis. In the catalytic runs, ReUS-Y catalyst slightly decreased the char formation with a consequent increase in aqueous phase yield in the case of one-step pyrolysis. However, the catalysts decreased the bio-oil yield with a consequent increase in the gas yield in the case of two-step pyrolysis. The general compositions of bio-oils obtained from both two pyrolysis systems were affected by using catalysts. In the case of one-step pyrolysis, the formation of water and water soluble compounds were reduced by using ReUS-Y catalyst. In the case of two-step pyrolysis, both ZSM-5 and red mud increased the formation of water soluble compounds while they decreased water formation. In contrast, ReUS-Y decreased the formation of water soluble compounds and increased the amount of pyrolytic lignin compounds in bio-oil. Fuel characteristics of pyrolysis products (gas, bio-oil and char) for both two pyrolysis systems were also investigated comparatively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The number of investigations involving bioelectrochemical systems (BES), processes in which microorganisms catalyze electrode reactions, is increasing while their mechanisms remain unresolved. Geobacter sulfurreducens strain DL1 is a model electrode catalyst that forms multimicrobe-thick biofilms on anodes that catalyze the oxidation of acetate to result in an electric current. Here, we report the characterization by cyclic voltammetry (CV) of DL1 biofilm-modified anodes (biofilm anodes) performed during biofilm development. This characterization, based on our recently reported model of biofilm anode catalytic activity, indicates the following. 1) As a biofilm grows, catalytic activity scales linearly with the amount of anode-accessible redox cofactor in the biofilm. This observation is consistent with a catalytic activity that is limited during biofilm growth by electron transport from within cells to the extracellular redox cofactor. 2) Distinct voltammetric features are exhibited that reflect the presence of a redox cofactor expressed by cells that initially colonize an anode that is not involved in catalytic current generation © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - As an alternative to conventional sulfide catalysts, NiMo carbide catalysts were prepared by impregnation method and studied for the hydrotreating of soybean oil to produce hydrocarbons in the gasoline to diesel range. The effect of the catalyst supports on activity and selectivity was investigated by using three different types of materials: mesoporous material (Al-SBA-15), alumina (γ-Al2O3) and zeolites (ZSM-5, Zeolite β and USY). The structural characterization of the catalysts was performed using XRD, BET and TEM. Catalytic tests were carried out in a bench scale flow reactor at 400 C and 650 psi. The results showed that the Al-SBA-15 supported catalyst has the highest surface area of 711.5 m2 g-1 and largest pore volume of 0.71 cm3 g-1. Among the five catalysts, hydrotreating on NiMoC/Al-SBA-15 gave the highest yield of organic liquid product (96%) and highest selectivity (97%) to hydrocarbons in the boiling range of the diesel fraction. For the three zeolite-supported catalysts, hydrotreating of soybean oil produced more hydrocarbon products in the boiling range of green gasoline (about 15-40%). © Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The ketonization of small organic acids is a valuable reaction for biorenewable applications. Ceria has long been used as a catalyst for this reaction; however, under both liquid and vapor phase conditions, it was found that given the right temperature regime of about 150-300 °C, cerium oxide, which was previously believed to be a stable catalyst for ketonization, can undergo bulk transformations. This result, along with other literature reports, suggest that the long held belief of two separate reaction pathways for either bulk or surface ketonization reactions are not required to explain the interaction of cerium oxide with organic acids. X-ray photon spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and temperature programmed decomposition results supported the formation of metal acetates and explained the occurrence of cerium reduction as well as the formation of cerium oxide/acetate whiskers. After thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry and FT-IR experiments, a single reaction sequence is proposed that can be applied to either surface or bulk reactions with ceria. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, low grade crude palm oil (LGCPO) with high free fatty acids (FFA) content is introduced as a possible biodiesel production feedstock alternative. The pre-treatment of LGCPO was conducted using ammonium-based deep eutectic solvent which consisted of hydrogen bond donor (i.e. p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate) (PTSA) and salt (i.e. N,N-diethylenethanol ammonium chloride) as a novel recyclable catalyst (DEAC-DES). The DEAC-DES was used in different dosages to reduce the level of FFA to the acceptable limit for biodiesel production. The esterification reaction was carried out to evaluate the effect of varying reaction operating conditions on the reduction of FFA content. The FFA content of LGCPO was reduced from 9.5% to less than 1% using optimum conditions. Four recycling runs of the DEAC-DES were achieved. The conversion of PTSA to deep eutectic solvent improved the recyclability of the acid and the physical properties such as the elimination of acid hygroscopicity. The LGCPO biodiesel fulfilled the international standards. This study demonstrates a potential route for biodiesel production from abundance LGCPO using DEAC-DES and an alkaline catalyst. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Advanced microwave technology has the potential to significantly enhance the biodiesel production process. Knowledge of dielectric properties of materials plays a major role in microwave design for any process. Dielectric properties (ε' and ε') of biodiesel precursors: soybean oil, alcohols and catalyst and their different mixtures were measured using a vector network analyzer and a slim probe in an open ended coaxial probe method at four different temperatures (30, 45, 60 and 75. °C) and in the frequency range of 280. MHz to 4.5. GHz. Results indicate that the microwave dielectric properties depend significantly on both temperature and frequency. Addition of catalyst significantly affected the dielectric properties. Dielectric properties behaved differently when oil, alcohol and catalyst was mixed at room temperature before heating and when the oil and the alcohol catalyst mixture was heated separately to a pre-determined temperature before mixing. These results can be used in designing microwave based transesterification system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microwave assisted catalytic pyrolysis was investigated to convert Douglas fir pellets to bio-oils by a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. A central composite experimental design (CCD) was used to optimize the catalytic pyrolysis process. The effects of reaction time, temperature and catalyst to biomass ratio on the bio-oil, syngas, and biochar yields were determined. GC/MS analysis results showed that the bio-oil contained a series of important and useful chemical compounds. Phenols, guaiacols, and aromatic hydrocarbons were the most abundant compounds which were about 50-82% in bio-oil depending on the pyrolysis conditions. Comparison between the bio-oils from microwave pyrolysis with and without catalyst showed that the catalyst increased the content of aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols. A reaction pathway was proposed for microwave assisted catalyst pyrolysis of Douglas fir pellets. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can result in negative net carbon emissions and may therefore provide an important technology option for meeting current greenhouse gas stabilization targets. To this end, syngas from biomass gasification combined with pre-combustion carbon capture can be used to produce either biofuels or electricity. Pre-treating the biomass with hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) produces a coal-like substance, biocoal, which is potentially better suited for entrained flow gasification than raw biomass. This paper compares HTC followed by entrained flow gasification of the biocoal with fluidized bed gasification of raw wood, both with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Simulation studies undertaken with Aspen Plus are interpreted using exergy analysis. Syngas production is more efficient from biocoal than from raw wood but the conversion losses in the HTC process outweigh the efficiency gains in the gasification. Carbon losses through gaseous and dissolved byproducts in the HTC also limit the capture rate. A CCS-IGCC with fluidized bed gasification using raw wood results in an electrical efficiency of 28.6% (HHV) and a carbon capture rate of 84.5%, while the conversion chain of HTC and a CCS-IGCC with entrained flow gasification yields an electrical efficiency of 27.7% and a capture rate of 72.7%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel cells typically yield lower power and are more difficult to fabricate than conventional fuel cells using inorganic catalysts. This work presents a glucose/O2 microfluidic biofuel cell (MBFC) featuring pyrolyzed photoresist film (PPF) electrodes made on silicon wafers using a rapid thermal process, and subsequently encapsulated by rapid prototyping techniques into a double-Y-shaped microchannel made entirely of plastic. A ferrocenium-based polyethyleneimine polymer linked to glucose oxidase (GOx/Fc-C6-LPEI) was used in the anode, while the cathode contained a mixture of laccase, anthracene-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and tetrabutylammonium bromide-modified Nafion (MWCNTs/laccase/TBAB-Nafion). The cell performance was studied under different flow-rates, obtaining a maximum open circuit voltage of 0.54 ± 0.04 V and a maximum current density of 290 ± 28 μA cm-2 at room temperature under a flow rate of 70 μL min-1 representing a maximum power density of 64 ± 5 μW cm-2. Although there is room for improvement, this is the best performance reported to date for a bioelectrode-based microfluidic enzymatic biofuel cell, and its materials and fabrication are amenable to mass production. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Hydrogen will be an important energy carrier in the future and hydrogen production has drawn a great deal of attention to its advantages in efficiency and environmental benefit. Catalytic steam reforming in this study was carried out in a fixed bed tubular reactor with sepiolite catalysts. Sepiolite catalysts modified with nickel (Ni) and molybdenum (Mo) were prepared using the precipitation method. Influential parameters such as temperature, catalyst, steam to carbon ratio (S/C), the feeding space velocity (WHSV), reforming length, and activity of catalyst were investigated and the yields of H 2, CO, CH4, and CO2 were obtained. The result of this experiment shows that the acidified sepiolite catalyst with addition of the Ni and Mo greatly improves the activities of catalyst and effectively increases the yield of hydrogen. The favorable reaction condition is as follows: reaction temperature is 700-800 °C; S/C is 16-18; the feeding space velocity is 1.5-2.2 h-1, respectively. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Litsea cubeba seed was conducted over different temperature (250-350°C), time (30-120min), reactor loading (0.5-4.5g) and Na2CO3 loading (0-10wt.%). Temperature was the most influential factor affecting the yields of product fractions. The highest bio-oil yield of 56.9wt.% was achieved at 290°C, 60min, and reactor loading of 2.5g. The presence of Na2CO3 favored the conversion of the feedstock but suppressed the production of bio-oil. The higher heating values of the bio-oil were estimated at around 40.8MJ/kg. The bio-oil, which mainly consisted of toluene, 1-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-benzene, fatty acids, fatty acid amides, and fatty acid esters, had a smaller total acid number than that of the oil obtained from the direct extraction of the starting material. It also contained nitrogen that was far below the bio-oil produced from the HTL of microalgae, making it more suitable for the subsequent refining. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One mutant (HP-1) with higher growth rate was obtained from Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 by heavy-ion irradiation mutagenesis. Compared to the wild type, the biomass accumulation and maximum growth rate of HP-1 were individually increased by 19% and 6%, and its lipid productivity was increased by 28% from 211 to 271mgL-1d-1. Subsequently analysis indicated photosynthetic efficiency of HP-1 was higher than that of wild type during cultivation. Further, lipid composition analysis indicated TAG content of HP-1 was 14% higher, while polar lipid content was 15% lower than that of wild type. Moreover, fatty acid profiles analysis revealed no significant variation was found between the two strains. The mutant is discussed in terms of its comparative advantage over the wild type with respect to its potential utilization for biodiesel production. Owing to its higher lipid productivity and TAG content, HP-1 could be considered as a valuable candidate for microalgal biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A variety of biofuel and biorefinery products have been produced from engineered Escherichia coli till date. Most of these products had been derived from simple sugars in its pure form, rather than deriving it from alternative, renewable and carbon neutral sources, such as marine alga biomass. Engineering E. coli to use algal hydrolysate can make these an attractive carbon source for the industrial production of value added fuels and chemicals. This work reports the engineering of E. coli by a combination of gene deletion and synthetic pathway incorporation, for the efficient utilization of algal hydrolysate to produce BA (2,3 butanediol. +. acetoin) under microaerobic condition. Engineered strain produced ~19. g/L of total BA from algal hydrolysate in defined M9 salt media at a yield of 0.43. g/g. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolysis of pine and gasification of pine chars was studied in this work, focusing on the influence of organically bound metals. Selective leaching of the major ash-forming elements in pine wood was performed with different acids, namely, nitric, sulfuric, hydrochloric and oxalic acids. No other major changes in the chemical composition of the biomass were observed except the removal of the metals. The effect of organically bound sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium was studied in both pyrolysis and gasification. Removal of the metals had a positive effect on the pyrolysis, resulting in higher bio-oil, lower char and gas yields. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The performance of immobilized enzyme systems is often limited by cofactor diffusion and regeneration. Here, we demonstrate an engineered enzyme capable of utilizing the minimal cofactor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN+) to address these limitations. Significant gains in performance are observed with NMN+ in immobilized systems, despite a decreased turnover rate with the minimal cofactor. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Different nanostructured supports, based on 1-decyl-2-methyimidazolium cations covalently attached to a polystyrene divinylbenzene porous matrix, were used as carriers to immobilise Candida antarctica lipase B. The suitability of these immobilised lipase derivatives for the synthesis of biodiesel (methyl oleate) by the methanolysis of triolein has been tested in both tert-butanol and supercritical (sc)CO2 (18 MPa, 45 °C) as reaction media. The use of modified supports with low ionic-liquid loading covalently attached to the main polymeric backbone chains provide structured materials that led to the best biodiesel yields (up to 95 %) and operational stability (85 % biodiesel yield after 45 cycles of 8-4 h) in scCO2 (45 °C, 18 MPa). The presence of tert-butanol as an inert cosolvent in the scCO2 phase at the same concentration as triolein was key to avoid poisoning the biocatalyst through the blockage of its active sites by the polar byproduct (glycerol) produced in the biodiesel synthesis. © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&amp;Co.

AB  - The non-catalytic transesterification of refined sunflower oil with supercritical methanol, in the presence of carbon dioxide, was conducted in a tubular reactor at temperatures from 553.2 to 593.2K and pressures up to 25.0MPa. The FAME yield can be achieved up to about 0.70 at 593.2K and 10.0MPa in 23min with methanol:oil of 25:1 in molar ratio. The effect of adding CO2 on the FAME yield is insignificant. The kinetic behavior of the non-catalytic esterification and transesterification of oleic acid or waste cooking oil (WCO) with supercritical methanol was also investigated. By using the supercritical process, the presence of free fatty acid (FFA) in WCO gives positive contribution to FAME production. The FAME yield of 0.90 from WCO can be achieved in 13min at 573.2K. The kinetic data of supercritical transesterification and esterifaication were correlated well with a power-law model. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bark constitutes an important part of any woody biomass to be used for the production of second generation biofuels and chemicals. Pyrolysis followed by biorefinery is a promising technology for the efficient utilisation of all components from a woody crop. While significant efforts have been devoted to the investigation of the pyrolysis characteristics of wood, relatively less is known about the pyrolysis behaviour of bark. This study aims to clarify the effects of temperature on the yields and composition of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of eucalypts bark. The bark of mallee, a type of eucalypt grown for soil amendment in Western Australia, was pyrolysed between 300 and 580°C at fast heating rates in a fluidised-bed pyrolysis unit. The bio-oil liquid products separate into two phases. The bio-oil liquid products were analysed by GC-MS, Karl-Fischer titration, UV-fluorescence spectroscopy, ICP-OES and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). These results are compared, when appropriate, to those obtained from the wood fraction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters synthesis from crude Jatropha oil using an ultrasound-assisted process was investigated. Several gamma alumina (Al) supported tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) catalysts were synthesized and characterized to elucidate their catalytic behaviors. TPA loadings on the support between 15% and 35% were investigated. The catalyst with 25% loading achieved the highest yield of 64.3% in 60. min. Effects of reaction time (10-50. min), reaction molar ratio (5:1-25:1), ultrasonic amplitude (30-90% of the maximum sonifier power) and catalyst amount (2.5-4.5. w/w oil) were investigated and optimized. Mathematical representation of FAME yield was successfully generated and statistically validated. A highest reaction yield of 84% was achieved under the optimum conditions i.e. at an ultrasonic amplitude of ~60%, a molar ratio of 19:1 and a reaction temperature of 65. °C in just 50. min. Interactions between the reaction variables were also statistically validated. The catalyst was also investigated for possible reusability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of agricultural residues from sugarcane and cassava plantations was carried out in a laboratory-scale free-fall reactor unit. The objectives of this work were to investigate the effects of biomass types and pyroysis conditions, such as reactor temperature, condensation temperature, nitrogen flow rate and run duration, on pyrolysis product distribution, as well as to study the basic properties of the products. The results showed that all of the parameters affected the product distribution. The optimum reactor temperatures for maximising bio-oil yield were in the range of 350-450 °C. About 70 wt% of bio-oil yield could be obtained by pyrolysis of cassava stalk at a reactor temperature of 450 °C and a primary condensation temperature of 10 °C. It was also found that the minimum flow rate of nitrogen for obtaining high bio-oil yield was 1.5 l/min. The product characterisation showed that the bio-oil and char produced from the agricultural residues with the free-fall reactor unit were to a certain extent similar to those produced from different types of biomass with different types of pyrolysis reactor configurations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Researchers around the world are developing sustainable plant-based liquid transportation fuels (biofuels) to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Algae are attractive because they promise large yields per acre compared to grasses, grains and trees, and because they produce oils that might be converted to diesel and gasoline equivalents. It takes considerable energy to produce algal biofuels with current technology; thus, the potential benefits of algal biofuels compared to petroleum fuels must be quantified. To this end, we identified key parameters for algal biofuel production using GREET, a tool for the life-cycle analysis of energy use and emissions in transportation systems. The baseline scenario produced 55400 g CO2 equivalent per million BTU of biodiesel compared to 101000g for low-sulfur petroleum diesel. The analysis considered the potential for greenhouse gas emissions from anaerobic digestion processes commonly used in algal biofuel models. The work also studied alternative scenarios, e.g., catalytic hydrothermal gasification, that may reduce these emissions. The analysis of the nitrogen recovery step from lipid-extracted algae (residues) highlighted the importance of considering the fate of the unrecovered nitrogen fraction, especially that which produces N 2O, a potent greenhouse gas with global warming potential 298 times that of CO2. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The requirements for chemical and food production technologies will change in the future as a result of shorter time to market and increasing market volatility. Especially the rising use of renewable resources will require the implementation of flexible and fast to install small-scale production technologies. The increasing number of necessary apparatuses and their distributed operation, however, will constitute major challenges, both economically and procedurally.The proposed solution to face the economic challenge is modularization and standardization. For food production, dewatering represents a key issue. Thus, biomass processing should first be divided into small-scale water separation steps and then into further large-scale processing steps. As dewatering usually happens thermally and heat exchangers often benefit from the economies of scale, heat supply and energy consumption or heat transfer with little capital investment are further issues. Therefore, temperature levels should be decreased and the use of solar heat increased. For the production of biofuels and chemicals from biomass, process integration and process simplification are proposed to improve the efficacy of production equipment and processes. Choosing raw materials with molecular structures, similar to the desired chemical building block, will lower the need for heat exchange and make small-scale manufacturing of fuels and chemicals possible. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soot particles derived from canola methyl ester (CME), soybean methyl ester (SME), a 50% mixture composed of soybean methyl ester (SME) and animal fats (AF), and diesel fuel have been studied using a wick-generated open-air laminar diffusion flame operating at atmospheric pressure. The particles were collected directly from inside the flame volume at different axial locations using the thermophoretic sampling technique and were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM). Interestingly, the results show that carbon particulates produced from several tested biodiesels have diameters significantly smaller than those produced in diesel fuel under the same experimental conditions. Within the tested biofuels, the soot from SME had the largest primary particle diameter followed by B50 SME/B50 AF, with CME having the smallest primary particle diameter. Further studies of the soot particle nanostructure were also conducted using a HR-TEM imaging technique. It was found that the soot derived from biodiesel has a highly graphitic shell-core arrangement compared to diesel soot which exhibits far less graphitic structure as it consists of short, disconnected and not concentrically oriented graphene segments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The traditional heating and microwave assisted method for biodiesel production using cation ion-exchange resin particles (CERP)/PES catalytic membrane were comparatively studied to achieve economic and effective method for utilization of free fatty acids (FFAs) from waste cooking oil (WCO). The optimal esterification conditions of the two methods were investigated and the experimental results showed that microwave irradiation exhibited a remarkable enhanced effect for esterification compared with that of traditional heating method. The FFAs conversion of microwave assisted esterification reached 97.4% under the optimal conditions of reaction temperature 60. °C, methanol/acidified oil mass ratio 2.0:1, catalytic membrane (annealed at 120. °C) loading 3. g, microwave power 360. W and reaction time 90. min. The study results showed that it is a fast, easy and green way to produce biodiesel applying microwave irradiation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crossflow microfiltration (MF) was successfully implemented for harvesting microalgae suspensions from a culture medium. In this study, investigations were carried out to harvest Chlorella sp. using a cellulose acetate (CA) membrane. Electrophoretic mobility profile during the cultivation process showed a maximum electronegative value of -2.56±0.07μmcm/Vs on the 9th day of the experiment which were taken as a fresh cultures in each cultivation process. The effects of hydrodynamic conditions on the permeation flux are also discussed. The results show that the permeate flux increases with an increasing crossflow velocity (CFV) and transmembrane pressure (TMP). The flux is higher when the pressure is high, suggesting that the resistance of the membranes to mass transfer increases; hence, the applied pressure (driving force) has to be increased to obtain a higher flux. Furthermore, an increase in the CFV leads to a higher shear velocity, which makes it more difficult for microalgae to be deposited on the membrane, thus giving a better flux. The analysis of various resistances encountered in membrane filtration which involves the resistance of membrane itself and cake as well as those due to pore blocking and concentration polarization was studied. The experimental results obtained here show that the cake resistance (R c) played a more major role in the filtration rate than the resistance due to concentration polarization (R cp) and pore blocking (R b) under the conditions examined. An increase in the CFV and a decrease in the TMP result in a reduction in the cake layer formation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global concerns over atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels and the security of fossil fuel supply have led to the development of biofuels; a potentially carbon-neutral and renewable fuel strategy. One new gasoline-alternative biofuel candidate is 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). In this paper, the potential of DMF is examined in a direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. Focus is given to the combustion performance and emissions sensitivity around the optimum spark timing, especially at 10 crank angle degrees retard (SR10). Such spark retard strategies are commonly used to reduce catalyst light-off times, albeit at the cost of reduced engine performance and increased CO 2. The results for DMF are compared to gasoline, ethanol, butanol and methanol so that its sensitivity can be positioned relatively. The overall order of spark sensitivity at the highest load (8.5 bar IMEP) was: gasoline &gt; butanol &gt; DMF &gt; ethanol &gt; methanol. The four biofuels widen the spark window due to improved anti-knock qualities and sometimes increased charge-cooling. This allows the increase of CO 2 to be better minimized than with gasoline. Furthermore, DMF is the only biofuel to produce high exhaust gas temperatures, similar to gasoline and helpful for fast catalyst light-off, whilst maintaining high combustion stabilities. This demonstrates the potentially favorable characteristics of DMF to become an effective cold-start fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two-step catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of fast pyrolysis oil was investigated for translating pyrolysis oil to transportation grade hydrocarbon liquid fuels. At the first mild HDO step, various organic solvents were employed to promote HDO of bio-oil to overcome coke formation using noble catalyst (Ru/C) under mild conditions (300°C, 10MPa). At the second deep HDO step, conventional hydrogenation setup and catalyst (NiMo/Al2O3) were used under severe conditions (400°C, 13MPa) for obtaining hydrocarbon fuel. Results show that the phenomenon of coke formation is effectively eliminated, and the properties of products have been significantly improved, such as oxygen content decreases from 48 to 0.5wt% and high heating value increases from 17 to 46MJkg-1. GC-MS analysis indicates that the final products include C11C27 aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons. In short, the fast pyrolysis oils were successfully translated to hydrocarbon liquid fuels using a two-step catalytic HDO process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, we first develop an integrated strategy for the catalytic conversion of lignocellulose into liquid fuels based on the production of levulinic acid (LA) followed by its hydrogenation to γ-valerolactone (GVL). Our integrated strategy involves a novel catalytic conversion process employing alkylphenol-based separation to extract LA from the sulfuric acid containing aqueous solution following the sulfuric acid catalyzed deconstruction of cellulose. To minimize utility consumption, we perform heat integration, while the remaining heating requirement is satisfied by the combustion of residual biomass. Hot combustion gases are also used to generate electricity, which meets the electricity requirement of the process, while the excess electricity is sold to the grid. We perform a technoeconomic analysis for the alkylphenol-based strategy and compare its economics with a previously reported strategy, in which butyl acetate was used as an extractive solvent to separate GVL from sulfuric acid following the LA hydrogenation step. With some improvements in the process configuration, the alkylphenol strategy leads to a minimum selling price (MSP) of $4.40 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) for compatible biofuel components, whereas the butyl acetate strategy leads to a MSP of $4.68 per GGE. We show that the alkylphenol strategy becomes a significantly better choice when the catalyst lifetime for the hydrogenation of LA becomes less than 6 months. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Clostridium carboxidivorans P7 is one of three microbial catalysts capable of fermenting synthesis gas (mainly CO, CO2, and H2) to produce the liquid biofuels ethanol and butanol. Gasification of feedstocks to produce synthesis gas (syngas), followed by microbial conversion to solvents, greatly expands the diversity of suitable feedstocks that can be used for biofuel production beyond commonly used food and energy crops to include agricultural, industrial, and municipal waste streams. C. carboxidivorans P7 uses a variation of the classic Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, identified through genome sequence-enabled approaches but only limited direct metabolic analyses. As a result, little is known about gene expression and enzyme activities during solvent production. In this study, we measured cell growth, gene expression, enzyme activity, and product formation in autotrophic batch cultures continuously fed a synthetic syngas mixture. These cultures exhibited an initial phase of growth, followed by acidogenesis that resulted in a reduction in pH. After cessation of growth, solventogenesis occurred, pH increased and maximum concentrations of acetate (41mM), butyrate (1.4mM), ethanol (61mM), and butanol (7.1mM) were achieved. Enzyme activities were highest during the growth phase, but expression of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), Fe-only hydrogenases and two tandem bi-functional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenases were highest during specific stages of solventogenesis. Several amino acid substitutions between the tandem acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenases and the differential expression of their genes suggest that they may have different roles during solvent formation. The data presented here provide a link between the expression of key enzymes, their measured activities and solvent production by C. carboxidivorans P7. This research also identifies potential targets for metabolic engineering efforts designed to produce higher amounts of ethanol or butanol from syngas. Biotechnol. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Bio-oils were produced from bench-scale slow-pyrolysis of three different biomass samples (corn stalks, poplar and switchgrass). Experimental protocols were developed and applied in order to screen their chemical composition. Several hazardous compounds were detected in the bio-oil samples analysed, including phenols, furans and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A procedure was outlined and applied to the assessment of toxicological and carcinogenic hazards of the bio-oils. The following hazardous properties were considered: acute toxicity; ecotoxicity; chronic toxicity; carcinogenicity. Parameters related to these properties were quantified for each component identified in the bio-oils and overall values were estimated for the bio-oils. The hazard screening carried out for the three bio-oils considered suggested that: (i) hazards to human health could be associated with chronic exposures to the bio-oils; (ii) acute toxic effects on humans and eco-toxic effects on aquatic ecosystems could also be possible in the case of loss of containment; and (iii) bio-oils may present a marginal potential carcinogenicity. The approach outlined allows the collection of screening information on the potential hazards posed by the bio-oils. This can be particularly useful when limited time and analytical resources reduce the possibility to obtain detailed specific experimental data. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae and duckweed were grown and harvested over a three-month period in CO 2-sparged helioreactors and open earthen ponds, respectively. The biomass feedstocks were thermolyzed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and fixed-bed reactor to produce a fuel precursor coined " bioleum" Analysis of the thermolysis kinetics revealed an increase in the activation energy with heating rate for both aquatic species. Activation energies were lower than literature-reported values for lignocellulosics, corroborated by TGA thermolysis of pinewood. Thermolysis of microalgae resulted in higher bioleum and energy yields than for duckweed, reflecting differences in the biomass composition. The algal bioleum properties resemble those of crude petroleum except for higher nitrogen and oxygen content and acid number. Speciation identified 300+ compounds in the oil phase, with similar amounts of hydrocarbons and oxygenates, while acetic acid was the major species in the aqueous phase. The compounds were classified according to their degree of aromaticity, oxygenation, and nitrogenation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Organosolv lignin was treated with ethanol at sub/supercritical temperatures (200, 275, and 350°C) for conversion to low molecular phenols under different reaction times (20, 40, and 60min), solvent-to-lignin ratios (50, 100, and 150mLg-1), and initial hydrogen gas pressures (2 and 3MPa). Essential lignin-degraded products, oil (liquid), char (solid), and gas were obtained, and their yields were directly influenced by reaction conditions. In particular, concurrent reactions involving depolymerization and recondensation as well as further (secondary) decomposition were significantly accelerated with increasing temperature, leading to both lignin-derived phenols in the oil fraction and undesirable products (char and gas).As the main components in the oil fraction, oxygenated phenols, guaiacol, and syringol as well as their alkylated forms were detected. The yield of alkylated phenols showed a drastic increase at 350°C in the presence of initial hydrogen gas due to prevailing hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation reactions of the vinyl/allyl/oxygenated phenols. These reactions were also demonstrated indirectly from the results of atomic H/C and O/C of the oils. The highest amount of monomeric phenols released from lignin (1.0g) was measured as ca. 96.7mg at 350°C, 40min, 100mLg-1, and 3MPa of H2. In addition, GPC analysis suggested a possibility of condensation between lignin-degraded fragments during the solvolysis reaction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper describes the results of a co-operative research project aimed at the energetic exploitation of the biodiesel derived glycerol. The research objective is the definition and validation of a synthesis process for conversion of glycerol in an oxygenated fuel additive (glycerol alkyl-ether) suitable for blending with diesel and biodiesel. The employed facilities, methodologies and first results from engine tests are described, including a preliminary Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).Etherification of glycerol with tert-butyl alcohol and isobutylene allowed to identify the suitable experimental conditions required to obtain a mixture predominantly composed of higher glycerol ethers (GEM). Novel catalysts, based on perfluorosulphonic ionomers as active species and spherical silica as support, were found to be stable and easy reusable allowing to obtain mixtures containing very low amount of monoethers and oligomers considered as undesired products. Engine tests with blends of GEM in diesel fuels revealed good combustion and emission performances when compared both to neat diesel fuel and a blend diesel/biodiesel. LCA analysis indicates that the GEM/diesel blend generates an environmental impact which is lower than the one of neat diesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The dehydration of fructose or glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) using room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) as a solvent is a promising method for producing liquid fuels from renewable resources. The IL, 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C2OHMIM]BF4), was used a catalyst-rather than as a solvent-in the conversion of fructose or glucose to 5-HMF. With glucose, the yield of 5-HMF reached as high as 67.3% after 1h at 180°C in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent. The catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by distilling solvent and reused six times without loss of activity. Furthermore, a kinetic analysis was carried out to illustrate the formation of 5-HMF, and the values of the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor for the reaction were 55.77kJmol-1 and 1.6×104min-1 respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A H 2/O 2 biofuel cell based on a hyperthermophilic O 2-tolerant hydrogenase and bilirubin oxidase was designed by one step covalent immobilization of the enzymes on functionalized carbon nanotubes. Under pure H 2 and O 2 saturated buffer solutions and no redox mediator, the biofuel cell delivers power densities up to 300 μW cm - 2 at 0.6 V with an open circuit voltage of 1.1 V. These performances, which are demonstrated to be dependent on hydrogenase characteristics at high potentials, are the best ever obtained. Promising stability of the biofuel cell during 24 h of continuous use has been obtained, which allows considering this device as an alternative power supply for small portable applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - High biomass productivity and efficient harvesting are currently recognized challenges in microbial biofuel applications. To produce naturally settleable biomass, combined growth of native microalgae and bacteria was facilitated in laboratory sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) using primary treated wastewater from the Christchurch Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWTP) in New Zealand. SBRs were operated under a simulated, local, summer climate (i.e., 925 μmol/m2/s of photosynthetically active radiation for 14.7 h per day at 21 °C mean water temperature) using 1.4- to 8-day hydraulic retention times (HRTs) to optimize growth. Solids retention times (SRTs) were varied from 4 to 40 days by discharging different ratios of supernatant and completely mixed culture. Biomass productivity up to 31 g/m2/day of solids was obtained, and it generally increased as retention times decreased. Biomass settleability was typically 70-95%, and the microbes aggregated into compact flocs as cultures aged up to four months. Due to a low lipid content of 10.5%, anaerobic digestion appeared to be the most appropriate biofuel conversion process with potential to generate 19,200 m3/ha/yr of methane based on settleable mixture productivity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A one-step process was applied to directly converting wet oil-bearing microalgae biomass of Chlorella pyrenoidosa containing about 90% of water into biodiesel. In order to investigate the effects of water content on biodiesel production, distilled water was added to dried microalgae biomass to form wet biomass used to produce biodiesel. The results showed that at lower temperature of 90°C, water had a negative effect on biodiesel production. The biodiesel yield decreased from 91.4% to 10.3% as water content increased from 0% to 90%. Higher temperature could compensate the negative effect. When temperature reached 150°C, there was no negative effect, and biodiesel yield was over 100%. Based on the above research, wet microalgae biomass was directly applied to biodiesel production, and the optimal conditions were investigated. Under the optimal conditions of 100 mg dry weight equivalent wet microalgae biomass, 4 mL methanol, 8 mL n-hexane, 0.5 M H2SO4, 120°C, and 180 min reaction time, the biodiesel yield reached as high as 92.5% and the FAME content was 93.2%. The results suggested that biodiesel could be effectively produced directly from wet microalgae biomass and this effort may offer the benefits of energy requirements for biodiesel production. © 2013 Hechun Cao et al.

AB  - •Methyl oleate and canola oil derived TMP-biolubricant were prepared.•Tribological properties were evaluated using ASTM, AOCS and EN standards.•Canola oil derived TMP-biolubricant was found best on lubricity test. A class of industrial-grade biolubricants was synthesized from methyl oleate and canola (Brassica napus) biodiesel by transesterification with trimethylolpropane (TMP) using sodium methoxide as catalyst. Model transesterification reactions were performed with methyl oleate to optimize the reaction conditions to obtain maximum yield of TMP trioleate. Methyl oleate-derived biolubricant with TMP triester composition of 91.2% was obtained after 5. h. Under similar reaction conditions, canola biodiesel-derived biolubricant comprising of 90.9% of TMP triesters was obtained. Both biolubricants were evaluated for their tribological properties using ASTM and AOCS standards. They exhibited very high viscosity indices, excellent low temperature properties and moderate oxidative stabilities. The lubricity of the biolubricants was tested on a High Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HFRR) apparatus by measuring wear scar diameter on a test sample. Canola biodiesel-derived biolubricant was found to perform better than methyl oleate-derived biolubricant based on HFRR test. Both biolubricants met ISO VG 46 specifications. © 2013.

AB  - This study optimized the conversion of animal fat wastes into ethylic biodiesel by alkali-catalyzed process under mild conditions. A mix of chicken and swine fat residues was used as feedstock for biodiesel production. A full 33 factorial design was used to optimize process parameters for maximum fatty acid ethyl esters yield. Factors were evaluated at three different levels: temperature (30; 50; 70 °C), ethanol:fat molar ratio (6:1; 7:1; 8:1) and catalyst concentration (0.44; 0.88; 1.32 wt.%). Effects of the process variables were analyzed using response surface methodology. Moreover, optimum conditions were applied in a bench-scale reactor and biofuel produced was characterized. It was observed that at high temperatures (50 and 70 °C), phase separation between biodiesel and glycerol was impaired. Although high conversion was achieved (96.2%) at 70 °C, this condition is not recommended because no spontaneous phase separation was verified. On the other hand, 30 °C was identified as the best temperature for biodiesel ethanolysis, using 0.96 wt.% catalyst and 7:1 ethanol:fat molar ratio. With these conditions, it is possible to achieve around 83% conversion. Despite the oxidative stability and total glycerin, biodiesel measured properties agreed with quality requirements established by Official Regulations (ASTM 6751 and EN 14214). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapors over 20wt.% Na2CO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was studied in a lab-scale fix-bed reactor at 500°C. Characterization of the catalyst using SEM and XRD has shown that sodium carbonate is well-dispersed on the support γ-Al2O3. TGA and 23Na MAS NMR suggested the formation of new hydrated sodium phase, which is likely responsible for the high activity of the catalyst. Catalytic oil has much lower oxygen content (12.3wt.%) compared to non-catalytic oil (42.1wt.%). This comes together with a tremendous increase in the energy density (37 compared to 19MJkg-1). Decarboxylation of carboxylic acids was favoured on the catalyst, resulting to an oil almost neutral (TAN=3.8mg KOH/g oil and pH=6.5). However, the mentioned decarboxylation resulted in the formation of carbonyls, which correlates to low stability of the oil. Catalytic pyrolysis results in a bio-oil which resembles a fossil fuel oil in its properties. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An in situ transesterification approach was demonstrated for converting lipid-rich wet algae (Nannochloropsis salina) into fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) under microwave-mediated supercritical ethanol conditions, while preserving the nutrients and other valuable components in the algae. This single-step process can simultaneously and effectively extract the lipids from wet algae and transesterify them into crude biodiesel. Experimental runs were designed to optimize the process parameters and to evaluate their effects on algal biodiesel yield. The algal biomass characterization and algal biodiesel analysis were carried out by using various analytical instruments such as FTIR, SEM-EDS, TLC, GC-MS and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen and oxygen environments was also performed to examine the thermal and oxidative stability of ethyl esters produced from wet algae. This simple in situ transesterification process using a green solvent and catalyst-free approach can be a potentially efficient route for algal biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The catalytic synthesis of biodiesel from soybean oil by transesterification over basic ionic liquid catalysts had been studied at atmospheric pressure. Choline hydroxide (ChOH) catalyst exhibited better catalytic activity compared with other basic ionic liquid catalysts, and methanol is the best alcohol for biodiesel synthesis. The suitable molar ratio of methanol and soybean oil was 9:1, and the optimum catalyst dosage existed for catalytic activity, which was about 4. wt.% (without soap formation). The study also revealed that the appropriate reaction temperature was about 60°C, and the suitable reaction time was 2.5. h on the basis of biodiesel yield. The reusability test showed that ChOH catalyst had perfect utility for repeated use. By basicity test, it was found that the basic ionic liquid ChOH possessed better basicity in methanol solution. The catalytic reaction mechanism was illuminated by the interaction between the methoxyl group after activating and the carbonyl group of the triglyceride, which has been investigated using quasi in situ infrared spectroscopy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels, the hydrocarbons less than C 18, produced by catalytic cracking of nonedible vegetable oils are the potential source to battle energy demand and pollution. Among the non edible oils, jatropha is the apt candidate for the production of biofuel. Jatropha oil can be cracked catalytically over solid acid catalysts to yield liquid fuels with superior characteristics. We present here the hydrothermal syntheses of a microporous solid acid catalyst (HZSM-5 with Si/Al = 14), mesoporous materials (AlMCM-41) with varying Si/Al ratios (Si/Al = 18, 41, 72 and 95) and composite catalyst comprising HZSM-5 (as core) and varying coating percentages (5, 10 and 20%) of AlMCM-41 (as shell). All the synthesized catalysts were characterized by using XRD, BET N 2 sorption studies, ICP, TPD and SEM techniques. Herein we report the catalytic activities of all the synthesized catalysts towards the cracking of jatropha oil obtained at the optimized conditions of temperature - 400 °C, WHSV - 4.6 h -1 and reaction time - 1 h. Of all the mesoporous catalysts with varying Si/Al ratios, AlMCM-41 (Si/Al = 18) was found to be the most active catalyst as it converted 65% of jatropha oil yielding 39% of bioliquid fuel with 47% and 36% selectivities towards green diesel and green gasoline respectively. In the core-shell architecture of the composite catalyst, different % coatings of the best active mesoporous material (AlMCM-41, Si/Al = 18) over the best active microporous material (ZSM-5, Si/Al = 14) were done. AlMCM-41/ZSM-5 (25, 15, 10) showed remarkable performance in the conversion of jatropha oil (99%) yielding 70% of bioliquid fuel with very high selectivity (61%) towards green gasoline. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reliable and selective removal of hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) is an essential part of the biogas upgrading procedure in order to obtain a marketable and competitive natural gas substitute for flexible utilization. A promising biogas desulfurization technology has to ensure high separation efficiency regardless of process conditions or H 2S load without the use or production of toxic or ecologically harmful substances. Alkaline oxidative scrubbing is an interesting alternative to existing desulfurization technologies and is investigated in this work. In experiments on a stirred tank reactor and a continuous scrubbing column in laboratory-scale, H 2S was absorbed from a gas stream containing large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into an aqueous solution prepared from sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2). The influence of pH, redox potential and solution aging on the absorption efficiency and the consumption of chemicals was investigated. Because of the irreversible oxidation reactions of dissolved H 2S with H 2O 2, high H 2S removal efficiencies were achieved while the CO 2 absorption was kept low. At an existing biogas upgrading plant an industrial-scale pilot scrubber was constructed, which efficiently desulfurizes 180m 3/h of raw biogas with an average removal efficiency of 97%, even at relatively high and strongly fluctuating H 2S contents in the crude gas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Pyrolysis of corn stover was carried out in a pressurized batch reactor to investigate production of potential bio-fuels from biomass wastes. Product yields and characteristics as well as conversion efficiencies were evaluated at varying temperatures of 400, 500 and 600°C and at moderate pressure. Maximum bio-char yield of 37.3 wt.% and liquid product yield of 31.4% were obtained at 400°C while the gas yield was maximum at 600°C (21.2 wt.%). Bio-char characterization through its energy content, proximate and ultimate analyses indicated its potential as alternative solid fuel, as revealed in the Van Krevelen diagram. FTIR and GC-MS analyses of the bio-oil showed that its major components are phenolic compounds, with significant proportions of aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The gas product mainly consisted of methane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with energy content ranging from 10.1 to 21.7 MJ m -3. Mass and energy conversion efficiencies were evaluated, which indicated that majority of the mass and energy contained in the feedstock was transferred to the bio-char. Results showed that pyrolysis of corn stover produced potentially valuable sources of fuel and chemical feedstock. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bio-oil cannot be directly used as biofuel mainly due to its abundant oxygen-containing functional groups. Therefore, bio-oil must be upgraded to produce high quality biofuels. As the first part of this series, this paper reports the transformation of GC-detectable light components during the hydrotreatment of bio-oil using noble-metal catalyst Pd/C over a wide range of reaction temperature (150-300 C). Our results show that aldehydes were easily hydrogenated, with cyclopentanone and 2-methyl cyclopentanone among the observed products. During hydrotreatment, carboxylic acids such as propionic, butanoic and pentanoic acids were also observed in the liquid products. Furthermore, evolution of propyl guaiacol, ethyl guaiacol, methyl guaiacol, guaiacol and syringol confirms the depolymerisation of the lignin-derived oligomers during the hydrotreatment of bio-oil. The hydrogenation of the phenolic compounds also took place. In addition, the FT-IR analysis of the O-containing functional groups, especially carbonyl groups, confirms the trends found by GC-MS. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper highlights the performance of Ni-MgO-(Ce,Zr)O2 tri-reforming catalysts under various reaction conditions and explains results using catalyst characterization. Testing under controlled reaction conditions and the use of several catalyst characterization techniques (BET, XRD, TPR, SEM-EDS, and XPS) were employed to better explain the effects of the synthesis parameters on the reaction performances. The support Ce:Zr ratio, metal loading techniques, metal wt%, and Ni:Mg ratios all had a pronounced influence on the catalyst performance. An even ratio of Ce:Zr for the support and an even ratio of Ni:Mg gave the best performance. The wet impregnation method consistently showed more resistance to coke formation when compared to the deposition precipitation method, but the difference was attributed to a better ability to load Mg by wet impregnation. Lower than previously reported H2O concentrations in the feed gas composition also led to desired H2:CO ratios needed for FT synthesis while maintaining high conversions of CO 2 and resistance to coke formation. High GHSV (61,000 h-1) yielded significantly higher H2:CO ratios when compared to reactions run at lower GHSV (25,000 h-1). These results suggest that steam reforming reactions are kept further from equilibrium at higher GHSV and result in higher H2 production. The tested tri-reforming catalyst produced desired H2:CO ratios with minimal deactivation, high reactant conversions, and extended catalyst lifetime. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is an attractive biofuel because it can be used directly with the traditional petro diesel engines, either as a substitute or as a blending component. There are several alternatives that can be used to produce biodiesel. In this work, we developed a superstructure optimization model to synthesize the optimum biodiesel production plant, i.e., the one that gives the minimum net present sink. To reduce the computational cost of solving the resulting disjunctive programming, the surrogate models utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been developed to replace the unit operation, thermodynamics and mixing models. The optimum solution with the alkali-catalyzed reactor (obtained in five CPU seconds) has a total net present sink of about $41 million, which differs less than one percent from the result obtained by modeling the solution in a process simulator. However, this level of accuracy required a large amount of data to train the ANNs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The exhaust emissions from a diesel power generator operating with waste cooking oil biodiesel blends have been studied. Fuel blends with 25%, 50% and 75% of biodiesel concentration in diesel oil were tested, varying engine load from 0 to 25kW. The original engine settings for diesel oil operation were kept the same during the experiments with the biodiesel blends. The main physical-chemical characteristics of the fuel blends used were measured to help with the analysis of the emission results. The results show that the addition of biodiesel to the fuel increases oxides of nitrogen (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and exhaust gas opacity were also increased with the use of biodiesel. Major increase of NOX was observed at low loads, while CO and HC were mainly increased at high loads. Using 50% of biodiesel in diesel oil, the average increase of CO2, CO, HC and NOX throughout the load range investigated was 8.5%, 20.1%, 23.5% and 4.8%, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Ascidians (tunicates) are rich sources of structurally elegant, pharmaceutically potent secondary metabolites and, more recently, potential biofuels. It has been demonstrated that some of these compounds are made by symbiotic bacteria and not by the animals themselves, and for a few other compounds evidence exists supporting a symbiotic origin. In didemnid ascidians, compounds are highly variable even in apparently identical animals. Recently, we have explained this variation at the genomic and metagenomic levels and have applied the basic scientific findings to drug discovery and development. This review discusses what is currently known about the origin and variation of symbiotically derived metabolites in ascidians, focusing on the family Didemnidae, where most research has occurred. Applications of our basic studies are also described. © 2012 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.

AB  - The effect that operating conditions (temperature, steam/carbon molar ratio, and space-velocity) have on the steam reforming of raw bio-oil has been studied in a two-step reaction unit. In the first step (operated at 500 C), a carbonaceous solid (pyrolytic lignin) deposits by repolymerization of certain bio-oil components, and the remaining volatiles are reformed in the second step (fluidized bed reactor) on a Ni/La2O3-αAl 2O3 catalyst. Under suitable reforming conditions (700 C, S/C = 9, space-velocity = 8000 h-1), the yields of H2 and CO were 95% and 6%, respectively. Catalyst deactivation was very low, whereby the H2 yield decreased by only 2% over 100 min of reaction. By using dolomite as adsorbent in the reforming reactor, CO2 was effectively captured, and the raw bio-oil was reformed at 600 C without adding water (S/C = 1.1), thus avoiding its vaporization cost. The yields of H2 and CO were 80-82% and 1%, respectively, for a space-velocity (GC1HSV) of 7000 h-1 and catalyst/dolomite ratio of 0.25, although a high yield of CH4 (7%) was obtained due to the cracking capacity of the dolomite. The coke content on the catalyst was high (7.7 wt % in 2 h) because of the limited gasification of coke precursors under the operating conditions (low temperature and low S/C ratio) used in the process with CO2 capture. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuel cells provide a safe and renewable means of powering small electronic devices. In this work, we demonstrate a bioanode that is capable of extracting four electrons from a single molecule of sucrose by way of a three-enzyme cascade. Invertase, fructose dehydrogenase and glucose oxidase are immobilized in a ferrocene-modified linear poly(ethylenimine) (LPEI) hydrogel onto the surface of a carbon electrode. Fuel sources are generated in the polymer film by (1) hydrolyzing sucrose into fructose and glucose and then (2) electroenzymatically oxidizing fructose and glucose to produce a current response. A previously unreported synergistic effect is observed between glucose oxidase and fructose dehydrogenase that results in a current response that is considerably higher than expected. The newly described enzyme cascade generated 302 ± 57 μA/cm2 at 25 C and 602 ± 62 μA/cm 2 at 37 C and when poised against an air breathing platinum cathode in a biofuel cell, the multienzyme-containing film generated 42 ± 15 μW/cm2 at 172 mV with a maximum current density of 344 ± 25 μA/cm2 in 100 mmol/L sucrose at 25 C. This is the first example of an enzymatic biofuel cell that utilizes both fructose and glucose as oxidation fuel sources. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, we propose pine oil biofuel, a renewable fuel obtained from the resins of pine tree, as a potential substitute fuel for a diesel engine. Pine oil is endowed with enhanced physical and thermal properties such as lower viscosity and boiling point, which enhances the atomization and fuel/air mixing process. However, the lower cetane number of the pine oil hinders its direct use in diesel engine and hence, it is blended in suitable proportions with diesel so that the ignition assistance could be provided by higher cetane diesel. Since lower cetane fuels are prone to more NOX formation, SCR (selective catalyst reduction), using urea as reducing agent, along with a CC (catalytic converter) has been implemented in the exhaust pipe. From the experimental study, the BTE (brake thermal efficiency) was observed to be increased as the composition of pine oil increases in the blend, with B50 (50% pine oil and 50% diesel) showing 7.5% increase over diesel at full load condition. The major emissions such as smoke, CO, HC and NOX were reduced by 70.1%, 67.5%, 58.6% and 15.2%, respectively, than diesel. Further, the average emissions of B50 with SCR and CC assembly were observed to be reduced, signifying the positive impact of pine oil biofuel on atmospheric environment. In the combustion characteristics front, peak heat release rate and maximum in-cylinder pressure were observed to be higher with longer ignition delay. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Application of ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production process from Jatropha oil catalyzed by activated carbon-supported tungstophosphoric acid catalyst was studied. Influences of ultrasonic energy on different process variables were elucidated. Reaction variables i.e. reaction time (10-50 min), reactants' molar ratio (5:1-25:1), ultrasonic amplitude (30-90% of the maximum sonifier power) and catalyst amount (2.5-4.5 w/w oil) were studied. A mathematical representation for biodiesel yield was successfully generated. A yield of 91% was achieved in just 40 min at a moderate ultrasonic amplitude (∼60%), high molar ratio (25:1) and low reaction temperature (65 °C). Interactions between the variables were also validated statistically. Leaching study revealed that the reaction was predominately heterogeneous in nature. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignin is one of the biomass components potentially usable as renewable resource to produce fuels or chemicals. After separation from the lignocellulosic matrix, this macromolecule is nowadays essentially valorized by combustion in paper mills. If second generation ethanol is produced in the future from lignocellulosic biomass, some increasing reserves of lignin will be available in addition to the ones coming from the paper industry. The main thermochemical ways such as pyrolysis, solvolysis, hydrothermal conversion and hydroconversion considered for the valorization of the lignin are reviewed in this article. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Biodiesel production from microalgae is recognized as one of the best solutions to deal with the energy crisis issues. However, after the oil extraction from the microalgae, the microalgae residue was generally discarded or burned. Here a novel carbon-based solid acid catalyst derived from microalgae residue by in situ hydrothermal partially carbonization were synthesized. The obtained catalyst was characterized and subjected to both the esterification of oleic acid and transesterification of triglyceride to produce biodiesel. The catalyst showed high catalytic activity and can be regenerated while its activity can be well maintained after five cycles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil from the pyrolysis of biomass can be upgraded into high quality liquid biofuels or utilised as a feedstock to boilers and gasifiers. The coke formation is a particularly serious problem for the upgrading of bio-oil as well as the direct utilisation of bio-oil. The effects of bio-oil chemical composition on the coke formation are keys to the understanding of the mechanism of coke formation. A bio-oil sample produced from the fast pyrolysis of mallee wood at 500°C and the lignin-derived oligomers separated from the bio-oil were pyrolysed in a two-stage fluidised-bed/fixed-bed reactor at temperatures between 250 and 800°C. In addition to the quantification of coke yield, UV-fluorescence spectroscopy was used to trace the formation and evolution of aromatic ring systems during pyrolysis. Our results indicate that both water-soluble and water-insoluble bio-oil fractions can form coke even at very low temperatures. The interactions among the species derived from cellulose/hemicellulose and lignin, especially the interactions involving their oligomers, are important to the observed coke yield, especially at low temperatures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work examined solvent extraction of lipid from microalgae for production of renewable biofuels, thereby allowing appropriate selection of solvent and extraction methods. The results of this study revealed that the mixture of chloroform and methanol (C/M) at the ratio of 2:1 (v/v) could extract the highest amount of total lipid from algae, while hexane was found to be a good solvent, concerning the selectivity for targeted lipids such as mono-, di- and tri-glycerides. As far as the extraction methods are concerned, applying disruption, especially with microwave could accelerate the rate of lipid extraction from algae with tough cell walls such as Chlorella vulgaris. On the other hand, ultrasound and microwave assisted extraction techniques added no benefits to the extraction of lipid from powder of Haematococcus pluvialis whose cell wall was previously damaged. Other than lipid extraction, this paper concerns with the development of transesterification process for algal lipid using C. vulgaris as a model system. Here, the effects of the amount of catalyst, alcohol to biomass ratio and reaction time on biodiesel yield were investigated. We also studied a single-step biodiesel production where extraction and transesterification simultaneously took place and comparison between this method and the conventional two-step biodiesel production process was made.

AB  - Production of bio-oil by microwave-assisted direct liquefaction (MADL) of Ulva prolifera was investigated, and the bio-oil was analyzed by elementary analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis (FT-IR), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicate that the liquefaction yield is influenced by the microwave power, liquefaction temperature, liquefaction time, catalyst content, solvent-to-feedstock ratio and moisture content. The maximum liquefaction yield of U. prolifera (moisture content of 8%) was 84.81%, which was obtained under microwave power of 600W for 30min at 180°C with solvent-to-feedstock ratio of 16:1 and 6% H 2SO 4. The bio-oil was composed of benzenecarboxylic acid, diethyl phthalate, long-chain fatty acids (C 13 to C 18), fatty acid methyl esters and water. The results suggest that U. prolifera is a viable eco-friendly, green feedstock substitute for biofuels and chemicals production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The synthesis of oxygenated fuel additives via solvent freebase-catalyzed etherification of glycerol is reported. The products of glycerol etherification arediglycerol (DG) and triglycerol (TG) with DG being the favorable one. The catalytic activity of different homogeneous alkali catalysts (LiOH, NaOH, KOH and Na 2CO 3) was investigated during the glycerol etherification process. LiOH exhibited an excellent catalytic activity during this reaction, indicated by the complete glycerol conversion with a corresponding selectivity of 33% toward DG. The best reaction conditions were a reaction temperature of 240°C, a catalyst/glycerol mass ratio of 0.02 and a reaction time of 6h. The influences of various reaction variables such as nature of the catalyst, catalyst loading, reaction time and reaction temperature on glycerol etherification were elucidated. Industrially, the findings attained in this study might contribute towards promoting the biodiesel industry through utilization of its by-products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The formation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from glucose was studied. It was found that the CrCl 2-catalyzed conversion in the ionic liquid, butylmethylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl) leads to negligible quantities of 3-deoxyglucosone confirming that fructose is the main intermediate. It was found that the environmentally unfriendly chromium salt could be replaced with zeolite (H-ZSM-5) leading to a 45% yield of HMF. It was also found that the solvent [Bmim]Cl could be replaced with non-toxic tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) giving a 56% yield of HMF. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of bio oil of fast pyrolysis of agricultural and industrial residues may be an economically and environmentally friendly choice for generation of energy and also for the production of chemicals. Suitable applications of rice husk and peach pit are an important issue to avoid improper waste disposal, as Brazilian production of rice and peach reach significant values. The purpose of this work was to perform a detailed qualitative analysis of bio oils of rice husk and peach pit, taking advantage of the higher peak capacity, resolution, sensitivity and selectivity of two-dimensional gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detector (GC × GC/TOFMS). The total number of compounds detected by GC × GC/TOFMS was 503 and 705 for rice husk and peach pit pyrolysates, respectively. Compounds tentatively identified in the same matrices were 106 and 223, respectively. Bio oil compounds were classified in five groups: phenols ketones, acids, ethers, aldehydes, and others. Major classes of both bio oils were phenols and ketones and the major compounds of rice husk and peach pit pyrolysates were guaiacol and furfural, respectively. Twenty compounds (area > 1%) of rice husk bio oil and 25 of peach pit oil accounted for 74.04% and 63.62% of the total area, respectively. A structured distribution of compounds of some classes was observed in the two dimensional space, as for example phenols and ketones. Qualitative analysis of these bio oils by GC × GC provided a detailed knowledge of their composition. Both bio oils showed might be employed for the production of chemicals and may be upgraded through an improved pyrolysis process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The molecular understanding of the chemistry of 1,4-β-glucans is essential for designing new approaches to the conversion of cellulose into platform chemicals and biofuels. In this endeavor, much attention has been paid to the role of hydrogen bonding occurring in the cellulose structure. So far, however, there has been little discussion about the implications of the electronic nature of the 1,4-β-glycosidic bond and its chemical environment for the activation of 1,4-β-glucans toward acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. This report sheds light on these central issues and addresses their influence on the acid hydrolysis of cellobiose and, by analogy, cellulose. The electronic structure of cellobiose was explored by DFT at the BB1 K/6-31++G(d,p) level. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was performed to grasp the key bonding concepts. Conformations, protonation sites, and hydrolysis mechanisms were examined. The results for cellobiose indicate that cellulose is protected against hydrolysis not only by its supramolecular structure, as currently accepted, but also by its electronic structure, in which the anomeric effect plays a key role. Strong nature: The electronic nature of the 1,4-β-glycosidic bond and its chemical environment is examined by DFT calculations on cellobiose. The results reveal that cellulose is protected against hydrolysis not only by the hydrogen-bond network, as currently accepted, but also by the electronic structure, in which the anomeric effect plays a key role.

AB  - A series of functional polymeric ionic liquids (FPILs) were prepared by coupling of SO3H-functionalized polymeric ionic liquids with different counterpart anions containing or excluding CrCl3·6H2O, and characterized by SEM, FT-IR, XRD, NH3-TPD, TG, melting point, ICP-AES, and TEM. The catalytic activity of the prepared solid FPILs was investigated for the conversion of biomass including fructose, glucose and cellulose into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with the presence of DMSO-mediated solvents, successively producing moderate to excellent yields of HMF under atmospheric pressure. The FPILs catalysts developed in this study present improved performance on fructose-to-HMF conversion over other solid catalysts, such as functional ionic liquids supported by silica, metal oxides and strong acid ion exchange resin catalysts, and can be very easily recycled at least five times without significant loss of activity. In addition, a kinetic analysis was carried out to illustrate the formation of HMF. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An investigation of the potential to efficiently convert lipid-depleted residual microalgae biomass using thermochemical (gasification at 850°C, pyrolysis at 550°C, and torrefaction at 300°C) processes to produce bioenergy derivatives was made. Energy indicators are established to account for the amount of energy inputs that have to be supplied to the system in order to gain 1MJ of bio-energy output. The paper seeks to address the difference between net energy input-output balances based on a life cycle approach, from "cradle-to-bioenergy co-products", vs. thermochemical processes alone. The experimental results showed the lowest results of Net Energy Balances (NEB) to be 0.57MJ/MJ bio-oil via pyrolysis, and highest, 6.48MJ/MJ for gas derived via torrefaction. With the complete life cycle process chain factored in, the energy balances of NEBLCA increased to 1.67MJ/MJ (bio-oil) and 7.01MJ/MJ (gas). Energy efficiencies and the life cycle CO2 emissions were also calculated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to find how the solvent polarity affects the liquefaction behavior of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and subsequently using the most suitable solvent identified to explore the solvent/biomass ratio, time, and temperature on the products yield and properties of the bio-oil. The products yield was significantly affected by the solvent type, and ethanol was proven to be the most suitable solvent to convert C. pyrenoidosa into bio-oil from the yield and economic points of view. Temperature is the most influential factor on the products yield and properties of the bio-oil. The HHVs of the bio-oils produced under different reaction conditions are within the range of 27.68-36.45. MJ/kg. The major compounds in bio-oil were esters, fatty acids, alkenes, aldehydes, and amides, and fatty acid ethyl esters were the largest portion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Five microbial lipase preparations from several sources were immobilized by hydrophobic adsorption on small or large poly-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) beads and the effect of the support particle size on the biocatalyst activity was assessed in the hydrolysis of olive oil, esterification of butyric acid with butanol and transesterification of babassu oil (Orbignya sp.) with ethanol. The catalytic activity of the immobilized lipases in both olive oil hydrolysis and biodiesel synthesis was influenced by the particle size of PHB and lipase source. In the esterification reaction such influence was not observed. Geobacillus thermocatenulatus lipase (BTL2) was considered to be inadequate to catalyze biodiesel synthesis, but displayed high esterification activity. Butyl butyrate synthesis catalyzed by BTL2 immobilized on small PHB beads gave the highest yield (≈90mmolL -1). In biodiesel synthesis, the catalytic activity of the immobilized lipases was significantly increased in comparison to the free lipases. Full conversion of babassu oil into ethyl esters was achieved at 72h in the presence of Pseudozyma antarctica type B (CALB), Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (Lipex ® 100L) immobilized on either small or large PHB beads and Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFL) immobilized on large PHB beads. The latter preparation presented the highest productivity (40.9mg of ethyl estersmg -1 immobilized proteinh -1). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, experiments were conducted on a single-cylinder high speed SI (spark ignition) engine fueled with 30and 35%vol butanol/gasoline blends and compared to the pure gasoline. This research is trying to find out the common principles about the influence on combustion heat release of SI engine for variables such as ignition timing, engine load, and butanol blend ratio in a wide engine speed range (3000-8500rpm). The results showed that butanol provides higher knocking resistance by allowing advance the ignition timing in SI engines, leading to more efficient combustion. The laminar burning velocity of butanol is higher than that of gasoline, but that doesn't guarantee a faster burning speed in a real engine unless the combustion process is more reasonably organized, such as using the optimum ignition timing. In the overall trend, as the butanol blend ratio increasing, one can achieve a more efficient combustion process with using the optimum operating parameters. Obviously, the rate of heat release became slower and declined in peak value as the engine load decreases, accompanied by a shift of peak value to later for both pure gasoline and butanol/gasoline blends. In the aspect of fuel oxidation rate, the fuel-air ratio is the dominated factor rather than fuel type. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates the economic feasibility of biohydrogen production via two bio-oil processing pathways: bio-oil gasification and bio-oil reforming. Both pathways employ fast pyrolysis to produce bio-oil from biomass stock. The two pathways are modeled using Aspen Plus® for a 2000 t d-1 facility. Equipment sizing and cost calculations are based on Aspen Economic Evaluation® software. Biohydrogen production capacity at the facility is 147 t d-1 for the bio-oil gasification pathway and 160 t d-1 for the bio-oil reforming pathway. The biomass-to-fuel energy efficiencies are 47% and 84% for the bio-oil gasification and bio-oil reforming pathways, respectively. Total capital investment (TCI) is 435 million dollars for the bio-oil gasification pathway and is 333 million dollars for the bio-oil reforming pathway. Internal rates of return (IRR) are 8.4% and 18.6% for facilities employing the bio-oil gasification and bio-oil reforming pathways, respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that biohydrogen price, biohydrogen yield, fixed capital investment (FCI), bio-oil yield, and biomass cost have the greatest impacts on facility IRR. Monte-Carlo analysis shows that bio-oil reforming is more economically attractive than bio-oil gasification for biohydrogen production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignin is a potential renewable material for the production of bio-sourced aromatic chemicals. We present the first hydrotreatment of lignin pyrolysis vapors, before any condensation, using inexpensive and sustainable iron-silica (Fe/SiO2) and iron-activated carbon (Fe/AC) catalysts. Lignin pyrolysis was conducted in a tubular reactor and vapors were injected in a fixed bed of catalysts (673 K, 1 bar) with stacks to investigate the profile of coke deposit. More than 170 GC-analyzable compounds were identified by GCxGC (heart cutting)/flame ionization detector mass spectrometry. Lignin oligomers were analyzed by very high resolution mass spectrometry, called the "petroleomic" method. They are trapped by the catalytic fixed bed and, in particular, by the AC. The catalysts showed a good selectivity for the hydrodeoxygenation of real lignin vapors to benzene, toluene, xylenes, phenol, cresols, and alkyl phenols. The spent catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N2 sorption. Micropores in the Fe/AC catalyst are completely plugged by coke deposits, whereas the mesoporous structure of Fe/SiO2 is unaffected. TEM images reveal two different types of coke deposit: 1) catalytic coke deposited in the vicinity of iron particles and 2) thermal coke (carbonaceous particles ≈1 μm in diameter) formed from the gas-phase growth of lignin oligomers. Lignin is fond of iron: Lignin is a promising source for renewable aromatics. Inexpensive iron-based catalysts are very selective for the direct hydrodeoxygenation of lignin pyrolysis vapors. Two types of coke deposit are revealed. Lignin oligomers are analyzed by very high resolution mass spectrometry. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Research on inexpensive and green catalysts is needed for economical production of biodiesel. The goal of the research was to test KI-impregnated calcined oyster shell as a solid catalyst for transesterification of soybean oil. Specific objectives were to characterize KI-impregnated oyster shell, determine the effect of reaction variables and reaction kinetics. The catalyst was synthesized by impregnating KI on calcined oyster shells. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the presence of portlandite and potassium iodide on the surface and a 31-fold increase in surface as a result of calcination and KI impregnation. Under the conditions tested, ideal reaction variables were 1mmolg -1 for catalyst loading, 50°C for temperature, 10:1 for methanol/oil, and 4h for reaction time. The transesterification followed a first-order reaction (k=0.4385h -1). The option of using oyster shell for the production of transesterification catalysts could have economic benefits to the aquaculture industry in the US. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The transesterification of palm oil to methyl esters (biodiesel) was studied using KOH/zeolite as solid heterogeneous catalysts. Various process variables such as KOH concentration and reaction time were studied in order to obtain maximum yield of biodiesel. A series of KOH/zeolite catalyst was prepared by impregnation of zeolite from Pacitan with potassium hydroxide in a various concentration (25. g KOH in 100. mL of distilled water; 50. g KOH in 100. mL of distilled water; 75. g in 100. mL of distilled water; and 100. g in 100. mL of distilled water). The weight ratios between zeolite and KOH solution were 1:4. Transesterification was carried out at various reaction times (1 to 4. h). The impregnation of zeolite with KOH concentration of 100. g/100. mL gave maximum yield of biodiesel. The natural zeolite, catalyst, and spent catalysts were characterised by using several techniques such as XRD, EDX, and SEM. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rice husk was converted into bio-oil via thermochemical liquefaction with ethanol as solvent in an autoclave (500 mL). The influences of reaction parameters on the yields of liquefaction products were investigated. Liquefaction experiments were performed at various reaction temperatures (T, 513-633 K), solid-liquid ratios (R1, 5-15%), and solvent filling ratios (R2, 10-30%) with or without catalyst. Two types of catalysts were involved, including iron-based catalysts (FeSO4 and FeS) and alkali metal compounds (NaCO3 and NaOH). The dosage of catalyst (R3) was also optimized. Without catalyst, the bio-oil yields ranged from 11.8% to 24.2%, depending on T, R1 and R2. And the bio-oil yields increased firstly and then decreased with increasing T and R 2, while the bio-oil yields continuously declined with increasing R1. NaOH was certified to be an ideal catalyst for rice husk liquefaction and the optimal dosage was approximately 10%. The obtained bio-oils had much higher caloric values of 20.9-24.8 MJ/kg compared to 14.9 MJ/kg for the crude rice husk sample. Without catalyst, the main components of bio-oil were phenolic compounds. In the case of NaOH as catalyst, long-chain alkanes were the major compositions of bio-oil. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To mitigate the diesel particle pollution problem, diesel vehicles are fitted with modern exhaust after-treatment systems (ATS), which efficiently remove engine-generated primary particles (soot and ash) and gaseous hydrocarbons. Unfortunately, ATS can promote formation of low-vapor-pressure gases, which may undergo nucleation and condensation leading to formation of nucleation particles (NUP). The chemical nature and formation mechanism of these particles are only poorly explored. Using a novel mass spectrometric method, online measurements of low-vapor-pressure gases were performed for exhaust of a modern heavy-duty diesel engine operated with modern ATS and combusting low and ultralow sulfur fuels and also biofuel. It was observed that the gaseous sulfuric acid (GSA) concentration varied strongly, although engine operation was stable. However, the exhaust GSA was observed to be affected by fuel sulfur level, exhaust after-treatment, and driving conditions. Significant GSA concentrations were measured also when biofuel was used, indicating that GSA can be originated also from lubricant oil sulfur. Furthermore, accompanying NUP measurements and NUP model simulations were performed. We found that the exhaust GSA promotes NUP formation, but also organic (acidic) precursor gases can have a role. The model results indicate that that the measured GSA concentration alone is not high enough to grow the particles to the detected sizes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The waste shell was utilized as a bioresource of calcium oxide (CaO) in catalyzing a transesterification to produce biodiesel (methyl ester). The economic and environmen-friendly catalysts were prepared by a calcination method at 700-1,000°C for 4 h. The heterogeneous catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The effects of reaction variables such as reaction time, reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio, and catalyst loading on the yield of biodiesel were investigated. Reusability of waste shell catalyst was also examined. The results indicated that the CaO catalysts derived from waste shell showed good reusability and had high potential to be used as biodiesel production catalysts in transesterification of palm oil with methanol. © 2013 Achanai Buasri et al.

AB  - Co-liquefaction of microalgae (Spirulina platensis, SP) and macroalgae (Entermorpha prolifera, EP) was studied in subcritical water by using a stainless-steel batch reactor at different temperature (250 to 370°C), time (5 to 120min), SP/EP mass ratio (0 to 100%), and water/algae mass ratio (1:1 to 6:1). The results suggested that a positive synergetic effect existed during the co-liquefaction of SP and EP, and this synergetic effect was dependent on reaction conditions. Co-liquefaction alleviated the severe reaction conditions compared to the separate liquefaction of SP and EP and also promoted the in situ deoxygenation of the bio-oil. The higher-heating-value of bio-oil produced from the co-liquefaction of SP and EP (wSP:wEP=1) is 35.3MJ/kg. The energy recovery from the co-liquefaction is larger than the average value from the separate liquefaction of SP and EP. Co-liquefaction did not affect the molecular composition but affect the relative amount of each component in the bio-oil. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lipase from Burkholderia cepacia was immobilized on modified attapulgite by cross-linking reaction for biodiesel production with jatropha oil as feedstock. Effects of various factors on biodiesel production were studied by single-factor experiment. Results indicated that the best conditions for biodiesel preparation were: 10g jatropha oil, 2.4g methanol (molar ratio of oil to methanol is 1:6.6) being added at 3h intervals, 7 wt% water, 10 wt% immobilized lipase, temperature 35°C, and time 24h. Under these conditions, the maximum biodiesel yield reached 94%. The immobilized lipase retained 95% of its relative activity during the ten repeated batch reactions. The half-life time of the immobilized lipase is 731h. Kinetics was studied and the Vmax of the immobilized lipases were 6.823mmolL-1. This immobilized lipase catalyzed process has potential industrial use for biodiesel production to replace chemical-catalyzed method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Corn stover, which is one of the most abundant agricultural residues around the world, could be converted into valuable biofuels and bio based products by means of microwave pyrolysis. After the reaction at the microwave power level of 500W for the processing time of 30min, the reaction performance under N2 atmosphere was generally better than under CO2 atmosphere. This may be due to the better heat absorbability of CO2 molecules to reduce the heat for stover pyrolysis. Most of the metal-oxide catalysts effectively increased the maximum temperature and mass reduction ratio but lowered the calorific values of solid residues. The gas most produced was CO under N2 atmosphere but CO2 under CO2 atmosphere. Catalyst addition lowered the formation of PAHs and thus made liquid products less toxic. More liquid products and less gas products were generated when using the catalysts possibly due to the existence of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have long been recognized as having the potential to provide a better source of biofuel. In this study, Spirulina platensis was cultivated in human urine to couple wastewater treatment with biomass production. The characteristics of microalgae growth under autotrophic and mixotrophic (adding glucose or sodium acetate to the urine) conditions, wastewater nutrient removal and biomass quality were examined. After 7. days, 97% of NH4+-N, 96.5% of total phosphorus (TP) and 85-98% of urea in the urine (ca. 120-diluted) were removed by the microalgae under autotrophic culture (30 °C). The addition of organic carbon was found to greatly stimulate the microalgae growth. More important, the mixotrophic grown biomass showed an increase in the content of protein, which could be converted into biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction. This study suggested that it might be possible to replace a common culture medium with human urine to produce S. platensis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gasification is considered to be a promising way to use biomass with high efficiency in combined heat and power production, for the production of second generation biofuels and in the chemical industry. Especially allothermal fluidized bed steam gasification produces a medium calorific, nitrogen free gas suitable for a variety of downstream processes. In general the raw product gas has to be cleaned from condensable hydrocarbons (tar) and conditioned (e.g. adjustment of the H 2/CO-ratio) before downstream use. The operating conditions of the gasification reactor have a large impact on the quality of the product gas. Hence first steps to a product gas low in tar content can be undertaken directly in the reactor. In this study the capability of influencing the tar content and gas composition by changing temperature (750-840 °C), steam to biomass (S/B) ratio (0.8-1.2) and pressure (0.1-0.25 MPa) in an allothermal bubbling fluidized bed steam gasifier is investigated. It is found that rising temperature reduces the total tar content and affects especially heterocyclic and light aromatic compounds. At atmospheric pressure the naphthalene content increases slightly with increasing temperature in contrary to pressurized gasification where naphthalene decreases significantly with increasing temperature. An increase in the S/B ratio leads to a decreasing total tar content, this tar reduction according to a higher steam content is higher at higher temperatures. Increasing pressure leads to increasing total tar content mainly due to naphthalene, the effect is most distinct for low S/B ratios. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethyl valerate and pentyl valerate, suitable as a gasoline additive and diesel component respectively, can be obtained in a one pot one step reaction from γ-valerolactone, readily available from lignocellulosic biomass. The reaction takes place in ethanol under H2 through nucleophilic addition of the alcohol to the carboxylic group giving hydroxypentanoate, dehydration to pentenoate and hydrogenation to the saturated ester. The bifunctional catalyst used consists of a non noble metal, namely copper, supported on an amorphous weakly acidic material, therefore representing an interesting alternative to Pt-zeolite catalysts. Pentyl valerate can be obtained in one pot with conversions &gt;90% and selectivity up to 83%. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study deals with an investigation of the direct oxidation of organic fuels with different molecular weights in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs). It aims to demonstrate that the final products of the oxidation process are essentially CO 2 and water with a very low amount of secondary products. An anodic catalyst formulation characterized by mixed electronicionic conductivity (MIEC) in combination with ceria electrolyte was used for this purpose. The anodic catalyst consisted in a composite Ni-modified perovskite mixed with Ce 0.9Gd 0.1O 2. It provided reasonable fuel flexibility in SOFCs. To get insight into the reaction mechanism, the same anode formulation was investigated in an ex-situ autothermal reforming test. The performances achieved with the direct utilization of both gaseous and liquid fuels appear promising for SOFC applications in remote and micro-distributed energy generation as well as for portable power sources. The anode layer demonstrated stable performance with very low amount of carbon deposition during more than 130 h testing under a direct utilization mode of dry organic fuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A two-step sequential hydrothermal liquefaction (SEQHTL) model for simultaneous extraction of polysaccharide at the first step followed by bio-oil in the second was established. The effects of reaction temperature, residence time, and biomass/water ratio on the product distribution of each SEQHTL step were evaluated. Maximum yield (32. wt.%) of polysaccharides was obtained at 160. °C, 20. min and 1:9 biomass/water ratio. Considering the operation cost and bio-oil yield (>30%); 240. °C, 20. min and 1:9 biomass/water ratio was preferred as ideal SEQHTL condition for bio-oil extraction. SEQHTL always produced ∼5% more bio-oil and ∼50% less bio-char than direct hydrothermal liquefaction (DHTL). Free fatty acid content of the bio-oils exhibited a sharp decrease with increase in temperature. Comparative analysis of the energy input and net energy balance showed that SEQHTL requires ∼15% less MJ/kg bio-oil than DHTL. Energy recovery rate for SEQHTL is nearly 4% higher than the DHTL. © 2012.

AB  - We investigated a new hydroesterification strategy for the production of biodiesel from low-value oil feedstocks: complete hydrolysis of the feedstock to fatty acids in subcritical water, followed by the use of a packed-bed reactor, containing a fermented solid with lipase activity, to convert the fatty acids to their ethyl esters. The fermented solids were produced by cultivating Burkholderia cepacia LTEB11 for 72. h on a 1:1 mixture, by mass, of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal. The esterification of fatty acids obtained from soybean soapstock acid oil was studied in the packed-bed bioreactor, in a solvent-free system, with the best results being a 92% conversion in 31. h, obtained at 50. °C. When the packed-bed reactor was reused in successive 48-h esterification reactions, conversions of over 84% of the fatty acids to esters were maintained for five cycles at 50. °C and for six cycles at 45. °C. Unlike previous hydroesterification processes that have used lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis followed by chemically-catalyzed esterification, our process does not expose the lipases to contaminants present in low quality feedstocks such as soapstocks. This advantage opens the possibility of operating the packed-bed esterification reactor in continuous mode. © 2013 .

AB  - The on-going research towards sustainable fuel production entails the improvement of the microbial catalysts involved. The possible reversibility of specific anaerobic catabolic reactions opens up a range of possibilities for the development of novel reductive bioprocesses. These reductive biohydrogenation pathways enable production of high energy density chemicals of interest as biofuels such as alcohols and long chain fatty acids. Anaerobic bioprocesses take place under energy scarcity conditions due to the absence of strong electron acceptors such as oxygen, and provide metabolic pathways towards these energy dense (reduced) chemicals. Metabolic reactions take place very close to thermodynamic equilibrium with minimum energy dissipation and consequently, environmental changes in product and substrate concentrations can easily reverse the driving force of the chemical reaction catalysed. The objective of this work is to investigate the potential reversibility of specific anaerobic pathways of interest. The thermodynamics of the different steps in biochemical pathways are analysed and combined with assumptions concerning kinetic and physiological constraints to evaluate if pathways are potentially reversible by imposing changes in process conditions. The results suggest that (i) in homoacetogenesis they may operate in both reductive and oxidative directions depending on the hydrogen partial pressure in the system, (ii) acetate reduction to butyrate with hydrogen is not feasible, but no biochemical bottlenecks are apparent in butyrate production from acetate with ethanol or lactate as electron donors, (iii) the reduction of short chain to longer chain fatty acids with ethanol as the electron donor appears thermodynamically and kinetically feasible, and (iv) alcohol production from the corresponding fatty acids (e.g. ethanol from acetate) was found to require proton translocations at specific sites in the biochemical pathways in order to compensate for the ATP required for phosphatation of acetate and to enable energy harvesting. Overall, the methodology proposed here allows for analysing the potential reversibility of catabolic pathways and therewith contributes to the development of efficient and reliable anaerobic bioprocesses for the production of biofuels and chemicals. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biodiesel, produced by enzymatic transesterification of cottonseed oil with methanol in a green, zero waste discharge process, was purified to meet the international specifications. Glycerol was recovered by gravity separation and unutilized methanol was recycled after distillation. The methyl ester content of the purified product was found to be almost 90%. The fuel properties of the product and its blends with petroleum diesel were in well accordance with the international standards. The performance characteristics of the diesel engine with the blends (B10 and B20) were comparable to that of diesel in terms of brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The emission characteristics of the engine with the blends were such that significant environmental benefits could be accrued, as the average emissions of CO, CO2, smoke and un-burned hydrocarbons (HCs) got considerably reduced by 33.3%, 8.4%, 43.4% and 29.4% respectively. However, in case biodiesel, relatively higher levels of NOX emission can be attributed to the inherent oxygen of biodiesel. Thus, the B10 and B20 products based on biodiesel from the green process showed comparable engine performance with better green house gas emission characteristics and hence, deserve the status of an efficient environment friendly bio-additive for diesel engines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oil extraction from microalgae stands as a huge challenge for bioproducts and biofuels production, mainly due to high costs and energy requirement. In this study, maximum cell density, growth curve, lipid content, daily biomass and oil productivities were determined for Chlorella minutissima, Thalassiosira fluviatilis and Thalassiosira pseudonana, strains maintained at the Instituto Oceanográfico of the Universidade de São Paulo. The microalgal dry biomass was used to evaluate the lipid extraction methodology regarding a sonication bath as pretreatment cell disruption technique followed by vortex mixing and n-hexane as solvent. The results showed a lipid content of 15.5% (% dry weight) for C. minutissima, 40.3% for T. fluviatilis and 39.5% for T. pseudonana. To determine the feasibility of using microalgae into the biofuel industry is essential to consider the daily biomass and oil productivities along with the lipid content, as could be evidenced in C. minutissima. The results indicate that the sonication-assisted method with n-hexane was efficient for lipid extraction in these strains, suggesting a favorable potential for biodiesel production. © 2013.

AB  - Bio-oil must be upgraded to be suitable for use as a high-grade transport fuel. Crude bio-oil has a high content of carboxylic acids which can cause corrosion, and the high oxygen content of these acids also reduces the oil's heating value. In this paper, acetic acid and propanoic acid were chosen as the model carboxylic acids in bio-oil. Their behavior in the production of liquid hydrocarbons during a catalytic conversion process was investigated in a micro-fixed bed reactor. The liquid organic phase from this catalytic conversion process mainly consisted of liquid hydrocarbons and phenol derivatives. Under the condition of low Liquid Hourly Space Velocity (LHSV), the liquid organic phase from acetic acid cracking had a selectivity of 22% for liquid hydrocarbons and a selectivity of 65% for phenol derivatives. The composition of the organic products changed considerably with the LHSV increasing to 3 h -1. The selectivity for liquid hydrocarbons increased up to 52% while that for phenol derivatives decreased to 32%. Propanoic acid performed much better in producing liquid hydrocarbons than acetic acid. Its selectivity for liquid hydrocarbons was as high as 80% at LHSV = 3 h -1. A mechanism for this catalytic conversion process was proposed according to the analysis of the components in the liquid organic phases. The pathways of the main compounds formation in the liquid organic phases were proposed, and the reason why liquid hydrocarbons were more effectively produced when using propanoic acid rather than acetic acid was also successfully explained. In addition, BET and SEM characterization were used to analyze the catalyst coke deposition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Acid treatments of xylose have been performed in a methanol/water mixture to investigate the reaction pathways of xylose during bio-oil esterification. Xylose was mainly converted into methyl xylosides with negligible humins formed below 130°C. However, humins formation became significant with the dehydration of xylose to furfural and 2-(dimethoxymethyl)furan (DOF) at elevated temperatures. The conversion of xylose to methyl xylosides protected the C1 hydroxyl group of xylose, which stabilized xylose and suppressed the formation of sugar oligomers and polymerization reactions. In comparison, the conversion of furfural to DOF protected the carbonyl group of furfural. However, the protection did not remarkably suppress the polymerization of furfural at high temperatures because of the shift of the reaction equilibrium from DOF to furfural with a prolonged residence time. In addition, the acid treatment of furfural produced methyl levulinate in methanol and levulinic acid in water, which was catalyzed by formic acid. Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Current international interest in finding alternative sources of energy to the diminishing supplies of fossil fuels has encouraged research efforts in improving biofuel production technologies. In countries which lack sufficient food, the use of sustainable lignocellulosic feedstocks, for the production of bioethanol, is an attractive option. In the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic feedstocks for ethanol production, various chemicals and/or enzymatic processes are employed. These methods generally result in a range of fermentable sugars, which are subjected to microbial fermentation and distillation to produce bioethanol. However, these methods also produce compounds that are inhibitory to the microbial fermentation process. These compounds include products of sugar dehydration and lignin depolymerisation, such as organic acids, derivatised furaldehydes and phenolic acids. These compounds are known to have a severe negative impact on the ethanologenic microorganisms involved in the fermentation process by compromising the integrity of their cell membranes, inhibiting essential enzymes and negatively interact with their DNA/RNA. It is therefore important to understand the molecular mechanisms of these inhibitions, and the mechanisms by which these microorganisms show increased adaptation to such inhibitors. Presented here is a concise overview of the molecular adaptation mechanisms of ethanologenic bacteria in response to lignocellulose-derived inhibitory compounds. These include general stress response and tolerance mechanisms, which are typically those that maintain intracellular pH homeostasis and cell membrane integrity, activation/regulation of global stress responses and inhibitor substrate-specific degradation pathways. We anticipate that understanding these adaptation responses will be essential in the design of 'intelligent' metabolic engineering strategies for the generation of hyper-tolerant fermentation bacteria strains. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

AB  - Lignin valorization practices have attracted a great deal of interest in recent years due to the large excess of lignin produced by the pulp and paper industry, together with second-generation bioethanol plants. In this work, a new lignin valorization approach is proposed. It involves ultrafiltration as a fractionation process to separate different molecular weight lignin fractions followed by a hydrogen-free, mild, hydrogenolytic, heterogeneously catalyzed methodology assisted by microwave irradiation to obtain simple phenolic, monomeric products by depolymerization using a nickel-based catalyst. The main products obtained were desaspidinol, syringaldehyde, and syringol; this proves the efficiency of the depolymerization conditions applied. The concentration of these observed compounds increased when the molecular weights of the lignin fractions increased. The applied depolymerization conditions, which take advantage of the use of formic acid as a hydrogen-donating solvent, did not generate any biochar in the systems.

AB  - In this study, transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel using KOH in different process conditions were studied. The investigated conditions were the molar ratio of methanol/oil, catalyst amount and reaction temperature. Optimal conditions were found to be methanol/oil molar ratio, 9:1; catalyst amount, 1 wt%; reaction temperature, 60 °C. Biodiesel yield for these conditions was obtained 93.2% in 1 h. In addition, the artificial neural network has been applied to estimate the biodiesel yield. The multilayer feed forward neural network with three inputs and one output has been trained with different algorithms and different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer. The accuracy of the proposed model was found to agree nearly with the experimental results over a wide range of experimental conditions. The results clearly depict that the neural network is a powerful tool to estimate the reaction rate and the designed neural network can be used instead of approximate and complex analytical equations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Herein, we report an effective approach to electricity storage in biofuels by selective electrocatalytic reduction of levulinic acid (LA) to high-energy-density valeric acid (VA) or γ-valerolactone (gVL) on a non-precious Pb electrode in a single-polymer electrolyte membrane electrocatalytic (flow) cell reactor with a very high yield of VA (&gt;90 %), a high Faradaic efficiency (&gt;86 %), promising electricity storage efficiency (70.8 %), and a low electricity consumption (1.5 kWhLVA -1). The applied potential and electrolyte pH can be used to accurately control the reduction products: lower overpotentials favor the production of gVL, whereas higher overpotentials facilitate the formation of VA. A selectivity of 95% to VA in acidic electrolyte (pH 0) and 100% selectivity to gVL in neutral electrolyte (pH 7.5) are obtained. The effect of the molecular structure on the electrocatalytic reduction of ketone and aldehyde groups of biomass compounds was investigated. Whereas LA can be fully electroreduced to VA though a four-electron transfer, the C=O groups are only electroreduced to -OH by a two-electron-transfer process when glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid serve as feedstocks. © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

AB  - Fungi of the phylum Zygomycetes fulfil all requirements for being utilized as core catalysts in biorefineries, and would be useful in creating new sustainable products. Apart from the extended use of Zygomycetes in preparing fermented foods, industrial metabolites such as lactic acid, fumaric acid, and ethanol are produced from a vast array of feedstocks with the aid of Zygomycetes. These fungi produce enzymes that facilitate their assimilation of various complex substrates, e.g., starch, cellulose, phytic acid, and proteins, which is relevant from an industrial point of view. The enzymes produced are capable of catalyzing various reactions involved in biodiesel production, preparation of corticosteroid drugs, etc. Biomass produced with the aid of Zygomycetes consists of proteins with superior amino acid composition, but also lipids and chitosan. The biomass is presently being tested for animal feed purposes, such as fish feed, as well as for lipid extraction and chitosan production. Complete or partial employment of Zygomycetes in biorefining procedures is consequently attractive, and is expected to be implemented within a near future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The synthesis of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) by a two-step in situ (reactive) esterification/transesterification from Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) seeds using microwave system has been investigated. Free fatty acid was reduced from 14% to less than 1% in the first step using H2SO4 as acid catalyst after 35min of microwave irradiation heating. The organic phase in the first step was subjected to a second reaction by adding 5N KOH in ethanol as the basic catalyst. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) was utilized to design the experiments and analyze the influence of process variables (particles seed size, time of irradiation, agitation speed and catalyst loading) on conversion of triglycerides (TGs) in the second step. The highest triglycerides conversion to fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) was 97.29% at the optimum conditions:&lt;0.5mm seed size, 12.21min irradiation time, 8.15ml KOH catalyst loading and 331.52rpm agitation speed in the 110W microwave power system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A continuous biodiesel production from the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol was investigated in a fixed bed reactor packed with D261 anion-exchange resin as a heterogeneous catalyst. The conversion to biodiesel achieved 95.2% within a residence time 56. min under the conditions: reaction temperature of 323.15. K, n-hexane/soybean oil weight rate of 0.5, methanol/soybean oil molar ratio of 9:1 and feed flow rate of 1.2. ml/min. The resin can be regenerated in-situ and restored to the original activity to achieve continuous production after the resin deactivation. The product obtained was mainly composed of methyl esters. No glycerol in the product was detected due to the resin adsorbing glycerol in the fixed bed, which solved the issue of glycerol separation from biodiesel. It is believed that the fixed bed reactor with D261 has a potential commercial application in the transesterification of triglyceride. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrotreating of C18 fatty acids for biofuel production was investigated with dodecane as solvent in a fixed bed reactor. The effects of temperature (300 C-375 C), pressure (2 MPa-8 MPa), WHSV (4 h- 1-18 h- 1) and hydrogen to oil ratio (500 NmL/mL-1000 NmL/mL) on the oxygen removal reaction pathways of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), decarbonylation/decarboxylation (DCO/DCO2) as well as α/β-C scission and isomerization reactions to form the C 15-C18 hydrocarbons were systemically evaluated. For all experiments the same commercial Ni-W supported on modified SiO 2-Al2O3 by NTY zeolite catalyst was used. The hydrotreating temperature is the most dominant operating parameter that affects the catalyst performance. The HDO to DCO/DCO2 ratio increases with decreasing temperature and/or increasing pressure. Low temperature and high WHSV will promote the isomerization reaction to cause more iso-paraffins in the products. The conversion of C18 fatty acids and/or product yield is little affected by the H2/oil ratio. Moreover, the concentration of C18 fatty acids in dodecane has a significant effect on the conversion of C18 fatty acids and C18 yield (HDO reaction), which decreases with the concentration of C18 fatty acids. Adsorbed hydrogen to fatty acid ratio has significant effect on deoxygenation pathways including C-O scission and C-C scission. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Influences of operating conditions such as temperature (270-380°C), time (10-120min), reactor loading (0.5-5.5g), and K2CO3 loading (0-50wt.%) on the product (e.g. crude bio-oil, water soluble, gas and solid residue) distribution from the hydrothermal processing of duckweed were determined. Of the four variables, temperature and K2CO3 loading were always the most influential factors to the relative amount of each component. The presence of K2CO3 is unfavorable for the production of bio-oil and gas. Hydrothermal processing duckweed produces a bio-oil that is enriched in carbon and hydrogen and has reduced levels of O compared with the original duckweed feedstock. The higher heating values of the bio-oil were estimated within the range of 32-36MJ/kg. Major bio-oil constituents include ketones and their alkylated derivatives, alcohols, heterocyclic nitrogen-containing compounds, saturated fatty acids and hydrocarbons. The gaseous products were mainly CO2 and H2, with lesser amounts of CH4 and CO. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To address the large energy consumption of microalgae dewatering and to simplify the conventional two-step method (cellular lipid extraction and lipid transesterification) for biodiesel production, a novel process for the direct conversion of wet microalgae biomass into biodiesel by microwave irradiation is proposed. The influences of conventional thermal heating and microwave irradiation on biodiesel production from wet microalgae biomass were investigated. The effects of using the one-step (simultaneous lipid extraction and transesterification) and two-step methods were also studied. Approximately 77.5% of the wet microalgal cell walls were disrupted under microwave irradiation. The biodiesel production rate and yield from wet microalgae biomass obtained through the one-step process using microwave irradiation were 6-fold and 1.3-fold higher than those from wet microalgae obtained through the two-step process using conventional heating. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this investigation, Enteromorpha compressa algal oil with high free fatty acids (FFA) used as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Two step process was developed and kinetic study executed to obtain reaction rate constant for the transesterification reaction. The acid esterification was carried out to reduce FFA from 6.3% to 0.34% with optimized parameters of 1.5% H2SO4, 12:1 methanol-oil ratio, 400rpm at 60°C and 90min of reaction time. The maximum biodiesel yield 90.6% was achieved from base transesterification through optimum conditions of 1% NaOH, 9:1 methanol-oil ratio, 600rpm and 60°C temperature for 70min. The algal biodiesel was characterized by GC-MS, HPLC and NIR. This transesterification follows first order reaction kinetics and the activation energy was determined as 73,154.89J/mol. The biodiesel properties were analyzed and found to be within the limits of American standards. Hence, E. compressa serves as a valuable renewable raw-material for biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A bench scale hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) system was tested using dairy manure to explore biooil production and waste treatment potential. Carbon monoxide was used as the process gas and sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) as catalyst. At a 350°C process temperature, the HTL unit produced 3.45g (±0.21) of acetone soluble oil fractions (ASF), with an average Higher Heating Value of 32.16 (±0.23)MJkg -1. A maximum ASF yield of 4.8g was produced at a process temperature of 350°C and 1g of catalyst. The best ASF yield corresponded to 67.6% of energy contained in the raw manure. GC-MS analysis of ASF indicated that the highest quantities of phenolic compounds were formed when 1g catalyst was used. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction in the dischargeable slurry was as high as 75%. The results point to an alternative dairy waste treatment technology with a potential to generate transportable biooils. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global warming, high-energy demand and availability of new technologies are among the factors catalyzing the search for alternative sources of energy. Currently, there is renewed interest in obtaining energy from wastes hitherto meant for disposal. Increased costs of disposal and their attendant problems of heavy environmental loading are some aspects making the disposal option unattractive. These wastes are sources of energy and among the several sources of generating this energy are the waste-to-energy (WTE) categories with potentials for useable fuel production. The WTE materials are mainly used domestic waste oils (UDWOs), municipal solid waste (MSW), agricultural and industrial wastes. However, the latter wastes are not attractive as they consist of innumerable hazardous contaminants. The UDWOs are arguably a safe and cost effective source of useable fuel. Their conversion offers the merits of a reduction in greenhouse gas emission (GHG), enhancing fuel diversification and a qualitatively comparable energy output to fossil diesel fuels. Thus, UDWOs could significantly contribute towards achieving the 2020 and 2030 goals of substituting approximately 20% and 30% of petro-diesel with biofuels in US and EU, respectively. Moreover, attaining the forecasted annual production rate of 227 billion liters of biofuel by most active stakeholders in the biodiesel industry could be easily achieved. This review aims to analyze the performance of biodiesel fuels obtained from UDWO and to demonstrate the suitability of applying these fuels as substitutes to mineral diesel in various industries. Benefits of UDWO as a biodiesel feedstock were as well highlighted. © 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - It is well known that current fossil fuel usage is unsustainable and associated with greenhouse gas production. The amount of the world's primary energy supply provided by renewable energy technologies is urgently required. Therefore, the relevant technologies such as hydrogen fuel, solar cell, biotechnology based on nanotechnology, and the relevant patents for exploiting the future energy for the friendly environment are reviewed. At the same time, it is pointed out that the significantly feasible world's eco-energy for the foreseeable future should not only be realized, but also methods for using the current energy and their by-products more efficiently should be found correspondingly, alongside technologies that will ensure minimal environmental impact. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a suitable process to eliminate the oxygen content in vegetable oils and to produce a renewable fuel with characteristics similar to petroleum derived diesel. In this investigation, ordered mesoporous materials based on SBA-15 and Al-SBA-15 were synthesized and impregnated by incipient wetness impregnation with Ni or Co nitrate, being subsequently calcined and reduced with hydrogen. All the samples were characterized by means of XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption analysis at 77 K, ICP-OES, H 2-TPR and TPD-NH3. Hydrotreating of a methyl esters mixture, used as convenient surrogate of triglycerides, was studied in the present work. Catalytic tests were carried out in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at 340-300 °C and 30 bar of H2 for 6 h, obtaining n-paraffins as main products. The results revealed that the presence of aluminum in the supports favors HDO processes, specifically at low temperatures, achieving higher selectivities and yields to C18 hydrocarbons than SBA-15 based materials. Besides, acid sites promote the formation of non-linear hydrocarbons in addition to n-paraffins, which are mainly produced with pure silica based catalysts. Regarding active phases, Co proved to be more active than Ni under the reaction conditions used in this study. On the basis of these results, Co/Al-SBA-15 can be considered as a very promising catalyst for the production of biofuels in diesel range from vegetable oils with a remarkable HDO activity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-sequestration of CO 2 through microalgae cultivation is considered as a viable option for biofuel production as well as CO 2 mitigation. Influence of CO 2 sparging period and interval was evaluated on the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae cultivated in domestic wastewater under mixotrophic microenvironment. Process performance was assessed in two phases viz., growth (GP) and starvation phases (SP) each with 8days of retention time. Experimental variations depicted marked influence on biomass growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae with the function of harvesting period. Sparging period of 120s documented maximum biomass growth (GP, 3.4mg/ml) and lipid productivity (SP, 27.3%) while in intervals, 4h (120s) condition showed maximum biomass (3.2mg/ml) and lipid productivity (27.8%). Total chlorophyll components documented higher concentrations of Chl b supporting the observed higher lipid productivity. Fatty acid composition varied with the experimental variations and represented higher degree of saturation indicating their utility as biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Biofuels may play a significant role in regard to carbon emission reduction in the transportation sector. Therefore, a thermochemical process for biomass conversion into synthetic chemicals and fuels is being developed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) by producing process energy to achieve a desirable high carbon dioxide reduction potential. Methods: In the bioliq process, lignocellulosic biomass is first liquefied by fast pyrolysis in distributed regional plants to produce an energy-dense intermediate suitable for economic transport over long distances. Slurries of pyrolysis condensates and char, also referred to as biosyncrude, are transported to a large central gasification and synthesis plant. The bioslurry is preheated and pumped into a pressurized entrained flow gasifier, atomized with technical oxygen, and converted at &gt; 1,200°C to an almost tar-free, low-methane syngas. Results: Syngas - a mixture of CO and H2 - is a well-known versatile intermediate for the selectively catalyzed production of various base chemicals or synthetic fuels. At KIT, a pilot plant has been constructed together with industrial partners to demonstrate the process chain in representative scale. The process data obtained will allow for process scale-up and reliable cost estimates. In addition, practical experience is gained. Conclusions: The paper describes the background, principal technical concepts, and actual development status of the bioliq process. It is considered to have the potential for worldwide application in large scale since any kind of dry biomass can be used as feedstock. Thus, a significant contribution to a sustainable future energy supply could be achieved. © 2012 Dahmen et al; licensee Springer.

AB  - As compared to petroleum diesel, biodiesel is more corrosive for automotive materials. Studies on the characterization of corrosion products of fuel exposed automotive materials are scarce. Automotive fuel system and engine components are made from different ferrous and non-ferrous materials. The present study aims to investigate the corrosion products of different types of automotive materials such as copper, brass, aluminum and cast iron upon exposure to diesel and palm biodiesel. Changes in fuel properties due to exposure of different materials were also examined. Degradation of metal surface was characterized by digital camera, SEM/EDS and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fuel properties were examined by measuring TAN (total acid number), density and viscosity. Among the metal investigated, copper is found to be least resistant in biodiesel and formed comparatively more corrosion products than other metals. Upon exposure of metals in biodiesel, TAN number crosses the limit given by standard while density and viscosity remain within the acceptable range of limit. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - First test flights using blends with algae oil are already carried out and expectations by the aviation and other industries are high. On the other hand technical data about performance of cultivation systems, downstream processing, and suitability of algae oil as fuel are still limited. The existing microalgae growing industry mainly produces for the food and feed market. Energy efficiency is so far out of scope but needs to be taken into account if the product changes to biofuel. Energy and CO2 balances are used to estimate the potential of algae oil to fulfil the EU sustainability criteria for biofuels. The analysis is supported by lab tests as well as data gained by a pilot scale demonstrator combined with published data for well-known established processes. The algae oil composition is indicator of suitability as fuel as well as for economic viability. Approaches attaining high value fractions are therefore of great importance and will be discussed in order to determine the most intended market. © 2012 Pascal Schlagermann et al.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising substitute for petroleum diesel, and has been commercialized and utilized in many countries. Conventional chemical or physical methods used for biodiesel production face the drawbacks of high energy consumption or intensive use of chemicals. In contrast, using lipase-catalyzed transesterification for biodiesel synthesis is clean, effective, and water tolerance. Therefore, in this work, a self-developed Burkholderia lipase was immobilized onto hydrophobic magnetic particles (HMPs) for biodiesel production. Transesterification with the immobilized lipase could be repeatedly carried out six times without severe activity loss. The optimal conditions for the enzymatic transesterification were identified as: room temperature, 200. rpm agitation, 10% water content, and a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 4:1. Under these conditions, the conversion of oil to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) reached nearly 70% within 12. h, giving a biodiesel production rate of 43.5. g/L/h. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We evaluate the economic feasibility for two bio-oil upgrading pathways: two-stage hydrotreating followed by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) or single-stage hydrotreating followed by hydrocracking. In the hydrotreating/FCC pathway, two options are available as the hydrogen source for hydrotreating: merchant hydrogen or hydrogen from natural gas reforming. The primary products of the hydrotreating/FCC pathway are commodity chemicals whereas the primary products for the hydrotreating/hydrocracking pathway are transportation fuels and hydrogen. The two pathways are modeled using Aspen Plus® for a 2000 metric tons/day facility. Equipment sizing and cost calculations are based on Aspen Economic Evaluation® software.The bio-oil yield via fast pyrolysis is assumed to be 65% of biomass. We calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) for each pathway as a function of feedstock cost, fixed capital investment (FCI), hydrogen and catalyst costs, and facility revenues. The results show that a facility employing the hydrotreating/FCC pathway with hydrogen production via natural gas reforming option generates the highest IRR of 13.3%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that product yield, FCI, and biomass cost have the greatest impacts on facility IRR. Monte-Carlo analysis shows that two-stage hydrotreating and FCC of the aqueous phase bio-oil with hydrogen produced via natural gas reforming has a relatively low risk for project investment. © 2013.

AB  - In this study, the effects of enzymatic hydrolysis on lipid extraction from microalga (Chlorella vulgaris) were investigated prior to biodiesel production. The initial fatty acids content of C. vulgaris was 87.6 mg/g cell. The microalgal cell walls were hydrolyzed by cellulases and then their lipid fractions were extracted using various organic solvents such as hexane, methanol, and chloroform. Optimal pH and temperature for the enzymatic hydrolysis were pH 4.8 and 50 °C, respectively, and the maximal hydrolysis yield was 85.3%, which was achieved after 72 h. After the enzymatic hydrolysis, the lipid extraction yield by the organic solvents was improved compared to when there was no enzymatic hydrolysis process, by 1.29-1.73-fold depending on the solvents used. The total fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) productivity through the enzymatic hydrolysis was higher than when there was no enzymatic hydrolysis, by 1.10-1.69-fold depending on the solvents used. When lipid was extracted from the C. vulgaris after the enzymatic hydrolysis in chloroform-methanol solution, FAME productivity was 59.4 mg FAME/g cell. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of direct sonication in conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. Waste cooking oils may cause environmental hazards if not disposed properly. However, waste cooking oils can serve as low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production. Ultrasonics, a non-conventional process technique, was applied to directly convert waste cooking oil into biodiesel in a single step. Ultrasonics transesterify waste cooking oils very efficiently due to increased mass/heat transfer phenomena and specific thermal/athermal effects at molecular levels. Thus, energy and chemical consumption in the overall process is greatly reduced compared to conventional biodiesel processes. Specific to this research, thermal effects of ultrasonics in transesterification reaction without external conventional heating along with effects of different ultrasonic, energy intensities and energy density are reported. Optimization of process parameters such as methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration and reaction time are also presented. It was observed that small reactor design such as plug-flow or contact-type reactor design may improve overall ultrasonic utilization in the transesterification reaction due to increased energy density and ultrasonic intensity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We develop a framework for the identification and evaluation of biomass-to-fuel production strategies. We generate a technology superstructure that consists of a wide range of conversion technologies along with the corresponding feedstocks, intermediates, and final products. The superstructure includes both known technologies as well as technologies that can be developed based on results available in the literature. Technical (yields and energy requirements) and economic (production cost) parameters, for both existing and potential new technologies, are calculated from the literature or estimated using a systematic approach. The superstructure along with the associated data is used to develop optimization models which allow us to identify and evaluate new and existing biofuel strategies as well as to perform sensitivity analyses and identify the major cost drivers of these strategies. The proposed framework can be used to study a range of interesting questions: What is the best strategy for the production of a specific fuel? What is the best utilization strategy for a specific feedstock? We illustrate our methodology using the production of ethanol from hard woody biomass as a case study. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Genetic modification (GM) of microalgae to improve commercial production of biofuels is underway. Inevitable governmental regulations will likely address environmental, economic and human health impacts. Proactive addressing of such regulatory protection goals should begin now, during early development of this new, potentially large and transformative industry. We present strategies for ecological risk assessment of GM algae for commercial mass cultivation assuming that escape of GM algae into the environment is unavoidable. We consider the potential ecological, economic and health impacts of GM algae that persist in and alter natural ecosystems. Horizontal gene transfer with native organisms is of particular concern for certain traits, especially when cultivating GM cyanobacteria. In general, we predict that most target GM algal traits are unlikely to confer a selective advantage in nature, and thus would rapidly diminish, resulting in low but nonzero ecological risk. Genetic and mechanical containment, plus conditional matching of GM algal traits to unnatural cultivation conditions, would further reduce risk. These hypothetical predictions must be verified through rigorous ongoing monitoring and mesocosm experiments to minimize risk and foster public and regulatory acceptance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Solid residues (SRs) are important byproducts of sub- and super-critical water gasification of sewage sludge (SS). In this study, the quantitative evaluation of heavy metals (HMs) in SRs, compared with SS, is applied in terms of potential ecological risks, pollution levels, and both bioavailability and eco-toxicity. The results show the bioavailability and eco-toxicity of HMs in SRs decrease, although the total concentration of HMs increased, particularly in the bioavailable fraction of Cu, which decreased nearly 97%. The geo-accumulation and potential ecological risk index indicated that the gasification process increased contamination by two levels (to the maximum), while the overall risk was in keeping with SS. However, based on the risk assessment code, each tested HM exhibited lower environmental risk after gasification, especially for Cd, which drastically dropped from 66.67 (very high risk) in SS to 0.71 (no risk) in SRs, with a reaction temperature of 375. °C for 60. min. © 2012.

AB  - This paper describes the use of bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of waste wood in a single cylinder, air cooled, direct injection (DI), diesel engine developing power of 4.4kW at 1500rpm used in agricultural and standby applications. The combustion, performance and emission characteristics of the diesel engine fueled with three different emulsions made from wood pyrolysis oil (WPO) and Jatropha methyl ester (JME) are compared with those of JME and diesel operations. The WPO of 5%, 10% and 15% by volume is emulsified with 95%, 90% and 85% by volume of JME, denoted as X1JOE5, X1JOE10 and X1JOE15 respectively. The combustion of JME, X1JOE5, X1JOE10 and X1JOE15 starts earlier by 2.6°CA, 2.3°CA, 2.8°CA and 2°CA respectively compared to that of diesel at load. Shorter ignition delay and higher peak cylinder pressure are observed with JME and its emulsions with WPO. There is a significant reduction in the nitric oxide (NO) emissions by 2.5% when fueled with X1JOE15. The smoke opacity decreases by 25%, 26.7%, 22.1% and 18.2% for JME and its emulsions with WPO respectively, in comparison with diesel at fullload. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A wide variety of polymeric carbohydrate-rich weed species were directly converted to a platform chemical, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and a promising next-generation biofuel, 5-ethoxymethyl-2-furfural (EMF), with homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts under mild reaction conditions. Bronsted acidic IL catalysts, [DMA]+[CH3SO3]- and [NMP]+[CH3SO3]-, were found to be effective enabling maximum 58 and 52 wt% HMF yields, respectively, from foxtail weed. Strong Lewis acidic silica supported heteropolyacid (HPA-SiO2) catalyst was also effective producing a maximum 32 wt% HMF from the same weed substrate. Both IL catalysts were effective for high-purity EMF production from HMF and weeds. HMF was quantitatively converted to EMF in 2 h. In the case of weed substrates, EMF was formed as the major product. The ratio of EMF and ethyl levulinate (EL) in the isolated product was 7:1. To address the sustainability issue and potential industrial application opportunity of the current method, a larger scale experiment under conventional heating demonstrated to produce 55 wt% HMF in 4 h. Most importantly, the spent catalyst and the solvent system were efficiently recycled for four consecutive catalytic cycles without a significant loss in yield. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A strategy for gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assembly driven by a dynamic DNA-fueled molecular machine is revealed here. In this machine, the aggregation of DNA-functionalized AuNPs is regulated by a series of toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions of DNA. The aggregation rate of the AuNPs can be regulated by controlling the amount of oligonucleotide catalyst. The versatility of the dynamic DNA-fueled molecular machine in the construction of two-component "OR" and "AND" logic gates has been demonstrated. This newly established strategy may find broad potential applications in terms of building up an "interface" that allows the combination of the strand displacement-based characteristic of DNA with the distinct assembly properties of inorganic nanoparticles, ultimately leading to the fabrication of a wide range of complex multicomponent devices and architectures. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, prepared silica supported sulfonic acid was used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the production of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) from fructose based carbohydrates and the synthesis of ethyl d-glucopyranoside from glucose based carbohydrates in ethanol. EMF was obtained in a high yield of 83.8% from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) after 10 h, and a 63.1% yield was obtained from fructose at 100°C for 24 h. Temperature experiments demonstrated that a higher reaction temperature (in the case of 120°C) resulted in side reactions such as polymerization of HMF and alcoholysis of HMF into ethyl levulinates. When di- and poly-saccharides (sucrose and inulin) were used, the fructose moieties in sucrose and inulin were also successfully converted into EMF. However, the silica supported sulfonic acid catalyst was inert for the production of EMF from aldose based carbohydrates such as glucose and cellobiose. Ethyl d-glucopyranoside was formed in a high yield of 91.7% from glucose. More importantly, the catalyst could be reused several times without losing its catalytic activity with an average EMF yield of around 60% from a one-pot reaction of fructose. This work provides a good outlook for the conversion of carbohydrates into fine chemicals and biofuel additive. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Wood ash is a highly alkaline material comprises of inorganic constituents. A limited information on use of wood ash as catalyst is available in literature. The present study was undertaken to investigate the catalytic activity of wood ash for transesterification of Jatropha oil. The thermal treatment (calcination) of wood ash was carried out at temperature in the range of 500-1200 °C to produce calcined wood ash catalysts (CWC). The wood ash was also chemically activated with K 2CO 3 and CaCO 3 by double carbonate solid state reaction to yield activated wood ash catalysts (AWC). The prepared catalysts were characterized by analytical techniques for surface morphology, crystalline phases, textural characteristics and alkalinity. Methyl ester conversion of Jatropha oil was achieved in the range of 97-99% with CWC and AWC catalysts. The synthesized Jatropha methyl esters using CWC and AWC catalysts have been found meeting the critical physico-chemical properties of ASTM D-6751 standards of biodiesel. The present study revealed the possibility of producing potential heterogeneous catalyst from wood ash for biodiesel synthesis, which can find a way to utilize abundant wood ash and reduce the overall cost of biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growth of energy demand and limited fossil fuel resources lead to renewable energy development such as vegetable oils and animal fats or their derivatives. In the present work, the valuation of waste fish fat by the pyrolysis technique with the presence of catalyst to produce biofuel for diesel engines. As a result, fuel undergoes good combustion and hence there is a significant improvement in performance and reduction in emissions. The brake thermal efficiency of neat biofuel is 32.4% at 80% load which is very high compared to neat diesel (29.98%). The combustion duration and ignition delay are decreased with neat biofuel due to high oxygen content and high cetane number of biofuel. The main problem with the use of neat biofuel in diesel engine is high NO. x emissions at all loads. Addition of diesel with biofuel reduces the NO. x emissions significantly from 917. ppm to 889. ppm at 80% load with an optimum blend of B80D20. There is a slight decrease in brake thermal efficiency and increase in particulate emission with this blend. The overall results show that by adding small quantity of diesel with biofuel decreases the NO. x emissions significantly and approaches the performance of neat biofuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Even though biomass is attracting increasing interest as a raw material in the chemical and the fuel industries, only few biobased production processes are yet established. At the same time a lot of new catalytic routes are proposed, but their potential in biorefinery applications is hard to predict. Reaction network flux analysis (RNFA) is introduced as a novel, rapid screening method which bridges the gap between chemo- or biocatalysis and process design by (1) systematically identifying and (2) subsequently analyzing and ranking the large number of alternative reaction pathways based on limited data. This optimization-based method helps to detect promising production routes as well as bottlenecks in possible pathways. The potential and the application of the RNFA methodology will be demonstrated by means of a case study for the production of the potential biofuel 3-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (3-MTHF) from the platform chemical itaconic acid (IA). © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Four different enhancing methods including mechanical stirring (MS), flat plate ultrasonic irradiation (FPUI), flat plate ultrasonic irradiation with mechanical stirring (UIMS) and probe ultrasonic irradiation (PUI) were studied to select a better one that need less catalyst, energy consumption and time to reach equilibrium for preparing biodiesel through transesterification of sunflower oil. The molar ratio of methanol to oil (3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 10:1 and 15:1), the catalyst concentration (0.5. wt.%, 1.0. wt.%, 1.5. wt.% and 2.0. wt.% of the weight of oil), the equilibrium time and energy consumption were studied. The PUI and UIMS methods reached the highest biodiesel conversion when methanol to oil ratio was 5:1 while that for MS was 6:1 and for FPUI was7:1. The suitable catalyst concentration for the reaction was 1.5. wt.%. At the same condition, the PUI and UIMS reached maximum biodiesel conversion about 25. min and that for MS and FPUI was about 50. min. The energy consumption of PUI and UIMS had no significant difference and were 0.19. kW. h, 0.18. kW. h, respectively. Results showed that under the same condition, UIMS and PUI used less catalyst, less methanol, shorter time and less energy consumption than MS and FPUI with the same biodiesel conversion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel process for hydrogen production via bio-oil catalytic reforming without steam addition was proposed. The liquid feedstock was a distillation fraction from crude bio-oil molecular distillation. The fraction obtained was enriched with the low-molecular-weight organics (acids, aldehydes, and ketones), and contained nearly all of the water from crude bio-oil. The highest catalytic performance, with a carbon conversion of 95% and a H2 yield of 135 mg g-1 organics, was obtained by processing the distillate over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at 700 C. The steam involved in the reforming reaction was derived entirely from the water in the crude bio-oil. The fresh and spent catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, thermogravimetric analysis, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. To further understand the reaction mechanisms, symmetric density functional theory calculations for decomposition were performed on four model compounds in bio-oil (acetic acid, hydroxyacetone, furfural, and phenol) over the Ni(111) surface. In addition, the decomposition of H2O*- to OH*- and O*- and their subsequent steam reforming reactions with carbon precursors (CH*- and CH3C*-) were also examined. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Background: Biodiesels are methyl esters of fatty acids that are usually produced by base catalyzed transesterification of triacylglyerol with methanol. Some lipase enzymes are effective catalysts for biodiesel synthesis and have many potential advantages over traditional base or acid catalyzed transesterification. Natural lipases are often rapidly inactivated by the high methanol concentrations used for biodiesel synthesis, however, limiting their practical use. The lipase from Proteus mirabilis is a particularly promising catalyst for biodiesel synthesis as it produces high yields of methyl esters even in the presence of large amounts of water and expresses very well in Escherichia coli. However, since the Proteus mirabilis lipase is only moderately stable and methanol tolerant, these properties need to be improved before the enzyme can be used industrially. Results: We employed directed evolution, resulting in a Proteus mirabilis lipase variant with 13 mutations, which we call Dieselzyme 4. Dieselzyme 4 has greatly improved thermal stability, with a 30-fold increase in the half-inactivation time at 50°C relative to the wild-type enzyme. The evolved enzyme also has dramatically increased methanol tolerance, showing a 50-fold longer half-inactivation time in 50% aqueous methanol. The immobilized Dieselzyme 4 enzyme retains the ability to synthesize biodiesel and has improved longevity over wild-type or the industrially used Brukholderia cepacia lipase during many cycles of biodiesel synthesis. A crystal structure of Dieselzyme 4 reveals additional hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in Dieselzyme 4 compared to the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that polar interactions may become particularly stabilizing in the reduced dielectric environment of the oil and methanol mixture used for biodiesel synthesis. Conclusions: Directed evolution was used to produce a stable lipase, Dieselzyme 4, which could be immobilized and re-used for biodiesel synthesis. Dieselzyme 4 outperforms the industrially used lipase from Burkholderia cepacia and provides a platform for still further evolution of desirable biodiesel production properties. © 2013 Korman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Electrosynthesis is a promising approach that enables the biological production of commodities, like fuels and fine chemicals, using renewably produced electricity. Several techniques have been proposed to mediate the transfer of electrons fromthe cathode to living cells. Of these, the electroproduction of formate as amediator seems especially promising: formate is readily soluble, of lowtoxicity and can be produced at relatively high efficiency and at reasonable current density. While organisms that are capable of formatotrophic growth, i.e. growth on formate, exist naturally, they are generally less suitable for bulk cultivation and industrial needs.Hence, it may be helpful to engineer a model organismof industrial relevance, such as E. coli, for growth on formate. There are numerousmetabolic pathways that can potentially support formatotrophic growth. Here we analyze these diverse pathways according to various criteria including biomass yield, thermodynamic favorability, chemical motive force, kinetics and the practical challenges posed by their expression.We find that the reductive glycine pathway, composed of the tetrahydrofolate system, the glycine cleavage system, serine hydroxymethyltransferase and serine deaminase, is a promising candidate to support electrosynthesis in E. coli. The approach presented here exemplifies how combining different computational approaches into a systematic analysis methodology provides assistance in redesigning metabolism.

AB  - Wild-type Ralstonia eutropha H16 produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) as an intracellular carbon storage material during nutrient stress in the presence of excess carbon. In this study, the excess carbon was redirected in engineered strains from PHB storage to the production of isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol (branched-chain higher alcohols). These branched-chain higher alcohols can directly substitute for fossil-based fuels and be employed within the current infrastructure. Various mutant strains of R. eutropha with isobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase activity, in combination with the overexpression of plasmid-borne, native branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway genes and the overexpression of heterologous ketoisovalerate decarboxylase gene, were employed for the biosynthesis of isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol. Production of these branched-chain alcohols was initiated during nitrogen or phosphorus limitation in the engineered R. eutropha. One mutant strain not only produced over 180 mg/L branched-chain alcohols in flask culture, but also was significantly more tolerant of isobutanol toxicity than wild-type R. eutropha. After the elimination of genes encoding three potential carbon sinks (ilvE, bkdAB, and aceE), the production titer improved to 270 mg/L isobutanol and 40 mg/L 3-methyl-1-butanol. Semicontinuous flask cultivation was utilized to minimize the toxicity caused by isobutanol while supplying cells with sufficient nutrients. Under this semicontinuous flask cultivation, the R. eutropha mutant grew and produced more than 14 g/L branched-chain alcohols over the duration of 50 days. These results demonstrate that R. eutropha carbon flux can be redirected from PHB to branched-chain alcohols and that engineered R. eutropha can be cultivated over prolonged periods of time for product biosynthesis. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Bioethanol has attracted attention as an alternative to petroleum-derived fuel. Seaweeds have been proposed as some of the most promising raw materials for bioethanol production because they have several advantages over lignocellulosic biomass. However, because seaweeds contain low contents of glucans, i.e., polysaccharides composed of glucose, the conversion of only the glucans from seaweed is not sufficient to produce high concentrations of ethanol. Therefore, it is also necessary to produce ethanol from other specific carbohydrate components of seaweeds, including sulfated polysaccharides, mannitol, alginate, agar and carrageenan. This review summarizes the current state of research on the production of ethanol from seaweed carbohydrates for which the conversion of carbohydrates to sugars is a key step and makes comparisons with the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. This review provides valuable information necessary for the production of high concentrations of ethanol from seaweeds. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - Non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae were carried out to generate an organic liquid fuel precursor. The impacts of several process variables on the fast pyrolysis in a falling solids reactor are reported, including temperature, particle size, flow rate, and atmosphere (N 2, H 2O and CO 2). Experiments were carried out with duckweed as the biomass to provide some comparison. The speciated organic phase product data were classified according to the different compound types including hydrocarbons, alcohols, oxygenates, and nitrogenates. In-situ catalytic pyrolysis produced an organic phase with an increased fraction of hydrocarbons and decreased fraction of oxygenates, evidence for carbon removal chemistries such as decarboxylation and decarbonylation. The noncatalytic pyrolysis gave the highest total liquid yield while catalytic pyrolysis resulted in the highest yield of the desired hydrocarbon fraction. A comparison of four exchanged ZSM-5 catalysts (H-, Fe-, Cu-, and Ni-) indicates that the protonated zeolite provided the largest enhancement among the catalysts of the liquid product yield and composition: H-ZSM-5 increased the yield of the hydrocarbon fraction in the organic phase from 21% to 43%, a 100% relative increase, and exhibited the least coking. The effects of biomass weight hourly space velocity, and comparisons between H-ZSM5 powder and monolithic catalysts are also reported. The implications of the findings for the conversion of microalgae to liquid fuels are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Untreated USY zeolites have low tolerance to hot liquid water, which makes them unsuitable for upgrading of biomass-derived liquid compounds in biphasic systems. However, the stability of USY zeolites can be greatly improved by functionalizing their external surface with organosilanes. Here, the structural stability of a commercial H-USY zeolite (Si/Al = 30) in the presence of hot liquid water has been investigated after functionalization with organosilanes of varying alkyl chain length (C2-C18). The structural tolerance of various samples to liquid water has been compared upon exposure to reaction conditions in water/oil emulsions at 200 C. In another set of experiments, structural changes have been monitored after exposure to increasing partial pressures of pure water vapor until a liquid phase is formed. The losses in crystallinity, surface area, and microporosity have been quantified by N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS). It is shown that the rate of collapse of the crystalline structure is not determined by the chemical potential of the water molecule inside the zeolite, but rather by the presence of a liquid aqueous phase, which favors dissolution and mobility of ions. Therefore, the zeolite deconstruction under hot liquid water can be described as a phenomenon that is more similar to the recrystallization that occurs under synthesis conditions than to a chemical attack, which explains the stability improvement obtained upon hydrophobization. Finally, the activity losses of the different zeolites in the presence of water have been evaluated by using the alkylation of m-cresol in a liquid biphasic system as a probe reaction, which is relevant to biomass conversion processes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Combo deal: Biomass furaldehydes are upgraded into oxygenated diesel and high-quality C10-12 linear alkane fuels. The first of two steps involves solvent-free self-condensation (Umpolung) through organocatalysis using an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), yielding C10-C12 furoin intermediates. In the metal-acid tandem catalysis step, in water, the furoin intermediates are converted into oxygenated biodiesel by hydrogenation, etherification or esterification; or into premium alkane jet fuels by hydrodeoxygenation.

AB  - TGA results indicated that the maximum decomposition temperature of the biomass decreased from 373.9 to 359.0. °C with increasing potassium concentration. For fast pyrolysis, char yield of potassium impregnated biomass doubled regardless of pyrolysis temperature compared to demineralized one. The presence of potassium also affected bio-oil properties. Water content increased from 14.4 to 19.7. wt% and viscosity decreased from 34 to 16.2. cSt, but the pH value of the bio-oil remained stable. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis revealed that potassium promoted thermochemical reactions, thus causing a decrease of levoglucosan and an increase of small molecules and lignin-derived phenols in bio-oil. Additionally, various forms of aromatic hydrocarbons, probably derived from lignins, were detected in non-condensed pyrolytic gas fractions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the yield and composition of bio-oils obtained from the auger pyrolysis of Douglas Fir wood. The tests were conducted at reactor wall temperatures between 200 and 600°C. Due to the relatively low heat transfer rates achieved between the reactor wall and the biomass particles, the temperature of the solid residue obtained was much lower (between 117 and 420°C). Bio-oil yields were close (maximum yield: 59 mass%) to those reported for fluidized bed reactors (more than 60 mass%). The maximum oil yield was obtained at a reactor wall temperature of 500°C (biomass residue heated up to 328°C). At this temperature, maximum yields of Douglas Fir primary degradation products (lignin oligomers, anhydrosugars, 2-furaldehyde, 2(5H)-furanone, 2-furanmethanol, β-methoxy-(S)- and alkylated and methoxylated phenols) were observed. The yield of products from secondary thermochemical reactions (phenol; phenol, 4-ethyl, O-cresol; phenol, 3,4-dimethyl; cresol; pyrotechol, and phenol 2,4-dimethyl, methanol and gases) increased with temperature. In all cases, the yield of the products from secondary reactions was higher than those reported for fluidized bed reactors at comparable temperatures. The water yield (11 mass%) obtained with the auger reactor was comparable to those reported for other materials processed in fluidized bed reactors. The results obtained confirm that the auger reactor is able to achieve good yields of both bio-oil and bio-char but that the overall composition of the oil obtained will be affected by the slower heating rates achieved and the intensification of secondary reactions in gas phase. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algae are an interesting feedstock for producing biofuel via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), due to their high water content. In this study, algae slurries (5-7. wt% daf) from different species were liquefied at 250 and 375. °C in batch autoclaves during 5. min. The aim was to analyze the influence of strain-specific parameters (cell structure, biochemical composition and growth environment) on the HTL process. Results show big variations in the biocrude oil yield within species at 250. °C (from 17.6 to 44.8. wt%). At 375. °C, these differences become less significant (from 45.6 to 58.1. wt%). An appropriate characterization of feedstock appeared to be critical to interpret the results. If a high conversion of microalgae-to-biocrude is pursued, near critical conditions are required, with Scenedesmus almeriensis (freshwater) and Nannochloropsis gaditana (marine) leading to the biocrude oils with lower nitrogen content from each growth environment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, a one-step extraction/transesterification process was developed to directly convert wet oil-bearing microalgal biomass of Chlorella vulgaris ESP-31 into biodiesel using immobilized Burkholderia lipase as the catalyst. The microalgal biomass (water content of 86-91%; oil content 14-63%) was pre-treated by sonication to disrupt the cell walls and then directly mixed with methanol and solvent to carry out the enzymatic transesterification. Addition of a sufficient amount of solvent (hexane is most preferable) is required for the direct transesterification of wet microalgal biomass, as a hexane-to-methanol mass ratio of 1.65 was found optimal for the biodiesel conversion. The amount of methanol and hexane required for the direct transesterification process was also found to correlate with the lipid content of the microalga. The biodiesel synthesis process was more efficient and economic when the lipid content of the microalgal biomass was higher. Therefore, using high-lipid-content microalgae as feedstock appears to be desirable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work demonstrates that the production of biodiesel using the lipids extracted from sewage sludge (SS) could be economically feasible because of the remarkably high yield of oil and low cost of this feedstock, as compared to conventional biodiesel feedstocks. The yield of oil from SS, 980 000 L ha -1 year-1, is superior to those from microalgal and soybean oils, 446 and 2200 L ha-1 year-1, respectively. According to the case study of South Korea, the price of the lipids extracted from SS was approximately $0.03 L-1 (USD), which is lower than those of all current biodiesel feedstocks. This work also highlights the insight of a novel methodology for transforming lipids containing high amounts of free fatty acids (FFAs) to biodiesel using a thermochemical process under ambient pressure in a continuous flow system. This allowed the combination of esterification of FFAs and transesterification of triglycerides into a single noncatalytic process, which led to a 98.5% ± 0.5% conversion efficiency to FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) within 1 min in a temperature range of 350-500 °C. The new process for converting the lipids extracted from SS shows high potential to achieve a major breakthrough in minimizing the cost of biodiesel production owing to its simplicity and technical advantages, as well as environmental benefits. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Canadian pinewood was pyrolyzed at 450. °C in an Infrared oven and the pyrolysis vapors were converted by passing through a catalyst bed at 450. °C. The catalysts studied were amorphous silica alumina (ASA) containing alkali metal or alkaline earth metal species including Na, K, Cs, Mg and Ca. The catalysts effectiveness to reduce the bio-oil oxygen content, to enhance the bio-oil energy density and to change the liquid and gas product distribution were evaluated using different techniques including gravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, Karl-Fischer titration, GC/MS and micro-GC analysis. According to the results K/ASA found to be the most effective catalysts for conversion of hollocellulose (hemicellulose and cellulose)-derived vapors of pinewood while Cs/ASA catalyst was the most effective catalyst for conversion of lignin-derived vapors and production of hydrocarbons. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass can be utilized to produce promising biofuels. In this study, liquid hot water pretreatments were performed to break the intricate structure of sugarcane bagasse, which resists the enzyme accessibility to cellulose. The effects of temperatures and times on the hemicellulose degradation (including the yields of pentoses and hexoses, the proportion of monomers and oligosaccharides, as well as limited inhibitors) and cellulose enzymatic digestibility were evaluated. The results indicated that the maximum xylose yields (combined 3.85. g xylose and 13.21. g xylo-oligosaccharides per 100. g raw material) in prehydrolyzate liquid were obtained at 180°C and 30. min. Due to the effective removal of hemicellulose, the maximum glucose yield in enzyme hydrolyzate reached 37.27. g per 100. g raw material, representing 90.13% of glucose in the sugarcane bagasse. The maximal total sugars yield (combined prehydrolyzate and enzymatic hydrolyzate) were 53.65. g based on 100. g raw material. © 2013.

AB  - Biodiesel can be a potential alternative to petroleum diesel, but its high production cost has impeded its commercialization in most parts of the world. One of the main drivers for the generation and use of biodiesel is energy security, because this fuel can be produced from locally available resources, thereby reducing the dependence on imported oil. Many countries are now trying to produce biodiesel from plant or vegetable oils. However, the consumption of large amounts of vegetable oils for biodiesel production could result in a shortage in edible oils and cause food prices to soar. Alternatively, the use of animal fat, used frying oils, and waste oils from restaurants as feedstock could be a good strategy to reduce the cost. However, these limited resources might not meet the increasing demand for clean, renewable fuels. Therefore, recent research has been focused the use of residual materials as renewable feedstock in order to lower the cost of producing biodiesel. Microbial oils or single cell oils (SCOs), produced by oleaginous microorganisms have been studied as promising alternatives to vegetable or seed oils. Various types of agro-industrial residues have been suggested as prospective nutritional sources for microbial cultures. Since the most abundant residue from agricultural crops is lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), this byproduct has been given top-priority consideration as a source of biomass for producing biodiesel. But the biological transformation of lignocellulosic materials is complicated due to their crystalline structure. So, pretreatment is required before they can be converted into fermentable sugar. This article compares and scrutinizes the extent to which various microbes can accumulate high levels of lipids as functions of the starting materials and the fermentation conditions. Also, the obstacles associated with the use of LCB are described, along with a potentially viable approach for overcoming the obstacles that currently preclude the commercial production of biodiesel from agricultural biomass. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel was produced from waste frying oil (WFO) using powdered calcined clamshell (Mereterix mereterix) as a heterogeneous catalyst. Clamshell calcined at 1173 K for 2.5 and 3.5 h showed different catalytic activities. Calcination for 3.5 h resulted in a catalyst of higher activity and reduced transesterification reaction time. The raw and calcined clamshells were characterized by XRD, FTIR, XRF spectroscopy and BET analysis. The XRD peaks showed the characteristics peaks of CaO at 2θ = 37.4, 47.3, and 54.4°. A few high intensity peaks of Ca(OH) 2 at 2θ = 17.9 and 34.1° in the calcined catalyst were also obtained which might have formed due to exposure of CaO with atmospheric air. The used catalyst showed peaks at 8.2 and 10.1° which were characteristic of calcium glyceroxide which was formed due to reaction of calcium oxide and glycerol. Formation of Ca(OH) 2 in the calcined clamshell was also confirmed by FTIR spectra which showed a sharp OH - stretching band. The catalyst was found to comprise principally of calcium (97%) and a few minor elements (Si, Na, Fe, Al, Sr, S, Mn) as analyzed by XRF. The surface area of the calcined clamshell was found to be 2.6 m 2 g -1. The optimum values for various parameters were found to be 3.0 g of catalyst and 25 ml of methanol per 100 ml of oil (6.03:1, methanol to oil molar ratio) at 333 K in 3 h. A high yield (&gt;89%) and conversion (&gt;97%) were obtained on optimization of variables. With the mandatory compulsion by National Biofuel Policy in India to blend 20% of biofuels i.e. bioethanol and biodiesel in the spark ignition and compression ignition engines respectively from 2017 strengthens the applicability of the present study that utilizes waste resources as feedstock and catalyst in the production of a green fuel i.e. biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: A major bottleneck in microalgal biodiesel production is lipid content, which is often low in microalgal species. The present study examines Chlorella vulgaris as a potential feedstock for biodiesel by identifying and evaluating the relationships between the critical variables that enhance the lipid yield, and characterizes the biodiesel produced for various properties. Results: Factors affecting lipid accumulation in a green microalga, Chlorella vulgaris were examined. Multifactor optimization raised the lipid pool to 55% dry cell weight against 9% control. When C. vulgaris cells pre-grown in glucose (0.7%)-supplemented medium were transferred to the optimized condition at the second stage, the lipid yield was boosted to 1974 mg L -1, a value almost 20-fold higher than for the control. The transesterified C. vulgaris oil showed the presence of ~82% saturated fatty acids, with palmitate and stearate as major components, thus highlighting the oxidative stability of C. vulgaris biodiesel. The fuel properties (density, viscosity, acid value, iodine value, calorific value, cetane index, ash and water contents) are comparable with the international (ASTM and EN) and Indian (IS) biodiesel standards. Conclusion: C. vulgaris biomass with 55% lipid content and adequate fuel properties is potentially a renewable feedstock for biodiesel. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Lipase-displaying whole cells appear to be efficient biocatalysts because of their low preparation costs and simple recycling procedure. The combined utilization of. Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and. Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML), separately displayed on. Pichia pastoris whole cells, to produce biodiesel in co-solvent media was investigated. A response surface methodology incorporating a D-optimal design was employed to obtain the optimum reaction conditions for methyl ester (ME) synthesis. The synergistic effect of the two displayed lipases and the use of tert-butanol and isooctane as the co-solvent media were found to significantly improve the transesterification reaction. Scaled-up reactions using various types of feedstock were carried out in a 0.5-l stirred reactor under optimum conditions, affording ME yields over 90% in 12 h. Moreover, the ME yields remained above 85% after 20 repeated batch cycles. In conclusion, this biocatalyst affords a promising route to efficient biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic conversion of rice husk, sawdust, sugarcane bagasse, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin into olefins was performed with HZSM-5 containing 6. wt.% lanthanum. The olefins yields for different feedstocks decreased in the order: cellulose > hemicellulose > sugarcane bagasse > rice husk > sawdust > lignin. Biomass containing higher content of cellulose or hemicellulose produced more olefins than feedstocks with higher content of lignin. Among the biomass types, sugarcane bagasse provided the highest olefin yield of 0.12. kg olefins/(kg dry biomass) and carbon yield of 21.2. C-mol%. Temperature, residence time and the catalyst/feed ratio influenced olefin yield and selectivity. While the HZSM-5 zeolite was catalytically active, the incorporation of lanthanum at 2.9, and 6.0. wt.% increased the production of olefins from rice husk by 15.6% and 26.5%, respectively. The conversion of biomass to light olefins potentially provides an alternative and sustainable route for production of the key petrochemicals. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, different flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent glucose dehydrogenases (FADGDHs) were characterized electrochemically after "wiring" them with an osmium redox polymer [Os(4,4′-dimethyl-2, 2′-bipyridine) 2(PVI) 10Cl] + on graphite electrodes. One tested FADGDH was that recently discovered in Glomerella cingulata (GcGDH), another was the recombinant form expressed in Pichia pastoris (rGcGDH), and the third was a commercially available glycosylated enzyme from Aspergillus sp. (AspGDH). The performance of the Os-polymer "wired" GDHs on graphite electrodes was tested with glucose as the substrate. Optimal operational conditions and analytical characteristics like sensitivity, linear ranges and current density of the different FADGDHs were determined. The performance of all three types of FADGDHs was studied at physiological conditions (pH 7.4). The current densities measured at a 20 mM glucose concentration were 494±17, 370±24, and 389±19 μA cm -2 for GcGDH, rGcGDH, and AspGDH, respectively. The sensitivities towards glucose were 2.16, 1.90, and 1.42 μA mM -1 for GcGDH, rGcGDH, and AspGDH, respectively. Additionally, deglycosylated rGcGDH (dgrGcGDH) was investigated to see whether the reduced glycosylation would have an effect, e.g., a higher current density, which was indeed found. GcGDH/Os-polymer modified electrodes were also used and investigated for their selectivity for a number of different sugars. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Glucose has been widely studied as a fuel in biofuel cells because it not only is abundant in nature and in the bloodstream but also demonstrates low volatility, is nontoxic, and is inexpensive. Those qualities coupled with its relatively high energy density qualify glucose as a promising fuel. However, one key to efficient use of this substrate as fuel is the ability to oxidize glucose to CO 2 and convert, more efficiently, the chemical energy released upon the redox reactions to electrical power. Most glucose biofuel cells in literature only oxidize glucose to gluconolactone. In this paper, we report the development of a six-enzyme cascade bioanode containing pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent enzymes extracted from Gluconobacter sp., aldolase from Sulfolobus solfataricus and oxalate oxidase from barley to sequentially oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide through a synthetic minimal metabolic pathway. This bioanode is also capable of performing direct electron transfer to carbon electrode surfaces and eliminates the need for mediators. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The conversion of the electromagnetic energy into heat depends largely on the dielectric properties of the material being treated. Therefore, the fundamental understanding of these properties is necessary for designing industrial microwave processing unit. The objective of this study is to investigate the dielectric properties of oil palm biomass and biochar at varying frequency in the range 0.2-10. GHz. The dielectric properties were measured using a coaxial probe attached to a network analyzer. The results indicate the dielectric constant was found to be inversely proportional to the frequency. However, the biomass in the present study did not obey the famous Debye equation and hence, the loss factor was found to be directly proportional to the frequency. The dielectric properties of oil palm shell (OPS) and its biochar were found to be almost similar and higher than oil palm fiber (OPF). Relaxation time and static dielectric constant were also presented in the paper. Lastly, the heating characteristics under MW irradiation confirmed poor microwave absorbing properties of oil palm biomass. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The microwave induced pyrolysis of the microalgae Scenedesmus almeriensis and its extraction residue was carried out at 400 and 800°C. The results show that it is possible to obtain a gas fraction with a high content (c.a. 50vol.%) in H2 from both materials, regardless of the pyrolysis temperature. Furthermore, an outstanding syngas production and high gas yields were achieved. The maximum syngas concentration obtained was c.a. 94vol.%, in the case of the pyrolysis of the residue at 800°C, indicating that the production of CO2 and light hydrocarbons was minimized. The same experiments were carried out in a conventional electric furnace in order to compare the products and yields obtained. It was found that microwave induced pyrolysis gives rise not only to higher gas yields but also to greater syngas and H2 production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from yellow horn (Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge.) seed oil using ion exchange resin as heterogeneous catalyst was investigated. After illustration of the mechanisms of transesterification reactions catalyzed by typical ion exchange resins, the factors affecting microwave-assisted transesterification process were studied. A high conversion yield of about 96% was achieved under optimal conditions using high alkaline anion exchange resins as catalyst. Analyzing the FAMEs composition by GC-MS and main physical-chemical properties demonstrated that the biodiesel product prepared from yellow horn seed oil was of high quality. Compared with conventional alkali catalyst, the outstanding characteristics of reusability and operational stability made the resin catalyst more predominant for biodiesel production. In addition, a comprehensive kinetic model was established for analyzing the reaction. The results of present research showed that microwave-assisted transesterification process catalyzed by high alkaline anion exchange resin was a green, effective and economic technology for biodiesel industry. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil produced via fast pyrolysis of biomass has the potential to be processed in a FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) unit to generate liquid fuel. However, this oil requires a significant upgrade to become an acceptable feedstock for refinery plants due to its high oxygen content. One promising route to improve the quality of bio-oil is to pyrolyse the parent biomass in the presence of a catalyst. This work investigates the influence of faujasite catalysts on the pyrolysis of pinewood. Pyrolysis process with Na-faujasite, Na0.2H0.8-faujasite, and H-faujasite (Na-FAU, Na0.2H0.8-FAU, and H-FAU) were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C. It is shown that, in the same condition, catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapour is superior to in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of biomass when it comes to quality of bio-oil. The yields of coke, gas and water increase while that of organic phase decreases proportional with the concentration of protons in catalysts. Compared to the other two catalysts, Na0.2H0.8-FAU removes the most oxygen from bio-oil, reduces amount of acids and aldehydes/ketones which result in a higher energy-contained and more stable oil with less corrosive property. However, the biggest contribution to the oxygen removal is via the formation of reaction water, which is not an optimum path. This leaves space for future development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Oil palm empty fruit bunch pellets were subjected to pyrolysis in a multimode microwave (MW) system (1. kW and 2.45. GHz frequency) with and without the MW absorber, activated carbon. The ratio of biomass to MW absorber not only affected the temperature profiles of the EFB but also pyrolysis products such as bio-oil, char, and gas. The highest bio-oil yield of about 21. wt.% was obtained with 25% MW absorber. The bio-oil consisted of phenolic compounds of about 60-70 area% as detected by GC-MS and confirmed by FT-IR analysis. Ball lightning (plasma arc) occurred due to residual palm oil in the EFB biomass without using an MW absorber. The bio-char can be utilized as potential alternative fuel because of its heating value (25. MJ/kg). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sulfated zirconia was synthesized and characterized by various physico-chemical techniques such as EDS, Thermal analysis (TGA & DTG), FT-IR, XRD, BET surface area measurement, SEM and n-butyl amine acidity determination. The use of synthesized catalyst was explored for biodiesel production by esterification of (free fatty acid) oleic acid with methanol. Influence of various reaction parameters (catalyst concentration, acid/alcohol molar ratio, catalyst amount, reaction temperature and reaction time) on catalytic performance was studied to optimize the conditions for maximum yield of methyl oleate. Also the catalyst was regenerated and reused. As an application, preliminary study was carried out for biodiesel production by transesterification of waste cooking oil and Jatropha oil, as feedstock without any pretreatment, with methanol. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An intravenous implantable glucose/dioxygen hybrid enzyme-Pt micro-biofuel cell (BFC) was investigated. In this miniaturized BFC, a flexible carbon fiber (FCF) microelectrode modified with neutral red redox mediator and glucose oxidase was used as the bioanode, and an FCF modified with platinum nanoparticles stabilized on PAMAM-G4 dendrimer was used as the cathode. In vitro experiments conducted using the BFC in a phosphate buffer solution (50 mmol L-1, pH = 7.2) and glucose (47 mmol L-1) showed high electrocatalytic performance with an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 400 mV, a maximum current density of 2700 μA cm-2 at 0.0 V and a maximum output power of 200 μW cm-2 at 250 mV. Under physiological conditions, glucose from rat blood is used as a fuel in anodic reactions and dissolved molecular oxygen is used as the oxidizing agent on the cathode. For in vivo experiments, the BFC was inserted into the jugular vein of a living rat (Rattus novergicus) using a catheter (internal diameter 0.5 mm). The power density of the implantable BFC was evaluated over a period of 24 h, and an OCV of 125 mV with a maximum power density of 95 μW cm-2 was obtained at 80 mV. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - A novel method has been developed for the direct conversion of fructose into 5-(ethoxymethyl)furfural (EMF) catalyzed by an organic-inorganic hybrid solid catalyst [MIMBS]3PW12O40. First, etherification of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) by ethanol was studied over a series of catalysts, and [MIMBS]3PW12O40 showed the best catalytic activity with an EMF yield of 90.7% at 70 °C. Then the one-pot dehydrative etherification of fructose into EMF was studied. It indicated that a low temperature (70 °C) was not favored for the dehydrative etherification process, and a high temperature (110 °C) was favored to promote side reactions. A high EMF yield of 90.5% was obtained from fructose at 90 °C with 5 mol % catalyst for 24 h. The recycling test demonstrated that [MIMBS]3PW12O40 could be reused several times without losing catalytic activity, with an average EMF yield of approximate 90%. This work provides a meaningful method for the conversion of carbohydrates into fine chemicals and biofuel additives. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Measurements of the knocking propensity of two biofuels blended at low levels with a gasoline fuel were performed in a single-cylinder direction-injection research engine at three load conditions. Blends tested included three blends containing 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) blended by volume with gasoline at concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 15%. A blend of 10% DMF/10% ethanol with a balance of gasoline was also tested. The knocking propensity of the blends using the potential advanced biofuel were compared to the performance of E10 and gasoline. Knocking intensity was quantified using in-cylinder pressure measurements. A comparison of the improvement in the knock-limited spark advance (KLSA) relative to the baseline gasoline was performed for the fuels tested, where the knock limit was defined as the spark crank angle where more than 10% of the cycles knock with a knocking intensity greater than 100 kPa. All of the blends using either DMF or ethanol showed improvement in the KLSA relative to the baseline gasoline fuel. The blend with 10% ethanol and 10% DMF showed the best performance for the fuels tested and gave an improvement in the KLSA of 7 crank angle degrees at the full load condition. Ethanol showed a greater ability to reduce knocking tendency than DMF for the same volumetric blend percentage. The higher autoignition resistance of the ethanol blends is hypothesized to be due at least in part to the higher latent heat of vaporization reducing the in-cylinder temperature. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Jatropha curcas is recognized as a new energy crop due to the presence of the high amount of oil in its seeds that can be converted into biodiesel. The quality and performance of the biodiesel depends on the chemical composition of the fatty acids present in the oil. The fatty acids profile of the oil has a direct impact on ignition quality, heat of combustion and oxidative stability. An ideal biodiesel composition should have more monounsaturated fatty acids and less polyunsaturated acids. Jatropha seed oil contains 30% to 50% polyunsaturated fatty acids (mainly linoleic acid) which negatively impacts the oxidative stability and causes high rate of nitrogen oxides emission. Results: The enzyme 1-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine delta 12-desaturase (FAD2) is the key enzyme responsible for the production of linoleic acid in plants. We identified three putative delta 12 fatty acid desaturase genes in Jatropha (JcFAD2s) through genome-wide analysis and downregulated the expression of one of these genes, JcFAD2-1, in a seed-specific manner by RNA interference technology. The resulting JcFAD2-1 RNA interference transgenic plants showed a dramatic increase of oleic acid (> 78%) and a corresponding reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids (< 3%) in its seed oil. The control Jatropha had around 37% oleic acid and 41% polyunsaturated fatty acids. This indicates that FAD2-1 is the major enzyme responsible for converting oleic acid to linoleic acid in Jatropha. Due to the changes in the fatty acids profile, the oil of the JcFAD2-1 RNA interference seed was estimated to yield a cetane number as high as 60.2, which is similar to the required cetane number for conventional premium diesel fuels (60) in Europe. The presence of high seed oleic acid did not have a negative impact on other Jatropha agronomic traits based on our preliminary data of the original plants under greenhouse conditions. Further, we developed a marker-free system to generate the transgenic Jatropha that will help reduce public concerns for environmental issues surrounding genetically modified plants. Conclusion: In this study we produced seed-specific JcFAD2-1 RNA interference transgenic Jatropha without a selectable marker. We successfully increased the proportion of oleic acid versus linoleic in Jatropha through genetic engineering, enhancing the quality of its oil. © 2012 Qu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - We report the synthesis of a new multifunctional mesoporous zeolite catalyst with cerium incorporated within the framework. This catalyst shows a shift in selectivity from typical HZSM-5 products (benzene, toluene, and xylenes) to valuable oxygenated chemicals (furans, ketones, aldehydes) during the catalytic fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. The cerium-incorporated hierarchical zeolite was synthesized using a dry-gel method followed by steam-assisted crystallization. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), NH 3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH 3-TPD), diffuse reflectance FT-IR, and diffuse reflectance UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The multifunctional catalyst was then studied in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of glucose (a carbohydrate model compound) at 600 °C. The new catalyst was compared with a mesoporous HZSM-5 catalyst with incipient wetness incorporated cerium and an ion exchanged commercial HZSM-5 catalyst. These catalysts behaved similarly to the parent materials, but the new catalyst with cerium incorporated into the zeolite framework exhibited selectivities greatly shifted from aromatics to oxygenated chemicals. Furthermore, this catalyst produced less coke (40 wt % or 11 mol % carbon) and increased CO production through decarbonylation reactions. These properties persisted after catalyst regeneration and recycle. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Liquefaction of biomass with proper solvents and catalysts is a promising process to produce liquid biofuels and valuable chemicals. In this study, pinewood sawdust was liquefied in the presence of various supercritical solvents (carbon dioxide, water, acetone, and ethanol) and catalysts (alkali salts and acidic zeolites). The liquid, gas and solid products were analyzed using GC-MS, FT-IR, elemental analyzer, 1H NMR, 13C NMR. The experimental results showed that both solvent and catalyst can significantly improve the liquefaction process by increasing the yield of liquid oil and suppressing the formation of solid residue. K2CO3 showed the best performance by doubling the yield of bio oil. Meanwhile, the maximum bio-oil yield (30.8wt%) and the minimum solid residue yield (28.9wt%) were obtained when ethanol was employed as the solvent. Solvents can also strongly affect the distribution of liquid products. 2,4,5,7-tetramethyl-phenanthrene and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were the premier compounds in liquid product as supercritical carbon dioxide is used as solvent while 2-methyl-naphthalene became the main composition when water is used as solvent. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of different activated carbon (AC) catalysts based on various carbon sources on products yield and chemical compositions of upgraded pyrolysis oils were investigated using microwave pyrolysis of Douglas fir sawdust pellets. Results showed that high amounts of phenols were obtained (74.61% and 74.77% in the upgraded bio-oils by DARCO MRX (wood based) and DARCO 830 (lignite coal based) activated carbons, respectively). The catalysts recycling test of the selected catalysts indicated that the carbon catalysts can be reused for at least 3-4 times and produced high concentrations of phenol and phenolic compounds. The chemical reaction mechanism for phenolics production during microwave pyrolysis of biomass was analyzed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A non-syngas direct steam reforming route is investigated for the conversion of methanol to hydrogen and carbon dioxide over a CuZnGaOx catalyst at 150-200 °C. This route is in marked contrast with the conventional complex route involving steam reformation to syngas (CO/H 2) at high temperature, followed by water gas shift and CO cleanup stages for hydrogen production. Here we report that high quality hydrogen and carbon dioxide can be produced in a single-step reaction over the catalyst, with no detectable CO (below detection limit of 1 ppm). This can be used to supply proton exchange membrane fuel cells for mobile applications without invoking any CO shift and cleanup stages. The working catalyst contains, on average, 3-4 nm copper particles, alongside extremely small size of copper clusters stabilized on a defective ZnGa2O4 spinel oxide surface, providing hydrogen productivity of 393.6 ml g-1-cat h-1 at 150 °C. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Biocathodes in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) can be used to convert CO2 into diverse organic compounds through a process called microbial electrosynthesis. Unfortunately, start-up of anaerobic biocathodes in BESs is a difficult and time consuming process. Here, a pre-enrichment method was developed to improve start-up of anaerobic facultatively autotrophic biocathodes capable of using cathodes as the electron donor (electrotrophs) and CO2 as the electron acceptor. Anaerobic enrichment of bacteria from freshwater bog sediment samples was first performed in batch cultures fed with glucose and then used to inoculate BES cathode chambers set at -0.4V (versus a standard hydrogen electrode; SHE). After two weeks of heterotrophic operation of BESs, CO2 was provided as the sole electron acceptor and carbon source. Consumption of electrons from cathodes increased gradually and was sustained for about two months in concert with a significant decrease in cathode chamber headspace CO2. The maximum current density consumed was -34±4mA/m2. Biosynthesis resulted in organic compounds that included butanol, ethanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and hydrogen gas. Bacterial community analyses based on 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed Trichococcus palustris DSM 9172 (99% sequence identity) as the prevailing species in biocathode communities, followed by Oscillibacter sp. and Clostridium sp. Isolates from autotrophic cultivation were most closely related to Clostridium propionicum (99% sequence identity; ZZ16), Clostridium celerecrescens (98-99%; ZZ22, ZZ23), Desulfotomaculum sp. (97%; ZZ21), and Tissierella sp. (98%; ZZ25). This pre-enrichment procedure enables simplified start-up of anaerobic biocathodes for applications such as electrofuel production by facultatively autotrophic electrotrophs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work the use of the heterogeneous catalysts pure (LO) and sulfated (SLO) lanthanum oxide, pure HZSM-5 and SLO/HZSM-5 (HZSM-5 impregnated with sulfated lanthanum oxide (SO42-/La2O3)) was evaluated. The structural characterization of the materials (BET) showed that the sulfation process led to a reduction of the SLO and SLO/HZSM-5 surface area values. FTIR showed bands characteristic of the materials and, FTIR-pyridine indicated the presence of strong Brønsted sites on the sulfated material. In the catalytic tests the temperature was the parameter that most influenced the reactions. The best reaction conditions were: 10% catalyst, 100°C temperature and 1:5 mOA/mmeOH for LO, SLO, SLO/HZSM-5 and 10% catalyst, 100°C temperature and 1:20 mOA/mmeOH for HZSM-5. Under these conditions the conversions were: 67% and 96%, for LO and SLO, respectively and 80% and 100%, for HZSM-5 and SLO/HZSM-5, respectively. All catalysts deactivated after the first use, but the deactivation of SLO/HZSM-5 was smaller. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study explores the characteristics of the literature on the biofuels published during the last three decades, based on the databases of Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and its implications using the scientometric techniques. The results of this study reveal that the literature on the biofuels has grown exponentially during this period reaching 6,770 papers in total with paralleling enormous changes in the research landscape. Papers mostly have been journal articles, reviews, and proceedings, predominantly in English. USA, China, and Germany have been the three most prolific countries. The "University of Illinois" has been the most prolific institution. The most prolific authors have been "Demirbas A" and "Minter SD". "Biomass & Bioenergy" has been the most prolific journal whilst, "Energy Fuels" has been the most prolific subject area. The total number of citations is 79,304, giving a ratio for the "Average Citations per Item" as 11.71 and "H-index" as 101. Ragauskas et al. has had the highest impact on the literature. Both the research output and the citations have thrived spectacularly after 2005. The results of this first ever such study of its kind, show that the scientometric analysis has a great potential to gain valuable insights into the evolution of the high-profile research on the biofuels, complementing other research techniques. © Sila Science.

AB  - Water contaminated by oil and gas production poses challenges to the management of America's water resources. Here we report the design, fabrication, and laboratory evaluation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes decorated with superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for oil-water separation. As revealed by confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy, the magnetic carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) remove oil droplets through a two-step mechanism, in which MCNTs are first dispersed at the oil-water interface and then drag the droplets with them out of water by a magnet. Measurements of removal efficiency with different initial oil concentration, MCNT dose, and mixing time show that kinetics and equilibrium of the separation process can be described by the Langmuir model. Separation capacity qt is a function of MCNT dose m, mixing time t, and residual oil concentration Ce at equilibrium:1qt=1qmax2kwm(1KCe+1)21t+1qmax(1KCe+1) where qmax, kw, and K are maximum separation capacity, wrapping rate constant, and equilibrium constant, respectively. Least-square regressions using experimental data estimate qmax=6.6(±0.6) g-diesel g-MCNT-1, kw=3.36(±0.03)Lg-diesel-1min-1, and K=2.4(±0.2)Lg-diesel-1. For used MCNTs, we further show that over 80% of the separation capacity can be restored by a 10min wash with 1mL ethanol for every 6mg MCNTs. The separation by reusable MCNTs provides a promising alternative strategy for water treatment design complementary to existing ones such as coagulation, adsorption, filtration, and membrane processes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The global demand for food could double in another 40 y owing to growth in the population and food consumption per capita. Tomeet the world's future food and sustainability needs for biofuels and renewable materials, the production of starch-rich cereals and cellulose-rich bioenergy plants must grow substantially whileminimizing agriculture's environmental footprint and conserving biodiversity. Here we demonstrate one-pot enzymatic conversion of pretreated biomass to starch through a nonnatural synthetic enzymatic pathway composed of endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolyase, cellobiose phosphorylase, and alpha-glucan phosphorylase originating from bacterial, fungal, and plant sources. A special polypeptide cap in potato alpha-glucan phosphorylase was essential to push a partially hydrolyzed intermediate of cellulose forward to the synthesis of amylose. Up to 30% of the anhydroglucose units in cellulose were converted to starch; the remaining cellulose was hydrolyzed to glucose suitable for ethanol production by yeast in the same bioreactor. Next-generation biorefineries based on simultaneous enzymatic biotransformation and microbial fermentation could address the food, biofuels, and environment trilemma.

AB  - Biomass can efficiently replace petroleum in the production of fuels for the transportation sector. One effective strategy for the processing of complex biomass feedstocks involves previous conversion into simpler compounds (platform molecules) which are more easily transformed in subsequent upgrading reactions. Lactic acid and levulinic acid are two of these relevant biomass derivatives which can easily be derived from biomass sources by means of microbial and/or chemical routes. The present paper intends to cover the most relevant catalytic strategies designed today for the conversion of these molecules into advanced biofuels (e.g. higher alcohols, liquid hydrocarbon fuels) which are fully compatible with the existing hydrocarbons-based transportation infrastructure. The routes described herein involve: (i) deoxygenation reactions which are required for controlling reactivity and for increasing energy density of highly functionalized lactic and levulinic acid combined with (ii) CC coupling reactions for increasing molecular weight of less-oxygenated reactive intermediates. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pyrolysis experiments have been conducted on a sample of corncob to determine the effects of pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and sweep gas flow rate on the pyrolysis product yields and their chemical compositions. The temperature of pyrolysis, heating rate and sweep gas flow rate were varied in the ranges of 400-550°C, 7-40°Cmin-1 and 50-200cm3min-1, respectively. The maximum oil yield of 26.44wt.% was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 500°C, heating rate of 40°Cmin-1 and sweeping gas flow rate of 100cm3min-1. The elemental analysis and calorific value of the oil were determined, and the chemical composition of the oil was investigated using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques (column chromatography, FTIR, 1H-NMR). Chromatographic and spectroscopic studies on the bio-oil showed that the bio-oil obtained from corncob could be used as a renewable fuel and chemical feedstock with a calorific value of 26.22MJkg-1 and empirical formula of CH1.34O0.28N0.01. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The functional role of aerobic and anoxic microenvironments on polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production using food waste (UFW) and effluents from acidogenic biohydrogen production process (FFW) were studied employing aerobic mixed culture as biocatalyst. Anoxic microenvironment documented higher PHA production, while aerobic microenvironment showed higher substrate degradation. FFW showed higher PHA accumulation (39.6%) than UFW (35.6%) due to ready availability of precursors (fatty acids). Higher fraction of poly-3-hydroxy butyrate (PHB) was observed compared to poly-3-hydroxy valerate (PHV) in the accumulated PHA in the form of co-polymer [P3(HB- co-HV)]. Dehydrogenase, phosphatase and protease enzymatic activities were monitored during process operation. Integration with fermentative biohydrogen production yielded additional substrate degradation under both aerobic (78%) and anoxic (72%) microenvironments apart from PHA production. Microbial community analysis documented the presence of aerobic and facultative organisms capable of producing PHA. Integration strategy showed feasibility of producing hydrogen along with PHA by consuming fatty acids generated during acidogenic process in association with increased treatment efficiency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermochemical liquefaction characteristics of rice husk in mixed solvent (ethanol-water) were investigated in this study. Compared with pure water or ethanol, the mixed solvent showed synergistic effect at a relatively lower temperature. The highest bio-oil yield was obtained at 533 K in ethanol-water mixed solvent (V/V, 5:5) and found to be 21.15%. In pure water and mixed solvent treatments, the yield of bio-oil declined with reaction temperature increasing from 533 K to 613 K. However, with the pure ethanol as solvent, the bio-oil yield increased firstly and then decreased slightly. In addition, the effects of solid-liquid ratio and solvent filling ratio on the distribution of liquefaction products were also explored with ethanol-water mixed solvent as medium. Higher solid-liquid ratio resulted in lower bio-oil yield, while the increase of solvent filling ratio led to an increase in the bio-oil yield. The compositions of bio-oil from rice husk consisted mainly of phenolic compounds, long-chain alkanes, ketones and esters. Compared with pure water or ethanol, the relative concentration of phenolic compounds in mixed solvent run was higher and reached up to 21.22%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review discusses anaerobic production of methane, hydrogen, ethanol, butanol and electricity from microalgal biomass. The amenability of microalgal biomass to these bioenergy conversion processes is compared with other aquatic and terrestrial biomass sources. The highest energy yields (kJg-1drywt. microalgal biomass) reported in the literature have been 14.8 as ethanol, 14.4 as methane, 6.6 as butanol and 1.2 as hydrogen. The highest power density reported from microalgal biomass in microbial fuel cells has been 980mWm-2. Sequential production of different energy carriers increases attainable energy yields, but also increases investment and maintenance costs. Microalgal biomass is a promising feedstock for anaerobic energy conversion processes, especially for methanogenic digestion and ethanol fermentation. The reviewed studies have mainly been based on laboratory scale experiments and thus scale-up of anaerobic utilization of microalgal biomass for production of energy carriers is now timely and required for cost-effectiveness comparisons. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The conversion of guaiacol catalyzed by Pt/ MgO in the presence of H 2 was investigated with a flow reactor at 573 K and 140 kPa. Among the dozens of reaction products identified by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry, the predominant ones were phenol, catechol, and (surprisingly) cyclopentanone, with others including methane, n-butane, butenes, n-pentane, and carbon monoxide. The predominant reactions were hydrodeoxygenation (with about 70 % of the guaiacol that was converted forming products that were reduced in oxygen). In contrast, when the catalyst incorporated an acidic support, Pt/γ-Al 2O 3, other reactions became kinetically significant, exemplified by transalkylation, and the selectivity to deoxygenated products was reduced to about half the value observed with Pt/MgO at guaiacol conversions in the range of about 6-20 %. Pt/MgO underwent deactivation less rapidly than Pt/γ-Al 2O 3, consistent with a lower rate of coke formation and with observations by scanning transmission electron microscopy showing that the average platinum cluster diameter, approximately 1-2 nm in each catalyst, did not change significantly during operation. The results point to the advantages of basic supports for noble metal hydrodeoxygenation catalysts. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternating environmentally benign fuel to mineral diesel. For the development of easier transesterification process, stable and active heterogeneous mixed metal oxide of TiO2-ZnO and ZnO nanocatalysts were synthesized and exploited for the palm oil transesterification process. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and FE-SEM studies for their structural and morphological characteristics. It was found that TiO2-ZnO nanocatalyst exhibits good catalytic activity and the catalytic performance was greatly depends on (i) catalyst concentration (ii) methanol to oil molar ratio (iii) reaction temperature and (iv) reaction time. A highest 98% of conversion was obtained at the optimum reaction parameters with 200mg of catalyst loading and the biodiesel was analyzed by TLC and 1H NMR techniques. The TiO2-ZnO nanocatalyst shows good catalytic performance over the ZnO catalyst, which could be a potential candidate for the large-scale biodiesel production from palm oil at the reduced temperature and time. © 2013.

AB  - The production of biofuels from microalgae, especially biodiesel, has become a topic of great interest in recent years. However, many of the published papers do not consider the question of scale up and the feasibility of the various processes to be operated at the very large scale required if algal biofuels are to make a meaningful contribution to renewable fuels. All the steps in the process must also be very low cost. This paper discusses the unit processes required for algal biofuels production (i. e., growing the algae, harvesting, dewatering, extraction and conversion to biofuel) and their scalability. In many cases, especially in the lipid extraction step, little is known as yet as to the scalability and economic feasibility of the various processes proposed. We also highlight the key engineering and biological issues which must be resolved for the production of biofuels from microalgae to become an economic reality. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Microalgae can be converted to an energy-dense bio-oil via pyrolysis; however, the relatively high nitrogen content of this bio-oil presents a challenge for its direct use as fuels. Therefore, hydrothermal pretreatment was employed to reduce the N content in Nannochloropsis oculata feedstock by removing proteins without requiring significant energy inputs. The effects of reaction conditions on the yield and composition of pretreated algae were investigated by varying the temperature (150-225. °C) and reaction time (10-60. min). Compared with untreated algae, pretreated samples had higher carbon contents and enhanced heating values under all reaction conditions and 6-42% lower N contents at 200-225. °C for 30-60. min. The pyrolytic bio-oil from pretreated algae contained less N-containing compounds than that from untreated samples and the bio-oil contained mainly (44.9% GC-MS peak area) long-chain fatty acids (C14-C18) which can be more readily converted into hydrocarbon fuels in the presence of simple catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of biomass thermally cracks solid biopolymers to generate a transportable liquid (bio-oil) which can be upgraded and integrated with the existing petroleum infrastructure. Understanding how the components of biomass, such as cellulose, break down to form bio-oil constituents is critical to developing successful biofuels technologies. In this work, we use a novel co-pyrolysis technique and isotopically labeled starting materials to show that levoglucosan, the most abundant product of cellulose pyrolysis (60% of total), is deoxygenated within molten biomass to form products with higher energy content (pyrans and light oxygenates). The yield of these products can be increased by a factor of six under certain reaction conditions, e.g., using long condensed-phase residence times encountered in powder pyrolysis. Finally, co-pyrolysis experiments with deuterated glucose reveal that hydrogen exchange is a critical component of levoglucosan deoxygenation. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Conversion of canola oil to normal alkane hydrocarbons was investigated using sequential reactions: continuous thermal hydrolysis and fed-batch thermo-catalytic decarboxylation. The free fatty acid (FFA) intermediate product from hydrolysis was quantified using GC-FID, which showed 99.7% conversion and the following components: palmitic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, arachidic and behenic acids. The FFA was saturated then decarboxylated at an average rate of 15.5 mmoles/min using a 5% Pd/C catalyst at 300°C. Approximately 90% decarboxylation conversion to n-alkanes was achieved within 5 h of the reaction. The resulting mixture of n-alkanes can be readily converted into renewable diesel using isomerization to improve the cold flow properties of the fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alkali-catalyzed transesterification of waste frying oils (WFO) was carried out in various conditions to investigate the effects of catalyst concentration, reaction time, methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, catalyst type (hydroxides, methoxides and ethoxides), and purification type (such as washing with hot water, purification with silica gel and dowex) on the biodiesel yields. The optimum conditions were 0.5%wt. of NaOH, 30min reaction time, 50°C reaction temperature, 7.5 methanol to oil ratio and purification with hot distilled water. 96% biodiesel yield with ∼97% ester content was obtained within in these conditions, and the activation energy was found to be as 11741Jmol-1. The determined specifications of obtained biodiesel according to ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 standards were in accordance with the required limits. As a conclusion, the present study indicates that WFO derived fuel promises being an alternative for petrodiesel, and could be used in engines without a major modification due to its qualifications. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We have engineered Escherichia coli to overproduce saturated and monounsaturated aliphatic methyl ketones in the C11 to C15 (diesel) range; this group of methyl ketones includes 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone, which are of importance to the flavor and fragrance industry and also have favorable cetane numbers (as we report here). We describe specific improvements that resulted in a 700-fold enhancement in methyl ketone titer relative to that of a fatty acid-overproducing E. coli strain, including the following: (i) overproduction of β-ketoacyl coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters achieved by modification of the β-oxidation pathway (specifically, overexpression of a heterologous acyl-CoA oxidase and native FadB and chromosomal deletion of fadA) and (ii) overexpression of a native thioesterase (FadM). FadM was previously associated with oleic acid degradation, not methyl ketone synthesis, but outperformed a recently identified methyl ketone synthase (Solanum habrochaites MKS2 [ShMKS2], a thioesterase from wild tomato) in β-ketoacyl-CoA-overproducing strains tested. Whole-genome transcriptional (microarray) studies led to the discovery that FadM is a valuable catalyst for enhancing methyl ketone production. The use of a two-phase system with decane enhanced methyl ketone production by 4- to 7-fold in addition to increases from genetic modifications. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - A new method for simultaneous coke oven gas (COG) biomethanation and in situ biogas upgrading in anaerobic reactor was developed in this study. The simulated coke oven gas (SCOG) (92% H2 and 8% CO) was injected directly into the anaerobic reactor treating sewage sludge through hollow fiber membrane (HFM). With pH control at 8.0, the added H2 and CO were fully consumed and no negative effects on the anaerobic degradation of sewage sludge were observed. The maximum CH4 content in the biogas was 99%. The addition of SCOG resulted in enrichment and dominance of homoacetogenetic genus Treponema and hydrogenotrophic genus Methanoculleus in the liquid, which indicated that H2 were converted to methane by both direct (hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis) and indirect (homoacetogenesis+aceticlastic methanogenesis) pathways in the liquid. However, the aceticlasitic genus Methanosaeta was dominant for archaea in the biofilm on the HFM, which indicated indirect (homoacetogenesis+aceticlastic methanogenesis) H2 conversion pathway on the biofilm. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An optimization-based process synthesis framework is proposed for the thermochemical conversion of biomass to liquid fuels (BTL). Gasification of biomass is used to generate synthesis gas which can be converted to raw hydrocarbons either directly using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or indirectly using catalytic conversion of methanol over ZSM-5. Multiple technologies are considered for generation of the raw hydrocarbons including (i) six types of Fischer-Tropsch units with different temperatures, catalyst types, and hydrocarbon effluent compositions, (ii) methanol conversion using methanol-to-gasoline, and (iii) methanol conversion using methanol-to-olefins. The hydrocarbons are upgraded into the final liquid fuel products (i.e., gasoline, diesel, and kerosene) using one or more technologies including ZSM-5 catalytic conversion, oligomerization, hydrocracking, isomerization, alkylation, and hydrotreating. A simultaneous heat, power, and water integration is included within the process synthesis framework to directly examine the costs associated with utility production and wastewater treatment with a particular topological design. A rigorous global optimization branch-and-bound strategy is implemented to mathematically guarantee the development of a BTL refinery that is economically and environmentally superior to all competing designs. Twenty-four case studies are investigated to determine the effect of refinery capacity, liquid fuel composition, and biomass feedstock on the overall system cost, the BTL refinery topological design, the process material/energy balances, and the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - A series of Pd nanoparticles deposited on the SiO2 support were facilely and successfully synthesized in the presence of the green solvent CO2, where the uniform distribution of Pd with small particle size was successfully achieved. The resulting Pd/SiO2 nanoparticles catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performances in the selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived levulinic acid, showing close to perfect selectivity of biofuel γ-valerolactone with the TON of 884.7 at 97.3% conversion of levulinic acid. The catalytic performance was superior to the activities of the 5 wt% Pd/SiO2 nanoparticle catalyst prepared by the traditional impregnation method. Besides, the reaction parameters (e.g., the Pd loading, reaction time, reaction temperature, and hydrogen pressure), catalyst stability and reaction mechanism on the hydrogenation performance were studied. The resulting Pd nanoparticles catalysts behaved high stability in the hydrogenation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was carried out on the effect of temperature (in the 500-800 C range) and space-time (between 0.10 and 0.45 gcatalyst h(g bio-oil)- 1) on Ni/La2O3- αAl2O3 catalyst deactivation by coke deposition in the steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction. The experiments were conducted in a two-step system, provided with a thermal step at 200 C for the pyrolytic lignin retention and an on-line step of catalytic reforming in fluidized bed reactor. Full bio-oil conversion and a hydrogen yield of around 95% (constant for 5 h) were achieved at 700 C, S/C (steam/carbon) ratio of 12 and space-time of 0.45 gcatalyst h(gbio-oil)- 1. The results of catalyst deactivation were explained by mechanisms of coke formation and evolution, which are established based on kinetic results and coke analysis by temperature programmed combustion. At 700 C the coke is gasified and Ni does not undergo sintering. The results of hydrogen yield were compared with those obtained in the literature using different reaction technologies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the photosynthetic photosystem II, electrons are transferred from the manganese-containing oxygen evolving complex (OEC) to the oxidized primary electron-donor chlorophyll P680•+ by a proton-coupled electron transfer process involving a tyrosine-histidine pair. Proton transfer from the tyrosine phenolic group to a histidine nitrogen positions the redox potential of the tyrosine between those of P680•+ and the OEC. We report the synthesis and time-resolved spectroscopic study of a molecular triad that models this electron transfer. The triad consists of a high-potential porphyrin bearing two pentafluorophenyl groups (PF10), a tetracyanoporphyrin electron acceptor (TCNP), and a benzimidazole-phenol secondary electron-donor (Bi-PhOH). Excitation of PF10 in benzonitrile is followed by singlet energy transfer to TCNP (τ = 41 ps), whose excited state decays by photoinduced electron transfer (τ = 830 ps) to yield Bi-PhOH-PF 10•+-TCNP•-. A second electron transfer reaction follows (τ &lt; 12 ps), giving a final state postulated as BiH+-PhO•-PF10-TCNP•-, in which the phenolic proton now resides on benzimidazole. This final state decays with a time constant of 3.8 μs. The triad thus functionally mimics the electron transfers involving the tyrosine-histidine pair in PSII. The final charge-separated state is thermodynamically capable of water oxidation, and its long lifetime suggests the possibility of coupling systems such as this system to water oxidation catalysts for use in artificial photosynthetic fuel production.

AB  - Fractional distillation of bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of corn stover was investigated under atmospheric and reduced pressure/vacuum conditions. Characterization of the fractions in terms of moisture, total acid number (TAN), energy content, elemental and chemical compositions was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the distillation process in separating the components and rendering improved product properties. Results showed high yields (wt.%) of the heavy fractions (b.p. 180-250 C at 1 bar; 160-230 C at 0.5 bar) and significant reduction in moisture and TAN content. Water was obtained as a separate layer in the first (light) fraction (b.p.≤100 C at 1 bar; ≤80 C at 0.5 bar). The heating values increased, especially for the light distillates in both atmospheric and vacuum distillation and the heavy distillates in atmospheric distillation. Analysis of the chemical composition showed that aromatic and oxygenated compounds were distributed in the light and middle fractions (∼15-20%) while phenolic compounds were concentrated in the heavy fraction (∼53%). The distillation process was effective in separating the components and yielding a product (heavy fraction) with improved properties and composition and which can be further utilized as feedstock for future upgrading procedures or as a blending material with other liquid fuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important biomass-derived building block, but production and sustainable utilization of HMF remain challenging due to reactions of the highly reactive functional groups of this compound. H4SiW12O40/MCM-41 nanospheres were developed that exhibit 84.1% selectivity to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) when HMF conversion reaches 92.0%, during etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with ethanol under mild conditions. The catalyst could be reused, and its activity remained unaffected over five cycles. The strong acidity of the catalyst significantly enhanced etherification. The acetalized byproducts, 5-(diethoxymethyl)-2-furanmethanol and the HMF-dimer (5,5'(oxy-bis(methylene))bis-2-furfural), can be converted into HMF and then transformed to the main product, EMF, by using this catalyst to shift the reaction equilibrium. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With increasing energy prices and concerns about the environmental impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a growing number of national governments are putting emphasis on improving the energy efficiency of the equipment employed throughout their transportation systems. Within the U.S. transportation sector, energy use in commercial vehicles has been increasing at a faster rate than that of automobiles. A 23% increase in fuel consumption for the U.S. heavy duty truck segment is expected from 2009 to 2020. The heavy duty vehicle oil consumption is projected to grow while light duty vehicle (LDV) fuel consumption will eventually experience a decrease. By 2050, the oil consumption rate by LDVs is anticipated to decrease below 2009 levels due to CAFE standards and biofuel use. In contrast, the heavy duty oil consumption rate is anticipated to double. The increasing trend in oil consumption for heavy trucks is linked to the vitality, security, and growth of the U.S. and global economies. An essential part of a stable and vibrant U.S. economy is a productive U.S. trucking industry. Studies have shown that the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is strongly correlated to freight transport. As the economy grows, the freight tonnage increases as well as the annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Over 80% of all U.S. freight tonnage is transported by diesel power and over 75% is transported by trucks. The improved efficiency of heavy-duty engines and vehicles has been quickly overwhelmed by the increase in annual VMT. This results in heavy-duty vehicles consuming a growing share of the total transportation-related petroleum. Given the vital role that the trucking industry plays in the economy, improving the efficiency of diesel engines is a central focus of this paper. Trucks are the mainstay for trade, commerce, and economic growth. Sustaining a U.S. trucking industry that is competitive in global markets requires innovation. The truck manufacturing and supporting industries are faced with numerous challenges to reduce oil consumption and greenhouse gases, meet stringent emissions regulations, provide customer value, and improve safety. A key part of the strategy to meet these requirements is to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine (ICE) powering the trucks. The performance, low cost, and fuel flexibility render the ICE the leading candidate to power commercial vehicles for many decades. Historically, diesel engine technologies have taken more than 10 years after first introduced to diffuse throughout the commercial vehicle marketplace. This rate is faster when fuel economy provides a business advantage to the vehicle's owner. Increased efficiency and reduced emissions of diesel engines can be realized through technologies that improve engine design and better integrate systems. Engine manufacturers have a growing need to refine the capability to innovate, design, develop, and validate engine efficiency improvements. Therefore, the primary purpose of this paper is to provide guidelines and tools that allow a systematic approach to engine design and development that focuses on satisfying regulatory requirements, achieving greater fuel efficiency, and improving transportation freight efficiency. The on-highway heavy-duty diesel engine is used to illustrate the processes; however, the general principles may be applied to other diesel and natural gas engine applications, such as off-highway or power generation. For the past two decades, engine manufacturers have focused on reducing engine emissions to near zero levels while maintaining or slightly increasing fuel efficiency. With the implementation of the new EPA/NHTSA commercial vehicle GHG regulations in 2011, the need to reduce fuel consumption has been explicitly linked to the ability to manufacture and sell engines. The forward looking technology roadmaps in this paper provide a framework for improving engine efficiency over the next 10 to 15 years. The list of improvements consists of engine components, aftertreatment, and powertrain advancements. Copyright © 2013 SAE International.

AB  - The synthesis of bioadditives for biofuels from glycerol esterification with acetic acid was performed over zirconia supported heteropolyacids catalysts using H4SiW12O40 (HSiW), H3PW12O40 (HPW) and H3PMo12O40 (HPMo) as active compounds. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, NH3-TPD, FTIR of pyridine adsorption and H2O-TPD. Among the catalysts tested, HSiW/ZrO2 achieved the best catalytic performance owing to the better combination of surface Brønsted acid sites and hydrothermal stability. A 93.6% combined selectivity of glyceryl diacetate and glyceryl triacetate with complete glycerol conversion was obtained at 120°C and 4h of reaction time in the presence of HSiW/ZrO2. This catalyst also presented consistent activity for four consecutive reaction cycles, while HPW/ZrO2 and HPMo/ZrO2 exhibited distinct deactivation after reusability tests. In addition, HSiW/ZrO2 can be resistant to the impurities present in bulk glycerol. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work demonstrates the application of a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor for the synthesis of biodiesel with used frying oil as a feedstock. The synthesis involved the transesterification of used frying oil (UFO) with methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide as a catalyst. The effect of geometry and upstream pressure of a cavitating orifice plate on the rate of transesterification reaction has been studied. It is observed that the micro level turbulence created by hydrodynamic cavitation somewhat overcomes the mass transfer limitations for triphasic transesterification reaction. The significant effects of upstream pressure on the rate of formation of methyl esters have been seen. It has been observed that flow geometry of orifice plate plays a crucial role in process intensification. With an optimized plate geometry of 2 mm hole diameter and 25 holes, more than 95% of triglycerides have been converted to methyl esters in 10 min of reaction time with cavitational yield of 1.28 × 10-3 (Grams of methyl esters produced per Joule of energy supplied). The potential of UFO to produce good quality methyl esters has been demonstrated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the experimental results carried out to evaluate the oxidation and storage stabilities of various biodiesel fuels. The biodiesel fuels are palm methyl ester (PME), jatropha methyl ester (JME), coconut oil methyl ester (COME), 20% blends of PME with diesel fuel and 20% blends of JME with diesel fuel. The ordinary diesel fuel was used for comparison purposes. Various ASTM standard methods were used to evaluate all the samples at the interval of 180 h over a 2160 h (three months) duration. Oxidation stability of the samples was measured by induction period (IP) using a Rancimat instrument. Other properties such as density, viscosity, flash point, total acid number (TAN), and total base number (TBN) were measured. The results show that almost all fuel samples met the standard specifications regarding IP. The trends for density, viscosity and TAN increased, while the TBN decreased due to oxidation. For the flash point, the trend also decreased, but the rate was very low. In overall consideration, among the biodiesels, COME was found to be better in respect to oxidation and storage stabilities. The results of this investigation will be used to sustainable development of biodiesel fuel from various stock resources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work reports the production of biodiesel with waste cooking oil and dimethyl carbonate in solvent free system through transesterification by immobilized enzyme (Novozym 435) under the influence of ultrasound irradiation. The experiments were conducted in an ultrasonic water bath under three different conditions i.e. ultrasonic irradiation (UI) without stirring, UI coupled with stirring and only stirring to compare their overall effects on fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) conversion. As compared with the conventional stirring method, where FAME conversion was 38.69% at 4 h, the UI without stirring significantly enhanced the conversion of enzymatic transesterification to 57.68% for the same reaction time. However the reaction rate was further increased under the condition of ultrasonication coupled with stirring and resulted into higher conversion of 86.61% for the same reaction time. Effects of reaction parameters, such as temperature, ratio of DMC/oil, speed of agitation and enzyme loading on the conversion were investigated. Furthermore, repeated use of Novozym 435 showed gradual decline in both conversion as well as enzyme activity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study is focused on the etherification of biodiesel-derived glycerol with anhydrous ethanol over arenesulfonic acid-functionalized mesostructured silicas to produce ethyl ethers of glycerol that can be used as gasoline or diesel fuel biocomponents. Within the studied range, the best conditions to maximize glycerol conversion and yield towards ethyl-glycerols are: T= 200. °C, ethanol/glycerol molar ratio = 15/1, and catalyst loading = 19. wt%. Under these reaction conditions, 74% glycerol conversion and 42% yield to ethyl ethers have been achieved after 4. h of reaction but with a significant presence of glycerol by-products. In contrast, lower reaction temperatures (T= 160. °C) and moderate catalyst loading (14. wt%) in presence of a high ethanol concentration (ethanol/glycerol molar ratio = 15/1) are necessary to avoid the formation of glycerol by-products and maximize ethyl-glycerols selectivity. Interestingly, a close catalytic performance to that achieved using high purity glycerol has been obtained with low-grade water-containing glycerol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Low cost semiconductor photocatalysts that can efficiently harvest solar energy to generate H2 from water or biofuels will be critical to future hydrogen economies. In this study, low cost CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts (CuO loadings 0-15 wt.%) were prepared, characterized and evaluated for H2 production from ethanol-water mixtures (80 vol.% ethanol, 20 vol.% H2O) under UV excitation. TEM, XRF, EDAX, EPR, Raman, TGA, XPS and Cu L-edge NEXAFS data showed that at CuO loadings &lt;5 wt.%, Cu(II) was highly dispersed over the TiO2 support, possibly as a sub-monolayer CuO species. At higher loadings, CuO crystallites of diameter 1-2 nm were identified. The photocatalytic activity of CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts was highly dependent on the CuO loading, with 1.25 wt.% CuO being optimal (H2 production rate = 20.3 mmol g-1 h -1). Results suggest that sub-monolayer coverages of Cu(II) or CuO on TiO2 are highly beneficial for H2 generation from ethanol-water mixtures and support the development of a sustainable H 2 economy. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel was produced from acidified soybean soapstocks by using lignin-derived carbonaceous catalyst (LCC). LCC was a solid acidic catalyst prepared by direct sulfonation of residual lignin from Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge hulls. The textural properties of the catalyst were characterized by 13C MAS NMR, X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, elemental analysis and BET surface area measurement. When 7wt.% of LCC was used in the esterification, the maximum free fatty acids (FFAs) conversion (above 97%) could be achieved at a molar ratio of methanol/oil of 1:9 and a reaction temperature of 70°C for 5h. A comparison of catalytic activity between sulfuric acid and LCC revealed that LCC performed 3.5 times higher activity than sulfuric acid with the equivalent active group (SO3H). Additionally, LCC could be reused at least three times with high FFAs conversion (&gt;80%). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The marine brown alga, Sargassum patens C. Agardh, floating on the Yellow Sea, was collected and converted to bio-oil through hydrothermal liquefaction with a modified reactor. A maximum yield of 32.1 ± 0.2. wt.% bio-oil was obtained after 15. min at 340 °C, at a feedstock concentration of 15. g biomass/150. ml water, without using a catalyst. The bio-oil had a heating value of 27.1. MJ/kg and contained water, lipid, alcohol, phenol, esters, ethers and aromatic compounds. The solid residue obtained had a high ash and oxygen content. The results suggest that S. patens C. Agardh has potential as biomass feedstock for fuel and chemical products. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report the synthesis of an industrially applicable, non-sulfided bimetallic catalyst with remarkable selectivity to the hydrodeoxygenation of aryl ethers and phenol. Bimetallic FeMo phosphide catalysts have selectivities as high as ∼90% benzene and 10% cyclohexane at hydroprocessing temperatures (400 C) and industrially low pressures (2.1 MPa H2) at near complete conversion (&gt;99%). Similarly, the selectivities for the hydrodeoxygenation of anisole were 90% benzene, 4% toluene, and 6% cyclohexane at 92% conversion. Furthermore, this catalyst has the ability to cleave aryl ether bonds and specifically β-O-4 linkages with higher selectivities to aromatics compared to hydrocarbons, thus minimizing the use of expensive H2. The selectivity to aromatics from phenol was highly dependent on H2 pressure, where doubling the pressure to 4.2 MPa reduced the selectivity to benzene, while less substantial decreases were observed when anisole or a β-O-4 model compound was reacted. These high selectivities were attributed to the unique FeMo phosphide material, as catalytic studies with FeP, MoP, and the combination of FeP and MoP resulted in selectivities much lower than the FeMo phosphide material. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A one-step hydrotreatment of vegetable oil combining deoxygenation and isomerization to directly produce low cloud point, high quality diesel is devised. The Pt/zeolite bifunctional catalysts prepared by using SAPO-11 and ZSM-22 zeolites as supports are used in this process. Catalytic reactions are conducted in a fixed-bed reactor under a hydrogen atmosphere. Over the bifunctional catalyst, 100 % conversion of soybean oil is obtained at 357 °C, 4 MPa, and 1 h-1, and 80 % organic liquid yield is achieved, which is close to the maximum theoretical liquid yield. In the organic products, the alkanes selectivity is 100 % with an i-alkanes selectivity above 63 %. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD), pyridine IR spectroscopy, and other characterization techniques are used to study the effect of the support acidity on the reaction pathway. Over the Pt/zeolite bifunctional catalyst with less strong Lewis acid sites, the reaction proceeds via the decarboxylation plus decarbonylation pathway. This one-step method provides a new strategy to produce low cloud point, high quality diesel from biomass feedstock in a more economic and attractive way. From vegetable oil to diesel: The one-step hydrotreatment of vegetable oil combining deoxygenation and isomerization provides a new strategy to directly produce low cloud point, high quality diesel from biomass feedstock. The support acidity of the Pt/zeolite bifunctional catalyst greatly influences this process. Over the catalyst with more BrÃnsted acid sites and less strong Lewis acid sites, a more economically attractive pathway occurs. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - A novel bagasse-based solid acid catalyst was successfully prepared through sulfonation of incompletely carbonized bagasse. A range of conditions for producing the catalyst were investigated, and the optimized catalyst, produced under carbonization at 648 K for 0.5a H and sulfonation at 423 K for 15a H, showed excellent catalytic activity and resulted in around 95% yield of methyl oleate. Its activity was not only substantially greater than that of niobic acid and Amberlyst-15, but also comparable to or superior to that of catalysts made from pure starch or glucose, respectively. Additionally, the bagasse-derived catalyst could be repeatedly employed for at least eight cycles and still retained around 90% of its original activity, exhibiting excellent operational stability. Furthermore, the catalyst efficiently converted waste cooking oils with 38.6 wt% free fatty acids into biodiesel and afforded a high yield of about 93.8% within 12a H. These results clearly show that the bagasse-derived catalyst is economic, eco-friendly, and promising for biodiesel production from low-cost feedstocks and may find wide applications.

AB  - A series of highly active, selective, and stable silver-exchanged phosphotungstic acid (AgPW) catalysts were prepared, characterized, and evaluated for bio-derived glycerol esterification with acetic acid to produce valuable biofuel additives. The structures, morphologies, acidities, and water tolerance of these samples were determined by FTIR, Raman, XRD, SEM-EDX, FT-IR of pyridine adsorption, and H2O-TPD. Several typical acidic catalysts were also performed for comparison. Among them, partially silver-exchanged phosphotungstic acid (Ag1PW) presented exceptionally high activity, with 96.8% conversion within just 15 min of reaction time and remarkable stability, due to the unique Keggin structure, high acidity as well as outstanding water-tolerance property. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed. In addition, this Ag1PW catalyst exhibited universal significance for esterification, holding great potential for a wide range of other acid-catalyzed reactions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we have studied the aqueous-phase hydrodeoxygenation of sorbitol over two fundamentally different types of bifunctional catalysts: Pt/Zr-P and PtReOx/C in a continuous flow reactor. During the reaction, the Pt/Zr-P catalyst undergoes phase transformations of amorphous into crystalline Zr-P having a rhombohedral framework along with a 97% loss of surface area, 86% loss of Pt surface sites, and 95% loss of surface acid sites. PtReOx/C has a higher hydrothermal stability than that of Pt/Zr-P and only lost 17% of its surface area during the reaction. The number of Pt surface sites increased by a factor of 3.5 for the PtReOx/C catalyst after reaction. Products were classified into three major categories: (1) light gases, (2) gasoline-range products, and (3) aqueous-phase products. The light gases included CO2 and C1C4 alkanes. The gasoline-range products included C5C6 alkanes, C2C6 alcohols, tetrahydrofurans, tetrahydropyrans, and small amounts of C2C6 aldehydes, ketones, and organic acids. The aqueous-phase products included isosorbide, mannitol, sorbitan, hexanetriol, C2C6 diols, glycerol, and methanol. The gasoline-range yield of each catalyst was 66.8% and 44.4% for the Pt/Zr-P and PtReOx/C catalysts, respectively. The PtReOx/C catalyst had a 34 times higher reaction rates than Pt/Zr-P on a Pt mass basis. However, the turnover frequency of both catalysts was similar based on the number of surface Pt sites measured after reaction. The acid sites on the PtReOx catalyst are able to isomerize sorbitol into mannitol, whereas no mannitol was observed with the Pt/Zr-P catalyst. Mannitol had a lower rate of coke formation than sorbitol for APHDO on the Pt/Zr-P catalyst. The PtReOx/C had a higher selectivity toward secondary alcohols than Pt/Zr-P which produced all primary alcohols. The PtReO x/C had a higher CO2 selectivity than Pt/Zr-P, suggesting the PtReOx/C has a higher rate of decarbonylation than Pt/Zr-P. Pt/Zr-P had a higher rate of CO bond cleavage than PtReOx/C, leading to higher C6 product selectivity (35.8% vs. 11.6%). © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A preliminary assessment of castor plant adaptability at Northern Portugal was performed, together with the evaluation of the extracted raw oil, without any refinement, for biodiesel production. Castor was seeded, plants grew and seeds were manually harvested after 2 years. Mechanical and chemical oil extraction procedures were evaluated. Biodiesel was produced by homogenous alkaline transesterification and experimental planning was conducted to evaluate the influence of temperature and reaction time in product yield and quality; 20 experiments were performed. A 54.1% (w/w) oil yield was obtained by Soxhlet extraction with methanol after grinding the seeds. Product yield ranged from 43.3 to 74.1% (w/w), biodiesel quality varied and the conditions that lead to the best product were established. Results indicate that, to achieve higher product yields and quality using raw oil, longer reaction times are required compared to what is generally reported for refined oil. Statistically significant predictive models were obtained to estimate product yield and quality as function of the studied reaction variables. The best temperature and reaction time to produce biodiesel from raw castor oil were 65 °C and 8 h, where models predict a product yield of 73.62% (w/w) and a purity of 83.41% (w/w). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The energy intensive harvesting of tiny microalgae cells (1-70 μm) from culture broth accounts for at least 20-30% of total costs of algal biomass production. The aim of this study was to develop an alternative fungus pelletization assisted bioflocculation method for harvesting microalgae using pellet-forming fungal strain (Aspergillus oryzae) isolated from municipal wastewater sludge. Facultative heterotrophic microalga Chlorella vulgaris UMN235 was used as a model species. Under heterotrophic growth condition, the key factors including spore inoculums, organic carbon concentration in medium as well as pH variation had significantly positive effects on fungus-algae pellet formation. The process parameters of 1.2 × 104 spores/mL, 20 g/L glucose, and pH ranged from 4.0 to 5.0 were found optimal for efficient fungus-algae pellet formation. For autotrophic growth, when pH of culture broth was adjusted to 4.0-5.0 with organic carbon addition (10 g/L glucose), almost 100% harvesting efficiency of microalgae was obtained. Moreover, it was observed that diameter and the concentration of fungus-algae pellets were affected by the shaker rotation. The novel harvesting technology developed in this study might reduce the microalgae harvesting cost and will have potential to be applied to all types of microalgae species as alternative to other traditional harvesting methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae and egg whites was investigated to evaluate the performance of different zeolites for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Three zeolites with different structures (H-Y, H-Beta and H-ZSM5) were used to study the effect of catalyst type on the aromatic yield. All three catalysts significantly increased the aromatic yields from pyrolysis of microalgae and egg whites compared with non-catalytic runs, and H-ZSM5 was most effective with a yield of 18.13%. Three H-ZSM5 with silica-to-alumina ratios of 30, 80 and 280 were used to study the effect of Si/Al ratio on the aromatic yield. The maximum yield was achieved at the Si/Al ratio of 80, which provides moderate acidity to achieve high aromatic production and reduce coke formation simultaneously. Aromatic production increased with the incorporation of copper or gallium to HZSM-5. However, other studied metals either had no significant influence or led to a lower aromatic yield. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) from microalgae biomass is generally low via traditional extraction-conversion route due to the deficient solvent extraction. In this study a two-step in situ process was investigated to obtain a high FAME yield from microalgae biomass that had high free fatty acids (FFA) content. This was accomplished with a pre-esterification process using heterogeneous catalyst to reduce FFA content prior to the base-catalyzed transesterification. The two-step in situ process resulted in a total FAME recovery up to 94.87. ±. 0.86%, which was much higher than that obtained by a one-step acid or base catalytic in situ process. The heterogeneous catalyst, Amberlyst-15, could be used for 8 cycles without significant loss in activity. This process have the potential to reduce the production cost of microalgae-derived FAME and be more environmental compatible due to the higher FAME yield with reduced catalyst consumption. © 2013.

AB  - The acid hydrothermal conversion of a non-food dedicated feedstock - giant reed (Arundo donax L.) - to levulinic acid (LA) was investigated. LA is a versatile intermediate for the production of biofuels and bio-based chemicals. LA was subsequently hydrogenated to γ-valerolactone (GVL), a sustainable liquid and valuable fuel additive and a precursor for the new platform of "valeric biofuels" The straight production of GVL directly from water slurries of giant reed was studied by adopting bifunctional (acid and hydrogenating) catalytic systems based on Ru/C and niobium oxide or niobium phosphate. Mild reaction conditions (only 0.5. MPa of hydrogen and 70 °C) are possible for the hydrogenation step. GVL yields up to 16.6. wt.% calculated from the starting weight of dry biomass were reached, with an almost complete and selective conversion of the intermediate LA. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Heavy-metal-polluted biomass derived from phytoremediation or biosorption is widespread and difficult to be disposed of. In this work, simultaneous conversion of the waste woody biomass into bio-oil and recovery of Cu in a fast pyrolysis reactor were investigated. The results show that Cu can effectively catalyze the thermo-decomposition of biomass. Both the yield and high heating value (HHV) of the Cu-polluted fir sawdust biomass (Cu-FSD) derived bio-oil are significantly improved compared with those of the fir sawdust (FSD) derived bio-oil. The results of UV-vis and 1H NMR spectra of bio-oil indicate pyrolytic lignin is further decomposed into small-molecular aromatic compounds by the catalysis of Cu, which is in agreement with the GC-MS results that the fractions of C7-C10 compounds in the bio-oil significantly increase. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the migration and transformation of Cu in the fast pyrolysis process show that more than 91% of the total Cu in the Cu-FSD is enriched in the char in the form of zerovalent Cu with a face-centered cubic crystalline phase. This study gives insight into catalytic fast pyrolysis of heavy metals, and demonstrates the technical feasibility of an eco-friendly process for disposal of heavy-metal-polluted biomass. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The heteropolyacid H3PW12O40 has been used as a catalyst for the production of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), a viable liquid biofuel, from fructose, sucrose, and inulin. An EMF yield of 65% can be obtained from fructose within 30min at 130°C in ethanol under microwave heating. The introduction of tetrahydrofuran as a co-solvent improved the yield of EMF to 76%. Longer reaction time, higher reaction temperature and higher catalyst amount lead to the decomposition of EMF to ethyl levulinate. The fructose moieties in sucrose and inulin are converted to EMF selectively. However, glucose moieties cannot be converted to EMF by this heteropolyacid catalyst. Instead ethyl glucoside is formed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Glycerol as a low-cost by-product of the biodiesel industry can be considered a renewable building block for biorefineries. In this work, the conversion of raw glycerol to nine added-value products obtained by chemical (syn-gas, acrolein, and 1,2-propanediol) or bio-chemical (ethanol, 1,3-propanediol, d-lactic acid, succinic acid, propionic acid, and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate) routes were considered. The technological schemes for these synthesis routes were designed, simulated, and economically assessed using Aspen Plus and Aspen Icarus Process Evaluator, respectively. The techno-economic potential of a glycerol-based biorefinery system for the production of fuels, chemicals, and plastics was analyzed using the commercial Commercial Sale Price/. Production Cost ratio criteria, under different production scenarios. More income can be earned from 1,3-propanediol and 1,2-propanediol production, while less income would be obtained from hydrogen and succinic acid. This analysis may be useful mainly for biodiesel producers since several profitable alternatives are presented and discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A microscale membrane-less biofuel cell, capable of generating electrical energy from human lachrymal liquid, was developed by utilizing the ascorbate and oxygen naturally present in tears as fuel and oxidant. The biodevice is based on three-dimensional nanostructured gold electrodes covered with abiotic (conductive organic complex) and biological (redox enzyme) materials functioning as efficient anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. Three-dimensional nanostructured electrodes were fabricated by modifying 100 μm gold wires with 17 nm gold nanoparticles, which were further modified with tetrathiafulvalene- tetracyanoquinodimethane conducting complex to create the anode and with Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase to create the biocathode. When operated in human tears, the biodevice exhibited the following characteristics: an open circuit voltage of 0.54 V, a maximal power density of 3.1 μW cm-2 at 0.25 V and 0.72 μW cm-2 at 0.4 V, with a stable current density output of over 0.55 μA cm-2 at 0.4 V for 6 h of continuous operation. These findings support our proposition that an ascorbate/oxygen biofuel cell could be a suitable power source for glucose-sensing contact lenses to be used for continuous health monitoring by diabetes patients. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Improved synthetic approaches for preparing small-sized Ni nanoparticles (d=3 nm) supported on HBEA zeolite have been explored and compared with the traditional impregnation method. The formation of surface nickel silicate/aluminate involved in the two precipitation processes are inferred to lead to the stronger interaction between the metal and the support. The lower Brønsted acid concentrations of these two Ni/HBEA catalysts compared with the parent zeolite caused by the partial exchange of Brønsted acid sites by Ni2+ cations do not influence the hydrodeoxygenation rates, but alter the product selectivity. Higher initial rates and higher stability have been achieved with these optimized catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid and microalgae oil. Small metal particles facilitate high initial catalytic activity in the fresh sample and size uniformity ensures high catalyst stability. The small matter of size: Nearly 5-8-fold enhancements of initial rates and improved recyclability have been achieved with Ni/HBEA catalysts, prepared by improved synthesis techniques, on the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid and microalgae oil. The average size and uniformity of Ni particles are crucial for maintaining the highly active and stable catalyst. The small metal sites facilitate high initial rates and the good uniformity ensures high catalyst stability (see figure). Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of low lipid content microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa with heterogeneous catalysts was processed under sub- and supercritical conditions of ethanol (200-300°C, 2.8-9.0MPa, 30min). The HTL products were separated into bio-crude, gas, solid residue and volatile components, and then characterized. The highest mass and energy recovery ratios of bio-crude on the dry basis of alga were 71.3% and 101.8% respectively, obtained at 240°C, while the highest higher heating value of bio-crude was 36.19MJ/kg, obtained at 300°C. Temperature was found to be the most dominant parameter. H2 as a processing gas at an initial pressure of 1.03MPa slightly improved the bio-crude yield and quality. Raney-Ni and HZSM-5 type zeolite catalysts had no significant effect on the presented HTL process. The results indicated that HTL with ethanol as the solvent was able to produce 50-70wt.% of bio-crude directly from C. pyrenoidosa. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasingly tighter regulations regarding organic waste, and the demand for renewable chemicals and fuels, are pushing the manufacturing industry toward higher sustainability to improve cost-effectiveness and meet customers’ demand. Food waste valorization is one of the current research areas that has attracted a great deal of attention over the past few years as a potential alternative to the disposal of a wide range of residues in landfill sites. In particular, the development of environmentally sound and innovative strategies to process such waste is an area of increasing importance in our current society. Landfill, incineration and composting are common, mature technologies for waste disposal. However, they are not satisfactory to treating organic waste due to the generation of toxic methane gas and bad odor, high energy consumption and slow reaction kinetics. In fact, research efforts have also been oriented on novel technologies to decompose organic waste. However, no valuable product is generated from the decomposition process. Instead of disposing and decomposing food waste, recent research has focused on its utilization as energy source (e.g., for bioethanol and biodiesel production). Organic waste is also useful to generate useful organic chemicals via biorefinery or white biotechnology (e.g., succinic acid and/or bio-plastics). This article is aimed to summarize recent development of waste valorization strategies for the sustainable production of chemicals, materials, and fuels through the development of green production strategies. It will also provide key insights into recent legislation on management of waste worldwide as well as two relevant case studies (the transformation of corncob residues into functionalized biomass-derived carbonaceous solid acids and their utilization in the production of biodiesel-like biofuels from waste oils in Philippines, as well as the development of a bakery waste based biorefinery for succinic acid and bioplastic production in Hong Kong) to illustrate the enormous potential of biowaste valorization for a more sustainable society. Future research directions and possible sustainable approaches will also be discussed with their respective proofs of concept. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Recently, there has been a growing interest in the development of cost-effective technologies for the production of biofuels. A common approach to biofuel research is to invent or improve a biochemical or thermochemical conversion step. Subsequently, other conversion and separation steps are added to form a complete biorefinery flowsheet. Because this approach is structured around a specific conversion step, it may limit the possibilities of configuring optimal and innovative biorefineries. This article proposes a novel and systematic two-stage approach to the synthesis and optimization of biorefinery configurations, given available feedstocks and desired products. In the synthesis stage, a systems-based approach is developed to create a methodical way for synthesizing integrated biorefineries. This method is referred to as "forward-backward" approach. It involves forward synthesis of biomass to possible intermediates and reverse synthesis starting with the desired products and identifying necessary species and pathways leading to them. In the optimization stage, Bellman's principle of optimality is applied to decompose the optimization problem into subproblems in which an optimal policy of available technologies is determined for every conversion step. An optimization formulation is utilized to determine the optimal configuration based on screening and connecting the optimal policies and generating the biorefinery flowsheet. A case study of alcohol-producing pathways from lignocellulosic biomass is solved to demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - There is a lack of comprehensive information in the retrievable literature on pilot scale process and energy data using promising process technologies and commercially scalable and available capital equipment for lignocellulosic biomass biorefining. This study conducted a comprehensive review of the energy efficiency of selected sugar platform biorefinery process concepts for biofuel production from lignocelluloses. The process data from approximately a dozen studies that represent state-of-the-art in cellulosic biofuel production concepts, along with literature energy input data for agriculture operations, were analyzed to provide estimates of net energy production. It was found that proper allocation of energy input for fertilizer and pesticides to lignocellulosic biomass and major agriculture or forestry products, such as corn and lumber in corn farming and lumber plantations, respectively, were critical. The significant discrepancies in literature data suggest studies are needed to determine energy inputs for fuel in farming and farm machinery. Increasing solids loading in pretreatment to at least 25% is critical to reducing energy input in a biorefinery. Post thermo-chemical pretreatment size reduction approach should be adopted for energy efficient woody biomass processing. When appropriate pretreatment technologies are used, woody biomass can be processed as efficiently as herbaceous biomass and agricultural residues. Net energy output for cellulosic ethanol was estimated to range approximately from -500-2000 MJ/ton biomass (HHV base); indicating that the energy input/output ratio is approximately 1:1 for cellulosic ethanol. However, net energy can reach approximately 4000-7000 MJ/ton of biomass when energy from lignin is included.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an attractive method for converting wet biomass into petroleum-like biocrude oil that can be refined to make petroleum products. This approach is advantageous for conversion of low-lipid algae, which are promising feedstocks for sustainable large-scale biofuel production. As with natural petroleum formation, the water in contact with the produced oil contains toxic compounds. The objectives of this research were to: (1) identify nitrogenous organic compounds (NOCs) in wastewater from HTL conversion of Spirulina; (2) characterize mammalian cell cytotoxicity of specific NOCs, NOC mixture, and the complete HTL wastewater (HTL-WW) matrix; and (3) investigate mitigation measures to reduce toxicity in HTL-WW. Liquid-liquid extraction and nitrogen-phosphorus detection was used in conjunction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which detected hundreds of NOCs in HTL-WW. Reference materials for nine of the most prevalent NOCs were used to identify and quantify their concentrations in HTL-WW. Mammalian cell cytotoxicity of the nine NOCs was quantified using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell assay, and the descending rank order for cytotoxicity was 3-dimethylamino-phenol &gt; 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone &gt; 2,6-dimethyl-3-pyridinol &gt; 2-picoline &gt; pyridine &gt; 1-methyl-2- pyrrolidinone &gt; σ-valerolactam &gt; 2-pyrrolidinone &gt; ε-caprolactam. The organic mixture extracted from HTL-WW expressed potent CHO cell cytotoxic activity, with a LC50 at 7.5% of HTL-WW. Although the toxicity of HTL-WW was substantial, 30% of the toxicity was removed biologically by recycling HTL-WW back into algal cultivation. The remaining toxicity of HTL-WW was mostly eliminated by subsequent treatment with granular activated carbon. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This article evaluates the environmental performance of a biofuel production system based on the fast pyrolysis of short-rotation poplar biomass using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The system includes a circulating fluidized bed reactor followed by bio-oil upgrading through hydrotreating and hydrocracking to produce gasoline and diesel. The investigated system was selected on the basis of an overview of available technologies for the production and upgrading of fast pyrolysis bio-oil. Inventory data for the whole system were collected and used in order to carry out the life cycle impact assessment. Seven impact categories were evaluated: cumulative energy demand, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification and eutrophication. Feedstock pre-treatment, pyrolysis and steam reforming for the production of the hydrogen required for hydroprocessing were identified as the subsystems with the highest contributions to the potential impacts. Within these subsystems, natural gas production, electricity generation and direct emissions to air were the main contributors. Special attention should also be paid to the production of the lignocellulosic biomass feedstock, especially to the associated land occupation and fertilizer requirements. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, lipase produced from an isolated strain Burkholderia sp. C20 was immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles to catalyze biodiesel synthesis. Core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized by coating Fe 3O 4 core with silica shell. The nanoparticles treated with dimethyl octadecyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl] ammonium chloride were used as immobilization supporters. The Burkholderia lipase was then bound to the synthesized nanoparticles for immobilization. The protein binding efficiency on alkyl-functionalized Fe 3O 4-SiO 2 was estimated as 97%, while the efficiency was only 76% on non-modified Fe 3O 4-SiO 2. Maximum adsorption capacity of lipase on alkyl-functionalized Fe 3O 4-SiO 2 was estimated as 29.45mgg -1 based on Langmuir isotherm. The hydrolytic kinetics (using olive oil as substrate) of the lipase immobilized on alkyl-grafted Fe 3O 4-SiO 2 followed Michaelis-Menten model with a maximum reaction rate and a Michaelis constant of 6251Ug -1 and 3.65mM, respectively. Physical and chemical properties of the nanoparticles and the immobilized lipase were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Moreover, the immobilized lipase was used to catalyze the transesterification of olive oil with methanol to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), attaining a FAMEs conversion of over 90% within 30h in batch operation when 11wt% immobilized lipase was employed. The immobilized lipase could be used for ten cycles without significant loss in its transesterification activity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A previous Iowa State University (ISU) analysis published in 2010 investigated the technical and economic feasibility of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing of biomass, and concluded that the pathway could produce cellulosic biofuels for a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $2.11/gal. The 2010 ISU study was largely theoretical in that no commercial-scale fast pyrolysis facilities were being constructed at the time of publication. The present analysis expands upon the 2010 ISU study by performing an updated techno-economic analysis of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway. Recent advances in pathway technology and commercialization and new parameters suggested by the recent literature are accounted for. The MFSP for a 2000 MTPD facility employing fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing to convert corn stover to gasoline and diesel fuel is calculated to quantify the economic feasibility of the pathway. The present analysis determines the MFSP of gasoline and diesel fuel produced via fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing to be $2.57/gal. This result indicates that the pathway could be competitive with petroleum, although not as competitive as suggested by the 2010 ISU study. The present analysis also demonstrates the sensitivity of the result to process assumptions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the alternative fuels which is renewable and environmentally friendly and can be used in diesel engines with little or no modifications. In the present study, experimental investigations were carried out on the effects of biodiesel types, biodiesel fraction and physical properties on the combustion and performance characteristics of a (compression ignition) CI engine. The experimental work was conducted on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, (direct injection) DI and turbo-charged diesel engine by using biodiesel of waste oil, rapeseed oil and corn oil and normal diesel. Based on the measured parameters, detailed analyses were carried out on cylinder pressure, heat release rate and (brake specific fuel consumption) BSFC. It has been seen that the biodiesel types do not result in any significant differences in peak cylinder pressure and BSFC. The results also clearly indicate that the engine running with biodiesel have slightly higher in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate than the engine running with normal diesel. The BSFC for the engine running with neat biodiesel was higher than the engine running with normal diesel by up to 15%. It is also noticed that the physical properties of the biodiesel affect significantly the performance of the engine. © 2013.

AB  - According to directives 2003/30/EC and 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, Member States should promote the use of biofuel. Consequently, since 2011 all fuels on the market used for transport purpose must contain a fraction of 5.75% renewable energy sources. Ethanol in gasoline is a promising solution to reach this objective. In addition to decrease the dependence on fossil fuel, ethanol contributes to reducing air pollutant emissions during combustion (carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbons), and has a positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions. These considerations rely on numerous emission studies performed in standard conditions (20-30 °C), however, very few emission data are available for cold ambient temperatures, as they prevail in winter times in e.g., Northern Europe. This paper presents a chassis dynamometer study examining the effect of ethanol (E75-E85) versus gasoline (E5) at standard and low ambient temperatures (22 °C and -7 °C, respectively). Emissions of modern passenger cars complying with the latest European standards (Euro4 and Euro5a) were recorded over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Common Artemis Driving Cycle (CADC). Unregulated compounds such as methane, ammonia, and small chain hydrocarbons were monitored by an online Fourier Transformed Infra-Red spectrometer. In addition, a number of ozone precursors (carbonyls and volatile organic hydrocarbons) were collected and analyzed offline by liquid and gas chromatography in order to evaluate the ozone formation potential (OFP) of the exhaust. Results showed higher unregulated emissions at -7 °C than at 22 °C, regardless of the ethanol content in the fuel blend. More carbonyls were associated with oxygenated fuel, and acetaldehyde emissions were found particularly enhanced at -7 °C with E75. In addition, elevated methane emission was measured at low ambient temperature when ethanol fuel was used. Moreover, the OFP of the exhaust gas at -7 °C increased with the amount of ethanol in gasoline when the cold start excess emissions were included. However, regardless of the ambient temperature, the ammonia and toluene emissions associated to E75-E85 were lower than with E5. © 2012.

AB  - The superstructure optimization of algae-based hydrocarbon biorefinery with sequestration of CO2 from power plant flue gas is proposed. The major processing steps include carbon capture, algae growth, dewatering, lipid extraction and power generation, and algal biorefinery. We propose a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that simultaneously maximizes the net present value (NPV) and minimizes the global warming potential (GWP) subject to technology selection constraints, mass balance constraints, energy balance constraints, technoeconomic analysis constraints, and environmental impact constraints. The model simultaneously determines the optimal decisions that include production capacity, size of each processing unit, mass flow rates at each stage of the process, utility consumption, economic, and environmental performances. We propose a two-stage heuristic solution algorithm to solve the nonconvex MINLP model. Finally, the bicriteria optimization problem is solved with ε-constraint method, and the resulting Pareto-optimal curve reveals the trade-off between the economic and environmental criteria. The results show that for maximum NPV, the optimal process design uses direct flue gas, a tubular photobioreactor for algae growth, a filtration dewatering unit, and a hydroprocessing pathway leading to 47.1 MM gallons of green diesel production per year at $6.33/gal corresponding to GWP of 108.7 kg CO2-eq per gallon. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The one-pot conversion of lignocellulosic and algal biomass into a liquid fuel, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), has been achieved by using a multicomponent catalytic system comprising [DMA]+[CH3SO3] - (DMA=N,N-dimethylacetamide), Ru/C, and formic acid. The synthesis of DMF from all substrates was carried out under mild reaction conditions. The reaction progressed via 5-hydroxyemthylfurfural (HMF) in the first step followed by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of HMF with the Ru/C catalyst and formic acid as a hydrogen source. This report discloses the effectiveness of the Ru/C catalyst for the first time for DMF synthesis from inexpensive and readily abundant biomass sources, which gives a maximum yield of 32 % DMF in 1 h. A reaction route involving 5-(formyloxymethyl)furfural (FMF) as an intermediate has been elucidated based on the 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data. Another promising biofuel, 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), was also synthesized with high selectivity from polymeric carbohydrate-rich biomass substrates by using a Brønsted acidic ionic liquid catalyst, that is [DMA]+[CH3SO3]-, by etherification of HMF in ethanol.

AB  - Oil palm shell biomass contains a high amount of lignin and thus has the potential to be converted into value-added products. If this biomass is not utilised efficiently, significant loss of valuable chemical products may occur, which otherwise can be recovered. In this paper, a new technique using an overhead stirrer to pyrolyse biomass under microwave (MW) irradiation was investigated. The ratio of biomass to activated carbon was varied to investigate its effect on the temperature profile, product yield and phenol content of the bio-oil. Interestingly, the microwave pyrolysis temperature could be controlled by varying the biomass to carbon ratio. The highest bio-oil yield and phenol content in bio-oil were obtained at a biomass to carbon ratio of 1:0.5. Chemical analyses of bio-oil were performed using FT-IR, GC-MS and 1H NMR techniques. These results indicate that bio-oil consists mainly of aliphatic and aromatic compounds with high amounts of phenol in the bio-oil. Thus, MW pyrolysis with a stirrer successfully produced high-phenol bio-oil compared to other methods. This significant increase in bio-oil quality could either partially or wholly replace petroleum-derived phenol in many phenol-based applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An original pyrolysis pilot plant provided with a conical spouted bed reactor has been designed and built for treating 25 kg/h of biomass. The scale-up of the process has been based on the previous knowledge acquired in both hydrodynamics and pyrolysis studies carried out at laboratory scale, as well as on the research conducted on 1:1 scale reactor made of methacrylate and operating at ambient conditions. The main components of the pyrolysis pilot plant are described and their performance is tested and assessed. Furthermore, preliminary results obtained by pyrolysing pinewood sawdust are presented. The pyrolysis plant operates in continuous mode for long periods without major operation problems. The excellent features of the spouted bed reactor (high heat transfer rates, short residence times, continuous char removal, etc.) allow obtaining high bio-oil yields. Thus, the maximum bio-oil yield is obtained at 480 C, reaching a value of 65.8%, with the yields of gas and char being 18.8% and 15.4%, respectively. The bio-oil obtained has suitable features for its subsequent valorization. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study a techno-economic analysis of the production of bioethanol from four lignocellusic (Sugarcane bagasse, Coffee cut-stems, Rice Husk, and Empty Fruit Bunches) residues is presented for the Colombian case. The ethanol production was evaluated using Aspen Plus and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer carrying out the simulation and the economic evaluation, respectively. Simulations included the composition of lignocellulosic residues, which was determined experimentally. It was found that empty fruit bunches presents the highest ethanol yield from a dry basis point of view (313.83. L/t), while rice husk produced less ethanol (250.56. L/t). The ethanol production cost was assessed for the standalone ethanol plant and the ethanol plant coupled with a cogeneration system. Moreover, ethanol production cost using EFB was the lowest with (0.49. US$/L) and without (0.58. US$/L) cogeneration scheme. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Preparation of activated carbon has been attempted using KOH as activating agent by microwave heating from biodiesel industry solid residue, oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFBAC). The significance of chemical impregnation ratio (IR), microwave power and activation time on the properties of activated carbon were investigated. The optimum condition has been identified at the IR of 1.0, microwave power of 600W and activation time of 7min. EFBAC was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption isotherm. The surface chemistry was examined by zeta potential measurement, determination of surface acidity/basicity, while the adsorptive property was quantified using methylene blue as dye model compound. The optimum conditions resulted in activated carbon with a monolayer adsorption capacity of 395.30mg/g and carbon yield of 73.78%, while the BET surface area and total pore volume were corresponding to 1372m 2/g and 0.76cm 3/g, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Deactivation mechanisms of copper chromite (CuCr2O 4ṡCuO) catalyst for vapor-phase selective hydrogenation for furfuryl alcohol have been investigated using ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). At 200 °C, the catalyst steadily deactivated. One of the dominant origins of catalyst deactivation is poisoning due to strong adsorption of polymeric species formed from the reactant and/or products. Metallic Cu is identified as the active site, while loss of active Cu(I) sites due to hydrogenation is not a deactivation cause, as opposed to previous literature reported. The copper chromite catalyst showed low activity at 300 °C process temperature. Under this condition, the Cu particle size does not change, but Cr/Cu ratio increases by 50%, suggesting that Cr coverage of Cu sites becomes an additional cause of catalyst deactivation at this temperature, along with the poisoning deactivation mechanism at 200 °C. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The major obstacle to biodiesel commercialization is the high cost of biodiesel. Biodiesel made from waste cooking oil is an economical source that can effectively reduce raw material cost. Although using a microwave heating system to improve the yields of waste-cooking-oil biodiesel has received little attention in the literature, experimental results indicate that it outperforms conventional heating, with the best performances found with 0.75wt% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 0.75wt% sodium methoxide (CH3ONa) catalysts, respectively. The biodiesel yields produced with CH3ONa catalyst are higher than those produced with NaOH catalyst. An increase in the reaction time from 1 to 3min significantly increases the yield, which decreases with a further increase to 6min. A methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6 is suitable for the synthesis of biodiesel. The biodiesel yields increase with increasing reaction power. However, the microwave output must not be too high as it may damage the organic molecules. The optimal reaction conditions are 0.75wt% CH3ONa catalyst, a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6, a reaction time of 3min, and a microwave power of 750W. © 2011.

AB  - The waste Capiz shell was utilized as raw material for catalyst production for biodiesel preparation. During calcination process, the calcium carbonate content in the waste capiz shell was converted to CaO. This calcium oxide was used as catalyst for transesterification reaction between palm oil and methanol to produce biodiesel. The biodiesel preparation was conducted under the following conditions: the mole ration between methanol and palm oil was 8:1, stirring speed was 700 rpm, and reaction temperature was 60 °C for 4, 5, and 6 h reaction time. The amount of catalyst was varied at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt %. The maximum yield of biodiesel was 93 ± 2.2%, obtained at 6 h of reaction time and 3 wt % of amount of catalyst. In order to examine the reusability of catalyst developed from waste of capiz (Amusium cristatum) shell, three transesterification reaction cycles were also performed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass, microalgae and sewage sludge have distinct compositions and structures to each other. To understand the effect of feedstock differences on biomass liquefaction process, the liquefaction characteristics of rice straw (lignocellulosic biomass), Spirulina (microalgae) and sewage sludge were comparatively studied. Liquefaction experiments were performed in a 500mL autoclave at identical conditions (623K, 9.4-10.1MPa and 20min retention time). Although the content of organic materials in sewage sludge was the lowest among above three biomasses, the yield of bio-oil from sewage sludge reached up to 39.5±1.16%, higher than those from rice straw (21.1±0.93%) and Spirulina (34.5±1.31%). Besides, the bio-oils from sewage sludge had the highest heating value (36.14MJ/kg). However, Spirulina showed the highest conversion (79.7±1.02%). GC-MS analysis results indicated that the major compounds in the bio-oil from rice straw were phenolic compounds. In case of sewage sludge and Spirulina, esters were the main compositions. The volatility distribution of hydrocarbons was evaluated by C-NPgram (Carbon-Normal Paraffin gram). It was showed that the majority of hydrocarbons from sewage sludge and Spirulina were distributed at C17 and C20, whereas they were distributed at C8 in rice straw-derived bio-oil. The types of feedstocks have a significant effect on biomass liquefaction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Around the world, significant able steps are being taken to move from today's fossil-based economy to a more sustainable economy based on biomass. A key factor in the realization of a successful bio-based economy will be the development of biorefinery systems allowing highly efficient and cost-effective processing of biological feedstocks to a range of bio-based products, and successful integration into existing infrastructure. The recent climb in oil prices and consumer demand for environmentally friendly products has now opened new windows of opportunity for bio-based chemicals and polymers. Industry is increasingly viewing chemical and polymer production from renewable resources as an attractive area for investment. Within the bio-based economy and the operation of a biorefinery, there are significant opportunities for the development of bio-based building blocks (chemicals and polymers) and materials (fiber products, starch derivatives, etc.). In many cases this happens in conjunction with the production of bioenergy or biofuels. The production of bio-based products could generate US$10-15 billion ofrevenue for the global chemical industry. The economic production of biofuels is often a challenge. The co--production of chemicals, materials food and feed can generate the necessary added value. This paper highlights all bio-based chemicals with immediate potential as biorefinery 'value added products'. The selected products are either demonstrating strong market growth or have significant industry investment in development and demonstration programs.

AB  - This contribution was presented as the closing lecture at the Faraday Discussion 155 on artificial photosynthesis, held in Edinburgh Scotland, September 5-7 2011. The world needs new, environmentally friendly and renewable fuels to exchange for fossil fuels. The fuel must be made from cheap and "endless" resources that are available everywhere. The new research area of solar fuels aims to meet this demand. This paper discusses why we need a solar fuel and why electricity is not enough; it proposes solar energy as the major renewable energy source to feed from. The scientific field concerning artificial photosynthesis expands rapidly and most of the different scientific visions for solar fuels are briefly overviewed. Research strategies and the development of artificial photosynthesis research to produce solar fuels are overviewed. Some conceptual aspects of research for artificial photosynthesis are discussed in closer detail. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The cost-effectiveness of a lignocellulose biorefinery may be improved by developing applications for lignin with a higher value than application as fuel. We have developed a pyrolysis based lignin biorefinery approach, called LIBRA, to transform lignin into phenolic bio-oil and biochar using bubbling fluidized bed reactor technology. The bio-oil is a potential source for value-added products that can replace petrochemical phenol in wood-adhesives, resins and polymer applications. The biochar can e.g. be used as a fuel, as soil-improver as solid bitumen additive and as a precursor for activated carbon. In this paper we applied the pyrolysis-based LIBRA concept for the valorisation of wheat straw-derived organosolv lignin. First, we produced lignin with a high purity from two wheat straw varieties, using an organosolv fractionation approach. Subsequently, we converted these lignins into bio-oil and biochar by pyrolysis. For comparison purposes, we also tested two reference lignins, one from soda-pulping of a mixture of wheat straw and Sarkanda grass (Granit) and one from Alcell organosolv fractionation of hardwoods. Results indicate that ∼80 wt% of the dry lignin can be converted into bio-oil (with a yield of 40-60%) and biochar (30-40%). The bio-oil contains 25-40 wt% (based on the dry lignin weight) of a phenolic fraction constituting of monomeric (7-11%) and oligomeric (14-24%) components. The monomeric phenols consist of guaiacols, syringols, alkyl phenols, and catechols. 4-vinylguaiacol is the major phenolic monomer that is formed during the pyrolysis of the straw lignins in yields from 0.5-1 wt%. For the hardwood-lignin Alcell, the predominant phenol is 4-methylsyringol (1.2 wt%). The ratio guaiacols/syringols seems to be an indicative marker for the source of the lignin. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Taming the beast: Unprecedented selectivity of over 94 % at good (20 %+) conversion was observed for the upgrade of ethanol to the advanced biofuel 1-butanol with a ruthenium diphosphine catalyst (see picture; P orange, Ru blue). Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that control over the notoriously uncontrolled acetaldehyde aldol condensation is critical for the high selectivity, and evidence was found for an on-metal condensation step.

AB  - Lignin samples isolated from Miscanthus giganteus using organosolv processes were treated with vanadium catalysts that were previously developed in our group. We demonstrate that the catalyst with high β-O-4′ bond-cleaving activity in dimeric lignin models was also effective in depolymerizing actual lignin. Molecular weight-lowering was evidenced by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), whereas 2D NMR experiments showed that β-O-4′ linkages were selectively cleaved in the degradation process, just as in the case of lignin models. Monophenolic degradation products were also formed, and the individual molecules were identified and quantified by GC/MS. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The sequential co-production of bioethanol and biodiesel from spent coffee grounds was investigated. The direct conversion of bioethanol from spent coffee grounds was not found to be a desirable option because of the relatively slow enzymatic saccharification behavior in the presence of triglycerides and the free fatty acids (FFAs) found to exist in the raw materials. Similarly, the direct transformation of the spent coffee grounds into ethanol without first extracting lipids was not found to be a feasible alternative. However, the crude lipids extracted from the spent coffee grounds were themselves converted into fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) via the non-catalytic biodiesel transesterification reaction. The yields of bioethanol and biodiesel were 0.46gg-1 and 97.5±0.5%, which were calculated based on consumed sugar and lipids extracted from spent coffee grounds respectively. Thus, this study clearly validated our theory that spent coffee grounds could be a strong candidate for the production of bioethanol and biodiesel. © 2013.

AB  - In this comparative study, direct conversion of algal biomass into biodiesel using supercritical methanol (SCM) and microwave-assisted (MW) transesterification methods was investigated. Wet algal biomass was used as feedstock in the supercritical methanol process and dry algal biomass for the microwave-assisted transesterification. Experimental runs were designed using a response surface methodology and the process parameters such as wet/dry algae to methanol ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst concentrations were optimized for both processes. The microwave-assisted approach improves extractions of algae significantly, with a higher efficiency, reduced extractive-transesterification time and increased yield. While the non-catalytic supercritical methanol method produces highly purified extracts (free of harmful solvents and catalyst residues), and reduces energy consumption in separation and purification steps. The algal biodiesel samples from SCM and MW processes were compared using FT-IR and TGA analysis methods to identify the functional group attributions and thermal stability of the biofuel samples, respectively. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of algal biomass and lipid extracted algae (LEA) and energy requirements for the two processes are also presented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The capacity of metal-dependent fungal and bacterial polysaccharide oxygenases, termed GH61 and CBM33, respectively, to potentiate the enzymatic degradation of cellulose opens new possibilities for the conversion of recalcitrant biomass to biofuels. GH61s have already been shown to be unique metalloenzymes containing an active site with a mononuclear copper ion coordinated by two histidines, one of which is an unusual τ-N-methylated N-terminal histidine. We now report the structural and spectroscopic characterization of the corresponding copper CBM33 enzymes. CBM33 binds copper with high affinity at a mononuclear site, significantly stabilizing the enzyme. X-band EPR spectroscopy of Cu(II)-CBM33 shows a mononuclear type 2 copper site with the copper ion in a distorted axial coordination sphere, into which azide will coordinate as evidenced by the concomitant formation of a new absorption band in the UV/vis spectrum at 390 nm. The enzyme's three-dimensional structure contains copper, which has been photoreduced to Cu(I) by the incident X-rays, confirmed by X-ray absorption/fluorescence studies of both aqueous solution and intact crystals of Cu-CBM33. The single copper(I) ion is ligated in a T-shaped configuration by three nitrogen atoms from two histidine side chains and the amino terminus, similar to the endogenous copper coordination geometry found in fungal GH61. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pyrolysis experiments of blue-green algae blooms (BGAB) were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor to determine the effects of pyrolysis temperature, particle size and sweep gas flow rate on pyrolysis product yields and bio-oil properties. The pyrolysis temperature, particle size and sweep gas flow rate were varied in the ranges of 300-700 °C, below 0.25-2.5 mm and 50-400 mL min-1, respectively. The maximum oil yield of 54.97% was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, particle size below 0.25 mm and sweep gas flow rate of 100 mL min-1. The elemental analysis and calorific value of the oil were determined, and the chemical composition of the oil was investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) technique. The analysis of bio-oil composition showed that bio-oil from BGAB could be a potential source of renewable fuel with a heating value of 31.9 MJ kg-1. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have already been investigated as a potential resource for biofuel in many reports. In this study, the effect of phosphorus concentration on lipid content was analyzed using the freshwater microalga Chlorella sp as a model. In addition, the carbohydrate and protein content were also analyzed in order to investigate the variations of biochemical composition under different phosphorus levels. Results showed that both lipid content and lipid productivity were increased under low phosphorus conditions. Furthermore, it was also found that lipid accumulation in cells decreased by supplementing the growth media with K2HPO4 in the late growth phase. The analysis of the total protein and the carbohydrate content showed that the former remained unaffected by external phosphorus variation; while the latter was directly correlated to phosphorus concentration. In summary, lipid accumulation had significant relationship with phosphorus concentration. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Traditionally, biodiesel has been produced from edible oils due to their low free fatty acids. However, their use has elevated some issues such as food versus fuel and many other problems that have negatively affected their economic viability. Therefore, exploration of non-edible oils may significantly reduce the cost of biodiesel especially in poor countries which can barely afford the high cost of edible oils. This paper aims to produce biodiesel from several edible and non-edible oils that are readily available in the South East Asian market. These oils include; Jatropha curcas, Calophyllum inophyllum, Sterculia foetida, Moringa oleifera, Croton megalocarpus, Patchouli, Elaeis guineensis (palm), Cocos nucifera (coconut), Brassica napus (canola) and Glycine Max (soybean) oils. This was followed by an investigation of physico-chemical properties of the produced biodiesel. This paper also discusses the concept of biodiesel blending to improve some of the properties of these feedstocks. For instance, blending of SFME and CoME improves the viscosity of SFME from 6.3717mm2/s to 5.3349mm2/s (3:1), 4.4912mm2/s (1:1) and 3.879mm2/s (1:3). The properties of other biodiesel blends were estimated using the polynomial curve fitting method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The residues from the palm oil industry are the main contributors to biomass waste in Malaysia, and these wastes require extra attention with respect to handling. The biomass waste is a renewable resource that can potentially be used to produce absorbents, fuels, and chemical feedstocks through the pyrolysis process. In this study, the wastes of palm shell, empty fruit bunches, and mesocarp fiber were characterized and then pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed reactor under the following conditions: a temperature of 500 °C, a nitrogen flow rate of 2 L/min and reaction time of 60 min. After pyrolysis, characterization of the products with an emphasis on the bio-oil and the bio-char was performed using various approaches (including Karl Fischer water-content tests, FTIR, SEM, TGA and CNH/O analyses). The results showed that the pyrolysis of palm oil wastes yielded more bio-oil than bio-char or non-condensable gases. The results also indicated that all of the bio-oils were acidic and contained high levels of oxygen. The bio-oils heating values were low and varied from 10. 49 MJ/kg to 14. 78 MJ/kg. The heating values of the bio-chars (20-30 MJ/kg) were higher than those of the bio-oils. Among the biomasses studied in this work, palm shell contained the highest level of lignin and showed the highest levels of bio-char yield and fixed and elemental carbon in the raw and bio-char form. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This paper addresses the optimal design and operation of hydrocarbon biorefinery via fast pyrolysis, hydrotreating and hydrocracking of hybrid poplar feedstock under economic and environmental criteria. The hydrocarbon biorefinery encompasses fast pyrolysis for crude bio-oil production, upgrading of the bio-oil through hydrotreating, separation and hydrocracking of long chained hydrocarbons into gasoline and diesel range products, and steam reforming for hydrogen production. We propose a bi-criteria nonlinear programming (NLP) model that seeks to maximize the economic performance measured by the net present value (NPV) and to minimize the environmental impacts. The environmental objective is measured with the global warming potential (GWP) metric according to the life cycle assessment procedures, which covers gate-to-gate environmental impacts of the hydrocarbon biorefinery. The multiobjective NLP model simultaneously determines the production capacity, size of each process units, operational conditions, the flow rates of species and streams at each stage of the process, hydrocarbon biofuel yields, and consumption rate of feedstock, steam, electricity, and natural gas. The bi-criteria NLP model is solved with the e{open}-constraint method, and the resulting Pareto-optimal curve reveals the trade-off between the economic and environmental dimensions of the sustainable hydrocarbon biorefinery. The optimization results reveal that the unit production cost of the hydrocarbon biofuels is $2.31 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) for the maximum NPV solution and $3.67/GGE for the minimum GWP design. The corresponding greenhouse emission is 8.07kgCO2-eq/GGE. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic bio-oil upgrading to produce renewable fuels has attracted increasing attention in response to the decreasing oil reserves and the increased fuel demand worldwide. Herein, the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol with carbon-supported non-sulfided metal catalysts was investigated. Catalytic tests were performed at 4.0MPa and temperatures ranging from 623 to 673K. Both Ru/C and Mo/C catalysts showed promising catalytic performance in HDO. The selectivity to benzene was 69.5 and 83.5% at 653K over Ru/C and 10Mo/C catalysts, respectively. Phenol, with a selectivity as high as 76.5%, was observed mainly on 1Mo/C. However, the reaction pathway over both catalysts is different. Over the Ru/C catalyst, the O-CH3 bond was cleaved to form the primary intermediate catechol, whereas only traces of catechol were detected over Mo/C catalysts. In addition, two types of active sites were detected over Mo samples after reduction in H2 at 973K. Catalytic studies showed that the demethoxylation of guaiacol is performed over residual MoOx sites with high selectivity to phenol whereas the consecutive HDO of phenol is performed over molybdenum carbide species, which is widely available only on the 10Mo/C sample. Different deactivation patterns were also observed over Ru/C and Mo/C catalysts. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Biofuels are the most immediate, practical solution for mitigating dependence on fossil hydrocarbons, but current biofuels (alcohols and biodiesels) require significant downstream processing and are not fully compatible with modern, mass-market internal combustion engines. Rather, the ideal biofuels are structurally and chemically identical to the fossil fuels they seek to replace (i.e., aliphatic n- and iso-alkanes and -alkenes of various chain lengths). Here we report on production of such petroleum-replica hydrocarbons in Escherichia coli. The activity of the fatty acid (FA) reductase complex from Photorhabdus luminescens was coupled with aldehyde decarbonylase from Nostoc punctiforme to use free FAs as substrates for alkane biosynthesis. This combination of genes enabled rational alterations to hydrocarbon chain length (Cn) and the production of branched alkanes through upstream genetic and exogenous manipulations of the FA pool. Genetic components for targeted manipulation of the FA pool included expression of a thioesterase from Cinnamomum camphora (camphor) to alter alkane Cn and expression of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex and β-keto acyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III from Bacillus subtilis to synthesize branched (iso-) alkanes. Rather than simply reconstituting existing metabolic routes to alkane production found in nature, these results demonstrate the ability to design and implement artificial molecular pathways for the production of renewable, industrially relevant fuel molecules.

AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 emission makes significant contribution to global climate change and CO2 capture and storage is a currently a preferred technology to change the trajectory toward irreversible global warming. In this work, we reported a new strategy that the inexhaustible MgCl2 in seawater and the abundantly available biomass waste can be utilized to prepare mesoporous carbon stabilized MgO nanoparticles (mPC-MgO) for CO2 capture. The mPC-MgO showed excellent performance in the CO 2 capture process with the maximum capacity of 5.45 mol kg -1, much higher than many other MgO based CO2 trappers. The CO2 capture capacity of the mPC-MgO material kept almost unchanged in 19-run cyclic reuse, and can be regenerated at low temperature. The mechanism for the CO2 capture by the mPC-MgO was investigated by FTIR and XPS, and the results indicated that the high CO2 capture capacity and the favorable selectivity of the as-prepared materials were mainly attributed to their special structure (i.e., surface area, functional groups, and the MgO NPs). This work would open up a new pathway to slow down global warming as well as resolve the pollution of waste biomass. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass-derived platform intermediate furfural and levulinic acid were efficiently hydrogenated to the value-added furfuryl alcohol and promising biofuel γ-valerolactone, respectively, using a noble-metal-free Cu-Cr catalyst, which was facilely and successfully synthesized by a modified co-precipitation method using the cheap metal nitrates. In the first hydrogenation of furfural, 95% yield of furfuryl alcohol was highly selectively produced at 99% conversion of furfural under the mild conditions. For the hydrogenation of levulinic acid, 90% yield of γ-valerolactone was highly selectively produced at 97.8% conversion. Besides, the physical properties of the resulting Cu-Cr catalysts were studied by XRD (X-ray diffraction), EDX (Energy-dispersive X-ray), TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) to reveal their influence on the catalytic performance. Subsequently, different reaction parameters were studied and it was found that Cu2+/Cr3+ ratios (0.5, 1 and 2), reaction temperature (120-220°C) and hydrogen pressure (35-70bar) presented important influence on the catalytic activities. In the end, the stability of the Cu-Cr catalysts was also studied. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A methane-producing microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is a technology to convert CO 2 into methane, using electricity as an energy source and microorganisms as the catalyst. A methane-producing MEC provides the possibility to increase the fuel yield per hectare of land area, when the CO 2 produced in biofuel production processes is converted to additional fuel methane. Besides increasing fuel yield per hectare of land area, this also results in more efficient use of land area, water, and nutrients. In this research, the performance of a methane-producing MEC was studied for 188days in a flat-plate MEC design. Methane production rate and energy efficiency of the methane-producing MEC were investigated with time to elucidate the main bottlenecks limiting system performance. When using water as the electron donor at the anode during continuous operation, methane production rate was 0.006m 3/m 3 per day at a cathode potential of -0.55V vs. normal hydrogen electrode with a coulombic efficiency of 23.1%. External electrical energy input was 73.5kWh/m 3 methane, resulting in a voltage efficiency of 13.4%. Consequently, overall energy efficiency was 3.1%. The maximum achieved energy efficiency was obtained in a yield test and was 51.3%. Analysis of internal resistance showed that in the short term, cathode and anode losses were dominant, but with time, also pH gradient and transport losses became more important. The results obtained in this study are used to discuss the possible contribution of methane-producing MECs to increase the fuel yield per hectare of land area. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel production from oleaginous microalgae shows great potential as a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Currently, most research focus on algal biomass production with autotrophic cultivation, but this cultivation strategy induces low biomass concentration and it is difficult to be used in large-scale algal biomass production. By contrast, heterotrophic algae allows higher growth rate and can accumulate higher lipid. However, the fast-growing and lipid-rich microalgae that can be cultivated in heterotrophic system for the industrial application of biodiesel production are still few. Traditional solvent extraction and gravimetric determination to detect the microalgal total lipid content is time-consuming and laborious, which has become a major limiting factor for selecting large number of algae specimens. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and efficient procedure for the screening of lipid-rich microalgae. Results: A novel green microalga Scenedesmus sp. strain R-16 with high total lipid content was selected using the Nile red staining from eighty-eight isolates. Various carbon sources (fructose, glucose and acetate) and nitrogen sources (nitrate, urea, peptone and yeast extract) can be utilized for microalgal growth and lipid production, and the optimal carbon and nitrogen sources were glucose (10 g L§ssup§- 1§esup§) and nitrate (0.6 g L§ssup§-1§esup§), respectively. Compared to autotrophic situation, the strain R-16 can grow well heterotrophically without light and the accumulated total lipid content and biomass reached 43.4% and 3.46 g L§ssup§-1§esup§, respectively. In addition, nitrogen deficiency led to an accumulation of lipid and the total lipid content was as high as 52.6%, and it was worth noting that strain R-16 exhibited strong tolerance to high glucose (up to 100 g L§ssup§-1§esup§) and a wide range of pH (4.0-11.0). Conclusions: The newly developed ultrasonic-assisted Nile red method proved to be an efficient isolation procedure and was successfully used in the selection of oleaginous microalgae. The isolated novel green microalgal strain R-16 was rich in lipid and can live in varied and contrasting conditions. The algae appeared to have great potential for application in microalgae-based biodiesel production. © 2013 Ren et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the influence of various physical process parameters on the liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass (pine wood) in supercritical ethanol was investigated. The parameters include reaction temperature (280-400°C), initial nitrogen pressure (0.4-7.5MPa), reaction time (0-240min), and biomass-to-solvent ratio (0.06-0.25g/g). The reaction temperature and residence time were found to have a more significant effect on biomass conversion and product yield than pressure and biomass-to-solvent ratio had; conversion in the range 34.0-98.1% and biocrude yield in the range 15.8-59.9wt% were observed depending on the process parameters. Despite the absence of catalysts and external hydrogen source, solid biomass to liquid and gaseous products conversion of 98.1%, and a high biocrude yield of approximately 65.8wt% were achieved at 400°C, 120min, and a biomass-to-solvent ratio of 0.06g/g. Moreover, the biocrude contained considerably lower amounts of oxygen and higher amounts of carbon and hydrogen, resulting in a substantially higher heating value (>30MJ/kg) as compared to raw feedstock (20.4MJ/kg). A comparison with sub- or supercritical water-based liquefaction revealed that supercritical ethanol produced biocrude with a lower molecular weight and much better yield. Finally, a new biomass liquefaction reaction mechanism associated with supercritical ethanol is proposed. © 2013.

AB  - Understanding of the condensation reactions in bio-oil is the key for efficient conversion into transportation fuel or value-added chemicals. In this study, the roles of the typical compounds representing the sugars, sugar derivatives, and aromatics found in bio-oil were investigated for their contribution to condensation reactions. Glucose played a key role for the polymer formation due to its decomposition to reactive compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups or conjugated π bonds. The sugar derivatives, including furfural, hydroxyl aldehyde and hydroxyl acetone, were also found to be reactive toward polymerization. The carboxylic acids were shown to be the catalysts for polymerization and formic acid was much more efficient to catalyze polymerization than acetic acid. The phenolic compounds also promoted the acid-catalyzed reactions. Vanillin contains reactive a carbonyl group, leading to its high tendency toward polymerization. In methanol, various kinds of methanolysis reactions dominated, which significantly suppressed the decomposition of glucose and the polymerization of other compounds. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

AB  - Furfural, a cellulose model compound, was converted into gasoline-range fuels through catalytic fast pyrolysis. H-ZSM-5-based catalysts were employed in a continuous fixed bed system. The reaction temperature, reactant contact time, and catalytic promoter are keys to manipulate the product distribution. The first step in furfural conversion is the decarbonylation of furfural to form furan, followed by furan conversion to intermediates (e.g., cyclohexene and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde) in the ZSM-5 pores. These intermediates can then be transformed into aromatics, coke, light olefins, and carbon oxides. A reaction temperature of 500°C generated the highest yield of aromatics and the lowest amount of coke. A long contact time (∼1.5 s) also provided the highest aromatic selectivity. The promoter, zinc oxide, plays an important role in hydrogen atom transfer. This is attributed to the change of acid site concentration and Lewis acid sites created by anchored Zn ions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In contrast to a few years ago, when cellulosic ethanol via enzymatic hydrolysis was the only widely recognized technology for commercially producing cellulosic biofuels, a diversity of approaches are currently under commercial development. While no commercial-scale (≥20 million gallons per year) cellulosic biofuel facilities are operating at present, at least ten biorefinery projects employing six different pathways are expected to begin operations by 2014. These biorefineries will employ the following pathways: (i) catalytic pyrolysis and hydrotreating to hydrocarbons; (ii) gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to hydrocarbons; (iii) gasification and methanol-to-gasoline synthesis; (iv) dilute acid hydrolysis, fermentation to acetic acid, and chemical synthesis to ethanol; (v) enzymatic hydrolysis to ethanol; and (vi) consolidated bioprocessing (single-step enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation) to ethanol. This review provides an overview of the six pathway technologies, comprehensive descriptions of each of the ten biorefinery projects, and a discussion of the current direction of cellulosic biofuel commercialization efforts and its implications for the revised Renewable Fuel Standard. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel, produced by transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats with methanol, is a promising alternative diesel fuel due to the limited resources of fossil fuels and the environmental concerns. An environmentally benign process for the transesterification reaction using immobilized lipase has attracted considerable attention for biodiesel production. In the work, magnetic chitosan microspheres were prepared by the chemical co-precipitation approach using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking reagent for lipase immobilization. The immobilization of lipase onto the magnetic particles was confirmed by magnetic measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. Using the immobilized lipase, the conversion of soybean oil to fatty acid methyl esters reached 87% under the optimized conditions of methanol/oil amount-of-substance ratio 4:1 with the three-step addition of methanol, reaction temperature 35 °C, and reaction duration 30 h. Moreover, the immobilized lipase could be used for four times without significant decrease of the activity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increased global demand for biofuels has prompted the search for alternatives to edible oils for biodiesel production. Given the abundance and cost, waste and nonedible oils have been investigated as potential feedstocks. A recent research interest is the conversion of such feedstocks into biodiesel via enzymatic processes, which have considerable advantages over conventional alkali-catalyzed processes. To expand the viability of enzymatic biodiesel production, considerable effort has been directed toward process development in terms of biodiesel productivity, application to wide ranges of contents of water and fatty acids, adding value to glycerol byproducts, and bioreactor design. A cost evaluation suggested that, with the current enzyme prices, the cost of catalysts alone is not competitive against that of alkalis. However, it can also be expected that further process optimization will lead to a reduced cost in enzyme preparation as well as in downstream processes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of products from hydrothermal treatments of cellulose in an autoclave at various temperatures (200 °C-400 °C) and residence times (5 min-2 h). The gas products mainly consisted of CO2, CO, CH4, and H2 at 250 °C-400 °C for 30 min. Heavy oil mainly contained furans, phenols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, and high molecular compounds at all hydrothermal temperatures. Aldehydes, phenols, ketones, acid groups and sugars were determined in the aqueous phase by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The solid residues were analyzed by elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron microscopy, FTIR, and thermogravimetric analysis techniques. The results showed that the residues had core-shell structure and better physicochemical characterization at lower temperature (250 °C) and longer residence time (2 h). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Macroalgae, an abundant and carbon-neutral renewable resource, with several species rich in carbohydrates are suitable for bioethanol production. This study focused on the pretreatment, enzyme saccharification and fermentation of Sargassum spp., a brown macroalgae for bioethanol production. The optimal acid pretreatment condition achieved in terms of glucose and reducing sugar yields was 3.4-4.6% (w/v) H2SO4 concentration, 115°C and 1.50h. The pretreated biomass was hydrolyzed with cellulase enzyme system supplemented with β-glucosidase. After fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 40°C, pH of 4.5 for 48h, the ethanol conversion rate of the enzyme hydrolysate reached 89%, which was markedly higher than the theoretical yield of 51% based on glucose as substrate. Since all the glucose was consumed during fermentation, other sugar sources might be present in the hydrolysate. The macroalgae, Sargassum spp., showed significant potential as a renewable feedstock for the production of bioethanol. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel hydrodeoxygenation catalytic system, Ni 2P/SBA-15, has been synthesized by temperature-programmed reduction of a nickel phosphate precursor impregnated in the mesostructured silica support. The formation of this active phase was verified by X-ray diffraction, whereas the study by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the catalyst is mainly constituted of nickel phosphide particles of relatively uniform size dispersed within the SBA-15 channels. Both Ni 2P/SBA-15 and a reference Ni/SBA-15 catalyst were tested for the hydrodeoxygenation of methyl oleate (C 17H 33-COO-CH 3) in a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. This compound was used as a convenient surrogate of triglyceride molecules present in vegetable oils that following catalytic hydrotreating yields n-alkanes as the main products. In the whole range of pressure studied (3-40 bar) and for temperatures higher than 290 °C, both systems achieve more than 80% ester conversion at 20 h -1 WHSV, although the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst presents a slightly higher activity. Overall, higher pressure and lower temperature and space velocity favors the formation of C 18 hydrocarbon, which is the preferred product in terms of carbon atom economy. Nevertheless, under all the assayed conditions, the n-C 18/n-C 17 ratio was remarkably higher for Ni 2P/SBA-15 than for Ni/SBA-15 catalysts. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that both deoxygenation and decarboxylation occur simultaneously over the Ni 2P catalyst, whereas decarboxylation and cracking are the prevailing processes over the Ni catalyst. Owing to these high yields of long-chain paraffins, Ni 2P/SBA-15 can be considered as a very promising catalyst for the production of green diesel. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) is considered as a renewable platform chemical and can be used for the synthesis of variety of important fuels and chemicals. In particular, its esterification with ethanol produces ethyl levulinate (EL) would be green process, as it can be used as diesel miscible biofuel (DMB), preventing global warming by decreasing atmospheric CO2. This study explores the use of modified H-ZSM-5 by desilication viz.; DH-ZSM-5 and dodecatungstophosphoric acid (DTPA) loaded on DH-ZSM-5 for esterification of LA with ethanol aiming to EL. Different degree of desilication of H-ZSM-5 was performed by using aq. NaOH (0.2-1.5 M) at 338 K for 30 min and then DTPA was loaded on these desilicated H-ZSM-5 (DH-ZSM-5) support. H-ZSM-5, DH-ZSM-5 and DTPA on these DH-ZSM-5 samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, pyridine chemisorbed IR spectroscopy, Temperature Programmed Ammonia Desorption (TPAD). The increase in conversion of levulinic acid was observed from 28% to 94% with increase of DTPA loading from 0% to 15%. The increased LA conversion may be due to increase in total acidity from 43.14% to 84.31%. The use of DH-ZSM-5 as support for deposition of DTPA may be reported for the first time. The present work also extended to optimize process parameters such as DTPA loading on DH-ZSM-5, catalyst to LA ratio, LA to ethanol molar ratio, speed of agitation, particle size reaction temperature and catalyst reusability. Kinetic study based on pseudo-homogeneous (P-H) model is also presented. The experimental results follow second order kinetics. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Compared hydrodeoxygenation experimental studies of both model compounds and real bio-oil derived from biomass fast pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis was carried out over two different supported Pt catalysts. For the model compounds, the deoxygenation degree of dibenzofuran was higher than that of cresol and guaiacol over both Pt/Al 2O 3 and the newly developed Pt supported on mesoporous zeolite (Pt/MZ-5) catalyst, and the deoxygenation degree of cresol over Pt/MZ-5 was higher than that over Pt/Al 2O 3. The results indicated that hydrodeoxygenation become much easier upon oxygen reduction. Similar to model compounds study, the hydrodeoxygenation of the real bio-oil derived from catalytic pyrolysis was much easier than that from fast pyrolysis over both Pt catalysts, and the Pt/MZ-5 again shows much higher deoxygenation ability than Pt/Al 2O 3. Clearly synergy between catalytic pyrolysis and bio-oil hydro-processing was found in this paper and this finding will lead an advanced biofuel production pathway in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report an economically- and environmentally-promising microalgae biorefinery pathway, which uses catalytic pyrolysis with HZSM-5 catalyst to convert whole microalgae into aromatic hydrocarbons. This process produces valuable petrochemicals and ammonia, the latter of which can be recycled as a fertilizer for microalgae cultivation. We tested samples of lipid-lean green microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris, at various reaction temperatures and catalyst loads. We also tested samples of lignocellulosic biomass, red oak, for comparison. Our results demonstrated that catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae produces better aromatic yields and better aromatic distributions than catalytic pyrolysis of red oak. The maximum carbon yield of aromatics from microalgae was 24%, while that from red oak was 16.7%. Moreover, catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae produced more monocyclic aromatics than were produced by catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Microalgae present many advantages as a feedstock for biofuel. With the promise catalytic pyrolysis offers for solving some of microalgae's disadvantages, microalgae biorefineries move one step closer to economic and environmental feasibility. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - An indigenous microalga Chlorella vulgaris ESP-31 grown in an outdoor tubular photobioreactor with CO 2 aeration obtained a high oil content of up to 63.2%. The microalgal oil was then converted to biodiesel by enzymatic transesterification using an immobilized lipase originating from Burkholderia sp. C20. The conversion of the microalgae oil to biodiesel was conducted by transesterification of the extracted microalgal oil (M-I) and by transesterification directly using disrupted microalgal biomass (M-II). The results show that M-II achieved higher biodiesel conversion (97.3wt% oil) than M-I (72.1wt% oil). The immobilized lipase worked well when using wet microalgal biomass (up to 71% water content) as the oil substrate. The immobilized lipase also tolerated a high methanol to oil molar ratio (&gt;67.93) when using the M-II approach, and can be repeatedly used for six cycles (or 288h) without significant loss of its original activity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents bio-oil preparation by direct liquefaction of Dunaliella tertiolecta (D. tertiolecta) with sub/supercritical ethanol-water as the medium in a batch autoclave with high temperature and high pressure. The results indicated that ethanol and water showed synergistic effects on direct liquefaction of D. tertiolecta. The maximum bio-oil yield was 64.68%, with an optimal D. tertiolecta conversion of 98.24% in sub/supercritical ethanol-water. The detailed chemical compositional analysis of the bio-oil was performed using an EA, FT-IR, and GC-MS. The empirical formulas of the bio-oil obtained using the ethanol-water co-solvent (40%, v/v) and sole water as the reaction medium were CH1.52O0.14N0.06 and CH1.43O0.23N0.09, with calorific values of 34.96 and 29.80MJkg-1, respectively. XPS and SEM results showed that ethanol-water is a very effective reaction medium in the liquefaction. A plausible reaction mechanism of the main chemical component in D. tertiolecta is proposed based on our results and the literatures. © 2012.

AB  - Conversion of lignin into chemicals and biofuels was performed using the commercial Kraft lignin, Indulin AT. Lignin was depolymerised in an aqueous alkaline solution using a continuous flow reactor generating four fractions. First is the gas fraction (mainly CO2), the second includes methanol, acetic acid and formic acid, thus defined as small organic compounds and third one (up to 19.1wt.% of lignin) is mostly composed of aromatic monomers. The fourth fraction (45-70wt.%) contains oligomers (polyaromatic molecules) and modified lignin. Pyrocatechol was the most abundant product at high severities (315°C) with selectivity up to 25.8%. 31P NMR showed the loss of almost all aliphatic OH groups and apparition of catechol groups during depolymerisation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris was carried out under different microwave power levels, catalysts and contents of activated carbon and solid residue. The products, pyrolysis temperature and temperature rising rate were analyzed in order to obtain the optimal conditions. The results indicated that the higher the microwave power level was, the higher the maximum temperature rising rate and pyrolysis temperature were. The maximum bio-oil yield (35.83. wt.%) and gas yield (52.37%) were achieved under the microwave power of 1500. W and 2250. W, respectively. And 2250. W was the optimal power to obtain bio-fuel product. High microwave power level and catalyst can enhance the production of gas. Catalysts can promote the pyrolysis of C. vulgaris, and activated carbon was the best among the tested catalysts followed by the solid residue. The optimal content of activated carbon is 5% with the maximum bio-fuel yield of 87.47%. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report on the fabrication and characterisation of a gold-nanoparticle (AuNP)-based mediatorless sugar/oxygen biofuel cell (BFC) operating in neutral sugar-containing buffers and human physiological fluids, such as blood and plasma. First, Corynascus thermophilus cellobiose dehydrogenase (CtCDH) and Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase (MvBOx), used as anodic and cathodic bioelements, respectively, were immobilised on gold electrodes modified with 20nm AuNPs. Detailed characterisation and optimisation of a new CDH/AuNP-based bioanode were performed and the following fundamental parameters were obtained: (i) the redox potential of the haem-containing centre of the enzyme was measured to be 75mV vs. NHE, (ii) the surface coverage of CtCDH was found to be 0.65pmolcm -2 corresponding to a sub-monolayer coverage of the thiol-modified AuNPs by the enzyme, (iii) a turnover number for CtCDH immobilised on thiol-modified AuNPs was calculated to be ca. 0.5s -1, and (iv) the maximal current densities as high as 40μAcm -2 were registered in sugar-containing neutral buffers. Second, both biomodified electrodes, namely the CtCDH/AuNP-based bioanode and the MvBOx/AuNP-based biocathode, were combined into a functional BFC and the designed biodevices were carefully investigated. The following characteristics of the mediator-, separator- and membrane-less, miniature BFC were obtained: in phosphate buffer; an open-circuit voltage of 0.68V, a maximum power density of 15μWcm -2 at a cell voltage of 0.52V and in human blood; an open-circuit voltage of 0.65V, a maximum power density of 3μWcm -2 at a cell voltage of 0.45V, respectively. The estimated half-lives of the biodevices were found to be &gt;12, &lt;8, and &lt;2h in a sugar-containing buffer, human plasma, and blood, respectively. The basic characteristics of mediatorless sugar/oxygen BFCs were significantly improved compared with previously designed biodevices, because of the usage of three-dimensional AuNP-modified electrodes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper systematically compares the activity of Au/TiO2 photocatalysts (Au loadings 0–10 wt.%) for H2 production from ethanol–water mixtures under UV excitation. Degussa P25 TiO2 was used as the support phase. TEM analyses revealed that the average Au nanoparticle size at all loadings was 5 ± 2 nm, with the Au nanoparticles preferentially located at the interfacial sites between TiO2 crystallites. XRD, XRF, XPS, and UV–Vis measurements established that metallic Au was the only gold species on the surface of the photocatalysts. The Au/TiO2 photocatalysts showed an intense absorption maximum centred around 560–570 nm due to the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the supported gold nanoparticles. Photoluminescence measurements revealed that gold nanoparticles effectively suppress electron–hole pair recombination in TiO2, even at low Au loadings. All of the Au/TiO2 photocatalysts displayed high activity for H2 production from ethanol–water mixtures under UV irradiation, with the highest activities observed in the Au loading range 0.5–2 wt.% (H2 production rate 31–34 mmol g−1 h−1). In order to deconvolute the role of the P25 TiO2 support in promoting H2 production, anatase and rutile nanoparticles were isolated from P25 TiO2 by selective chemical dissolution and then functionalised with gold nanoparticles (3 wt.% loading, size 5 ± 2 nm). The H2 production activity of the resulting Au/anatase and Au/rutile photocatalysts was 22 and 10 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively, and substantially lower than the corresponding Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst (32 mmol g−1 h−1). The data provide strong evidence that synergistic electron transfer between the TiO2 polymorphs and supported Au nanoparticles is responsible for the high rates of H2 production observed in the Au/P25 TiO2 system. The interface between anatase and rutile crystallites, where gold nanoparticles preferentially deposit, is identified as a photocatalytic ‘hot spot’ for H2 production. High Au loadings reduce the efficiency of such ‘hot spots’. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Algae biomass is an attractive biofuel feedstock when grown with high productivity on marginal land. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) produces more oil from algae than lipid extraction (LE) does because protein and carbohydrates are converted, in part, to oil. Since nitrogen in the algae biomass is incorporated into the HTL oil, and since lipid extracted algae for generating heat and electricity are not co-produced by HTL, there are questions regarding implications for emissions and energy use. We studied the HTL and LE pathways for renewable diesel (RD) production by modeling all essential operations from nutrient manufacturing through fuel use. Our objective was to identify the key relationships affecting HTL energy consumption and emissions. LE, with identical upstream growth model and consistent hydroprocessing model, served as reference. HTL used 1. 8 fold less algae than did LE but required 5. 2 times more ammonia when nitrogen incorporated in the HTL oil was treated as lost. HTL RD had life cycle emissions of 31,000 gCO2 equivalent (gCO2e) compared to 21,500 gCO2e for LE based RD per million BTU of RD produced. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased when yields exceeded 0. 4 g HTL oil/g algae because insufficient carbon was left for biogas generation. Key variables in the analysis were the HTL oil yield, the hydrogen demand during upgrading, and the nitrogen content of the HTL oil. Future work requires better data for upgrading renewable oils to RD and requires consideration of nitrogen recycling during upgrading. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this study is to present and apply a quick screening method and to identify the most promising bioethanol derivatives using an early-stage sustainability assessment method that compares a bioethanol-based conversion route to its respective petrochemical counterpart. The method combines, by means of a multi-criteria approach, quantitative and qualitative proxy indicators describing economic, environmental, health and safety and operational aspects. Of twelve derivatives considered, five were categorized as favorable (diethyl ether, 1,3-butadiene, ethyl acetate, propylene and ethylene), two as promising (acetaldehyde and ethylene oxide) and five as unfavorable derivatives (acetic acid, n-butanol, isobutylene, hydrogen and acetone) for an integrated biorefinery concept. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study is to characterise and compare fast pyrolysis product yields from straw, high yielding perennial grasses and hardwoods. Feedstocks selected for this study include: wheat straw (Triticum aestivum), switch grass (Panicum virgatum), miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), willow short rotation coppice (Salix viminalis) and beech wood (Fagus sylvatica). The experimental work is divided into two sections: analytical (TGA and Py-GC-MS) and laboratory scale processing using a continuously fed bubbling fluidized bed reactor with a capacity of up to 1 kg/h. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) has been used to quantify pyrolysis products and simulate fast pyrolysis heating rates, in order to study potential key light and medium volatile decomposition products found in these feedstocks. Py-GC-MS quantification results show that the highest yields of furfural (0.57 wt.%), 2-furanmethanol (0.18 wt.%), levoglucosan (0.73 wt.%), 1,2-benzenediol (0.27 wt.%) and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (0.38 wt.%) were found in switch grass, and that willow SRC produced the highest yield of phenol (0.33 wt.%). The bio-oil higher heating value was highest for switch grass (22.3 MJ/kg). Water content within the bio-oil is highest in the straw and perennial grasses and lowest in the hardwood willow SRC. The high bio-oil and char heating value and low water content found in willow SRC, makes this crop an attractive energy feedstock for fast pyrolysis processing, if the associated production costs and harvest yields can be maintained at current reported values. The bio-oil from switch grass has the highest potential for the production of high value chemicals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here we present unequivocal experimental proof that microscale cofactor- and membrane-less, direct electron transfer based enzymatic fuel cells do produce significant amounts of electrical energy in human lachrymal liquid (tears). 100μm diameter gold wires, covered with 17nm gold nanoparticles, were used to fashion three-dimensional nanostructured microelectrodes, which were biomodified with Corynascus thermophilus cellobiose dehydrogenase and Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase as anodic and cathodic bioelements, respectively. The following characteristics of miniature glucose/oxygen biodevices operating in human tears were registered: 0.57V open-circuit voltage, about 1μWcm -2 maximum power density at a cell voltage of 0.5V, and more than 20h operational half-life. Theoretical calculations regarding the maximum recoverable electrical energy can be extracted from the biofuel and the biooxidant, glucose and molecular oxygen, each readily available in human lachrymal liquid, fully support our belief that biofuel cells can be used as electrical power sources for so called smart contact lenses. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In a previous publication the conversion of waste activated sludge (WAS) to short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) was reported to be significantly enhanced by carbohydrate addition. Herein, the effect of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio, pH (especially alkaline pH), temperature and hydraulic retention time (HRT) (or solid retention time (SRT)) on SCFA production and the related mechanisms were investigated when kitchen waste was added to WAS fermentation system. By response surface methodology, the conditions for maximal SCFA production were optimized, i.e. pH 8, C/N ratio 22, temperature 37 °C and time 6. d. Mechanism exploration revealed that under the optimum conditions the general activity of anaerobic microorganisms, the activities of key acid-forming enzymes, and the ratio of Bacteria to Archaea were improved remarkably, whereas the increase of methane production was negligible. With the fermentation liquid from WAS and kitchen waste as the fuel in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), the performance of electricity generation was enhanced significantly compared with those in MFCs fed with ultrasonic-pretreated WAS or ultrasonic-pretreated WAS plus smashed kitchen waste, due to the increase of SCFA content and the decrease of viscosity of the fuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Inexpensive non-sulfided Ni-based catalysts were evaluated for hydrotreatments using phenol as model compound. HZSM-5, a zeolite with different ratio of Si/Al and γ-Al2O3 were impregnated with Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and calcined at 450°C. Conversion rates and product distribution for treatment of phenol at 160-240°C in the presence of catalysts with nickel loads of 6, 10, 14 and 17wt.% were determined. Phenol conversion was highest (91.8%) at 240°C in the presence of HZSM-5(Si/Al=38) loaded with 10% Ni. When hydrotreatment was carried out with bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis of pine sawdust under the optimal conditions determined for phenol, the pH of bio-oil increased from 2.27 to 4.07, and the hydrogen content increased from 6.28 to 7.01wt.%. The decrease in acidity is desirable for the use of upgraded bio-oil. © 2012.

AB  - Waste animal bones was employed as a cost effective catalyst for the transesterification of palm oil. The catalyst was calcined at different temperatures to transform the calcium phosphate in the bones to hydroxyapatite and 800 °C was found to give the best yield of biodiesel. The catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). Under the optimal reaction conditions of 20. wt.% of catalyst, 1:18 oil to methanol molar ratio, 200. rpm of stirring of reactants and at a temperature of 65 °C, the methyl ester conversion was 96.78% and it was achieved in 4. h. The catalyst performed equally well as the laboratory-grade CaO. Animal bone is therefore a useful raw material for the production of a cheap catalyst for transesterification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The mechanism of the catalytic reduction of palmitic acid to n-pentadecane at 260 °C in the presence of hydrogen over catalysts combining multiple functions has been explored. The reaction involves rate-determining reduction of the carboxylic group of palmitic acid to give hexadecanal, which is catalyzed either solely by Ni or synergistically by Ni and the ZrO2 support. The latter route involves adsorption of the carboxylic acid group at an oxygen vacancy of ZrO2 and abstraction of the α-H with elimination of O to produce the ketene, which is in turn hydrogenated to the aldehyde over Ni sites. The aldehyde is subsequently decarbonylated to n-pentadecane on Ni. The rate of deoxygenation of palmitic acid is higher on Ni/ZrO2 than that on Ni/SiO2 or Ni/Al2O3, but is slower than that on H-zeolite-supported Ni. As the partial pressure of H2 is decreased, the overall deoxygenation rate decreases. In the absence of H 2, ketonization catalyzed by ZrO2 is the dominant reaction. Pd/C favors direct decarboxylation (-CO2), while Pt/C and Raney Ni catalyze the direct decarbonylation pathway (-CO). The rate of deoxygenation of palmitic acid (in units of mmol moltotal metal -1 h-1) decreases in the sequence r (Pt black)≈r(Pd black)&gt;r(Raney Ni) in the absence of H2. In situ IR spectroscopy unequivocally shows the presence of adsorbed ketene (Cï£34;Cï£34;O) on the surface of ZrO2 during the reaction with palmitic acid at 260 °C in the presence or absence of H2. Biomass to biofuels: The conversion of palmitic acid to n-pentadecane over ZrO2 mainly proceeds by hydrogenation of the carboxylic acid group to give hexadecanal (rate-determining step), which is catalyzed either solely by Ni sites or synergistically by Ni sites and sites on the ZrO2 support (see scheme). In the absence of H2, ketonization is the dominant reaction catalyzed by ZrO 2. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - This paper proposes a multiobjective, mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the superstructure optimization of hydrocarbon biorefineries via gasification pathway under economic and environmental criteria. The proposed hydrocarbon biorefinery superstructure includes a number of major processing stages, such as drying of the cellulosic biomass feedstocks, air separation unit, gasification, syngas conditioning, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydroprocessing, power generation, and the diesel and gasoline production. The superstructure considers alternatives of technologies and equipment, such as gasification technologies, cooling options, hydrogen production sources, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts. The economic objective is measured by the net present value (NPV), and the environmental concern is measured using global warming potential (GWP) that follows the life cycle assessment procedures, which evaluates the gate-to-gate environmental impacts of hydrocarbon biofuels. The multiobjective MINLP model simultaneously determines the technology selection, operation conditions, flow rate of each stream, energy consumption of each unit, economic performance, environmental impacts, and equipment sizes. The multiobjective MINLP problem is solved with the e{open}-constraint method. The resulting Pareto-optimal curve reveals the trade-off between the economic and environmental performances. The optimal solution reveals that the high-temperature gasification, direct cooling, internal hydrogen production and cobalt catalysis have the best environmental and economic performances. At the breakeven point, where the optimal NPV is 0, the unit production cost of hydrocarbon biorefinery is $4.43 per gasoline-equivalent gallon (GEG) with unit GWP of 20.92kg CO2 eqv./GEG. In the case of maximum NPV of $810 MM, the corresponding unit production cost is $3.17/GEG. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pretreatment of corncobs using torrefaction was conducted in an auger reactor at 250-300°C and residence times of 10-60min. The torrefied corncobs were fast pyrolyzed in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor at 470°C to obtain high-quality bio-oil. The heating value and pH of the bio-oil improved when the torrefaction as pretreatment was applied; however, increasing bio-oil yield penalties were observed with increasing torrefaction severity. Fourier transform infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and quantitative solid 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) analysis of torrefied corncobs showed that the devolatilization, crosslinking and charring of corncobs during torrefaction could be responsible for the bio-oil yield penalties. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that the acetic acid and furfural contents of the bio-oil decreased with torrefaction temperature or residence time. The results showed that torrefaction is an effective method of pretreatment for improving bio-oil quality if the crosslinking and charring of biomass can be restricted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are deemed to be a potential biocatalyst for the production of biodiesel along with other valuable products. An attempt was made to evaluate the effect of sequential growth phase (GP) and starvation phase (SP) on the lipid productivity of heterotrophically grown mixed microalgae using domestic wastewater as substrate/feed-stock. Effect of nutrients viz., nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), carbon (C) and potassium (K) on biomass growth and lipid accumulation was elucidated. Due to good nutrients availability during GP operation, significant increment in biomass growth was observed. On the contrary, nutrients deprived condition during SP operation documented increment in lipid productivity due to acceleration of triacylglycerides formation. Higher biomass growth was observed in GP operation with maximum in N + P condition (1.69 mg/mL) while higher lipid productivity was observed in starvation phase with maximum in C condition (28.2%). Gross fatty acid composition depicted significant variations in the fatty acid profile with abundance in saturated fatty acids (SFAs). Relatively good wastewater treatment efficiency in terms of substrate degradation and nutrient removal was observed during the GP operation. Diversity studies visualized dominance of lipid accumulating microalgae such as Scenedesmus sp., Diatoms and Chlorella sp. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Six hydrothermal liquefaction experiments on Nannochloropsis salina and Spirulina platensis at subcritical and supercritical water conditions (220-375 °C, 20-255. bar) were carried out to explore the feasibility of extracting lipids from wet algae, preserving nutrients in lipid-extracted algae solid residue, and recycling process water for algae cultivation. GC-MS, elemental analyzer, FT-IR, calorimeter and nutrient analysis were used to analyze bio-crude, lipid-extracted algae and water samples produced in the hydrothermal liquefaction process. The highest bio-crude yield of 46% was obtained on N. salina at 350 °C and 175. bar. For S. platensis algae sample, the optimal hydrothermal liquefaction condition appears to be at 310 °C and 115. bar, while the optimal condition for N. salina is at 350 °C and 175. bar. Preliminary data also indicate that a lipid-extracted algae solid residue sample obtained in the hydrothermal liquefaction process contains a high level of proteins. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used widely to estimate the environmental implications of deploying algae-to-energy systems even though no full-scale facilities have yet to be built. Here, data from a pilot-scale facility using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is used to estimate the life cycle profiles at full scale. Three scenarios (lab-, pilot-, and full-scale) were defined to understand how development in the industry could impact its life cycle burdens. HTL-derived algae fuels were found to have lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than petroleum fuels. Algae-derived gasoline had significantly lower GHG emissions than corn ethanol. Most algae-based fuels have an energy return on investment between 1 and 3, which is lower than petroleum biofuels. Sensitivity analyses reveal several areas in which improvements by algae bioenergy companies (e.g., biocrude yields, nutrient recycle) and by supporting industries (e.g., CO2 supply chains) could reduce the burdens of the industry. © 2013.

AB  - In the context of algal biofuels, lipids, or better aliphatic chains of the fatty acids, are perhaps the most important constituents of algal biomass. Accurate quantification of lipids and their respective fuel yield is crucial for comparison of algal strains and growth conditions and for process monitoring. As an alternative to traditional solvent-based lipid extraction procedures, we have developed a robust whole-biomass in situ transesterification procedure for quantification of algal lipids (as fatty acid methyl esters, FAMEs) that (a) can be carried out on a small scale (using 4-7 mg of biomass), (b) is applicable to a range of different species, (c) consists of a single-step reaction, (d) is robust over a range of different temperature and time combinations, and (e) tolerant to at least 50% water in the biomass. Unlike gravimetric lipid quantification, which can over- or underestimate the lipid content, whole biomass transesterification reflects the true potential fuel yield of algal biomass. We report here on the comparison of the yield of FAMEs by using different catalysts and catalyst combinations, with the acid catalyst HCl providing a consistently high level of conversion of fatty acids with a precision of 1.9% relative standard deviation. We investigate the influence of reaction time, temperature, and biomass water content on the measured FAME content and profile for 4 different samples of algae (replete and deplete Chlorella vulgaris, replete Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and replete Nannochloropsis sp.). We conclude by demonstrating a full mass balance closure of all fatty acids around a traditional lipid extraction process. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial photosynthesis comprises the design of systems for converting solar energy into useful forms based on the fundamental science underlying natural photosynthesis. There are many approaches to this problem. In this report, the emphasis is on molecule-based systems for photochemical production of fuels using sunlight. A few examples of typical components of artificial photosynthetic systems including antennas, reaction centres, catalysts for fuel production and water oxidation, and units for photoprotection and photoregulation are presented in order to illustrate the current state of the field and point out challenges yet to be fully addressed. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A facile continuous method for dilute-acid hydrolysis of the representative red seaweed species, Gelidium amansii was developed and its hydrolysate was subsequently evaluated for fermentability. In the hydrolysis step, the hydrolysates obtained from a batch reactor and a continuous reactor were systematically compared based on fermentable sugar yield and inhibitor formation. There are many advantages to the continuous hydrolysis process. For example, the low melting point of the agar component in G. amansii facilitates improved raw material fluidity in the continuous reactor.

AB  - Valorisation of lignin plays a key role in further development of lignocellulosic biorefinery processes the production of biofuels and bio-based materials. In the present study, organosolv hardwood and wheat straw lignins were converted in a supercritical fluid consisting of carbon dioxide/acetone/water (300-370 °C, 100. bar) to a phenolic oil consisting of oligomeric fragments and monomeric aromatic compounds with a total yield of 10-12% based on lignin. These yields are similar to the state-of-the-art technologies such as base-catalysed thermal processes applied for lignin depolymerisation. Addition of formic acid increases the yield of monomeric aromatic species by stabilizing aromatic radicals. Supercritical depolymerisation of wheat straw and hardwood lignin yielded monomeric compounds in different compositions with a maximum yield of 2.0% for syringic acid and 3.6% for syringol, respectively. The results of the present study showed that under the applied conditions competition occurred between lignin depolymerisation and recondensation of fragments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To better understand the pyrolysis of microalgae, the different roles of three major components (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) were investigated on a pyroprobe. Cellulose, egg whites, and canola oil were employed as the model compounds of the three components, respectively. Non-catalytic pyrolysis was used to identify and quantify some major products and several reaction pathways were proposed for the pyrolysis of each model compound. Catalytic pyrolysis was then carried out with HZSM-5 for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons at different temperatures and catalyst to feed ratios. The aromatic yields of all feedstocks were significantly improved when the catalyst to biomass ratio increased from 1:1 to 5:1. Egg whites had the lowest aromatic yield among the model compounds under all reaction conditions, which suggests that proteins can hardly be converted to aromatics with HZSM-5. Lipids, although only accounted for 12.33% of Chlorella, contributed about 40% of aromatic production from algal biomass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy is a renewable energy that plays an indispensable role in meeting today's ever increasing energy needs. Unlike biofuels, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) convert energy harvested from redox reactions directly into bioelectricity. MFCs can utilize low-grade organic carbons (fuels) in waste streams. The oxidation of the fuel molecules requires biofilm catalysis. In recent years, MFCs have also been used in the electrolysis mode to produce bioproducts in laboratory tests. MFCs research has intensified in the past decade and the maximum MFCs power density output has been increased greatly and many types of waste streams have been tested. However, new breakthroughs are needed for MFCs to be practical in wastewater treatment and power generation beyond powering small sensor devices. To reduce capital and operational costs, simple and robust membrane-less MFCs reactors are desired, but these reactors require highly efficient biofilms. Newly discovered conductive cell aggregates, improved electron transport through hyperpilation via mutation or genetic recombination and other advances in biofilm engineering present opportunities. This review is an update on the recent advances on MFCs designs and operations. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Ethylene is the most widely produced petrochemical feedstock globally. It is currently produced exclusively from fossil fuels, and its production is the largest CO2-emitting process in the chemical industry. In this study, we report on a photobiological process for sustained production of ethylene from CO2. The efe gene encoding an ethylene-forming enzyme from Pseudomonas syringae pv. Phaseolicola was previously expressed in cyanobacterial strains, but was not stable. We modified the gene sequence to enhance its stability, and expressed it in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, leading to continuous ethylene production. The same ethylene production rate was sustained across four successive sub-cultures without apparent loss of ethylene-forming ability. Up to 5.5% of the fixed carbon was directed to ethylene synthesis, surpassing the published carbon-partition rate into the TCA cycle. Nitrogen- and phosphorus-enriched seawater can support both growth and ethylene production. Factors limiting ethylene production, including efe expression levels, light intensity and nutrient status, were identified and alleviated, resulting in a peak production rate of 5650 μL L-1 h-1 (7125 μg L-1 h-1, 252 μmol L-1 h-1, or 171 mg L-1 day-1), which is higher than that reported for other algae biofuels and chemicals. This study suggests that Synechocystis, expressing the modified efe gene, has potential to be an efficient biological catalyst for the uptake and conversion of CO2 to ethylene. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Catalytic microwave pyrolysis of biomass using activated carbon (AC) was investigated to determine the effects of pyrolytic conditions on the yields of phenol and phenolics. Bio-oils with high concentrations of phenol (38.9%) and phenolics (66.9%) were obtained. These levels were higher than those obtained by pyrolysis without AC addition and were closely related to the decomposition of lignin. A high concentration of esters (42.2% in the upgraded bio-oil) was obtained in the presence of Zn powder as catalyst and formic acid/ethanol as reaction medium. Most of the esters identified by GC-MS were long chain fatty acid esters. The high content of phenols and esters obtained in this study can be used as partial replacement of petroleum fuels after separation of oxygenates or as feedstock for organic syntheses in the chemical industry after purification. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass to bio-oil under alkaline or neutral conditions has been widely reported in literature. However, there has been limited data available in literature on comparing HTL of biomass to bio-oil under acidic, neutral, and alkaline in terms of chemical compositions and yields by using the same reaction conditions and reactor. Using cellulose as a feedstock we conducted the comparative studies for pH=3, 7 and 14 at temperatures of 275-320°C with reaction residence times of 0-30min. Results showed that the chemical compositions of the bio-oils were different for acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions. Under acidic and neutral conditions, the main composition of HTL bio-oil was 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF). Under alkaline conditions, the main compounds became C2-5 carboxylic acids. For bio-oil yields, it was observed that high temperatures and long residence times had negative effects, regardless of the pH levels. However, the corresponding reaction mechanisms are different. Under acidic conditions, the decrease in the bio-oil yields was mainly caused by polymerization of 5-HMF to solids. Under neutral conditions, the bio-oil yields decreased because 5-HMF was converted to both solid and gaseous products. Under alkaline conditions, the bio-oil decomposed to gases through the formation of short chain acids and aldehydes. Therefore, although they were all referred to as HTL bio-oil in literature, they were formed by different reaction pathways and had different properties due to their different chemical compositions. Given these differences, different strategies are recommended in this study to further improve HTL of biomass to bio-oil. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - • Biofuels, in conjunction to their positive carbon balance with regards to fossil fuels, also represent a significant potential for sustainability and economic growth of industrialized countries because they can be generated from locally available renewable material. • Biofuels are usually classified as follows: 1. First-generation biofuels are directly related to a biomass that is generally edible. 2. Second-generation biofuels are defined as fuels produced from a wide array of different feedstock, ranging from lignocellulosic feedstocks to municipal solid wastes. 3. Third-generation biofuels are, at this point, related to algal biomass but could to a certain extent be linked to utilization of CO2 as feedstock. • Scaling second- and third-generation biofuel processes thus requires solid economics that are directly dependent on optimized carbon utilization that relies on the production of fuels (commodities), as well as high value co-products. © Lee and Lavoie.

AB  - Background: Bioethanol produced from the lignocellulosic fractions of sugar cane (bagasse and leaves), i.e. second generation (2G) bioethanol, has a promising market potential as an automotive fuel; however, the process is still under investigation on pilot/demonstration scale. From a process perspective, improvements in plant design can lower the production cost, providing better profitability and competitiveness if the conversion of the whole sugar cane is considered. Simulations have been performed with AspenPlus to investigate how process integration can affect the minimum ethanol selling price of this 2G process (MESP-2G), as well as improve the plant energy efficiency. This is achieved by integrating the well-established sucrose-to-bioethanol process with the enzymatic process for lignocellulosic materials. Bagasse and leaves were steam pretreated using H 3PO 4as catalyst and separately hydrolysed and fermented. Results: The addition of a steam dryer, doubling of the enzyme dosage in enzymatic hydrolysis, including leaves as raw material in the 2G process, heat integration and the use of more energy-efficient equipment led to a 37 % reduction in MESP-2G compared to the Base case. Modelling showed that the MESP for 2G ethanol was 0.97 US$/L, while in the future it could be reduced to 0.78 US$/L. In this case the overall production cost of 1G + 2G ethanol would be about 0.40 US$/L with an output of 102 L/ton dry sugar cane including 50 % leaves. Sensitivity analysis of the future scenario showed that a 50 % decrease in the cost of enzymes, electricity or leaves would lower the MESP-2G by about 20%, 10% and 4.5%, respectively. Conclusions: According to the simulations, the production of 2G bioethanol from sugar cane bagasse and leaves in Brazil is already competitive (without subsidies) with 1G starch-based bioethanol production in Europe. Moreover 2G bioethanol could be produced at a lower cost if subsidies were used to compensate for the opportunity cost from the sale of excess electricity and if the cost of enzymes continues to fall. © 2012 Macrelli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A series of silica-supported metal phosphides was prepared by two methods involving the reduction of phosphite (I) or phosphate (A) precursors and was studied for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF). The I method required lower temperature than the A method and resulted in catalysts with higher surface area. The activity was evaluated in a packed-bed reactor on the basis of equal CO chemisorption sites (30 μmol) loaded in the reactor with comparison made to a commercial Pd/Al 2O 3 catalyst. At 300 °C and 1 atm, the order of activity was Ni 2P &gt; WP &gt; MoP &gt; CoP &gt; FeP &gt; Pd/Al 2O 3. The principal HDO products for the iron group phosphides (Ni 2P and CoP) were pentane and butane, whereas for the group 6 metal phosphides (MoP and WP), the products were mostly pentenes and pentadienes. For the Pd/Al 2O 3 and the low-activity FeP/SiO 2 catalyst the products were mostly pentenes and C4 mixtures. There were no significant differences in the turnover frequency between materials prepared by the two methods, except possibly for the case of WP. There were likewise no great changes in selectivity toward HDO products at 5% total conversion, except for WP. The differences in the case of WP were attributed to the surface P/W ratio that X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed to be twice as large for the I method than the A method. Contact-time studies were used to develop reaction networks for the most active catalysts, Ni 2P/SiO 2 and WP/SiO 2. For Ni 2P/SiO 2 by both methods, the selectivity profiles were similar and could be explained by a rake mechanism with pentenes as primary products, 2-pentanone as a secondary product, and pentane as a final product. In contrast, for WP/SiO 2, the selectivity depended greatly on the preparation method, but produced a preponderance of unsaturated compounds. The results could be explained from the surface composition. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of lignin with four different zeolite catalysts was investigated to determine the role of shape selectivity of zeolites in CFP. These zeolites included ZSM-5, mordenite, beta, and Y zeolites, which have various crystallographically determined static pore sizes between 5.6 and 7.6. The molecular dimensions of pyrolysis products, including lignin-derived oxygenates and aromatics, were calculated using quantum chemical computations. The effective pore sizes of the four zeolites at 650 °C were then determined by analyzing the molecular size and conversion behavior of the pyrolysis products in CFP. Results suggest that thermal distortion of the zeolite pore structure under high-temperature conditions of CFP effectively enlarge the crystallographically determined pore sizes of the zeolites by 2.5-3.4. Therefore, many lignin-derived oxygenates with a molecular size considerably larger than the static pore size were able to enter the pores of the zeolites and become effectively converted in our CFP tests. Bulkier monolignols derived from syringyl lignin, however, could not be effectively converted by ZSM-5 and mordenite zeolites due to size exclusion or pore blockage. Among the four zeolites, ZSM-5 produced the highest aromatic yield, followed in order by beta, mordenite, and Y zeolites. Beta and Y zeolites were the most effective catalysts for deoxygenating lignin-derived oxygenates. This analysis indicates that for CFP of softwood, ZSM-5 is the optimal catalyst because it can achieve satisfactory deoxygenation and aromatic production simultaneously, whereas for hardwood feedstock, beta zeolite may be used to convert bulky oxygenates derived from syringyl lignin. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Direct transformation of cellulose and sugarcane bagasse into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was carried out using single or combined metal chloride catalysts in DMA-LiCl solvent under microwave-assisted heating. Among several metal chloride catalysts studied, Zr(O)Cl 2/CrCl 3 combined catalyst was most effective enabling 57% HMF from cellulose fiber. Zr(O)Cl 2/CrCl 3 catalyst was also effective for the conversion of sugarcane bagasse to HMF and 5-ethoxymethyl-2-furfural (EMF), a promising biofuel. This report discloses one-pot synthesis of EMF from sugarcane bagasse for the first time and also reveals the maximum HMF yield known so far from sugarcane bagasse. Thus, the current catalytic system based on cheap and readily abundant zirconium and chromium salts presents an efficient method for EMF and HMF synthesis from inexpensive lignocellulosic biomass. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper focuses on the fundamental chemical aspects of hydrogen transfer reactions with RANEY® Ni and propan-2-ol. It aims at novel process options for defunctionalization and hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic and aromatic biorefinery feeds under low-severity conditions. A series of 32 model substrates were explored, providing a comprehensive description of the reactivity of RANEY® Ni toward transfer hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenolysis. In addition, the aspects related to the catalyst stability were addressed in detail. With regard to the processing of a model-substrate mixture, important features of the chemoselectivity of RANEY® Ni were also revealed. Herein, we also demonstrate that hydrogen transfer reactions could hold the key to the upgrade of bio-oil under unusual, low-severity conditions. Indeed, bio-oil was easily upgraded to cyclohexanols and less functionalized alkylphenols, with RANEY® Ni and propan-2-ol, at 120 °C. Full saturation of bio-oil to cyclic alcohols, cyclohexane-1,2-diols and other products with reduced oxygen content was achieved at 160 °C under autogenous pressure. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

AB  - Characterization of crude glycerol is very important to its value-added conversion. In this study, the physical and chemical properties of five biodiesel-derived crude glycerol samples were determined. Three methods, including iodometric-periodic acid method, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography (GC), were shown to be suitable for the determination of glycerol content in crude glycerol. The compositional analysis of crude glycerol was successfully achieved by crude glycerol fractionation and characterization of the obtained fractions (aqueous and organic) using titrimetric, HPLC, and GC analyses. The aqueous fraction consisted mainly of glycerol, methanol, and water, while the organic fraction contained fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), free fatty acids (FFAs), and glycerides. Despite the wide variations in the proportion of their components, all raw crude glycerol samples were shown to contain glycerol, soap, methanol, FAMEs, water, glycerides, FFAs, and ash. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable energy source is becoming progressively essential. Much attention is focused on identifying suitable biomass species that can provide high energy outputs to replace conventional fossil fuels. The current study emphasizes on some commonly available biomasses in North America such as pinewood, timothy grass, and wheat straw for their usage towards next generation biofuels. Fast pyrolysis of the feedstocks was performed at 450 °C to generate biochars that were further characterized to advocate their energy and agronomic relevance. The biomasses were examined physiochemically to understand their compositional and structural characteristics through analytical approaches such as CHNS (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur), ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry), particle size, FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric, XRD (X-ray diffraction), and high-pressure liquid chromatography. The chemical composition of feedstocks significantly differed from that of biochars and the variations among feedstock composition were also found to be greater than for biochars. The presence of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin along with other organic components were identified in the spectroscopic and chromatographic analysis. The FTIR spectra of biochars showed removal of oxygen- and hydrogen-containing functionalities from feedstocks due to pyrolysis at higher temperature, although retaining certain significant cellulose-derived functionalities. A number of crystallographic phases in the XRD of biomass, ash, and biochars were due to minerals commonly Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Fe, and Mn. ICP-MS of biochars demonstrated substantial amount of alkali elements indicating their compatibility towards soil amendment for restoring degraded soils. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Wheat straw fractionation by ethanol organosolv was studied as pretreatment for enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis. A parametric study focusing on temperature, reaction time, acid catalyst dose, solvent concentration, and particle size was performed to determine their influence on delignification, xylan hydrolysis, and enzymatic cellulose digestibility. Major process parameters were found to be temperature, ethanol concentration, and acid dose. Optimisation of the process towards enzymatic digestibility resulted in a maximum glucose yield of 86% without the use of a catalyst (lignin yield 84%, organosolv at 210°C, 50% w/w aqueous EtOH). Using 30mM H2SO4 as catalyst resulted in similar glucose and lignin yields at a lower temperature (190°C, 60% w/w aqueous EtOH). Lowering the pretreatment temperature by using an acid catalyst substantially improved the yield of the hemicellulose derivatives xylose and furfural. A systematic approach in pretreatment optimisation is vital for development of efficient lignocellulosic biorefineries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolitic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, such as switchgrass and other agricultural residues, to bio-fuels is being considered for national energy security and for environmental advantages. Bio-oil, syn-gas and bio-char were produced and characterized from switchgrass at 400, 500 and 600°C by pyrolysis. Bio-oil yield increased from 22 to 37%, syn-gas yield increased from 8 to 26%, and bio-char yield decreased from 48 to 25% with increases of pyrolysis temperatures from 400 to 600°C. Bio-oil heating value was 36.3 MJ/kg, density was 920 kg/m3 and viscosity was 10 cST. GC-MS study indicated that the bio-oil contained 37% oxygenates that can be upgraded to transportation fuel in future research. Syn-gas compositional analysis shows that, with increasing pyrolysis temperature, CO2, CO, C 2H4 and C2H6 contents increased, whereas H2 and CH4 contents decreased. Part of the syn-gas consisting of H2, CO and CO2, when converted to syn-fuel, can be beneficial to the environment; sulfur free, presence of oxygenates results in less CO emissions and ozone to the atmosphere. Bio-char may be used as a co-product to enhance soil quality, and for carbon sequestration. Analysis of elemental composition and physical properties of bio-char show increase in carbon content, decrease in oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen content, and increase in surface area and pore volume with increases of pyrolysis temperature. The optimized pyrolysis process for bio-oil production in this study will help meet future goals of oil upgrading to produce transportation fuel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - On January 1 2008, Brazil included yet another element into its energy matrix: biodiesel. The predominant biodiesel production process involves a phase of transesterification that yields glycerol as a by-product. The use of this glycerol is limited since it is considered an unrefined raw material that must be refined for its various types of use. Several studies have addressed identification of possible uses for unrefined glycerol. Given the diversity of uses, an overview is necessary. The purpose of this work is to present alternatives currently being considered for the use of unrefined glycerol as a by-product of biodiesel production, aiming to contribute to the sustainable consolidation of the biofuel market. Exploratory research was carried out to identify these viable alternatives for the use of this by-product. The possibilities include the production of chemical products, fuel additives, production of hydrogen, development of fuel cells, ethanol or methanol production, animal feed, co-digestion and co-gasification, and waste treatment among others. The present research reveals that there are promising possibilities for the use of unrefined glycerol, which may help consolidate the sustainability of the biofuel market. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The natural resistance to enzymatic deconstruction exhibited by lignocellulosic materials has designated pretreatment as a key step in the biological conversion of biomass to ethanol. Hydrothermal pretreatment in pure water represents a challenging approach because it is a method with low operational costs and does not involve the use of organic solvents, difficult to handle chemicals, and "external" liquid or solid catalysts. In the present work, a systematic study has been performed to optimize the hydrothermal treatment of lignocellulosic biomass (beech wood) with the aim of maximizing the enzymatic digestibility of cellulose in the treated solids and obtaining a liquid side product that could also be utilized for the production of ethanol or valuable chemicals. Hydrothermal treatment experiments were conducted in a batch-mode, high-pressure reactor under autogeneous pressure at varying temperature (130-220 °C) and time (15-180 min) regimes, and at a liquid-to-solid ratio (LSR) of 15. The intensification of the process was expressed by the severity factor, log Ro. The major changes induced in the solid biomass were the dissolution/removal of hemicellulose to the process liquid and the partial removal and relocation of lignin on the external surface of biomass particles in the form of recondensed droplets. The above structural changes led to a 2.5-fold increase in surface area and total pore volume of the pretreated biomass solids. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose increased from less than 7 wt % for the parent biomass to as high as 70 wt % for the treated solids. Maximum xylan recovery (60 wt %) in the hydrothermal process liquid was observed at about 80 wt % hemicellulose removal; this was accomplished by moderate treatment severities (log R o=3.8-4.1). At higher severities (log Ro=4.7), xylose degradation products, mainly furfural and formic acid, were the predominant chemicals formed. Green fuels and chemicals: The enzymatic digestibility of cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass towards fermentable glucose can be increased significantly by hydrothermal pretreatment in pure water under relatively mild conditions. Appropriate selection of the pretreatment temperature and time also leads to a process liquid that can be enriched in xylose or in furfural and acetic acid.

AB  - Separation of CO2 and N2 from CH4 is significantly important in natural gas upgrading, and capture/removal of CO 2, CH4 from air (N2) is essential to greenhouse gas emission control. Adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of CO2, CH4, and N2 on an ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) sample were systematically investigated to evaluate its capability in the above two applications. The OMC was synthesized and characterized with TEM, TGA, small-angle XRD, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements. Pure component adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 were measured at 278, 298, and 318 K and pressures up to 100 kPa, and correlated with the Langmuir model. These data were used to estimate the separation selectivities for CO2/CH4, CH4/N2, and CO2/N2 binary mixtures at different compositions and pressures according to the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) model. At 278 K and 100 kPa, the predicted selectivities for equimolar CO2/CH 4, CH4/N2, and CO2/N2 are 3.4, 3.7, and 12.8, respectively; and the adsorption capacities for CH 4 and CO2 are 1.3 and 3.0 mmol/g, respectively. This is the first report of a versatile mesoporous material that displays both high selectivities and large adsorption capacities for separating CO 2/CH4, CH4/N2, and CO 2/N2 mixtures. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microalgae are considered as an intriguing candidate for biofuel production due to their high biomass yield. Studies on bio-oil production through fast pyrolysis and upgrading to hydrocarbon fuels using algal biomass are limited as compared to other terrestrial biomass. Therefore, in this study, a fresh water green alga, Chlorella vulgaris, was taken for pyrolysis study. The average activation energy for pyrolysis zone was found to be 109.1kJ/mol. Fixed-bed pyrolysis of algae gave a bio-oil yield of 52.7wt.%, which accounts for 60.7wt.% carbon yield. In addition, analytical pyrolysis of C. vulgaris was carried out in a Py/GC-MS to identify major compounds present in bio-oil with and without catalyst (H +ZSM-5). The study found that in catalytic-pyrolysis, as the catalyst loading increased from zero to nine times of the biomass, the carbon yield of aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 0.9 to 25.8wt.%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass pyrolysis utilizes high temperatures to produce an economically renewable intermediate (pyrolysis oil) that can be integrated with the existing petroleum infrastructure to produce biofuels. The initial chemical reactions in pyrolysis convert solid biopolymers, such as cellulose (up to 60% of biomass), to a short-lived (less than 0.1 s) liquid phase, which subsequently reacts to produce volatile products. In this work, we develop a novel thin-film pyrolysis technique to overcome typical experimental limitations in biopolymer pyrolysis and identify α-cyclodextrin as an appropriate small-molecule surrogate of cellulose. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are performed with this surrogate to reveal the long-debated pathways of cellulose pyrolysis and indicate homolytic cleavage of glycosidic linkages and furan formation directly from cellulose without any small-molecule (e.g., glucose) intermediates. Our strategy combines novel experiments and first-principles simulations to allow detailed chemical mechanisms to be constructed for biomass pyrolysis and enable the optimization of next-generation biorefineries. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Levulinic acid is considered as a versatile building block because it can be used for the synthesis of several organic chemicals. In particular, its esterification with ethanol produces ethyl levulinate that can be used as diesel miscible biofuel (DMB), preventing global warming by decreasing atmospheric CO 2 generated from the consumption of fossil fuels. This article explores the use of two groups of solid acid catalysts (sulfated oxides and zeolites with different pore structures) in the esterification of levulinc acid with ethanol aiming for ethyl levulinate production. It was found that while there is a correlation between the number of acidic sites and activity for the sulfated oxides, the same is not true for the studied zeolites where the pore channels play a more important role. Among the catalysts tested, Amberlyst-15 and sulfated SnO 2 showed a remarkable high yield of ethyl levulinate that was probably due to the strong acidity provided by SO 3H functional groups and SO 4 species, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pinewood sawdust flash pyrolysis has been performed in continuous mode in a pilot plant provided with a conical spouted bed reactor, in the 400-600 °C range. The influence of temperature on the pyrolysis yields and product properties has been studied. Product analysis has been carried out on-line by means of chromatographic methods. High liquid yields have been achieved, with the maximum bio-oil yield (75 wt%) at 500 °C. Gas yield is very low at low temperatures and this fraction is mainly composed of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and small amounts of methane, hydrogen and C 2-C 4 hydrocarbons. Bio-oil has been characterized and its major compounds are phenols, specifically guaiacols at low temperatures and catechols at high temperatures. At 600 °C, there is an increase in light compounds due to the cracking reactions, but no aromatic compounds have been detected due to the low residence time of the volatiles in the reactor. The fuel properties of the bio-oil have been measured and the results indicate that it can be a potential substitute to conventional fuels, although its heating value should be improved by subjecting to further treatments. Char can be used as energy source or as active carbon. The char obtained at 600 °C has a high surface area and is suitable for active carbon production. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - HY zeolites hydrophobized by functionalization with organosilanes are much more stable in hot liquid water than the corresponding untreated zeolites. Silylation of the zeolite increases hydrophobicity without significantly reducing the density of acid sites. This hydrophobization with organosilanes makes the zeolites able to stabilize water/oil emulsions and catalyze reactions of importance in biofuel upgrading, i.e., alcohol dehydration and alkylation of m-cresol and 2-propanol in the liquid phase, at high temperatures. While at 200 °C the crystalline structure of an untreated HY zeolite collapses in a few hours in contact with a liquid medium, the functionalized hydrophobic zeolites keep their structure practically unaltered. Detailed XRD, SEM, HRTEM, and BET analyses indicate that even after reaction under severe conditions, the hydrophobic zeolites retain their crystallinity, surface area, microporosity, and acid density. It is proposed that by preferentially anchoring hydrophobic functionalities on the external surface, the direct contact of bulk liquid water and the zeolite is hindered, thus preventing the collapse of the framework during the reaction in liquid hot water. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Triacylglycerols are among the most attractive alternative raw materials for biofuel development. Current oil plant-based technologies are limited in terms of triacylglycerol production capacity and rate. These limitations may be circumvented by biotransformation of carbohydrates into lipids; however, our understanding of microbial oleaginicity remains limited. Here we present the results of a multi-omic analysis of Rhodosporidium toruloides, a robust triacylglycerol-producing fungus. The assembly of genome and transcriptome sequencing data reveals a genome of 20.2 Mb containing 8,171 protein-coding genes, the majority of which have multiple introns. Genes including a novel fatty acid synthase are predicted to participate in metabolic pathways absent in non-oleaginous yeasts. Transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that lipid accumulation under nitrogen-limited conditions correlates with the induction of lipogenesis, nitrogenous compound recycling, macromolecule metabolism and autophagy. The multi-omic map of R. toruloides therefore provides a valuable resource for efforts to rationally engineer lipid-production pathways. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bio-oil obtained from fast pyrolysis of biomass has the potential to be upgraded to renewable, drop-in fuel intermediates. The quality of bio-oil produced is critical to downstream process development and is determined by a number of factors like reaction timescale, extent of primary and secondary reactions, and the presence of minerals. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of the various competing reactions in fast pyrolysis of cellulose and other glucose-based carbohydrates through a unified microkinetic model. The model incorporates the reactions of the cellulose chain and of the glucose intermediate to form a variety of bio-oil components, which are confirmed by either experiments or theoretical calculations reported in the literature. The majority of the Arrhenius rate parameters were based on existing studies, while a small number were fitted to match the experimental product distribution over a wide range of temperatures. The model yields of all the major primary fast pyrolysis products, viz., levoglucosan, formic acid, glycolaldehyde, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, furfural and char, match reasonably well with the experimental data over the temperature range of 400-550°C. The model predicted that the time required for complete conversion corresponds to 2.5-3 s. Net rate analysis identified key pathways to levoglucosan via either mid-chain initiation, or depropagation and end-chain initiation that were dominant over the timescales of 0-100 ms and 100-1000 ms, respectively, at 500°C. Unlike the existing lumped kinetic models, our model provides a detailed picture of levoglucosan formation that involves mid-chain glycosidic bond cleavage followed by unzipping of levoglucosan from the chain ends. The model, utilizing the same set of rate coefficients, was able to predict the dominant products of fast pyrolysis of maltohexaose, cellobiose and glucose that also are in good agreement with experimental data. The initial chain length of cellulose was found to have a profound effect on the product yields for chain lengths shorter than 50, while it had no effect on the total reaction time. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - Productive uses of lignin, the third most abundant natural polymer, have been sought for decades. One especially attractive possibility is that of developing value-added products including thermoplastics based on lignin. This possibility warrants special attention due to growth of the modern biofuel industries. However, the polydisperse molecular weight and hyper-branched structure of lignin has hindered the creation of high-performance biopolymers. Here, we report the preparation and characterization of novel lignin-based, partially carbon-neutral thermoplastics. We first altered the molecular weight of lignin, either by fractionation with methanol, or by formaldehyde crosslinking. Crosslinking of lignin increases the molecular weight, exhibiting Mn = 31000 g mol-1, whereas that of as-received lignin is 1840 g mol-1. Tuning the molecular weight of lignin enabled successful preparation of novel lignin-derived thermoplastics, when coupled with telechelic polybutadiene soft-segments at proper feed ratios. Characteristic to thermoplastic rubbers, free-standing films of the resulting copolymers exhibit two-phase morphology and associated relaxations in the dynamic mechanical loss spectrum. To the best of our knowledge this article is the first report to demonstrate phase immiscibility, melt-processibility, and biphasic morphology of soft and hard segments in a lignin-based copolymer for all feed ratios of two macromolecular components. The use of higher molecular weight lignin enhanced the resulting shear modulus due to efficient network formation of telechelic polybutadiene bridges. The storage modulus in the rubbery plateau region increased with increasing lignin content. The successful synthesis of novel lignin-based thermoplastics will open a new pathway to biomass utilization and will help conserve petrochemicals. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - There is currently great interest in microalgae as sources of renewable energy and biofuels. Many algae species have a high lipid content and can be grown on non-arable land using alternate water sources such as seawater. This paper discusses in detail the issue of sustainability of commercial-scale microalgae production of biofuels with particular focus on land, water, nutrients (N and P) and CO2 requirements and highlights some of the key issues in the very large scale culture of microalgae which is required for biofuels. The use of genetically modified algae is also considered. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Waste frying oil was used to produce biodiesel using calcined snail shell as a heterogeneous base catalyst. Trans esterification reactions were carried out and the yield and conversion of the product were optimized by varying the methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst amount, reaction temperature, and time. A biodiesel conversion of 99.58% was obtained with a yield of 87.28%. The reaction followed first order kinetics. The activation energy (E A) was 79kJ/mol and the frequency factor (A) was 2.98×10 10min -1. The fuel properties of the biodiesel were measured according to ASTM D 6751 and found to be within the specifications. Snail shell is a novel source for the production of heterogeneous base catalyst that can be successfully utilized for synthesis of biodiesel of high purity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent years have faced stimulating developments in the functionalization of electrode surfaces with biological materials, notably due to the significant input of nanosciences and nanotechnology. In this review (over 450 references), we are discussing the interest of both nano-objects (metal nanoparticles and quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and graphene) and nano-engineered and/or nanostructured materials (template-based materials, advanced organic polymers) for the rational design of bio-functionalized electrodes and related (bio)sensing systems. The attractiveness of such nanomaterials relies not only on their ability to act as effective immobilization matrices, which are, e.g., likely to enhance the long-term stability of bioelectrochemical devices, but also on their intrinsic and unique features (large surface areas, electrocatalytic properties, controlled morphology and structure, possible use as labels) that can be advantageously combined with the functioning of biomolecules, thus contributing to improved bioelectrode performance in terms of sensitivity and selectivity (enzymatic biosensors, DNA sensors, immunosensors and cell sensors) or power (biofuel cells). © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The materials that are used to make electrodes and their internal structures significantly affect microbial fuel cell (MFC) performance. In this study, we describe a carbon nanotube (CNT)-sponge composite prepared by coating a sponge with CNTs. Compared to the CNT-coated textile electrodes evaluated in prior studies, CNT-sponge electrodes had lower internal resistance, greater stability, more tunable and uniform macroporous structure (pores up to 1 mm in diameter), and improved mechanical properties. The CNT-sponge composite also provided a three-dimensional scaffold that was favorable for microbial colonization and catalytic decoration. Using a batch-fed H-shaped MFC outfitted with CNT-sponge electrodes, an areal power density of 1.24 W m -2 was achieved when treating domestic wastewater. The maximum volumetric power density of a continuously fed plate-shaped MFC was 182 W m -3. To our knowledge, these are the highest values obtained to date for MFCs fed domestic wastewater: 2.5 times the previously reported maximum areal power density and 12 times the previously reported maximum volumetric power density. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The effect of storage temperature and time on lipid composition of Scenedesmus sp. was studied. When stored at 4 °C or higher, the free fatty acid content in the wet biomass increased from a trace to 62.0% by day 4. Using two-step catalytic conversion, algae oil with a high free fatty acid content was converted to biodiesel by pre-esterification and transesterification. The conversion rate of triacylglycerols reached 100% under the methanol to oil molar ratio of 12:1 during catalysis with 2% potassium hydroxide at 65 °C for 30. min. This process was scaled up to produce biodiesel from Scenedesmus sp. and Nannochloropsis sp. oil. The crude biodiesel was purified using bleaching earth. Except for moisture content, the biodiesel conformed to Chinese National Standards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nearly one hundred years ago, the fermentative production of acetone by Clostridium acetobutylicum provided a crucial alternative source of this solvent for manufacture of the explosive cordite. Today there is a resurgence of interest in solventogenic Clostridium species to produce n-butanol and ethanol for use as renewable alternative transportation fuels. Acetone, a product of acetone-n-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, harbours a nucleophilic α-carbon, which is amenable to C-C bond formation with the electrophilic alcohols produced in ABE fermentation. This functionality can be used to form higher-molecular-mass hydrocarbons similar to those found in current jet and diesel fuels. Here we describe the integration of biological and chemocatalytic routes to convert ABE fermentation products efficiently into ketones by a palladium-catalysed alkylation. Tuning of the reaction conditions permits the production of either petrol or jet and diesel precursors. Glyceryl tributyrate was used for the in situ selective extraction of both acetone and alcohols to enable the simple integration of ABE fermentation and chemical catalysis, while reducing the energy demand of the overall process. This process provides a means to selectively produce petrol, jet and diesel blend stocks from lignocellulosic and cane sugars at yields near their theoretical maxima. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - We investigated hydrothermal liquefaction of Nannochloropsis sp. at different temperatures (250-400 °C), times (10-90 min), water densities (0.3-0.5 g/mL), and biomass loadings (5-35 wt %). Liquefaction produced a biocrude with light and heavy fractions, along with gaseous, aqueous, and solid by-product fractions. The gravimetric yields of the product fractions from experiments at 250 °C summed to an average of 100 ± 4 wt %, showing mass balance closure at 250 °C. The gravimetric yields of the product fractions are independent of water density at 400 °C. Increasing the biomass loading increases the biocrude yield from 36 to 46 wt %. The yields of light and heavy biocrude depend on reaction time and temperature, but their combined yield depends primarily on temperature. Regardless of reaction time and temperature, the yield of products distributed to the aqueous phase is 51 ± 5 wt % and the light biocrude is 75 ± 1 wt % C. Two-thirds of the N in the alga is immediately distributed to the aqueous phase and up to 84% can be partitioned there. Up to 85% of the P is distributed to the aqueous phase in the form of free phosphate. Thus, N and P can be recovered in the aqueous phase for nutrient recycling. Up to 80% of the chemical energy in the alga is retained within the biocrude. The quantitative results reported herein provide the basis for a reaction network for algae liquefaction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four groups of catalysts have been tested for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol as a model compound of bio-oil, including oxide catalysts, methanol synthesis catalysts, reduced noble metal catalysts, and reduced non-noble metal catalysts. In total, 23 different catalysts were tested at 100 bar H2 and 275 C in a batch reactor. The experiments showed that none of the tested oxides or methanol synthesis catalysts had any significant activity for phenol HDO under the given conditions, which were linked to their inability to hydrogenate the aromatic ring of phenol. HDO of phenol over reduced metal catalysts could effectively be described by a kinetic model involving a two-step reaction in which phenol initially was hydrogenated to cyclohexanol and then subsequently deoxygenated to cyclohexane. Among reduced noble metal catalysts, ruthenium, palladium, and platinum were all found to be active, with activity decreasing in that order. Nickel was the only active non-noble metal catalyst. For nickel, the effect of support was also investigated and ZrO2 was found to perform best. Pt/C, Ni/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2-ZrO 2 were the most active catalysts for the initial hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol but were not very active for the subsequent deoxygenation step. Overall, the order of activity of the best performing HDO catalysts was as follows: Ni/ZrO2 &gt; Ni-V2O5/ZrO 2 &gt; Ni-V2O5/SiO2 &gt; Ru/C &gt; Ni/Al2O3 &gt; Ni/SiO2 Pd/C &gt; Pt/C. The choice of support influenced the activity significantly. Nickel was found to be practically inactive for HDO of phenol on a carbon support but more active than the carbon-supported noble metal catalysts when supported on ZrO2. This observation indicates that the nickel-based catalysts require a metal oxide as a carrier on which the activation of the phenol for the hydrogenation can take place through heterolytic dissociation of the O-H bond to facilitate the reaction. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass is a primary source of renewable carbon that can be utilized as a feedstock for biofuels or biochemicals production in order to achieve energy independence. The low bulk density, high moisture content, degradation during storage and low energy density of raw lignocellulosic biomass are all significant challenges in supplying agricultural residues as a cellulosic feedstock. Torrefaction is a thermochemical process conducted in the temperature range between 200 and 300 °C under an inert atmosphere which is currently being considered as a biomass pretreatment. Competitiveness and quality of biofuels and biochemicals may be significantly increased by incorporating torrefaction early in the production chain while further optimization of the process might enable its autothermal operation. In this study, torrefaction process parameters were investigated in order to improve biomass energy density and reduce its moisture content. The biomass of choice (corn stover) was torrefied at three moisture content levels (30%, 45% and 50%), three different temperatures (200, 250 and 300 °C), and three unique reaction times (10, 20 and 30 min). Solid, gaseous, and liquid products were analyzed, and the mass and energy balance of the reaction was quantified. An overall increase in energy density (2-19%) and decrease in mass and energy yield (3-45% and 1-35% respectively) was observed with the increase in process temperature. Mass and energy losses also increased with an increase in the initial biomass moisture content. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Isosorbide is a platform chemical of considerable importance for the future replacement of fossil resource-based products. Applications as monomers and building blocks for new polymers and functional materials, new organic solvents, for medical and pharmaceutical applications, and even as fuels or fuel additives are conceivable. The conversion of isosorbide to valuable derivatives by functionalization or substitution of the hydroxyl groups is difficult because of the different configurations of the 2- and 5-positions and the resulting different reactivity and steric hindrance of the two hydroxyl groups. Although a substantial amount of work has been published using exclusively the endo or exo derivatives isomannide and isoidide, respectively, as starting material, a considerable effort is still necessary to transfer and adapt these methods for the efficient conversion of isosorbide. This Minireview deals with all aspects of isosorbide chemistry, which includes its production by catalytic processes, special properties, and chemical transformations for its utilization in biogenic polymers and other applications of interest. Unwritten tales of isosorbide: Isosorbide is a versatile platform chemical that can be derived from cellulosic biomass as a sustainable resource. Numerous derivatives can be obtained by using various chemical, chemocatalytic, and biotechnological processes to enable the replacement of products in numerous applications that are currently based on fossil resources.

AB  - Catalytic hydrotreatment or hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been researched extensively with the crude bio-oil and its model compounds over conventional sulfided Ni(Mo), Co(Mo) catalysts and supported noble metal catalysts. These types of catalysts showed themselves unsuitable for the target HDO process, which resulted in an urgent need to search for a new catalytic system meeting such requirements as low cost, stability against coke formation and leaching of active components due to adverse effect of the acidic medium (bio-oil). In the present work a series of Ni-based catalysts with different stabilizing components has been tested in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol), bio-oil model compound. The process has been carried out in an autoclave at 320°C and 17MPa H 2. The main products were cyclohexane, 1-methylcyclohexane-1,2-diol, and cyclohexanone. The reaction scheme of guaiacol conversion explaining the formation of main products has been suggested. The catalyst activity was found to rise with an increase in the active component loading and depend on the catalyst preparation method. The most active catalysts in HDO of guaiacol were Ni-based catalysts prepared by a sol-gel method and stabilized with SiO 2 and ZrO 2. According to TPR, XRD, XPS, and HRTEM, the high activity of these catalysts correlates with the high nickel loading and the high specific area of active component provided by the formation of nickel oxide-silicate species. The effect of temperature on the product distribution and catalyst activity in the target process (HDO) has been investigated as well. The catalysts were shown to be very promising systems for the production of hydrocarbon fuels by the catalytic upgrading of bio-oil. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report a simple electrochemical approach for the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) on reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The immobilization of GOx was achieved in a single step without any cross linking agents or modifiers. A simple solution phase approach was used to prepare exfoliated graphene oxide (GO), followed by electrochemical reduction to get RGO-GOx biocomposite. The direct electrochemistry of GOx was revealed at the RGO-GOx modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electrocatalytic and electroanalytical applications of the proposed film were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometry. It is notable that the glucose determination has been achieved in mediator-free conditions. RGO-GOx film showed very good stability, reproducibility and high selectivity. The developed biosensor exhibits excellent catalytic activity towards glucose over a wide linear range of 0.1-27mM with a sensitivity of 1.85μAmM-1cm-2. The facile and easy electrochemical approach used for the preparation of RGO-GOx may open up new horizons in the production of cost-effective biosensors and biofuel cells. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Thermochemical conversion is a promising route for recovering energy from algal biomass. Two thermochemical processes, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL: 300 °C and 10-12. MPa) and slow pyrolysis (heated to 450 °C at a rate of 50 °C/min), were used to produce bio-oils from Scenedesmus (raw and defatted) and Spirulina biomass that were compared against Illinois shale oil. Although both thermochemical conversion routes produced energy dense bio-oil (35-37. MJ/kg) that approached shale oil (41. MJ/kg), bio-oil yields (24-45%) and physico-chemical characteristics were highly influenced by conversion route and feedstock selection. Sharp differences were observed in the mean bio-oil molecular weight (pyrolysis 280-360. Da; HTL 700-1330. Da) and the percentage of low boiling compounds (bp < 400 °C) (pyrolysis 62-66%; HTL 45-54%). Analysis of the energy consumption ratio (ECR) also revealed that for wet algal biomass (80% moisture content), HTL is more favorable (ECR 0.44-0.63) than pyrolysis (ECR 0.92-1.24) due to required water volatilization in the latter technique. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Two major considerations of the emerging algae biofuel industry are the energy intensive dewatering of the algae slurry and nutrient management. The proposed closed loop process which involves nutrient recycling of the aqueous phase from the hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae offers a solution to both aspects. Hydrothermal liquefaction has been shown to be a low energy process for bio-crude production from microalgae. For the purpose of this research, microalgae strains of . Chlorella vulgaris, . Scenedesmus dimorphus and the cyanobacteria . Spirulina platensis and . Chlorogloeopsis fritschii were processed in batch reactors at 300. °C and 350. °C. Following liquefaction the product phases were separated and the water phase recovered. The bio-crude yields ranged from 27 to 47. wt.%. The bio-crudes were of low O and N content and high heating value making them suitable for further processing. The water phase was analysed for all major nutrients, TOC and TN to determine the suitability of the recycled aqueous phase for algae cultivation. Growth trials were performed for each algae strain in a standard growth medium and compared to the growth rates in a series of dilutions of the recycled process water phase. Growth was determined by cell count and . chlorophyll a absorbance. Growth occurred in heavy dilutions where the amount of growth inhibitors was not too high. The results show that the closed loop system using the recovered aqueous phase offers a promising route for sustainable oil production and nutrient management for microalgae. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis is a promising thermochemical conversion route for lignocellulosic biomass that produces chemicals and fuels compatible with current, petrochemical infrastructure. Catalytic modifications to pyrolysis bio-oils are geared towards the elimination and substitution of oxygen and oxygen-containing functionalities in addition to increasing the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the final products. Recent progress has focused on both hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation of bio-oil using a variety of metal catalysts and the production of aromatics from bio-oil using cracking zeolites. Research is currently focused on developing multi-functional catalysts used in situ that benefit from the advantages of both hydrodeoxygenation and zeolite cracking. Development of robust, highly selective catalysts will help achieve the goal of producing drop-in fuels and petrochemical commodities from wood and other lignocellulosic biomass streams. The current paper will examine these developments by means of a review of existing literature. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microalgae are considered as the most promising renewable feedstock for biofuel production and biorefineries, due to their advantages of fast growth, efficient carbon dioxide fixation, not competing for arable lands and potable water, and potentially accumulating high amounts of lipids and carbohydrates. Since carbohydrates in microalgae biomass are mainly cellulose in the cell wall and starch in the plastids without lignin and low hemicelluloses contents, they can be readily converted into fermentable sugars. However, to date there are very few studies focusing on the use of microalgae-based carbohydrates for biofuel production, which requires more understanding and knowledge to support the technical feasibility of this next-generation feedstock. This review article elucidates comprehensive information on the characteristics and metabolism of main fermentable microalgal carbohydrates (e.g., starch and cellulose), as well as the key factors and challenges that should be addressed during production and saccharification of microalgal carbohydrates. Furthermore, developments on the utilization of microalgae-based feedstock in producing liquid and gaseous biofuels are summarized. The objective of this article is to provide useful knowledge and information with regard to biochemistry, bioprocess engineering, and commercial applications to assist in the viable technology development of for biofuels generation from microalgae-based carbohydrates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dwindling fossil resources, surging energy demand and global warming stimulate growing demand for renewable polymer products with low carbon footprint. Going well beyond the limited scope of natural polymers, biomass conversion in biorefineries and chemical carbon dioxide fixation are teamed up with highly effective tailoring, processing and recycling of polymers. "Green monomers" from biorefineries, and "renewable oil", gained from plastics' and bio wastes, render synthetic polymers renewable without impairing their property profiles and recycling. In context of biofuel production, limitations of the green economy concepts are clearly visible. Dreams and reality of "green polymers" are highlighted. Regardless of their new greenish touch, highly versatile and cost-effective polymers play an essential role in sustainable development. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - We have developed Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets modified glassy carbon (Fe3O4/r-GO/GC) electrode as a novel system for the preparation of electrochemical sensing platform. Decorating Fe3O4 nanoparticles on graphene sheets was performed via a facile one-step chemical reaction strategy, where the reduction of GO and the in-situ generation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles occurred simultaneously. Characterization of as-made nanocomposite using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and alternative gradient force magnetometry (AGFM) clearly demonstrate the successful attachment of monodisperse Fe3O4 nanoparticles to graphene sheets. Electrochemical studies revealed that the Fe3O4/r-GO/GC electrode possess excellent electrocatalytic activities toward the low potential oxidation of NADH (0.05V vs. Ag/AgCl) as well as the catalytic reduction of O2 and H2O2 at reduced overpotentials. Via immobilization of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a model dehydrogenase enzyme onto the Fe3O4/r-GO/GC electrode surface, the ability of modified electrode for biosensing lactate was demonstrated. In addition, using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) to investigate the electrochemical oxidation behavior of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA) at Fe3O4/r-GO/GC electrode, the high electrocatalytic activity of the modified electrode toward simultaneous detection of these compounds was indicated. Finally, based on the strong electrocatalytic action of Fe3O4/r-GO/GC electrode toward both oxidation and reduction of nitrite, a sensitive amperometric sensor for nitrite determination was proposed. The Fe3O4/r-GO hybrid presented here showing favorable electrochemical features may hold great promise to the development of electrochemical sensors, molecular bioelectronic devices, biosensors and biofuel cells. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report a catalyst made of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) supported on mesoporous N-doped carbon, Pd@CN0132, which was shown to be highly active in promoting biomass refining. The use of a task-specific ionic liquid (3-methyl-1-butylpyridine dicyanamide) as a precursor and silica NPs as a hard template afforded a high-nitrogen-content (12 wt %) mesoporous carbon material that showed high activity in stabilizing Pd NPs. The resulting Pd@CN 0.132 catalyst showed very high catalytic activity in hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin (a typical model compound of lignin) at low H2 pressure under mild conditions in aqueous media. Excellent catalytic results (100% conversion of vanillin and 100% selectivity for 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) were achieved, and no loss of catalytic activity was observed after six recycles. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Among the various types of biomass, microalgae have the potential of becoming a significant energy source for biofuel production in the coming years. Currently, research is mainly focusing on optimization of the cultivation methods and the conversion of just a single microalgae fraction (lipids for biodiesel production). Hydrothermal liquefaction is a method for thermochemical conversion of wet microalgae, producing a liquid energy carrier called 'bio-oil' or 'biocrude', next to gaseous, aqueous and solid by-products. A review of the available literature is presented here, analyzing the influence of parameters such as temperature, holding time and catalyst dosage on the yield and properties of the different product fractions. Also, the strain selection and the status of the technology for hydrothermal processes are analyzed. Finally, based on the findings obtained from the literature review, directions for future research are suggested. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Research interest in biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals has increased significantly in the last decade as the necessity for a renewable source of carbon has become more evident. Accordingly, many different reactions and processes to convert biomass into high-value products and fuels have been proposed in the literature. Special attention has been given to the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, which does not compete with food sources and is widely available as a low cost feedstock. In this review, we start with a brief introduction on lignocellulose and the different chemical structures of its components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These three components allow for the production of different chemicals after fractionation. After a brief overview of the main reactions involved in biomass conversion, we focus on those where bimetallic catalysts are playing an important role. Although the reactions are similar for cellulose and hemicellulose, which contain C6and C5sugars, respectively, different products are obtained, and therefore, they have been reviewed separately. The third major fraction of lignocellulose that we address is lignin, which has significant challenges to overcome, as its structure makes catalytic processing more challenging. Bimetallic catalysts offer the possibility of enabling lignocellulosic processing to become a larger part of the biofuels and renewable chemical industry. This review summarizes recent results published in the literature for biomass upgrading reactions using bimetallic catalysts. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This critical review provides a survey illustrated by recent references of different strategies to achieve a sustainable conversion of biomass to bioproducts. Because of the huge number of chemical products that can be potentially manufactured, a selection of starting materials and targeted chemicals has been done. Also, thermochemical conversion processes such as biomass pyrolysis or gasification as well as the synthesis of biofuels were not considered. The synthesis of chemicals by conversion of platform molecules obtained by depolymerisation and fermentation of biopolymers is presently the most widely envisioned approach. Successful catalytic conversion of these building blocks into intermediates, specialties and fine chemicals will be examined. However, the platform molecule value chain is in competition with well-optimised, cost-effective synthesis routes from fossil resources to produce chemicals that have already a market. The literature covering alternative value chains whereby biopolymers are converted in one or few steps to functional materials will be analysed. This approach which does not require the use of isolated, pure chemicals is well adapted to produce high tonnage products, such as paper additives, paints, resins, foams, surfactants, lubricants, and plasticisers. Another objective of the review was to examine critically the green character of conversion processes because using renewables as raw materials does not exempt from abiding by green chemistry principles (368 references). © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper provides an updated review on fast pyrolysis of biomass for production of a liquid usually referred to as bio-oil. The technology of fast pyrolysis is described including the major reaction systems. The primary liquid product is characterised by reference to the many properties that impact on its use. These properties have caused increasingly extensive research to be undertaken to address properties that need modification and this area is reviewed in terms of physical, catalytic and chemical upgrading. Of particular note is the increasing diversity of methods and catalysts and particularly the complexity and sophistication of multi-functional catalyst systems. It is also important to see more companies involved in this technology area and increased take-up of evolving upgrading processes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
