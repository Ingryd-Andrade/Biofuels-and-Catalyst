AB  - The fresh corn stalks were pretreated by acid modified treatment and fermentation modified treatment and then directly liquefied in a batch autoclave with high temperature and high pressure. The change of the micro- fabric features and functional groups were analyzed. The yield and compounds of biofuels were examined. The results showed the structure of lignocellulose in corn stalks was be destroyed by the acid treatment and fermentation treatment, but functional groups were changed little. All the modified treatments could enhance the biofuels yield and conversion yield, while the fermentation treatment was best for them. With the fermentation treatment, the biofuels yield and conversion yield were increased to 39.95% and 86.61%, respectively. The content of six compounds with their relative content >4% was 54.84% in total. © 2016, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica. All right reserved.

AB  - Sustainable energy management has become a high priority in Nigeria, as well as in many countries around the world. The majority of our energy stock comes from non-renewable fossil fuels, which are currently dwindling. Biofuels are one of the most promising solutions being researched to address this urgent problem. In particular, using transesterified Hura crepitans seed oil appears to be a promising method of producing biofuels, due to the availability of Hura crepitans trees in Nigeria, and the fact that it does not compete with food crops. The use of a polymer catalyst makes the separation and purification of the final product steps easier than catalysis in homogeneous conditions, but the high incidence of free fatty acid (FFA) in Hura crepitans seed oil shows the need for a 2-step transesterification process. Thus, this study investigated the transesterification of Hura crepitans seed oil using a methanol and polymer based catalyst. This study was achieved with a methanol/oil molar ratio of 3:1, 0.15 % catalyst (w/wt), 50 °C reaction temperature, for 1hr reaction times, resulting in an 82 % fatty acid methyl ester yield, a 0.520 mgKOH/g acid value, and a 235, 9 and −5 °C, flash point, cloud point, and pour point, respectively. The result further reveals a 912.40 kg/m3 density, a 4.75 Cst kinematic viscosity, 0.021 mass% free glycerin, 0.280 mass% free glycerin, and 0.280 mass% total glycerin. © 2016, Walailak University.

AB  - Conversion of biomass to high-value products by pyrolysis is a significant development direction for biomass utilization. As a promising thermochemical conversion technology of biomass, biomass pyrolysis can obtain the bio-char, bio-oil and higher heating value gas product. By introducing the exogenous nitrogen into the biomass pyrolysis process to form nitrogen-enriched pyrolysis, high-value products can be potentially generated. In this study, NH3 was chosen as the exogenous nitrogen. The influence of pyrolysis temperature on the properties of sawdust and corn stalk pyrolysis product was investigated. Furthermore, the forming mechanism of nitrogen-contained compounds was analyzed. Products' characteristics were investigated with variant approaches, such as chromatography-mass spectroscopy(7890A/5975C, Agilent, America), ultimate analysis(Vario Micro cube, Germany), diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(Vertex 70, Bruker, Germany), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(Axis ultra DLD, Kratos, United Kingdom). The results indicated that, with pyrolysis temperature increasing, the yield of the bio-char derived from sawdust and corn stalk decreased significantly, while the trend of gas products' yield turned out to be the opposite. The bio-oil yield increased firstly and then decreased, reaching the maximum(48.7% and 42.7% for sawdust and corn stalk, respectively) at 550℃. Bio-oil contained a lot of amine compounds(methylamines, propylamines and trace amides) and nitrogen-contained heterocyclic compounds(pyrroles, piperidines and trace morpholines) and a few nitriles(acetonitriles and propionitriles). The contents of amine compounds, nitrogen-contained heterocyclic compounds and nitriles were 50%-80%, 10%-20% and lower than 10%, respectively. With the temperature increasing, the content of amine compounds increased due to the fact that NH3 reacted with biomass at high temperature leading to the formation of NH2, NH and H free radicals, which were then combined with pyrolysis volatiles to generate amine compounds more easily. However, nitrogen-contained heterocyclic compounds and nitriles began to decompose and converse, and hence their contents declined to varying degrees. With the pyrolysis temperature increasing, the content of nitrogen and carbon of the bio-chars increased obviously while the oxygen content decreased significantly. The highest nitrogen contents of the bio-chars from sawdust and corn stalk were 4.08% and 3.92%, respectively. The surface of bio-char contained a lot of nitrogen-contained functional groups, such as pyridine C=N, N-COO, C-N and N-H at 350℃, which could be derived from the reaction of NH3 with the carbon skeleton. The intensities of pyridine C=N, N-COO and C-N increased obviously at 550℃. After 750℃, none of nitrogen-contained functional groups could be detected. Pyridinic-N, amide-N and pyrrolic/pyridine-N were the main existing forms of nitrogen-contained functional groups on the surface of bio-char. At lower temperature (350℃), amide-N and pyrrolic/pyridine-N were the main nitrogen-contained functional groups. With the temperature increasing, the content of amide-N decreased dramatically, while the content of pyridinic-N increased significantly. At higher temperature (750-850℃), only pyridinic-N and pyrrolic/pyridine-N existed, indicating that amide-N was not stable and easy to convert to the more stable pyridinic-N and pyrrolic/pyridine-N. In conclusion, nitrogen-contained bio-oil and nitrogen-doped bio-char are produced by biomass nitrogen-enriched pyrolysis, and the bio-oil contains numerous high-value chemicals. However, the detailed forming mechanisms of nitrogen-contained products need to be further researched. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Specific culture media are used for lipolytic fungi and bacteria growth. It is possible that more complex culture media, used for plant tissue culture, allows a higher expression of fungi and bacteria growth. The aim was to evaluate the effect of the addition of vegetable oil in different culture media for micropropagation, on growth of fungi and bacteria from soil samples. Ten soil samples from different sites in Chiapas, two types of culture media (MS con 1.48 mg/LTDZ y 1 mg/LAIB; Yasuda con 1.25 mg/LKIN y 1 mg/LAIB) and the presence or absence of olive oil (1 %) in the culture media were evaluated. Expression of fungi and bacteria was significantly affected by at least two factors evaluated. The factor soil sample led fungal expression percentages from 47.5 to 100 %, while in bacteria was from 95 to 100 %. The presence of olive oil favored fungal expression (94.5 %). Both culture media allowed the growth of microorganisms. The factor vegetable oil promoted 94.5 % of fungi expression and 99.5 % of bacteria. It was found more diversity on fungi expression compared to bacteria. Differences in microorganisms growth were mainly due to the soil sample. © 2016 Universidad Autonoma de Tlaxcala.

AB  - The microwave-assisted pyrolysis of cotton stalk was researched to investigate the influence of microwave power and additive on the product yields. Pyrolysis temperature curves were analyzed. The results showed that the higher microwave power would lead to the higher final temperature and heating rate. When microwave power raised from 800 W to 1200 W, the solid residue yield decreased and gas yield increased, but the maximum bio-oil yield of 26.7% was gained under the microwave power of 1000 W. CaO made the yield gas yield increase, MgCl2 made the bio-oil yield rise, Na2CO3 made the yields of solid residue and gas increase.

AB  - We report studies into the effects of electrolyte membrane characteristics on power generation in glucose fuel cells. Commercially available perfluo-rosulfonate ionomer membranes of various thicknesses were characterized by quantitatively measuring and analyzing electrical power generation. Characterization suggested that thinner Nafion® membranes could lead to improved performance (higher peak power, lower ohmic loss, and lower activation loss) over thicker membranes, however extremely thin membranes gave low performance due to their lack of stability, stemming from fabrication failure. The dependency on fuel concentration was also identified and a glucose concentration of 1 M gave the best performance. Finally, the prepared ion-exchange polymer composite membrane (formed by sorbing a Nafion® membrane into a polycarbonate track-etched (PCTE) membrane) was tested, and it was observed that cell performance was remarkably improved when membrane porosity was considered quantitatively. Our study is expected to be useful in the design of biofuel cells that can be utilized in low-concentration environments, such as living or-ganisms. © 2016, The Korean BioChip Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The results showed that the deposition of coke precursor on catalyst surface is mainly lowboiling point of saturated hydrocarbon compounds and the coke precursor of internal channels of deactivated catalyst is major aromatic hydrocarbon compounds. The coke precursor is in an amorphous state,which was highly dispersed on the catalyst surface or into the catalyst micropore.

AB  - In this article, the shrub residues as raw materials were produced to fast pyrolysis oil (called bio-oil) in a 5-kg/h fluidized-bed reactor. The optimum conditions were obtained at 500°C, flow rate of fluidizing gas of 4 m3/h, and feed rate of 3 kg/h. The liquid yield was up to 60% at the optimum conditions. The bio-oil was easy to divide into two phases: oil phase and aqueous phase. The high heat value of the oil phase was up to 18.55 MJ/kg, but the high heat value of the aqueous phase was only 0.72 MJ/kg. The oil phase and aqueous phase both have lower pH values. The oxygen content was up to 50%, while the sulfur and nitrogen content were very low. Owing to the higher oxygen content and lower pH value in liquid products, it must be further upgraded to bio-oil before application. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Phosphotungstic acid is an efficient, green and highly acidic heterogeneous catalyst. Different from other solid heteropholy acids, phosphotungstic acid is dissoluble in alcohols. This research makes the best use of the physicochemical properties of phosphotungstic acid combining with high solubility of supercritical alcohols. Sawdust was liquefied in the supercritical solvent using phosphotungstic acid as catalyst. The effects of different solvents on the solvolysis liquefaction and the compositions of bio-oil were investigated. Each solvolysis experiment was conducted at 260℃ for 30 min in a stainless-steel autoclave, in which 1 g of fir sawdust, 0.5 g of phosphotungsic acid, 150 g of alcohol (such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or iso-propanol) were added. The liquefaction products were separated by filtration after quenching the reaction. Then, the filtrate was extracted with n-hexane and separated into light bio-oil and heavy bio-oil after removing the solvent. Simultaneously, the residue, heavy bio-oil and light bio-oil were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Agilent 7890A/5975C gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results show that the reaction pressure and polarity of alcoholic solvents significantly impact the liquefaction efficiency and liquefaction products. The liquefaction yield using methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and iso-propanol is 54.75%, 90.29%, 85.90% and 89.15%, respectively, while the relative content of main compound esters in liquefaction products is 43.759%, 23.531%, 41.761% and 28.619%, respectively. Especially, the relative content of methyl levulinate in methanol system is 33.374%. The main compounds in liquefaction products using methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol as solvent are esters and phenols, while n-propanol system are esters, ketones and alcohols. Meanwhile, levulinate erster, which is produced through the reaction of cellulose/hemicellulose and alcohols, is detected in the liquefaction products of all four solvents. Phenols is determined in the liquefaction products in iso-propanol system with relative content of 24.342%. The aldehyde compounds only exist in methanol system. The absence of phenols in n-propanol system indicates that its weakest polarity provides less hydrogen radical and may lead to difficult degradation of lignin. © 2016, Science Press.

AB  - The Ni-W/SSY catalyst prepared by incipient impregnation using a super steady Y (SSY) zeolite was used to produce biofuels mainly composed of bio-kerosene and bio-gasoline from bio-C16 and C18 n-alkanes by hydrocracking in which the kerosene yield can be improved. The catalyst was characterized by nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the continuous hydrogenation on a micro fixed bed cracking reactor, the effect of reaction conditions on the one-through conversion and the mass ratio of kerosene to gasoline were studied. The results indicated that the single pass conversion of n-alkanes exceeded 60% and the mass ratio of kerosene to gasoline exceeded 2.0 when the reaction was carried out at 255℃, 1.0 MPa, space velocity (WHSV) 0.33 h-1 and hydrogen-oil ratio of 4 000: 1. With its high catalytic activity, Ni-W/SSY can be used to produce kerosene based liquid fuels using long-chain alkanes as raw materials. © 2016, Editorial Board of Journal of Chemical Reaction Engineering and Technology.

AB  - The prospects of biofuel production from microalgal carbohydrates and lipids coupled with greenhouse gas mitigation due to photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 have ushered in a renewed interest in algal feedstock. Furthermore, microalgae (including cyanobacteria) have become established as commercial sources of value-added biochemicals such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoid pigments used as antioxidants in nutritional supplements and cosmetics. This article presents a comprehensive synopsis of the metabolic basis for accumulating lipids as well as applicable methods of lipid and cellulose bioconversion and final applications of these natural or refined products from microalgal biomass. For lipids, one-step in situ transesterification offers a new and more accurate approach to quantify oil content. As a complement to microalgal oil fractions, the utilization of cellulosic biomass from microalgae to produce bioethanol by fermentation, biogas by anaerobic digestion, and bio-oil by hydrothermal liquefaction are discussed. Collectively, a compendium of information spanning green renewable fuels and value-added nutritional compounds is provided. © 2016. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis experiments were conducted to investigate the possibility of obtaining valuable chemicals from Pinus densiflora, a native Korean tree species occupying 21.4% of the total area under forests in South Korea. Two representative mesoporous catalysts, Al-MCM-41 and Al-MSU-F, as well as hierarchical mesoporous MFI (Meso-MFI) that has both mesopores and micropores, were used as catalysts. Compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis was shown to reduce the fractions of levoglucosan, phenolics, and acids in bio-oil, while increasing the fractions of aromatics, PAHs, and furans. Meso-MFI with strong acid sites showed a high selectivity toward aromatics and PAHs, whereas Al-MCM-41 and Al-MSU-F with weak acid sites exhibited a high selectivity toward furanic compounds. The results of this study indicate that choosing a catalyst with an adequate quantity of acidic sites with the required strength is critical for enhancing the production of desired chemicals from Pinus densiflora.

AB  - To investigate the influence of oxidative pretreatment on the following esterification, oxidative pretreatment and esterification are tested by using the bio-oil model compounds. Furfural, acetic acid, acetone and ethyl alcohol are chosen to constitute the bio-oil model compound. H2O2 and ozone are used as the oxidizer in oxidative pretreatment. The influences of the oxidative reaction time (0 to 2 h), the amount of H2O2 (20 to 60 mL) and the oxidizer type on both the efficiencies of oxidative pretreatment and the following esterification are investigated by acid values, gas chronatography-mass spectrometer (GCMS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results show that adding more H2O2 in oxidation can improve the effect of oxidation pretreatment, but by a small amount. Oxidative pretreatment combining ozone and H2O2 is an optimal oxidative method among different oxidative pretreatments. Compared with the esterification rate of 7.8% of bio-oil model compounds without oxidative pretreatment, the esterification rate is increased to no less than 24.9% by using the selected oxidative method. The oxidative pretreatment before esterification can effectively enhance the effect of the esterification. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Southeast University. All right reserved.

AB  - The vegetable oil was treated by hydroisodewaxing process to convert large molecule hydrocarbons into small molecule hydrocarbons in fuel oil production. The results of the tests on hydroisodewaxing with vegetable oil as feedstock demonstrated that, when 3# jet fuel was produced, only distillates of low FBP and narrow distillate could be cut. Hydroisodewaxing could help reduce diesel freezing point but would cause the loss of cetane number. However, the diesel cetane number was still over 80 after hydroisodewaxing. After hydroisodewaxing, part of jet fuel blending components could be produced and diesel freezing point was about + 10 °C, which was the good diesel blending components.

AB  - The ionic liquid 3-methylimidazolium hydrogensulfate is soluble within the glycerol phase that it creates, after catalyzing the transesterification of sunflower oil to fatty acids methyl esters with methanol. Separation of this phase and addition of acetone allow the production of the 5-membered ketal 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxylane-4-yl-methanol, in which the catalyst is insoluble and is removed by decantation. After drying under vacuum, the ionic liquid is ready to rerun to the two-stage cycle with no apparent loss of activity. © 2016 Atlantis Livros Ltda. All rights reserved.

AB  - The depletion of fossil energy resources and the increased energy consumption led to the intensification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Consequently, the investigation for renewable energy sources has focused on biofuels, aiming to the improvement of the energy security supply. Biofuels are considered alternative fuels targeting to reduce the transportation sector’s dependency on fossil resources and GHG emissions. However, the production of FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) biodiesel via transesterification of vegetable oils, raised significant issues e.g. food versus fuel debate. Catalytic hydrotreatment constitutes an alternative conversion process of vegetable oils and/or animal fats into bio-based diesel fuels and has been applied in industrial scale for the production of hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVOs). Residual biomass such as waste cooking oil (WCO) has been extensively explored as potential feedstock for renewable diesel production via catalytic hydrotreatment in CPERI/CERTH. However, considering the high investment cost of hydroprocessing units of vegetable and/or waste oils, the option of co-processing petroleum fractions with oils has recently started being investigated. More specifically, co-hydroprocessing of petroleum fractions with WCO was also examined in CPERI/CERTH, resulting in the production of a new hybrid diesel. Nevertheless, the production of renewable fuels also has environmental impacts that should be evaluated via Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in order to identify the most sustainable fuels. This LCA study compares the environmental performance of the renewable diesel and the hybrid diesel produced via WCO hydrotreatment and co-hydroprocessing petroleum fractions with WCO, respectively. In addition, accounting for the fact that the renewable diesel could be potentially used as a blending component of fossil diesel (in blends up to 7 % v/v) its sustainability assessment was also taken into account. Another scope of this study was to compare the environmental impacts of the aforementioned fuels and the fossil diesel (containing 7 % v/v FAME biodiesel), in order to identify the potentially most environmentally friendly fuel/fuels. The comparison was based on a Well-To-Tank analysis (WTT) including only the production processes of all fuels considered. The LCA results showed that the hybrid diesel presented the most favorable environmental profile. Moreover, the sustainability of the renewable diesel and the hybrid diesel are higher as compared to the fossil diesel. Nevertheless, by comparing the GHG emissions of the blend of the renewable diesel with fossil diesel, with other HVOs its environmental superiority was also evident. The finding of this study highlight that the hybrid diesel produced via co-hydroprocessing petroleum fractions with WCO presented the optimal environmental performance with respect to all the fuels production systems examined, validating its sustainability superiority, promoting also the incorporation of residual biomass in the refinery. Consequently, the integration of WCO in the refining via the co-processing technology supports the production of bio-based sustainable fuels compared to stand-alone biomass conversion technologies. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - In the search for alternatives to fossil fuels, diverse technologies for the production of biofuels have been developed. Among them is biodiesel, which can be obtained from oil seeds or oil residues generated from agriculture, livestock and urban activities. With the approval in 2001 of Act-693 “Uses of Alcohol Fuels”, Colombia began the era of biofuels and currently has nine biodiesel production plants from palm oil. In the case of Mexico, in 2008 the Law on Promotion and Development of Bioenergetics was enacted. This laid the foundation for the production of biodiesel on an industrial level nationally. In Mexico, six biodiesel plants were installed in the states of Chiapas, Michoacán and Nuevo León capable of processing, Jatropha Curcas L., palm oil, castor oil, waste vegetable oil and animal tallow. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to show a comparative analysis of the development of the biodiesel industry in Colombia and Mexico, considering the use of waste. According to the results, the biodiesel production in Colombia is based on a technology that processes palm which generates waste. The latter is used as an energy source in other processes. The use of waste for biodiesel is under investigation. In Mexico, the technologies of the plants were designed to process waste and oil seeds.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the status of policy design and policy implementation in the biofuel sector in Ireland. The focus of the work addresses the overarching operational context of the biofuel sector in Ireland and the role of different actors in shaping and resolving inconsistencies in policy outlook and practice. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a qualitative research approach involving a series of semi-structured interviews with members of the relevant sub-groups concerned. This study sought to address two questions – whether current or proposed policy is likely to affect consumption of indigenous biofuel feedstocks in the biofuel sector and what are the controlling factors in the demand for indigenous feedstocks for biofuel. Findings: Outcomes suggest that while Irish government policy recognises the need to support the development of renewable energy, it also operates under a number of parallel and potentially inconsistent paradigms in relation to biofuels as a renewable energy commodity. It is contended that the outcome of this position is a lack of coherent and coordinated policy in the area of biofuel production, including second generation biofuel using indigenous feedstocks. Originality/value: This paper provides a new cross sectoral perspective on the status of biofuel policy in Ireland with particular reference to second generation biofuel feedstocks. It focuses analysis on the nature of policy-operational inconsistencies and the need for a deeper ecological perspective in governance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The unstable and unsure handiness of crude oil sources moreover the rising price of fuels have shifted international efforts to utilize renewable resources for the assembly of greener energy and a replacement which might additionally meet the high energy demand of the globe. Biofuels represent a sustainable, renewable, and also the solely predictable energy supply to fossil fuels. During the green production of Biofuels, several in vivo processes place confidence in the conversion of biomass to sugars by engineered enzymes, and the subsequent conversion of sugars to chemicals via designed proteins in microbial production hosts. Enzymes are indispensable within the effort to provide fuels in an ecologically friendly manner. They have the potential to catalyze reactions with high specificity and potency while not using dangerous chemicals. Nature provides an in depth assortment of enzymes, however usually these should be altered to perform desired functions in needed conditions. Presently available enzymes like cellulose are subject to tight induction and regulation systems and additionally suffer inhibition from numerous end products. Therefore, more impregnable and economical catalyst preparations ought to be developed for the enzymatic method to be more economical. Approaches like protein engineering, reconstitution of protein mixtures and bio prospecting for superior enzymes are gaining importance. Advances in enzyme engineering allow the planning and/or directed evolution of enzymes specifically tailored for such industrial applications. Recent years have seen the production of improved enzymes to help with the conversion of biomass into fuels. The assembly of the many of those fuels is feasible due to advances in protein engineering. This review discusses the distinctive challenges that protein engineering faces in the method of changing lignocellulose to biofuels and the way they're addressed by recent advances in this field. © Applied Science Innovations Pvt.

AB  - Plant oils or triglycerides are converted through the trans-esterification reaction with methanol and base catalyst to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) or Biodiesel. Production of biodiesel from plant oil is a renewable, sustainable and alternative of petroleum based fuel. Algae oil (AO) from macroalgae has the potential to become a sustainable fuel source as biodiesel. The lipid contents or oil in algae, once extracted and purified, represent an excellent sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Ulva Lactucaspecies of macroalgae were used for algal oil extraction in this study. The AO was extracted by chemical extraction method. The transesterification reaction of AO with methanol and base catalyst was used for the production of biodiesel. In engine performance test, it showed slight increase in specific fuel consumption but biodiesel blends showed higher brake power. The emission of CO, HC and NOx reduced as biodiesel blend percentage increased over engine speed range. © Research India Publications.

AB  - This paper presents a process to utilize oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) by thermochemical conversion to produce carbon-infiltrated biochar, which can be used as an efficient alternative energy source. An integrated process of pyrolysis and decomposition of pyrolysis vapor was employed by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process. For preparation, raw EFB was made into highly porous biochar by slow pyrolysis process at 500-800°C to provide active sites for decomposition of pyrolysis vapor. In the general fast pyrolysis process of EFB, the main pyrolysis vapor product will undergo a secondary decomposition to produce secondary char and gases. In this study, this secondary decomposition is of interest. Fast pyrolysis of EFB was carried out at 400, 450 and 500°C to produce pyrolysis vapor to be infiltrated within the pores of biochar substrate and decomposed on its active sites. Secondary decomposition of pyrolysis vapor produced secondary char, where solid carbon was deposited within the porous biochar substrate, increasing the total carbon content of the resultant carbon-infiltrated biochar. This process was developed to produce a value-added EFB-derived biochar. One special application of this product is in steel industry, mainly in their sintering plants; as an efficient alternative energy source to partially substitute coke breeze. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - The amines are basic compounds present in the atmosphere that react with acidic species forming particulate matter. Are generated during combustion process and can impact the human health and ecosystems. The use of biodiesel as a biofuel added to diesel is growing and it is necessary to study the impact of their use on the environment. Four primary aliphatic amines were studied in the ambient air of a bus station where vehicles circulate using B5 mixture. The amines have been determined by HPLC/PDA after derivatization with phenyl isothiocyanate in basic medium. Methyl, ethyl and buthylamine have been quantified. In the gas phase the average concentrations were 86.2; 102 and 224 ng m-3 of methyl, ethyl and buthylamine, respectively. On the fine fraction (&lt; PM2.5) the average concentrations were 2.9; 10.0 and 6.87 ng m-3 of methyl, ethyl and buthylamine, respectively. We can infer that the gaseous amines are emitted directly from the B5 combustion process; methyl and ethylamine in the PM2.5 may be resulting from gasparticle conversion and buthylamine distinguished from the source or formation process.

AB  - First test diesel engines using blends with algal biodiesel are already carried out but still optimized. The purpose of microalgae growing is mainly for food and feed markets, but algal biofuel has much attention in recent years worldwide. Technical data about feasibility of cultivation system, lipids extraction and conversion into biodiesel are still limited. Potentials of microalgae have incentive the Egyptian scientists to conduct a preliminary economic assessment for 0.25 Million tons biodiesel production from microalgae grown in wastewater, which had a range of expected accuracy ±20%. Process units required have been sized. Total capital investment (TCI), total manufacturing cost (TMC), net profit, rate on return (ROR) and payback period were all calculated to be USD138134136, USD576517352, USD121584271, 88% and one year, respectively based on feedstock cost of USD400/ton and biodiesel selling price of USD2000/ton. As well, sensitivity and break-even analyses were evaluated on variations in feedstock cost, product prices and microalgae lipids content using ROR and payback time. Results recommended that for profitable algal biodiesel business, the biomass cost cannot be higher than USD530/ton, algal biodiesel price and biomass lipids content must be above USD1578/ton and 30% on dry basis, respectively. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

AB  - This study is to investigate a bio-fuel to replace diesel consumption. Bio-diesel from cotton seed oil (non – edible) prepared bytrans-esterification process and ethanol anhydrous are blendedin various proportions, the properties of the blends are determined as per the ASTM standards. Blends containing 5%, 15%, 25% of ethanol and rest biodiesel are tested in a diesel engine for the performance and emission characteristics at various loads. Results are compared with diesel as base fuel. From the results it is observed that the BTE of allthe blends are closer to diesel. BSFC and emissions of CO, HC and NOx emission for the blends are lesser than diesel. The study shows that using of these blends can replace diesel to a greater extent and also reduce the emission affecting the environment impact. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House. All right reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the variables affecting the in-situ transesterification via ultrasonic bath for Spirulina platensis microalgae species. The optimum conditions were the presence of co-solvent to algae oil mass ratio 3:1 v/w, catalyst percentage 100% to the oil weight and molar ratio of alcohol to algae oil mass 30:1 which gives 70% yield at room temperature for 30 minute. Scendismus species was subjected to one step transesterification via ultrasonic bath under the optimum conditions of Spirulina platensis and recorded 76% yield of fatty acid methyl ester. Chlorella species obtained from Alexandria University through MED algae project was subjected to two step transesterification via ultrasonic bath under the previous optimum conditions. Comparison between different methods of transesterification (extraction followed by transesterification process, direct transesterification process and direct transesterification via ultrasonic bath) was studied. The extraction and transesterification process resulted in higher ester yield than direct transesterification process either via ultrasonic bath or without. The GC analysis of crude biodiesel from Spirulina platensis, Scendismus species and Chlorella species showed that they are promising algal species for biodiesel production with high oxidation stability and high predicted cetane number due to high percentage of saturated fatty acid methyl ester (SFAME).

AB  - Pyrolysis of forestry residues produces bio-oil compounds and potentially employed in H2 production. This research is aimed to perform a kinetic study and obtain optimum reaction conditions (ORC) for the pyrolysis of the Mexican Pinus cooperi (PC) and Quercus sideroxyla (QS) forest species to obtain the maximum amount of volatile matter (condensable and non-condensable). Samples of forest biomass were crushed and sieved to 300 ≥ dp ≥ 400 μm and 600 ≥ dp ≥ 700 μm and evaluated in a reactor under a N2 flowrate at 50, 100 and 150 ml/min, and heating rates (β) of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 °C/min from 25 to 700 °C. Results show that ORC were: 300 ≥ dp ≥ 400 μm, 150 ml/min and β = 25 °C/min, for both species. Kinetic study of the pyrolysis shown an Ea = 153.6 kJ/mol for PC and 200.51 kJ/mol for QS, respectively and n = 1 for both species. Preliminary thermodynamic analysis of steam reforming and CO2 absorption (Na2ZrO3) of bio-oil resulted in a maximum of 98.57% hydrogen production. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Thespesia populnea oil was new source of biodiesel. Crude Thespesia populnea oil was used as feedstock for biodiesel production by alkali-catalyzed methanolysis. The reaction in the presence of NaOH as catalyst was carried out to investigate the optimum conditions and to study the effects of variables on the reaction. A methanol to oil ratio of 6:1, sodium methoxide catalyst concentration of 1.5%, mixing intensity of 250 rpm and reaction temperature of 60°C offered the best Thespesia populnea seed oil methyl esters (biodiesel) yield (92.6%). The methyl ester content under these optimum conditions was 92.6% w/w, and all of the measured properties of the Thespesia populnea biodiesel (TPME) met the international standards ASTM D 6751-02. The results reveal that all of the reaction variables in this study had positive effects on the reaction. The results of the present study indicated that TPME could be a potential alternative to petrodiesel © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Subcritical water is shown to be an efficient medium for the cellulose conversion process to produce polyols. A novel type of Ru-containing hyper-crosslinked polystyrene (HPS)-immobilized catalyst is suggested. Application of the catalyst containing 1% Ru can achieve a total yield of sorbitol and mannitol of about 50%; that is comparable with the results obtained in the presence of more complex and, therefore, more expensive catalytic systems. The influence of both the process conditions and the catalyst properties on the target product yield is studied. The hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose in subcritical water using Ru-containing HPS-immobilized catalysts can become a base for novel technologies of cellulose biomass conversion and production of raw materials for chemical synthesis and industrial production of second generation biofuels. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Conversion of biomass-derived syngas to ethanol has recently received significant attention because of strong demands for alternative and renewable energy sources; therefore glycerol has been suggested as promising raw material for obtaining ethanol in two consecutive steps. In this work, a thermodynamic study of glycerol dry reforming to produce syngas and subsequent ethanol production, as two-step process, was evaluated by means of the method of Gibbs free energy minimization. The effect of parameters such as reaction temperature, CO2/glycerol ratio (CGR), and pressure (P) on system performance was investigated. Reactions were simulated between 700-1,500 K and CGR range of 0-5, at 1 atm pressure. Calculations were performed with Aspen Plus 8.4, using Peng-Robinson thermodynamic method for properties estimation. Optimum conditions for syngas and ethanol production were determined, in order to prevent carbon deposition and methane formation. At temperatures above 900 K and CGR&lt;1, between 3 and 7 mole of H2/mole of glycerol can be generated. Results indicated that the addition of CO2 to the glycerol dry reforming reactor favored syngas and ethanol synthesis. The maximum yield obtained was 1 mole of ethanol per mole of glycerol at CGR≥2. Simulations indicate that temperature and CGR are essential factors for determining the process efficiency of the production of ethanol from syngas. These results suggest that glycerol wasted from biodiesel manufacturing should be useful as efficient raw material for syngas and ethanol production. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.

AB  - To study the energy efficiency and the economic performance of bio-oil upgrading method in supercritical ethanol, the process and its simulation model for the production of liquid fuels by biomass fast pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading in supercritical ethanol were established. On the base of the simulation, the system energy conversion efficiency and the fuel production cost were calculated and compared with the catalytic hydrogenation of biomass pyrolysis and cellulose-into-ethanol processes for liquid fuels. The effects of different factors on fuel production cost were also researched by the sensitivity analysis. Results show that fuel production cost is 6 052 RMB/t(216 RMB/GJ) slightly higher than that of catalytic hydrogenation process but significantly lower than that of cellulose-into-ethanol process. The bio-oil yield during the process of pyrolysis and the ethanol price have the greatest impact on fuel production cost, enhancing bio-oil yield and reducing the consumption of ethanol during the process of bio-oil upgrading can improve economic performance of the system. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Southeast University.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of biomass and upgrading techniques for the high chemical value bio-oil production have been investigated widely in recent decades. A variety of upgrading techniques are applied in industrial manufacture process, while the production efficiency and sustainability of those techniques have their own merits and demerits, which emphasizes the importance of the evaluation systems for those techniques. Several evaluation methods, such as energy analysis, exergy analysis, and emergy analysis, have been developed to evaluate the fast pyrolysis of biomass and upgrading techniques. Based on different emergy flows, the methods chosen for the thermodynamic analysis lead to various outcomes. All the input and output energies in an industrial production system are considered in energy analysis, while exergy analysis takes the additional available energy into account. In emergy analysis, all kinds of emergy flows are taken into consideration, including monetary flow, information flow and energy flow. Emergy analysis is derived from the viewpoint that the sun provides the energy for everything on the earth so it is reasonable to convert all kinds of energy to the solar energy. It is so efficient and comprehensive that it has been applied to evaluate the fast pyrolysis of biomass and upgrading techniques. Based on the input-output framework and emergy indices, with the consideration of environment elements, emergy analysis method was applied to comprehensively evaluate two schemes in this paper, achieving upgraded bio-oil from pinus sylvestris by fast pyrolysis and catalytic hydrogenation (Scheme I) and supercritical ethanol upgrading technique (Scheme II), respectively. Meanwhile, the effects of different schemes were compared from three aspects, including production efficiency, environmental support and sustainability. As the results indicated, Scheme II consumed less solar energy and enjoyed higher efficiency when the same amount of fuel was produced. For the input of economic emergy and total emergy, Scheme I were 4.58×1020 and 4.64×1020 sej/a while Scheme II were 5.82×1020 and 5.88×1020 sej/a respectively, which showed that Scheme I needed less economic emergy input and total emergy input by contrast with Scheme II. For the renewable ratio, Scheme I was 49.57 while Scheme II was 39.12, which showed that renewable emergy input occupied higher percent of the total emergy input in Scheme I. For the environment sustainable index, Scheme I was 0.99 while Scheme II was 0.65, which showed that Scheme I had less stress on the environment and got more support from it. In brief, Scheme I achieves larger renewable ratio, less environment stress, better sustainability and greater environmental support. The optimal direction for both Scheme I and Scheme II is to reduce the emergy input. Scheme I focuses on improving the efficiency of emergy conversion, while Scheme II emphasizes on adjusting the process to reduce the dependency on external support. Compared with the results of energy analysis and exergy analysis, Scheme II needs more total inputs and total energy consumptions, while Scheme I has higher exergy efficiency. Scheme I and Scheme II shared the same emergy yield ratio, which indicated emergy analysis could provide a more comprehensive and deeper evaluation. In sum, theoretical foundations on improving the integrated performance of fast pyrolysis of biomass and upgrading techniques for the bio-oil production are achieved in this paper. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Coupling of non-hydrodesulfurization process with bio-desulfurization process can bring benefits o to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel fuels. Under operating condition of 65 C and atmospheric-1-1 pressure, the sulfur content present in diesel fuel decreased from 766 μ g g to 7.14 μg g by non hydrodesulfurization process using persulfate as oxidizing agent. The non-hydrodesulfurization diesel fuel was used for bio-desulfurization technique using the Rhodocuccus sp and Methylomonas methanica separately. An experiment was conducted in two phase medium [non aqueous to aqueous ratio, 15:85 to 100:0 (i.e., 0-100% diesel)]. Microbial strains were observed to follow classic monod type growth kinetics under the present range of substrate maximum growth-1-1-3 rate (μ = 0.096 hr and 0.098 hr) and half saturation constant (max K = 71 and 77 mg dm) for s Rhodocuccus sp and Methylomonas methanica, respectively. This bio-desulfurization process was conducted in a trickle bed reactor under continuous mode that was coupled with non hydrodesulfurization unit. The sulfur content present after bio-desulfurization technique using-1-1 Rhodocuccus sp and Methylomonas methanica was 4.22 μg g and 4.06 μg g, respectively. This was equivalent to 99.93% sulfur removal and was 1.78 times better than Bharat IV norms. © 2016 Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - The catalytic pyrolysis of Cirsium arvense was performed with titania supported catalysts under the operating conditions of 500 °C, 40 °C/min heating rate, 100 mL/min N2 flow rate in a fixed bed reactor for biofuel production. The effect of catalysts on product yields was investigated. The amount of pyrolysis products (bio-char, bio-oil, gas) and the composition of the produced bio-oils were determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and elemental analysis (EA) techniques. Thistle bio-oils had lower O/C and H/C molar ratios compared to feedstock. The highest bio-char and bio-oil yields of 29.32 wt% and 36.71 wt% were obtained in the presence of Ce/TiO2 and Ni/TiO2 catalysts respectively. GC–MS identified 97 different compounds in the bio-oils obtained from thistle pyrolysis. 1H NMR analysis showed that the bio-oils contained ∼55–77% aliphatic and ∼6–19% aromatic structural units. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Incentives for energy policies and current environmental requirements motivate the search for alternative energy sources such as hydrogen gas. This paper aims at the production of hydrogen gas via electrolysis of formic acid using electrodes of 1008 carbon steel and Armco iron. Samples were done by experimental de-sign, and employed the techniques of optical microscopy, cathodic potentiodynamic polarization, open circuit potential and chronoamperometry. The results showed that the surface treatment of the electrodes with #320 grit SiC abrasive paper is effective when compared to the other treatments tested for the evolution of H2. The Armco iron, showed higher hydrogen production, on average 70% increased when compared with platinum in both studied media, however its lifetime is shorter. © 2016, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - Biofuel is expected to have a role in creating a renewable, practical and environmentally intact source of energy. Biomass is converted into biofuels either via: chemical, thermochemical, or biochemical processes. The choice of conversion process and feedstock depends on the desired product and the form of energy. The potentiality of microalgae as a biofuel source is high comparing to other sorts of biomass. However there are several basics needed for the development of this trend. Firstly, the suitable microalgae strain. Secondly, the type of cultivation system that is agreeable to the environmental consideration and ideal for energy conservation. Finally, the physical and chemical factors affect the cultivation of microalgae. Greenhouse gas emissions and energy utilization potential are pertinent to biofuel production. Life cycle assessment of biofuel production from microalgae proposes them to be preferable to fossil fuel. However; the algal technologies need more improvements to be attractive economically. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - In this study, we fabricated the catalysts for enzymatic biofuel cell anode with carbon nanotube (CNT), glucose oxidase (GOx) and various molecular weights branched poly(ethyleneimine)(bPEI) and terephthalaldehyde (TPA) as cross-linker. In case of GOx/bPEI/CNT using only physical entrapments for immobilization, the molecular weights of bPEI didn't affect to electrochemical performances and long term stability. but that of the catalysts cross linked via TPA (TPA[GOx/bPEI/CNT]) improved and the mass transfer of glucose to FAD was interrupted as increasing of the bPEI's molecular weights. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the optimum molecular weight of PEI for TPA [GOx/bPEI/CNT]) structure is 750k that showed marvelous high performance (maximum power density of 0.995 mW·cm-2).

AB  - A combination of biochemical and thermochemical process to produce sugars and bio-oil by using switchgrass which was grown in lead contaminated soil was studied. Four different process routes which involve fast pyrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, and their combinations were investigated. The impact of lead content in the switchgrass feedstock used for the production of sugars and bio-oil along with the recovery of lead through the above mentioned routes were evaluated. The yields of sugars from acid hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis did not seem to be affected by the lead contained in the switchgrass. The chemical product distribution in bio-oil produced from pyrolysis of lead-containing switchgrass and regular switchgrass showed slight differences. The highest overall yields of the liquid products were obtained from the fourth route which utilized all the three process steps, resulting in the lowest yield of bio-char byproduct which had the lowest content lead (2 mg/kg). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Neutron imaging provides a route for studying the effect of environmental conditions on enzymatic electrochemical cell (EEC) performance. Here, the application of 2D and 3D neutron imaging is demonstrated as a means to investigate effects of environmental conditions on EEC performance. Changes in aqueous solutions that are vital to the operation of EECs have been directly observed in real time using neutron radiography (NR). These changes include uptake of aqueous solutions in electrode materials and in situ observation of water content during operation. The EEC structure has also been observed using ex situ neutron tomography. Initially samples constructed to simulate EEC geometry were imaged, and aqueous buffer solution uptake behavior was observed in carbon paper cell components. In follow-on studies neutron tomography was used to map regions of enzyme catalyst inks, defining active regions within the EEC electrode. The higher neutron attenuation of polymeric ink components enables this observation. Finally, in situ imaging of a prototype EEC pouch cell was performed using a standard chronoamperometry arrangement while performing real time neutron radiography. Neutron radiographs acquired during operation show a clear variation in transmission behavior, primarily due to drying. Together these studies demonstrate the applicability and attendant challenges of neutron imaging for the study of EEC performance and reliability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewable and bio-based transportation fuel sources can lower the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. We present an initial assessment of ethyl 3-ethoxybutyrate (EEB) as a biofuel in terms of its performance as a fuel oxygenate and its persistence in the environment. EEB can be produced from ethanol and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, a bacterial storage polymer that can be produced from non-food biomass and other organic feedstocks. Physicochemical properties of EEB and fuel-relevant properties of EEB-gasoline blends were measured, emissions of criteria pollutants from EEB as a gasoline additive in a production vehicle were evaluated, and fate and persistence of EEB in the environment were estimated. EEB solubility in water was 25.8 g/L, its Kow was 1.8, and its Henry’s Law constant was 1.04 × 10−5 atm-m3/mole. The anti-knock index values for 5 and 20 % v/v EEB-gasoline blends were 91.6 and 91.9, respectively. Reductions in fuel economy were consistent with the level of oxygenation, and criteria emissions were met by the vehicle operated over the urban dynamometer driving cycle (FTP 75). Predicted environmental persistence ranged from 15 to 30 days which indicates that EEB is not likely to be a persistent organic pollutant. In combination, these results suggest a high potential for the use of EEB as a renewable fuel source. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Presently the production and use of biodiesel is not cost-effective in comparison to traditional fossil fuels. Naturally occurring enzymes, such as lipases and esterases, can potentially be engineered to lower the cost of certain steps in the biodiesel synthesis process that would otherwise be more costly. However, these enzymes have evolved to perform biologically relevant functions, and not necessarily to manufacture biodiesel under commercially viable conditions. To this end, we have identified, cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized two proteins from the staphylococcal lipase family that are capable of catalyzing the formation of fatty acid alkyl esters. In an effort to explore strategies for improving these fatty acid modifying enzymes (FAMEs), we have engineered a chimeric fusion protein that significantly increases the esterification of free fatty acid with ethanol. The fusion protein, which consists of a staphylococcal FAME fused to a Drosophila ethanol binding protein, demonstrably improves the rate of catalysis by providing an additional substrate binding site and concomitant increase in the local concentration of substrate. This results in greater overall substrate (ethanol) residence in proximity to the catalytic domain, and a faster rate of catalysis, without the necessity of altering the amino acid sequence of the FAME protein. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With Ce-Ni/Co as reforming catalyst and CaO from calcination of calcium acetate as CO2 adsorbent, the sorption-enhanced steam reforming of bio-oil for hydrogen production was studied. The results show that the addition of CO2 sorbent can effectively promote the hydrogen molar fraction and hydrogen yield compared with the case without CO2 sorbent under the same temperature and M(S)/M(C) ratio (the molar mass of steam to carbon in the model compounds of bio-oil). When the CO2 sorbent existed, the hydrogen molar fraction and yield increased first, then decreased with the increase of the reforming temperature, and reached the maximum at 700℃. With the increase of M(S)/M(C) ratio, the hydrogen molar fraction increased first, then decreased, and was the largest at the M(S)/M(C) ratio of 9, while the hydrogen yield increased till the M(S)/M(C) ratio reached 9, then changed slightly. With the increase of M(CaO)/M(C) ratio (the molar mass of calcium oxide to carbon in the model compounds of bio-oil), the hydrogen molar fraction increased gradually, but changed slightly after the M(CaO)/M(C) ratio reached 3, while the hydrogen yield increased first and then decreased, reached the maximum at the M(CaO)/M(C) ratio of 3. The optimum conditions for steam reforming of bio-oil with CO2 sorption are 700℃, M(S)/M(C)=9 and M(CaO)/M(C)=3, where the hydrogen molar fraction and the hydrogen yield are 92.2% and 84.1% respectively. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Northeastern University.

AB  - Microbial growth on hydrocarbons is common in nature and used in bioremediation of contaminated sites, whereas in fuel storage tanks this phenomenon can affect the stability of the fuel and the tank. The impact of microbial growth and produced metabolites on materials, which are used in the construction of storage tanks, were analyzed. In contrast to metal tank components, polymeric materials did not affect or were influenced by microorganisms. Zinc was highly corroded by microbial growth, most likely due to the formation of organic acids that were produced during microbial growth on hydrocarbons. A contaminated water phase in a storage tank of a heating system was simulated with a self-constructed pump test bench. Microbial growth began in the water phase of the storage tank and microbes were distributed throughout the tank system, through water-in-oil microemulsions. No microbial growth was observed in oil that was previously contaminated, indicating that essential nutrients had been depleted. The identification and removal of these essential nutrients from fuels could minimize or prevent microbial contamination. The results are discussed with regard to developing recommendations for the design and operation of domestic heating oil storage tanks to lower the risk of technical failure due to microbial contamination. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - With the increasing energy requirements and pollution problems worldwide, energy from renewable resources has received global attention in recent decades. Biomass is one of the most abundant renewable resources. It mainly includes forest residues, agricultural wastes, industrial residues, municipal solid wastes, bagasse, aquatic plants, and algae animal wastes. Due to the advantages of abundance, non-polluting, being renewable and easy to obtain, biomass is considered as the most promising energy feedstock to replace the traditional energy. Meanwhile, it is the only resource that can be converted into solid, liquid, and gaseous products for use of fuels. Thermo-chemical conversion is an effective technology of biomass conversion. Liquefaction is the typical thermo-chemical technology for the conversion of biomass to obtain liquid biofuels and valuable chemicals, such as bio-oil and fuel additives. The conversion process is not only influenced by organic reagents but also by different catalysts. Effective catalyst is an essential factor to improve liquefaction efficiency. As catalyst, sulfuric acid has very strong corrosion and needs high-quality liquefaction equipment, and its recycling is difficult. Solid acid is used to overcome shortcomings of organic acid in the liquefaction, but it is easy to form coke to cause the deactivation of catalyst, and needs to be calcined before re-use, which increases the reaction cost. Now, it is found that the ionic liquid has non-corrosiveness, low melting point, high thermal stability and low vapor pressure, and some other merits. It has a broad application prospect used as solvents and catalysts in catalytic reactions. Ionic liquid, especially sulfonated bisulfate ionic liquid can dissolve cellulose, because it has higher acidic sites that can easily break the hydrogen bonds of biomass material, and promote the degradation and conversion of cellulose. At present, ionic liquid is usually used to catalyze carbohydrate, which is changed into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The report about producing levulinate from agriculture waste catalyzed by ionic liquids is rare. Therefore, we choose wheat straw as raw material and ionic liquids as catalyst in the liquefaction process. In this study, 1-methyl-3-(4-Sulfobutyl)-imidazolium hydrosulfate is synthesized and used as catalyst for the liquefaction of wheat straw in ethanol. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance carbon-13 spectrum (13C NMR), thermo gravimetric analyzer (TG) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) characterized the structure of ionic liquid and liquid products. The synthesized ionic liquid is confirmed to be 1-methyl-3-(4-Sulfobutyl)-imidazolium hydrosulfate. Results of the experiments show that the ionic liquid has the optimum catalytic properties for the liquefaction of wheat straw. Under the conditions that wheat the straw mass is 5 g, the mass fraction of catalyst is 26%, the reaction temperature is 200℃, and the reaction time is 60 min, a high conversion rate of 85.5% is obtained; under the conditions, the yield of ethyl levulinate is 9.97%, and the relative percentage content of ethyl levulinate is 29.9% in liquid products. The liquid products include aldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, phenols and other oxygenated chemicals; among them, phenols are from the degradation of lignin mainly, and the other compounds are from the degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose principally. The results can provide theoretical basis for the development and utilization of low corrosive and environment-friendly catalysts, which will be used on liquefaction to prepare high grade chemicals. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Regional Biomass Research Centers (RBRC) were created to contribute to the planning, research, and development of entire long-term sustainable biofuel production supply chains based on agricultural and forest-based feedstocks. The intent of the centers is to provide a catalyst that links feedstock genetic development, sustainable production and management, logistics, conversion, co-product production, distribution, and market demand suited to the available economic, social, and natural resources within different regions. The centers provide a coordinated, region-based research focus designed with relatively short-term deliverables to help accelerate the commercial production of biomass and other biofuel feedstocks. The centers provide a leadership structure for coordinating biomass research across the country, providing a national perspective that complements other USDA agency efforts designed to help US rural communities participate in the emerging biofuels and biobased products economy. Through coordination with the RBRC, USDA research and service agency programs and resources have been leveraged with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and other federal department, university, and private industry efforts to help accelerate commercial advancement of advanced biofuel production to promote rural economic opportunities and achieve transportation biofuel policy goals. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - ABSTRACT: Extensive research and development (R&amp;D) efforts are required to make biofuel production cost-effective. Knowledge management may boost the R&amp;D efforts. Co-processing of petroleum residues, other organic wastes, and fuels may generate cleaner fuels. Presently, an energy management concept of phase-wise transition to biofuels and an energy security management (ESM) model has been suggested as E (Energy) = a ex + b dy/dt + c ez, based on the exponential growth of fossil fuels use with increase in the world population (ex) and differential rate increase in organic wastes use with time, with ez being the exponential increase in biofuels use and a, b, and c are the factors representing the fuel reserves. R&amp;D management involving knowledge management through trained human resources may lead to the development of effective technologies for ushering in the era of bioeconomy. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) is an important multipurpose tree valued for oil. In India, plans are underway to bring substantial area under this crop for meeting the biofuel requirements of the country. A study was conducted to develop allometric relationships in Jatropha to predict various biomass-related components (above ground and below ground) using easily measurable attributes, viz. collar diameter, tree height, number of branches, crown diameter, and crown depth. Further, it was aimed to establish the reliability of these relationships using an independent dataset obtained from varied management situations. Destructive sampling was carried out during the rainy season of 2011, when Jatropha plants were eight years old. Highly significant allometric relationships (F-values significant at 1% level) were obtained while predicting various biomass components (above, below, and total) using easily measurable attributes with R2 values ranging from 0.89 to 0.98. Of all the predictors, collar diameter exhibited a highly significant relationship with total dry biomass per plant (R2 = 0.97). The allometric relationships developed were validated with an independent dataset. The allometric relationships developed would serve as valuable tools for estimating total dry biomass production and carbon sequestration with reasonable accuracy in Jatropha systems, as they are proposed to be taken up in substantial area in the years to come. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Wild reed was pyrolyzed over two nanoporous SBA-15 catalysts with different acid characteristics: Si-SBA-15 and Al-SBA-15. Al was grafted on Si-SBA-15 to increase the acidity and enhance the catalytic activity. Fast pyrolysis was carried out using a pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system at 550°C for real-time analysis of the products. Significant improvement of the product bio-oil quality was attained by catalytic reforming over nanoporous Al-SBA-15. The fraction of total oxygenates was reduced because of the decrease in the fraction of ketones, aldehydes, and carboxylates, which deteriorate the fuel quality of bio-oil. On the other hand, the fractions of furans and aromatics, which are the chemicals with high value-added, were increased by the catalytic reforming. The catalytic activity of Al-SBA-15 was considerably higher than that of Si-SBA-15 because the incorporation of Al increased the catalyst acidity.

AB  - Zirconia supported cadmium oxide basic nanocatalyst was prepared by simple co-precipitation method using aq. ammonia as precipitating reagent. The catalyst was characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy technique (TEM), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller surface area measurement (BET), temperature program desorption (TPD-CO2) etc. The transesterificaton of soybean oil with methanol into biodiesel was catalysed by employing zirconia supported nanocatalyst. Kinetics of transesterificaton of oil was studied and obeyed the pseudo first order equation. While, the activation energy (Ea) for the transesterification of oil was found to be 41.18 kJ mol–1. The 97% yield of biodiesel was observed using 7% catalyst loading (with respect of oil), 1:40 molar ratio of oil to methanol at 135°C. © 2016 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - After processing of cotton seed oil the activated bleaching clay is converted to low valued waste bleaching clay. The chemical composition of activated bleaching clay from Mirpur, Pakistan is found out as; SiO2 (71.34 %), Al2O3 (15.54 %), CaO (2.72 %), MgO (1.48 %), Na2O (0.51 %), K2O (0.23 %), Fe2O3 (0.02 %). The clay has bleachability (74 %) and oil retention (32.70 %) by standard method (ASTM). The cotton seed oil recovered with different polarity solvents (31.1-36.3 %) have different free fatty acid values (0.2-0.85). However, lower percentage of tri-esters (88 %) was found out in dark coloured recovered oil as compare to freshly n-hexane extracted cotton seed oil (92.5 %) from edible oil refinery. The lower free fatty acid (0.2) valued cotton seed oil recovered with n-hexane is transesterified at optimized conditions to mono alkyl esters. The reaction was optimized by performing series of experiments to observe molar concentrations: methanol-oil (3-18 : 1), oil-catalysts/NaOH/NaOCH3/KOH/KOCH3 (1.5-0.25), temperature (20-80 °C), mixing intensity (200-650 rpm) and reflux time (120 min). The maximum yield of biodiesel (98.5 %) has been found out by NaOCH3 (1.00 %), methanol-oil (6:1) at 65 °C and stirring intensity (650 rpm). The properties of biodiesel are also under limits as per standards: ASTM 6751, EN 14214 and optimal methylation of recoverd oil appeared to be an acceptable feedstock for production of biodiesel as renewable fuel.

AB  - This work aims to investigate the feasibility of upgrading bio-oil into hydrogen via steam reforming and water shift reactions using conceptual design and simulation approaches. In the simulation work using PETRONAS iCON software, it is assumed that the aqueous fraction of bio-oil comprises of 67% acetic acid, 16.5% acetone, and 16.5% ethylene glycol. It is observed that increment in temperature and the amount of steam supplied in the steam reformer increase the hydrogen production until a certain extent. Meanwhile, opposite effect on hydrogen production is observed for both the temperature and steam used in the shift reactor. The overall conversion predicted for the process is 84% at operating temperatures and pressures for the steam reformer and shift reactor of 650 and 200°C, and 1 and 17 bar, respectively, and at the molar steam-to-carbon ratio (S:C) of 6.5. The results are compared and showed good agreement with those from published simulation and experimental work. Positive preliminary economic potential was obtained for the process developed, that is, USD 5.56 × 106/year. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - As a clean sustainable substitute for fossil fuel, bio-oil has properties of acidity and instability, which affected its large scale application. Based on its high acid, ketone, aldehyde and phenol content, three processes for the bio oil upgrading were investigated: Separated esterification and hydrogenation (SHE), one step esterification-hydrogenation (OEH), and one step esterification-hydrogenation plus second hydrogenation process (OEH plus). The studies were conducted over Mo modified Raney Ni catalyst (Mo-RN) and Ru/C catalyst with the light fraction of sawdust fast pyrolysis oil as feedstock. The catalysts reuse performance and the reaction pathways of the typical components during the bio-oil upgrading process were also studied. For the SEH process, esterification reaction was conducted without catalysts, and the hydrogenation reaction of the produced esterification bio-oil were carried out over Mo-RN and Ru/C respectively. For the OEH process, methanol and the raw bio-oil were reacted over Mo-RN and Ru/C directly. Based on OEH-Ni, second hydrogenation over Ru/C catalyst under mild condition (120℃) was conducted after the OEH-Ni process. Over all, the oil properties were improved significantly through the different upgrading process. Through the separate esterification process, oil acidity decreased substantially, showing the acid content decreased from 39.41% of the raw oil to 12.40% of the ES-oil. Accordingly, the total acid value decreased from 55.76 to 16.11 mg/g. In the following hydrogenation process, esters converted to corresponding alcohols under H2 atmosphere over Mo-RN and Ru/C catalyst, resulted in an alcohol content of 56.61% and 43.06%, respectively. Mo-RN showed better catalytic performance on the hydrogenation of phenol and ketone compounds. In the one step hydrogenation reaction process, Ru/C showed better performance for acid and ester converting to corresponding alcohols, showing the acid and ester content of 8.12% and 8.01% for OEH-Ru and 11.43% and 17.15% for OEH-Ni process. Mo-RN better improved the ketone and phenol conversion, showing the content of 1.56% and 6.60%. Through the OEH process, saturated alcohol &amp; ester content increased from 9.99% in the raw oil to 58.31% and 71.95% for Ru/C and Mo-RN, respectively. For the one step hydrogenation over Mo-RN catalyst along with its following second hydrogenation process, acid, phenol and ester in OEH-Ni oil got more thoroughly conversion to alcohol compounds, leading to obtaining an OEH plus upgraded oil of 84.20% saturated alcohol and ester content. Meanwhile, through the second hydrogenation, oil properties showed great improvement for the total acid value decreasing from 111.52 to 11.75 mg/g and pH value from 3.67 increased to 5.88. Besides, even in the second use of Mo-RN and Ru/C catalyst, no significant deactivation was observed. The saturated alcohol and ester content was still kept at 68.37% and 75.84% degree for the OEH -Ni* and OEH plus process, respectively. Through esterification hydrogenation process, oil properties showed great improvement in the acidity and stability. This esterification hydrogenation method is proved to be a promising routine for efficient upgrading bio-oil to oxygenated fuel. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Corn stover, which occurs in Poland in large amounts, is a potential raw material for production of biofuels (Styszko, Majewski, 2010). Until now, staple food (food ingredients), cereals, potatoes or sugar beets have been used for biofuel production (Kupczyk, Wojdalski, 2010). However, more often, other methods employing lignocellulosic material and acids or bases are applied for ethanol production; however, these methods are not so efficient and their application carries a potential environmental risk. An application of methods that are safe (i.e. methods with minimized production of toxic waste after processing) and could be recycled sound like a better solution in this situation. As an example of such methods, we can propose techniques based on ionic fluids belonging to a group of “green solvents”. Therefore, in this study we evaluated an applicability of preprocessing phase using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride in the process of biofuel production from corn stover. The study included determination of properties of corn stover (dry mass, cellulose and lignin content), preprocessing of corn stover using various ionic liquids, enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover and alcohol fermentation. Ionic liquids beneficially affect the crystal structure of cellulose, leading to crystal structure loosening and increase in areas available for cellulosic enzymes. We noticed that 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate initially separated lignin from other content of corn stover and had no negative effect on the action of cellulosic enzymes and yeasts. The study of efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of rye stover after preprocessing with ionic liquids allowed to make comparison between above-mentioned preprocessing methods. More beneficial cleaning process of lignocellulosic material was observed for 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. This beneficial effect resulted from higher amount of reducing sugars after enzymatic hydrolysis. It was also found that the use of ionic liquid – 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate – improved the yield of biofuel production from corn stover. © 2018, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

AB  - Biodiesel is considered as cost effective than regular diesel because normally it is made from low cost materials, extends greater engine life through better lubricity, better wear factor and smoother running. The present study involves in obtaining biodiesel from fresh water algae biomass. Algae are third generation biofuel source which are considered to produce economically good biodiesel. The prepared biodiesel was tested for its properties by adopting ASTM standards. pure diesel and its three blends with biodiesel were tested in a single cylinder, air cooled, vertical and compression ignition (CI) engine for getting its performance and emission characteristics. The test was conducted by advancing and retarding the Injection timing of 3 degree crank angle from the normal timing and the engine loading. The results confirmed that the brake thermal efficiency for the biodiesel blends were almost nearer to diesel. Due to lower calorific value of biodiesel its brake specific consumption values were higher. There were considerable reduction in CO, UHC and smoke emissions for biodiesel blends; its NOx emission values are slightly more than the diesel. Out of three injection timings used, the advanced injection timing shows improved performance and emission characteristics. © 2016, Scibulcom Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quick development of vehicles and constrained stores of fossil fuel is trying to build up alternative fuels. Alternative fuels are usually clean compared with diesel and gasoline in the combustion processes. The usage of alternative fuels reduces exhaust emissions and improves the performance of an engine. The usage of biodiesel like edible and non-edible oils create problems for human needs and other necessities. So, research is needed to develop a biodiesel from waste oils. The production of biodiesel from waste animal fat is cheaper compared to other oils. This paper discusses about the impact of animal fat based biodiesel blends in comparison with diesel over engine performance and emissions. Experimental investigation conducted on diesel engine test bench at different loads with 3 animal fat based biodiesel blends in different proportions like B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% pure diesel fuel), B40, B60 and BO (diesel). Results show that there is rise in brake thermal efficiency upto6% and reduction in carbon monoxide and hydro carbons emissions up to 33% and 41% respectively. Copyright © EM International.

AB  - Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural resources such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. Diesel which is a component in fossil fuel is a non-renewable resource because they take millions of years to form, and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made. The production and use of diesel raise environmental concerns. A global movement toward the generation of renewable energy is therefore under way to meet increased energy needs. Plant based oils have superior tri biological properties, and have wide spread use as additives to diesel. In order to use plant based oils into diesel, chemical modifications can be applied. In this work chemical modification by using both acid and alkaline catalysts to convert (Azadirachta indica) neem seeds into Biodiesel is done. For this purpose H2SO4 and KOH catalysts are used. Batch process is adopted. The product has been analyzed and the results obtained are found to be coinciding. Other characteristics such as flash point, fire point, pour point, density, viscosity and calorific value of the product are also estimated. Since the demand for edible oils is more in our country the production of biodiesel using non edible oil feed stock i.e. (Azadirachta indica) neem seeds will be definitely more effective. © RJPT All right reserved.

AB  - Biochar has successfully emerged as a solid biofuel to address the concerns of greenhouse gas emissions. This research investigated microwave pyrolysis of maple wood in a laboratory-scale microwave pyrolysis reactor to study the effects of final pyrolysis temperature, holding time and selective heating on the biochar yield through microwave absorbers. A regression model was developed to predict the biochar yield as a function of pyrolysis temperature, holding time and doping ratio. The analysis indicated that microwave heating can fasten the process of pyrolysis conversion reactions and the yield of the pyrolysis products increased with increase in holding time and decrease in process temperature. On the other hand, variation in doping ratio did not have a significant effect on the biomass conversion to biochar. The biochar was analyzed through proximate analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine its thermodynamic potential. A biochar sample can be characterized as a carbon-rich solid fuel with high fixed carbon content or residual matter but low volatile or volatile matter. The proximate analysis indicated that the highest residual matter (%) to volatile matter (%) ratio was obtained for the pyrolysis temperature of 290°C, holding time of 1 min and dope ratio of 24% while biochar produced at pyrolysis temperature of 250°C, holding time of 1 min and dope ratio of 32% had the highest energy in the DSC analyses. The regression model developed indicated that the predicted values for the exothermic energies were in good agreement to the observed values (P < 0.05).

AB  - Hydrogen is expected to play an important role as a clean, reliable and renewable energy source. A key challenge is the production of hydrogen in an economically and environmentally sustainable way on an industrial scale. One promising method of hydrogen production is via biological processes using agricultural resources, where the hydrogen is found to be mixed with other gases, such as carbon dioxide. Thus, to separate hydrogen from the mixture, it is challenging to implement and evaluate a simple, low cost, reliable and efficient separation process. So, the aim of this work was to develop a polymeric membrane for hydrogen separation. The developed membranes were made of polysulfone via phase inversion by a controlled evaporation method with 5 wt % and 10 wt % of polysulfone resulting in thicknesses of 132 and 239 micrometers, respectively. Membrane characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ASTM D882 tensile test. Performance was characterized using a 23 factorial experiment using the time lag method, comparing the results with those from gas chromatography (GC). As a result, developed membranes exhibited dense microstructures, low values of RMS roughness, and glass transition temperatures of approximately 191.75 °C and 190.43 °C for the 5 wt % and 10 wt % membranes, respectively. Performance results for the given membranes showed a hydrogen selectivity of 8.20 for an evaluated gas mixture 54% hydrogen and 46% carbon dioxide. According to selectivity achieved, H2 separation from carbon dioxide is feasible with possibilities of scalability. These results are important for consolidating hydrogen production from biological processes. © Malagón-Romero et al.

AB  - Gasified biomass syngas has been successfully used to produce liquid hydrocarbons at pilot scale using a novel biochar-supported catalyst. Producer gas from a downdraft gasifier was made from woodchips and contained 53% N2, 17% CO, 14% H2, 13% CO2, and 2% CH4 after undergoing a rigorous scrubbing and refining process. The producer gas was successfully scrubbed so that the catalyst contaminants contained in the gas (e.g., NH4 and O2) were lower than 1 ppm. This study involved over 2000 h of biomass syngas trials at the pilot plant and achieved objectives to better understand and overcome challenges associated with reactor scale-up. A mass balance closure of ±5% was achieved. Producer gas, which flowed through the system only once (without a recycle loop), had a CO conversion of 59% or greater after being introduced to the novel biochar-supported catalyst. The pilot-scale catalyst bed had a much greater surface area for the gas to flow through than previously tested lab-scale reactors (approximately 15 times more surface area), which allowed channels to form and flow regimes to be more inconsistent than in the smaller reactor tubes. This accounted for the lower yield, so smaller tubes are suggested to improve efficiency and overall yield. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The environmental benefits of biodiesel can be significant in terms of reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases, and reduction of other pollutants e.g. acid rain, photochemical smog etc. There is growing recognition that the use of biodiesel in large commercial systems based on sustainability, existing resources and residues can help to our natural resources. In this study, tobacco seed oil (TSO) for biodiesel production was examined. TSO is a nonedible vegetable oil and a by-product of tobacco leaves production. After obtaining TSO parametric studies have been done and the KOH and NaOH catalyst are used in the transesterification method to produce tobacco seed oil methyl ester (TSOME). Although, there were many parameters related with the process, the four process parameters were only determined such as catalyst type, molar ratio of alcohol to oil, reaction temperature and catalyst amount. A multi response Taguchi technique was employed for determining the optimum combination of these process parameters. The catalyst type has two levels and whilst another parameters have three levels. Thus Taguchi's L18 orthogonal array was chosen. Multi performance characteristics such as methyl ester amount, kinematic viscosity, density, freezing and flash points of these methyl esters were chosen. Experiment results were analyzed by calculating multi response signal-to-noise ratio (MRSN) and the optimum combination level of process parameters for the performance characteristics was obtained simultaneously using multi response Taguchi method. ANOVA was applied to determine influencing process parameters. Obtained combination was verified through confirmation experiments. MRSN obtained from confirmation experiment was placed in predicted interval then it was decided adequacy of the optimum combination. Copyright © by PSP and PRT.

AB  - Biodiesel has good impact on the alternate fuel for compression engine. Cotton seed oil has good viability to produce the biofuel for diesel engine. Cotton seed oil methyl ester was produced by the transetrification process using methanol as solvent and KOH as catalyst. The fuel was prepared by blending the methyl ester of cotton seed oil with diesel with 10%, 20% and 30% with the additives (DEE) of 5% and 10% on volume basics. The experiment was conducted on the single cylinder four stroke water cooled naturally aspirated diesel engine coupled with eddy current dynamometer at constant speed of 1500rpm by varying the load. The result shows that reduction in the Brake thermal efficiency for the blended fuel with and without additives of DEE. SFC was found higher for the blended fuel with and without DEE. Addition of the DEE increases the CO, HC emissions and reduces the Nox and Co2 emissions.

AB  - The demand for fossil fuels increases because of the over usage and extraction of petroleum for transportation purpose and comfort life style in modern age. Energy crisis across the world because of significant growth in population and the basic industry sectors have caused environmental problems. The hike in oil prices and change in climate condition, and harmful emission from combustion of fossil fuel, the industry sector started inverts on alternative resource. The algae biomass converted into bio-oil through pyrolysis process and the bio-oil properties is compared with diesel fuel. Distillation is the method of separating the substance from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. The distillation process results in the removal of unwanted moisture content. The bio-oil has lower content of water after distillation, than pyrolysis bio-oil. The flash and fire point of bio-oil is low, and the heating value is high so that combustion takes place at a lower temperature which in produce better combustion of the oil, Hence the distilled bio- oil has greater efficiency than pyrolysed oil.

AB  - The ability to design and characterise uniform nanoparticles with multi-anion group, where the less stable ligand enhances the diffusivity and activity of the metal ion, would be of broad interest in catalysis. In this paper, well dispersed Cu2Cl(OH)3 (atacamite) nanorods are synthesised via a facile wet chemical method. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the atacamite nanorods (ANRs) possess an enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose. The ANRs-based electrode exhibits desirable catalytic performances with a short response time (&lt;3 s), wide linear range (3 μM to 6 mM), and sound sensitivity (as high as 45.3 μA/mM). A high selectivity towards oxidation of glucose in the presence of oxygen, ascorbic acid, uric acid and dopamine is also observed. The good electrochemical properties are attributed to the intrinsic atomic diffusivities and electron transport efficiency at the liquid-solid interface, which makes such mixed oxides promising for wide applications in non-enzymatic biofuel cells and biosensors. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuel resources and raising demand for fuels are the major drives for the research on alternative fuels. Biodiesel produced from vegetable oils is one of renewable fuel which fulfils most of the requirements. Conventionally, biodiesel is produced by transesterification of vegetable oil with methanol in the presence of alkali catalyst. Homogeneous base catalyst processes suffer from several drawbacks and disadvantages. The problem can be overcome by the use of heterogeneous catalyst. Washing process is not required using heterogeneous catalyst during biodiesel production which deducts the use of wash water and also the catalyst can be regenerated and so has very low wastage. The glycerine obtained from heterogeneous catalyst is also of very high purity. So in this work the biodiesel produced by homogenous catalyst was compared with the heterogeneous catalyst such as TiO2, CaO and CaO nano particle impregnated on zeolite. The percentage conversion is similar for CaO nano partice and KOH homogeneous catalyst. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels derived from industry waste have potential to substitute fossil fuels (Diesel and Gasoline) in internal combustion (IC) engines. Use of waste streams as fuels would help to reduce considerably life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and minimise waste processing costs. In this study an investigation into the fuel properties of two waste derived biofuels were carried out, they are: (i) Glidfuel (GF) biofuel - a waste stream from paper industry, and (ii) Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) biodiesel - biodiesel produced from palm oil industry effluent through various treatment and transesterification process. GF and POME was mixed together at various proportions and separately with fossil diesel (FD) to assess the miscibility and various physical and chemical properties of the blends. Fuel properties such as kinematic viscosity, higher heating value, water content, acid number, density, flash point temperature, CHNO content, sulphur content, ash content, oxidation stability, cetane number and copper corrosion ratings of all the fuels were measured. The properties of GF, POME and various blends were compared with the corresponding properties of the standard FD. Significance of the fuel properties and their expected effects on combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of the IC engine were discussed. Results showed that most properties of both GF and POME biodiesel were comparable to FD. Both GF and POME were miscible with each other, and also separately with the FD. Flash point temperatures of GF and POME biodiesel were 40.7°C and 158.7°C respectively. The flash point temperature of GF was about 36% lower than corresponding FD. The water content in GF and FD were 0.74 (% wt) and 0.01 (% wt) respectively. Acidity values and corrosion ratings of both GF and POME biodiesel were low compared to corresponding value for FD. The study concluded that optimum GF-POME biofuel blends can substitute fossil diesel use in IC engines. Copyright © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - Pretreatment is one of the most challenging and expensive steps in using biomass for fuel production. Hence, there is growing interest in exploring alternate pretreatment techniques. Recently it was suggested that biomass could be pretreated via solid acid catalysts. Hence, in this work, we used niobium oxide as a solid catalyst for pretreatment of switchgrass to understand the mechanism and kinetics of the delignification process. Alamo switchgrass was pretreated with 0.25 g g-1 of niobium oxide at 60°C, 75°C, and 90°C for 20 to 120 min in a 150 mL batch reactor. Subsequently, switchgrass samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and BET surface area analysis. SEM indicated that niobium oxide pretreatment was able to disrupt the external structure of switchgrass, which was corroborated by BET data. XPS of the pretreated surface indicated an increase in surface oxygen content, suggesting that niobium oxide was able to delignify switchgrass via oxidation. In addition, delignification of switchgrass ranged from 47.65% ±2.04% to 59.03% ±3.28% (60°C to 90°C). After enzymatic hydrolysis, a glucan conversion of 86.62% ±0.26% to 95.87% ±1.3% was also observed. Our results indicate that niobium oxide offers an effective and reusable pretreatment alternative to harsh chemicals that require significant downstream processing. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The energy needs of the human society till date have been successfully fulfilled by fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal and natural gas. However, these fossil fuels are being depleted at a very high rate and this has led to the need for an alternative for these fossil fuels. Biofuels are being considered as an effective replacement for fossil fuels by researchers worldwide as they are renewable. In this study, a bio diesel having a blend of 25% cotton seed oil and 75% pure diesel is used in a Direct Injection, Kirloskar engine. The study is exhibited in three phases. In the first phase, transesterification was done to produce Cotton seed oil methyl esters with sodium hydroxide as catalyst. The second phase comprised of coating the piston with ceramic materials (ZrO2&amp; CeO2) by plasma spray process to provide a low heat rejection (LHR) engine. In the third phase, the coated engine was run at a rated speed of 1500rpm to obtain the performance and emission parameters at various loads on the engine. The results obtained were compared with i) an uncoated engine and ii) coated engine with pure diesel and cotton seed methyl esters as fuel at the same conditions. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

AB  - Biodiesel is a leading biofuel due to its ability to partially or totally replace diesel, with the advantage of being a renewable fuel. However, it is subject to oxidative degradation. Therefore, the study of the oxidative stability of biodiesel is very important for its technological development. Oxidative degradation occurs due to the action of the air, light, temperature and humidity. This action is accelerated when biodiesel is exposed to high temperatures or catalysts. The goal of this work was to study the stability of biodiesel produced from soybean vegetable oil. For the analysis of the stability of the biodiesel, the samples were subjected to thermal stress in an oven, at 130ºC. The acidity index coupled with UV-Vis and infrared spectroscopic techniques was used to monitor the level of oxidation of biodiesel. The catalytic effect of metals in the oxidation reaction of soybean biodiesel was also addressed, comparing the effects of the presence and the absence of metals. The acidity index of soybean biodiesel increased with the thermal stress exposure time. There was also an increase of 32.1% and 60.7% in the acidification speed in the presence of iron and copper, respectively. Analyzes from the UV-Vis and infrared spectra indicated the generation of oxidation products. Changes in the UV-Vis and infrared spectra of soybean biodiesel were smaller compared to soybean biodiesel contaminated with metals, thus indicating the catalytic effect of these metals. © 2016, World Food Ltd. and WFL Publishers.

AB  - Preparation, characterization and catalytic activity testing of chrome-bentonite for hydrocracking reaction of used cooking oil into biofuel have been done. Chrome-bentonite preparation began by reacting Na-bentonite with 1 M H2SO4 to obtain sample of the H-bentonite. Chrome-bentonite catalyst preparation was performed through impregnation method of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O into H-bentonite, followed by calcination and reduction. Chrome-bentonite obtained was then characterized by FT-IR spectrophotometry, X-ray diffractometry and porosimetry methods. Chrome-bentonite catalyst which was used for hydrocracking of used cooking oil with variation ratio of catalyst/feed of 1/10, 1/15, 1/20 respectively at 450 °C and the flow rate of H2 20 mL/min for 1 h. Hydrocracking product was analyzed by GC-MS to determine the content and composition of the compounds. The results showed that the catalyst preparation did not affect the structure of bentonite, however caused a decrease in surface area of bentonite as a result of activation and after chrome being impragnated from 47.30 to 19.76 m2/g. Experimental results demonstrated that compounds contained in the hydrocracking products were palmitic acid, dodecanoic acid and heptadecanoic acid.

AB  - Malaysia is presently the world's largest exporter of palm oil with total production of 19.22 million tonnes of crude palm oil (CPO) in 2013. Aside CPO, by-products such as empty fruit bunch (EFB), palm kernel shell (PKS), palm kernel oil (PKO), palm kernel cake (PKC) and pressed palm fibres (PPF) are produced from the palm oil mills. These biomasses can be used as potential feedstock for the production of biofuels, biogas and bioelectricity. One of the ways to fully harness the potentials of these biomasses is by employing the biorefinery concepts where all the products and by-products from oil palm are utilized for production of valuable bio-products. In this study, technological feasibility of biorefinery for the production of biodiesel, hydrogen, Fischer-Tropsch liquids (FTLs) integrated with combined heat and power (CHP) generation was investigated. Flowsheet was designed for each of the processes using Aspen HYSYS® v 8.0. Material balance was performed on a palm oil mill processing 250 tonnes per year of fresh fruit palm (FFP). Results from the material balance shows that 45.1 tonnes of refined bleached deodorized palm oil (RDBPO) and 52.4 tonnes of EFB were available for the production of biodiesel, hydrogen, FTLs and the CHP generation. The annual plant capacity of the biodiesel production is estimated to be 26,331.912 tonnes. The overall energy consumption of the whole process was estimated to be 36.0GJ/h. This energy demand was met with power generated from the CHP which is 792GJ/h leaving a surplus of 756GJ/h that can be sold to the grid. The process modelling and simulation of the biorefinery process shows technological feasibility of producing valuable products from oil palm.

AB  - This study used thermal cracking with hydrogen (HTC) to produce bio-fuel oil (BFO) from jatropha oil (JO) and to improve its quality. We conducted HTC with different hydrogen pressures (PH2; 0-2.07 MPa or 0-300 psig), retention times (tr; 40-780 min), and set temperatures (TC; 623-683 K). By applying HTC, the oil molecules can be hydrogenated and broken down into smaller molecules. The acid value (AV), iodine value, kinematic viscosity (KV), density, and heating value (HV) of the BFO produced were measured and compared with the prevailing standards for oil to assess its suitability as a substitute for fossil fuels or biofuels. The results indicate that an increase in PH2 tends to increase the AV and KV while decreasing the HV of the BFO. The BFO yield (YBFO) increases with PH2 and tr. The above properties decrease with increasing TC. Upon HTC at 0.69 MPa (100 psig) H2 pressure, 60 min time, and 683 K temperature, the YBFO was found to be 86 wt%. The resulting BFO possesses simulated distillation characteristics superior to those of boat oil and heavy oil while being similar to those of diesel oil. The BFO contains 15.48% light naphtha, 35.73% heavy naphtha, 21.79% light gas oil, and 27% heavy gas oil and vacuum residue. These constituents can be further refined to produce gasoline, diesel, lubricants, and other fuel products. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.

AB  - Highly exothermic reactions require catalyst beds with good heat transfer characteristics. Novel Ni-foam structured catalysts have significant heat transfer efficiency compared with traditional packed beds, which is very suitable for the highly exothermic methanation reaction. The present work reports an experimental study of steady-state heat transfer behaviour of a gas flowing through a fixed bed packed with Ni-foam structured catalyst under various operation conditions. Experiments were carried out in a dedicated tubular reactor with inlet air temperature ranging from 160 to 200 °C, heating pipe temperature inside the fixed bed ranging from 400 to 500 °C, and air flow rate ranging from 4.0 to 6.0 Nm3/h. Effective radial conductivity (λer) and wall heat transfer coefficient (αw) were derived based on the steady-state measurements and the two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous heat transfer model. The estimated values of λer and αw were between 2.17 and 3.34 W/m · K and 170 to 250 W/m2 · K respectively. Heat transfer properties of Ni-foam structured catalyst are prominent compared with conventional packed bed. From the results it was found that the metal matrix and porous structure of the catalyst enhanced heat transfer. We anticipate that our research will open a new opportunity for design of new-generation SNG process. © 2016 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering

AB  - The study of fuel oxidation stability is an important issue for the development of future fuels. Diesel and kerosene fuel systems have undergone several technological changes to fulfill environmental and economic requirements. These developments have resulted in increasingly severe operating conditions whose suitability for conventional and alternative fuels needs to be addressed. For example, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) introduced as biodiesel are more prone to oxidation and may lead to deposit formation. Although several methods exist to evaluate fuel stability (induction period, peroxides, acids, and insolubles), no technique allows one to monitor the real-time oxidation mechanism and to measure the formation of oxidation intermediates that may lead to deposit formation. In this article, we developed an advanced oxidation procedure (AOP) based on two existing reactors. This procedure allows the simulation of different oxidation conditions and the monitoring of the oxidation progress by the means of macroscopic parameters, such as total acid number (TAN) and advanced analytical methods like gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR). We successfully applied AOP to gain an in-depth understanding of the oxidation kinetics of a model molecule (methyl oleate) and commercial diesel and biodiesel fuels. These developments represent a key strategy for fuel quality monitoring during logistics and on-board utilization. © 2016 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

AB  - Low molar mass homopolymers, synthesized through free radical polymerization of acrylic acid under solvent control were reported. The polymers were characterized by FTIR, NMR, TGA, and GPC. The behavior as pour point improvers in biodiesel and blends biodiesel/diesel, were evaluated. By using 1000 ppm of the poly(tetradecyl acrylate) (A14) it was possible to decrease the pour point (PP) of neat biodiesel to −10°C, blend B5 to −39°C and blend B20 to −28°C, values below those reported in the literature. These results indicated that it would be possible to use higher amount of biodiesel in blends with diesel in regions where their use would not be feasible, mainly because of their poor flow properties. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The consumption of fuel by vehicles emits nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) into the atmosphere, which are important ozone precursors. Ozone is formed as a secondary pollutant via photochemical processes and is not emitted directly into the atmosphere. In this paper, the ozone increase resulting from the use of biodiesel and diesel fuels was investigated, and the different ozone formation trends were experimentally evaluated. Known amounts of exhaust gas from a power generator operated using biodiesel and diesel fuels were added to ambient air. The quality of the ambient air, such as the initial NMHC and NOx concentrations, and the irradiation intensity have an effect on the ozone levels. When 30 cm3 of biodiesel fuel exhaust gas (BFEG) or diesel fuel exhausted gas (DFEG) was added to 18 dm3 of ambient air, the highest ratios of ozone increase from BFEG compared with DFEG in Japan and Vietnam were 31.2 and 42.8%, respectively, and the maximum ozone increases resulting from DFEG and BFEG compared with the ambient air in Japan were 17.4 and 26.4 ppb, respectively. The ozone increase resulting from the use of BFEG was large and significant compared to that from DFEG under all experimental conditions. The ozone concentration increased as the amount of added exhaust gas increased. The ozone increase from the Jatropha-BFEG was slightly higher than that from waste cooking oil-BFEG. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - ‘UFCP 87-0053’ (Reg. No. CV-166; PI 674425) sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) cultivar was released by the USDA-ARS, Canal Point (CP), FL, and the University of Florida (UF) for its potential use in cellulosic ethanol production. UFCP 87-0053 is a high-fiber sugarcane clone, which was developed to produce genetic diversity in a feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production in Florida. The UFCP 87-0053 clone results from a CP cross of unknown parents, yet it can be distinguished molecularly, and is genotypically distinct, from other energy cane cultivars released concurrently. UFCP 87-0053 is highly resistant to smut (caused by Sporisorium scitamineum). in field conditions, with significantly lower infestation than the reference cultivar L 79-1002. Following both naturally occurring environmental and artificial inoculations. UFCP 87-0053 was also resistant, or moderately resistant, to several other sugarcane diseases, including brown rust (caused by Puccinia melanocephala Syd. and P. Syd.), orange rust [P. kuehnii (Kruger) E. Butler], leaf scald [caused by Xanthomonas albilineans (Ashby) Dawson], and Sugarcane mosaic virus. Mean dry biomass yield of UFCP 87-0053 was approximately 5% greater than L 79-1002. Plant composition of UFCP 87-0053 was similar to L 79-1002. UFCP 87-0053 was released to be cultivated on marginal or sandy soils of Florida for cellulosic ethanol production. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - In a bio-refinery focused on fast pyrolysis, hydrogen (H2) producible from reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil with steam can be utilized for upgrading pyrolytic lignin into fuels by hydrotreatment. In this work, propylene glycol (PG) was chosen as a typical compound symbolizing higher polyols in the bio-oil aqueous fraction. Catalytic processing of PG into H2 at low temperature (T = 500°C) was investigated using several commercial catalysts such as Ni/Al2O3, Ru/Al2O3, Ru/C, Pt/C, and Pd/C in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor. The efficiencies of the catalysts were presented as selectivity to CO, CO2, CH4 and H2, and PG conversion into gaseous phase. Wide ranges of temperature (300–500°C), W/FO (18.6–92.9 g h/mol), and S/C ratio (5.6–12.7 mol/mol) were examined using Ni/Al2O3. At T = 500°C, H2 selectivity (73.7%) and PG conversion (66.2%) were maximized using ratios of catalyst mass to molar flow rate of PG (W/FO) = 18.6 g h/mol and steam to carbon (S/C) = 12.7 (10 wt% PG solution). It was found that Ni/Al2O3 demonstrates stable operation for at least 6 h of time-on-stream. Finally, a plausible reaction pathway for PG reforming was proposed. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this work, biocrude vapors generated from hydrothermal conversion of Pongammia pinnata cake using high pressure reactor at 400 °C and 25 kg/cm2 were upgraded over three mesoporous catalyst namely SBA-15, KIT-6 and FDU-12. The catalysts were synthesized, aluminated and characterized using X-Ray Diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM techniques. A decrease in the surface area was observed on all three mesoporous catalyst after alumina loading with negligible effect on the pore diameter. Purely siliceous catalysts were found to give negligible effect on the yield of different product phases. Alumina supported SBA-15 (SAR 30) was observed as the suitable catalyst as compared to Al/FDU-12 (SAR 30) and Al/KIT-6 (SAR 30) for maximizing the biocrude yield with low heavy hydrocarbons (46.3 ± 2.2%), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (17.1%) and acidic compounds (9.1%) content. Therefore series of SBA-15 were synthesized by varying silicon to alumina ratio between 20 and 50 for maximizing hydrocarbons with boiling cut fractions between 195 and 317 °C corresponding to gasoline range hydrocarbons. Al/SBA-15(SAR 40) was found to give highest biocrude yield (~34.8%) with highest selectivity towards gasoline fraction (23.7 ± 1.9%). GC/MS analysis was used to confirm the presence of aliphatic and aromatics. Highest asphaltene content was observed with Al/SBA-15 (SAR 50). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Fluorescent film sensors utilizing immobilized fluorescent reporters possess more favorable properties from a practical viewpoint. Recent advances in fluorescent noble metal nanoclusters, e.g. Au and Ag, have greatly prompted the development of fluorescent film sensors. The aims of this paper are to introduce readers to the synthesis of Au and Ag fluorescent nanoclusters and the fabrication of the fluorescent film sensors, and to review research related to the potential application of the nanoclusters-based fluorescent film sensors. Methods: The synthesis of Au and Ag fluorescent nanoclusters, fabrication of fluorescent metal nanocluster film sensors and their application are reviewed. Outlook of the fluorescent film sensors is provided. Results: Au and Ag fluorescent nanoclusters can be synthesized by using different ligands, such as thiol-based ligands, polymers and dendrimers, proteins, etc. Fluorescent films based on nanoclusters can be fabricated by incorporation of the pre-synthesized nanoclusters into the films or direct generation of nanoclusters within the films. Fluorescent film sensors have been used to sensitively and selectively detect heavy metal ions (e.g., Hg2+, Cu2+), nitrite anion, and trinitrotoluene (TNT). Conclusion: Organic ligand shells of nanoclusters play a crucial role in stabilizing Au and Ag nanoclusters and impart the properties of the ligands to the encapsulated nanoclusters. The ligand shells of nanoclusters can be tailored independently, constituting versatile platforms for the development of simple and facile methods of immobilizing nanoclusters on solid substrates. Designing the immobilization strategy of clusters on substrates would have a profound effect on the construction of fluorescent nanocluster film sensors with optimal properties. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - A series of highly active, selective, and stable solid indium-exchanged tungstophosphoric acid catalysts had been prepared, characterized and evaluated for bio-derived glycerol esterification with acetic acid to produce valuable biofuel additives. It was found that the Inx/3H3-xPW with nanotube structure owns Lewis acidity and Brønsted acidity in one, which favors for the efficient esterification of glycerol into monoglycerides with higher selectivity. Among all, In0.8H0.6PW presented exception-ally high activity with 88 % conversion and 96 % selectivity to MAG within 30 min of reaction time at 120 °C using 4:1 molar ratio. The better performance came from its remarkable stability, due to the unique Keggin structure, high acidity as well as nanotube structure. In addition, this In0.8H0.6PW catalyst did not suffer from deactivation of water in the six consecutive reaction tests. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the return of investment and profitability of a bio-gasification facility using a modeling method. Based on preliminary market analysis, the results determined that the power facilities driven by biomass gasifiers could be profitable if they consider the most sensitive cost factors such as labor, project investment, and feedstock supply. The result showed that economic feasibility of bio-gasification facility can significantly affect by its production capacity and operating modes (one shift, two shifts, or three shifts). The cost analysis modeling approach developed in this study could be a good approach for economic analysis of bio-syngas and bio-fuel products. In addition, this study demonstrated a unique modeling approach to analyze return of investment and profitability of biofuels production. © 2016 China Agricultural University

AB  - A fixed-bed reactor was used for rice husk pyrolysis and the effects of operating conditions and catalysts on bio-oil production were studied. The results show that the maximum bio-oil yield is 53.81% without catalysts at 550℃ under 20℃·min-1. The presence of Na2CO3 and CaCO3 can increase bio-oil yield and improve bio-oil quality, and Na2CO3 shows better performance than that of CaCO3. With the increase of catalyst percentage, the increasing rate of bio-oil yield decreases. The bio-oil yields are 60.92% or 57.67% when 2.5% (wt) Na2CO3 or CaCO3 is added. The acid value decreasing rate and the calorific value increasing rate both increase with the increase of Na2CO3. However, the increase of CaCO3 has a different effect, which shows that the acid value decreasing rate has a minimum peak and the calorific value increasing rate is less affected. The bio-oil composition was analyzed by GC-MS, which indicates that the addition of catalysts changes the composition. Phenols, alcohols and aromatic compounds increase, while acids and sugars decrease. © 2016, Editorial Board of “Journal of Chemical Engineering of Chinese Universities”. All right reserved.

AB  - Bioethanol is the most commonly used renewable biofuel as an alternative to fossil fuels. Many microbial strains can convert lignocellulosics into bioethanol. However, very few natural strains with a high capability of fermenting pentose sugars and simultaneously utilizing various sugars have been reported. In this study, fermentation of sugar by Fusarium oxysporum G was performed for the production of ethanol to improve the performance of the fermentation process. The influences of pH, substrate concentration, temperature, and rotation speed on ethanol fermentation are investigated. The three significant factors (pH, substrate concentration, and temperature) are further optimized by quadratic orthogonal rotation regression combination design and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum conditions are pH 4, 40 g/L of xylose, 32 °C, and 110 rpm obtained through single factor experiment design. Finally, it is found that the maximum ethanol production (10.0 g/L) can be achieved after 7 d of fermentation under conditions of pH 3.87, 45.2 g/L of xylose, and 30.4 °C. Glucose is utilized preferentially for the glucose–xylose mixture during the initial fermentation stage, but glucose and xylose are synchronously consumed without preference in the second period. These findings are significant for the potential industrial application of this strain for bioethanol production. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cellulose, as a model compound of biomass, was catalyzed over zeolite (HY, HZSM-5) and zeolite/matrix (HY/Clay, HM/Clay) in a GC/micro-pyrolyzer at 500 °C, to produce the valuable products. The catalysts used were pure zeolite and zeolite/matrix including 20 wt% matrix content, which were prepared into different particle sizes (average size; 0.1 mm, 1.6 mm) to study the effect of the particle size of the catalyst for the distribution of product yields. Catalytic pyrolysis had much more volatile products as light components and less content of sugars than pyrolysis only. This phenomenon was strongly influenced by the particle size of the catalyst in catalytic fast pyrolysis. Also, in zeolite and zeolite/matrix catalysts the zeolite type gave the dominant impact on the distribution of product yields. Copyright © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - Slow pyrolysis of giant mullein (Verbascum thapsus L.) stalks have been carried out in a fixed-bed tubular reactor with (Al2O3, ZnO) and without catalyst at four different temperatures between 400 to 550°C with a constant heating rate of 50°C/min and with a constant sweeping gas (N2) flow rate of 100 cm3/min. The amounts of bio-char, bio-oil, and gas produced were calculated and the compositions of the obtained bio-oils were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The effects of pyrolysis parameters, such as temperature and catalyst, on the product yields were investigated. The results show that both temperature and catalyst have significant effects on the conversion of Verbascum thapsus L. into solid, liquid, and gaseous products. The highest liquid yield of 40.43% by weight including the aqeous phase was obtained with 10% zinc oxide catalyst at 500°C temperature. Sixty-seven different products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the bio-oils obtained at 500°C temperature. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The report focuses on optimisation of alkali catalysis as a process for producing biodiesel from waste cooking oils. Biodiesel production parameters that were optimised were methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time. A statistical experimental design was conducted using the central composite design method and surface methodology, and the results obtained were analysed using a statistical software package to predict the optimal yields and parameters for the process. The predictions were analysed and the most suitable parameters for biodiesel production were selected. From the results the optimum parameters for biodiesel production were a reaction temperature of 68.4°C, a reaction time of 1.9 hours, a catalyst concentration of 0.75 wt % potassium hydroxide, and a 0.3:1 methanol to oil weight ratio. The optimum yield of biodiesel from these optimum parameters was predicted to be 98.5%. Thus, alkali catalysis was determined to be a suitable process for production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. © 2016, Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, several methods were devised and evaluated to enhance biodiesel production by whole cells immobilized onto the polyurethane foam coated with activated carbon. Biodiesel conversion was increased to 76.4% with the increase in the number of polyurethane foam until it occupied 18.0 or 2.4% of reaction mixture based on apparent or actual volume of supports, respectively. Stepwise methanol addition to prevent methanol inhibition on the immobilized whole cells was optimized in terms of number of aliquot and feeding interval. When 4.5 molar ratio of methanol to soybean oil was divided into 4 equal aliquots and each aliquot was fed to the reaction mixture every 24 h, the highest final biodiesel conversion of 82.4% was achieved. Chemical treatment of the immobilized cells with 0.1% of chloroform for 2 h enhanced biodiesel conversion to 90.5%. The initial addition of 5% glycerol in the fresh reaction mixture increased biodiesel conversion to 90.3% while the removal of glycerol during biodiesel production barely increased biodiesel conversion. The biodiesel conversion was increased with the increase of initial water content in the fresh reaction mixture and the highest value was 92.7% at 3.0% of water content, but decreased thereafter. The effects of co-addition of glycerol and water on biodiesel production were also investigated, and the co-addition of 3.125% of glycerol and 1.875% of water relative to soybean oil substantially increased biodiesel conversion to 95.0%. By these optimization of reaction conditions and co-adding glycerol and water, initial biodiesel production rate and final biodiesel conversion were remarkably enhanced by 26.8 and 24.1%, respectively. © 2016, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Catalysts composed of plurimetallic particles (Cu, Ni and Ru) supported on Keggin type polyanion salts (Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40) are synthesized and characterized by various physicochemical techniques. Several catalysts have been prepared in this view by varying the metal content. The organic yield obtained with CuNi2Ru1@ CsPW catalyst (ca. 30 wt.%) is two times higher than the one found for the bimetallic CuRu1@CsPW and close to the activity of CuRu2@CsPWmaterial. In the batch reactor, a high yield of good quality biofuel is obtained. However, the catalyst reusability is compromised due to high thermal treatment required for the charcoal removal fromthe surface of the materialwhich causes catalyst degradation and particles sintering.Moreover, the accumulation of ashes on the catalyst surface decreases the active species accessibility. To avoid the contamination of the catalystwith ashes and charcoal, hydrotreatment process is combined with slowpyrolysis of biomass. Indeed, the pyrolysis oil resulted from thermal decomposition of biomass is treated in a fixed bed reactor containing CuNi2Ru1@CsPW. In this case, the catalytic activity is low, only 15 wt.% of biofuel is obtained, but the activity is stable even after four catalytic cycles. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The desilication of HZSM-5 zeolite was carried out using aqueous solutions of NaOH. The structure and acid property of HZSM-5 before and after desilication were characterized by XRD, N2 sorption and TPD of ammonia. Meanwhile, the catalytic pyrolysis of chlorella was also studied in a fixed-bed reactor. It shows that the proportion of mesopores framework in the zeolite can be turned commodiously by controlling concentration of NaOH at a given temperature with optimal time of desilication, and the acidity also can be varied. The catalyst with higher surface acidity and lower acid strength can favor the reaction over the HZSM-5 treated in 0.3 mol/L of NaOH at 80℃ for 2 hours. Furthermore, the catalyst can remove most of the oxygen in the form of CO and CO2, thus it reduce the oxygen content in the biological oil effectively. Liquid yields of chlorella catalytic pyrolysis and bio-oil calorific value are 46.83% and 32.851 MJ/kg respectively. The hydrocarbons yield reached 40.34% (mass fraction), while the carbonyl and alcohols compounds decrease significantly. © 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Enhanced biofuel production routes utilizing separate lignin and carbohydrate processing of lignocellulose are analyzed and compared with two conventional routes; the methanol and methane production via syngas from biomass. The enhanced processes studied are: hydrocarbons production by hydrogenation of biomass based sugars by hydrogen obtained from lignin gasification, and ethanol production by biomass hydrolysis and fermentation and conversion of residual lignin into methanol via syngas. The analysis of processes was done by rigorous flowsheet modeling including power production calculations and realistic heat integration and evaluation based on energy yield, greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction and net present value (NPV). The enhanced processes via separate lignin and sugar processing can run in two modes: either being energy self-sufficient or utilizing external low temperature heat and power. The processes can operate with high efficiency as 'waste heat and power to gas and liquids' processes for producing liquid or gaseous fuels especially when excess energy is available e.g. in summer. Of all the processes studied the enhanced hydrocarbon production process integrated with external low temperature heat source gave the largest GHG reduction and highest NPV. External low temperature heat and electricity is converted into fuels in 136% higher heating value (116% lower heating value) efficiency. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Ionic liquid (IL)-assisted pretreatment is an important step in biochemical conversn of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels. Design for low-cost ILs that efficiently work at a relatively low pretreatment temperature with a short processing time is of great interest. In this work, a functional acidic ionic liquid, 1-H-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidonium chloride ([Hnmp]Cl), was prepared by a simple synthetic procedure in a cost-effective manner and was then investigated for use in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Factors including temperature, time, ratio of biomass to ionic liquid, and water content were studied to determine their impact on the pretreatment of lignocellulose; 91.39% of lignin content was recovered when the corn stalk was pretreated by pure [Hnmp]Cl at 100 °C for 45 min with a biomass loading of 5%. The highest glucose yield attained was 93.20% and the highest cellobiose yield was 18.76%, when the ratio of biomass to water was kept at 1:4. The pretreatment efficacy was dependent on the pretreatment temperature and processing time, which was more efficient for pure ionic liquid with respect to lignin recovery from lignocelluloses. However, more efficient enzymatic saccharification of cellulose-rich materials was achieved with aqueous ionic liquid. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The main objective of this work is to determine the kinetics of a fast, economically viable process for the conversion of lignocellulose (Ricinus communis) to fuel products such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) - the platform chemical, along with the production of glucose for bioethanol production. Here, we perform ionic liquid ([BMIM]Cl) based catalytic conversion of Ricinus communis (Castor leaves/tree mixtures) under the influence of microwave radiations with CuCl2 as a catalyst in a microwave reactor. The lignocellulosic substrate is first depolymerized into glucose, which then converts to HMF that further dissociates into levulinc acid (LA) and formic acid (FA). We focus on experimental determination of the optimal water addition and microwave heating profile (temperature and pressure) for maximizing the HMF yield from Ricinus communis in [BMIM]Cl aided with CuCl2 catalyst. Our kinetic model along with a Power Law model (for the dehydration of HMF and conversion of HMF to LA) and Biphasic Model (for lignocellulose hydrolysis) for quantifying the temporal dynamics of glucose and HMF production uses our understanding of the crucial role that water plays in determining the product distribution. The effect of pre-treatment on the lignocellulosic substrate has also been analyzed using FESEM (pore structure, size and density), BET (pore-surface analysis), Particle Size Analyser and XRD (extent of crystallinity). The microwave reactor helps align the dipoles in the electromagnetic field created by the combination of ionic liquid and microwave radiation, thus reducing the total reaction time drastically to 35 - 50 min, while our novel water addition strategy allows us to manipulate the production distribution for maximizing the conversion of lignocelluloses to HMF via glucose.

AB  - A gasoline-boiling-range olefin production process which combines hexanol production from cellulose using Ir-ReOx/SiO2 and acid catalysts and hexene production from the hexanol using H-ZSM-5 catalyst is proposed. The compositions of the hexene mixture obtained by dehydrating 1- 2- and 3-hexanol and the applicability of the mixture to gasoline based on JIS specifications were determined. About 22 vol.% and ca. 7 vol.% of the hexene mixture could be blended into regular gasoline in summer and winter respectively. This suggests that the hexene mixture obtained from cellulose through this pathway is a potential biofuel.

AB  - The production of cellulosic biofuels often leaves behind solid residues, which can be converted to useful co-products via chemical modification and processing. The objective of this study was to examine the changes in hydroxyl accessibility of a hardwood after the extraction of fermentable sugars (saccharification). Saccharification was performed on milled and dilute-acid pretreated aspen wood and resulted in a glucan-to-glucose conversion of 91%. The unhydrolyzed (solid) fraction was then analyzed for hydroxyl availability using an acetylation method, and the data were related to information of accessible pore volume evaluated using nitrogen adsorption. Different pore volumes were also created by oven-, air-, or freeze-drying of the samples. The results showed that more hydroxyls are available if the physical accessibility (pore volume) of a given substrate is better preserved. Upon saccharification, the accessible hydroxyls were reduced by at least half of that in untreated wood, while the specific pore volume increased 10 times. This finding suggests that future strategies for utilizing saccharification residues for co-products should tap the increased porosity and lower polarity of the substrate.

AB  - Castor oil methyl ester is a kind of biodiesel from castor oil. However, in those previous methods for biodiesel preparation using castor oil as feedstock, glycerol was the main by-product, which had a strong blocking effect on the immobilized enzyme activity and affected the mass transfer of reaction system. For avoiding the negative effect of glycerol on the enzymatic esterification, biodiesel was prepared using ricinoleic acid (RA) as acyl donor. Enzyme screening was also studied, and the effects of reaction temperature, molar ratio of ricinoleic acid and methanol, enzyme load, and reaction time, on the preparation of castor methyl ester were also evaluated. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the interaction effect of reaction variables (reaction temperature (30-70°C), enzyme load (2-7%; relative to the weight of total substrates), molar ratio of methanol to ricinoleic acid (2:1-10:1), and reaction time (0.5-2.5 h)) on the acid value (AV) and the degree of esterification (DE). Validation of the RSM model was verified by the good agreement between the experimental and the predicted values of AV and DE. The optimum preparation conditions were as follows: reaction temperature, 48.2°C; enzyme load, 5.8%; molar ratio of methanol to ricinoleic acid, 5.56:1; reaction time, 2.36 h. Under these conditions, the AV and DE of the esterification reaction are 10.36±1.05 mgKOH/g and 94.03±0.60%, respectively. The relationship between initial reaction rate and temperature was also established, and the activation energy (Ea) of the enzymatic esterification is 33.87 KJ/mol. © 2016 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - The development of methods to analyze fatty acids which require solvent extraction, purification, hydrolysis and derivatization procedures, and which are not lengthy or cumbersome, are in great demand. Jatropha curcas, being non edible and possessing high seed oil content, has been gaining importance as a biodiesel, besides several medicinal applications. Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs) preparation is the critical step in biofuel production. In this study, we report simple and efficient methods for FAMEs preparations to screen large number of samples of J. curcas with respect to fatty acid compositions. These procedures are based on methylation of fatty acids using commercial anhydrous HCl/ acetyl chloride and methanol. GC-MS of FAMEs was done and peak percentage area for the most prevalent monounsaturated Fatty Acids i.e. Oleic acid, were found to be 48.61±0.06 by Method 1 and 48.20±0.08 by Method 2. Major polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for about 26.04±0.23 and 24.07±0.46 percent area respectively for the methods 1 and 2. The FAMEs yields from both methods are comparable, although the procedure used in Method 2 is faster. These values, being in correct range, indicate that these single step extraction procedures are efficient, time saving as well as economical for the derivatization process. These two methods used for studying the fatty acids composition in the seeds can be useful for screening of large number samples and can also facilitate population studies.

AB  - In view of ever increasing global requirement for energy, there has been sizeable interest in escalating renewable biologically produced fuel. Today’s petroleum fuels are unsustainable because of depleting supplies and the contribution of fuels to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We need substitute transportation fuel to prevent carbon dioxide accumulation in the environment. Microalgae are one of the best producing oil crops which converts carbon-dioxide to biofuels as well as involved in bioremediation process. In this present study marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata strain was collected from CMFRI Chennai and cultivated with f/2 medium enriched with dairy industry waste water for cultivation. The lipid extraction was studied using solvent. The functional components in lipids were studied using GC-MS and FT-IR. This study proved to be an efficient tool for useful utilization of Industrial effluents by microalgae nurturing will pave the way for phycoremediation which will pilot to the manufacturing of eco-friendly biofuel. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

AB  - The nano-magnetic catalysts KF/CaO-Fe3O4 were prepared and used for the transesterification of beef tallow to produce biodiesel. The raw materials were brought as a waste material from the slaughter house. The made up catalyst was characterized with X-Ray Diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). For the investigation of the transesterification reaction various process parameters such as methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, catalyst loading and reaction time were conducted. After the process was completed, the results show that 10:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, 5 g of catalyst, 55 °C reaction temperature and 1 h reaction time was the optimum condition to achieve a yield of 94 wt%. The catalyst used for the production of biodiesel from beef tallow shows an effective result.

AB  - This work presents a one-dimensional reactor model for a tubular reactor packed with a catalytically active foam packing with a pore density of 30 PPI in cocurrent upward flow in the example of hydrogenation reaction of α-methylstyrene to cumene. This model includes material, enthalpy, and momentum balances as well as continuity equations. The model was solved within the parameter space applied for experimental studies under assumption of a bubbly flow. The method of orthogonal collocation on finite elements was applied. For isothermal and polytropic processes and steady state conditions, axial profiles for concentration, temperature, fluid velocities, pressure, and liquid holdup were computed and the conversions for various gas and liquid flow rates were validated with experimental results. The obtained results were also compared in terms of space time yield and catalytic activity with experimental results and stirred tank and also with random packed bed reactor. The comparison shows that the application of solid foams as reactor packing is advantageous compared to the monolithic honeycombs and random packed beds. © 2016 Farzad Lali et al.

AB  - Energy, in the form of biofuel production through transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats is rapidly increasing due to the hasty outgrowth of population and urbanization. Correspondent increase in the production of crude glycerol causes mixed effects. Sustainable biodiesel production requires optimization of its production process and drastic increase in the utilization of glycerol. To ensure high biodiesel yields and low environmental impacts, with respect to needless waste streams. Upgrading of crude glycerol to highly pure glycerol and subsequent utilization in producing value added products are emerging research areas. The production of such value-added chemicals requires new basic heterogeneous catalysts as well as optimization of the conventional catalyst materials. The clay especially mesoporous type clay have great potential as a catalyst. For present study Aluminum pillared clay (AlPC) was prepared by Al13 precursors and treated with NaOH to modify as basic which enhance conversion of glycerol to polyglycerol (diglycerol, triglycerol). The modified AlPC samples were well characterized by different latest techniques. The modified ALPC was found stable with high mesoporousity and basicity that enhances etherification reaction. The glycerol conversion and polyglycerol production yield was noted maximum 98% and 80.5% over prepared stable modified AlPC catalysts respectively. Industrially, the findings attained in this study might contribute towards promoting the biodiesel industry through utilization of its by-products. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - Flow-through catalytic membrane system for ester production is one of the competitive alternatives to the conventional esterification system. This article presents the development of an integrated reaction/regeneration unit that was established to study the reaction followed by the regeneration step using two consecutive membrane reactor units working alternately. The hypothesis led to continuous ester production with a relatively high average conversion. The esterification reaction conversion of ethylhexanoic acid with ethanol and acetic acid with ethanol using catalytic membrane reactor reached up to 97.7% and 96%, respectively at room temperature after a reaction time of 10 sec, then slowly decreased; this is attributed to the decrease of catalytic membrane efficiency due to water adsorption on active functional groups, making a regeneration step mandatory. The developed unit was used to produce biofuel/biodiesel by esterification of acetic acid and fatty acid with ethanol. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - A RANS zonal pseudo-homogeneous 1D radial heat transfer model is derived using an homogenization technique along with high-fidelity microscopic simulation to calibrate the model free parameters. Thus, it is brought to light the importance of the mechanical dispersion in the mixing process, the similarity between turbulent and dispersive dynamics and the exixtence of a channeling effect which is responsible for the thermal resistance in the near wall zone. A linear law for the effective thermal conductivity is proposed to assess the heat transfer within the disrupted thermal boundary layer. The model showed its ability to estimate the effective conductivity and the temperature field in the radial direction with satisfaction. Very good agreements are also found in the near wall zone where the temperature gradients are the highest. The model well estimated also the value of the wall temperature and the wall heat transfer coefficient for an imposed heat flux at the wall. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Today, the impending stringent environmental norms and concerns about the depletion of fossil fuel reserves have added impetus on development of cutting edge technologies for production of alternative fuels from renewable sources, like biomass. The concept of biomass pyro-gasification offers a platform for production of (a) hydrogen, (b) hydrocarbons and (c) value added chemicals, etc. In this context, there exists potential for hydrogen production from biomass by superheated steam gasification. Apart from H2, gaseous products of biomass steam gasification contain CO, CH4 and other hydrocarbons that can be converted to hydrogen through cracking, steam reforming and water gas shift reactions. In the present work, the characteristics of biomass steam gasification in an indigenously designed rotary tubular coiled-downdraft reactor for high value gaseous fuel production from rice husk was studied through a series of experiments. The robust reactor system enhances biomass conversion to gaseous products by improved mass and heat transfer within the system induced by a coiled flow pattern with increased heat transfer area. Also, the system has improved upon the reliability of operation and offered greater continuity of the process and easier control in comparison with a conventional process by making use of an innovative gas cooler assembly and efficient venturi-mixing system for biomass and steam. Subsequently, the effects of reactor temperature, steam-to-biomass ratio and residence time on overall product gas yield and hydrogen yield were investigated. From the experimental results, it can be deduced that an optimum reactor temperature of 750 °C, steam-to-biomass ratio of 2.0 and a residence time of 3.0 min contributed highest gas yield (1.252 Nm3 kg-1 moisture-free biomass). Based on the obtained experimental results, a projected potential hydrogen yield of 8.6 wt% of the moisture-free biomass could be achieved, and is also practical for production of pure hydrogen. ©The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Separations in biological systems remain a challenging problem and can be particularly so in the case of biofuels, where purification can use a significant fraction of the energy content of the fuel. For small-molecule biofuels like ethanol, reverse osmosis (RO) membranes show promise as passive purifiers, in that they allow uncharged small molecules to pass through while blocking most other components of the growth medium. Here, we examine the use of RO membranes in developing biohybrid fuel cells, closely examining the case where a direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) is coupled with an ongoing yeast fermentation across an RO membrane. We show that, contrary to initial good performance, the acetic acid produced by the DEFC readily diffuses back across the RO membrane and kills the fermentation after a few days. We introduce an amelioration chamber where the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. The RO membrane rejects the acetate ions due to their charge, preventing acetic acid buildup in the fermentation. We also show that some small, charged components of the fermentation such as amino acids are imperfectly rejected by RO membranes. Because of the high sensitivity of DEFCs to low concentrations (10s of μM) of amino acids, even a very slow diffusion of amino acids across the RO membranes can limit biohybrid fuel cell lifetimes.

AB  - Abstract: The present contribution screens the specific activity of various inorganic and enzymatic based materials in the esterification of oleic acid that is typically used as a test reaction for the production of biodiesel from high free fatty acid feedstocks. The inorganic materials investigated in this contribution are bulk fosfotungstic heteropoly acid of the Wells Dawson structure H6P2W18O62.nH2O (HPA), as well as dispersed on titanium dioxide 18 % w/w H6P2W18O62/TiO2 and the insoluble cesium salt of the Wells Dawson heteropoly anion Cs2H4P2W18O62. Additionally, the commercial biocatalyst Novozym® 435 (immobilized lipase B of Candida antarctica) and a self-supported lipase of vegetable origin obtained from the latex Araujia sericifera (ASL) were studied among the materials of enzymatic nature. The density and accessibility of Brønsted acid sites have a key role in the specific activity of the fosfotungstic based heteropoly compounds. The HPA dispersed over an oxide support catalyzed the esterification of the fatty acid in a heterogeneous fashion with the highest activity (6.4 µmol mg−1 h−1 at 85 °C) among the inorganic materials. In contrast, the enzymatic materials are more active at lower temperature than the inorganic ones. Particularly, ASL catalyzed the homogenous methanolysis with the highest specific activity (30.7 µmol mg−1 h−1 at 40 °C) at the lowest temperature among the materials assayed.

AB  - A new photoelectrochemical starch-O2 biofuel cell has been developed, consisting of chlorin-e6 (Chl-e6) adsorbed on a TiO2 layer onto an optical transparent conductive glass electrode as a photoanode, bilirubin oxidase (BOD)-modified electrode as a cathode, and a solution containing starch, glucoamylase, glucose dehydrogenase and NAD+ as fuel. The short-circuit photocurrent and the open-circuit photovoltage of this cell are 9.0 μA cm−2 and 530 mV, respectively. The maximum power, FF and η values are estimated to be 1.7 μW cm−2, 0.36 and 0.0017 %, respectively. Thus, this new type of the photochemical starch-O2 biofuel cell has been developed by using the visible light photosensitization of Chl-e6 on a TiO2 film photoanode. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In order to study the influence of straw biomass pyrolysis in a rotating bed reactor under different carrier gas conditions, including no carrier gas, the tail gas and N2, biomass pyrolysis was tested based on the reactor. The bio-char, bio-oil and syngas were collected respectively, and the yield rates were calculated. The biochar's calorific value and elements were analyzed; bio-oil's calorific value, water content and elements were analyzed; the syngas' composition and content of organic compounds were analyzed by using gas chromatography. Passing the tail gas can reduce the generation of bio char, increase the production of bio oil, and the higher calorific value of bio char was, the higher carbon content was. The water content of bio oil was decreased, and organic matter content was increased. But when the calorific value of bio oil decreased, the content of light organic matter was the highest in syngas. The tail gas can take away pyrolysis gas more quickly or participate in the pyrolysis of two-time reaction. Biomass react was the most adequate, and tail gas can increase the activity of H; reduce water content, but no way to remove oxygen elements, so the oxygen elements retained in the bio oil. Nitrogen can reduce production of biochar, increase bio oil production and calorific value, and change a little carbon content of biochar, bio oil moisture and organic matter content, but the calorific value of the bio oil greatly increased; the light organic matter content in syngas was the least. Nitrogen can reduce two-time reaction and pyrolysis gas can quickly leave the reactor. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All right reserved.

AB  - The conversion of biomass to hydrocarbon transportation fuels presents unique challenges that generally focus on maintaining high mass and energy yields while removing oxygen from the biomass. Among the many processes proposed and demonstrated, processes that can achieve this efficiently and economically will have a clear advantage. Currently, there is no graphical method to analyze such conversion processes. In this work, we introduce a Funnel Plot to indicate both product quality, in terms of oxygen removal, and energy yield, the energy retained in the product oil from the original biomass. The Funnel Plot is applied to literature data for several processes and compared to an idealized chemical conversion of biomass revealing some of the current challenges associated with biofuel production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transesterification of vegetable oils under supercritical conditions has been identified as a viable alternative for efficient biodiesel synthesis and has the potential for industrial applications. In the present study, a multivariate analysis was used to optimize the supercritical transesterification of soybean oil and hydrated ethanol (92.8% w/w). The following variables were evaluated: reaction time, temperature, ethanol/oil molar ratio and the ratio between the reagent volume and reactor volume. The reactions were conducted according to a Doehlert design using four variables in a reactor specifically designed for this purpose. Glass windows positioned at the ends of the reactor allowed for the monitoring of the phases in the system at both the critical point and the supercritical environment. Both a mathematical linear regression model and response surface were created and used to determine the optimal synthesis conditions. An ester content of greater than 97.3% which was estimated using the optimized experimental conditions (320 °C, 50 min, ethanol/oil 49:1, reagent to reactor volume ratio of 60% and pressure lower than 20 MPa) indicated that biodiesel synthesis can be performed with high yields using hydrated bioethanol under supercritical conditions. The effects of temperature on polyunsaturated esters containing two and three carbon double bonds were also evaluated. The advantages of a supercritical synthetic route are that it requires neither catalysts nor washing water during the purification stages, produces purer glycerin than conventional processes and permits the re-use of ethanol without preliminary dehydration, which simplifies the overall process and has a low environmental impact. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy and environment management is important for energy policy makers as the global warming and climate changes are necessitating carbon management. Coal and biomass are the major energy sources. Focus of energy planners is shifting to renewable fuels such as biofuels (bioeconomy) and clean coal technologies. The present paper describes the need for boosting research and development (R and D) efforts in renewable energy sources. Proper biofuels and clean coal technologies policy and planning are desirable for the sustainable energy technologies management. Strategic management of energy sources would require not only the trained manpower but also knowledge management for the economical and sustainable exploitation of energy resources. Flow scheme of the integrated energy management for cleaner power generation has been suggested by the author presently and a model for clean fuel management and planning has also been proposed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The responsiveness of specific enzymes, involved with antioxidant and defensive mechanisms, were evaluated in leaf tissue extracts of Jatropha curcas L. (J. curcas) seedlings treated with different amounts of methyl jasmonate (MeJA [0.1, 10 and 100 μM]) or salicylic acid (AS [1, 5 and 10 mM]). In addition, the enzymes activities were measured 24 and 48 h after each stimulus. The positive effect of lower amounts of MeJA on the catalase (CAT) activity was more prominent during the first 24 h, by contrast higher concentration of MeJA (100 μM) provoked a reduction of CAT activity in both periods tested. On the other hand, CAT activity increased upon all SA treatments. The guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity was incremented in response to both stimuli, while the ascorbate peroxidase (APX) had contrasting responses regarding different concentration of MeJA and SA. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was not altered in response to any treatment. Chitinase activity was induced in higher degree in response to MeJA 100 μM after 24 and 48 h exposure, whereas under SA treatments it showed a quite discrete induction throughout experiments. The activity of β-1,3-glucanase (GLU) in response to MeJA was positively affected in all concentration only after 48 h treatment, while in response to SA it showed induction for 2 tested concentration (1 and 5 mM) during the first 24 h. However at time of 48 h treatment only 5 mM was effective to induce this particular enzyme. With regard to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity, it was only induced by SA treatments. Collectively, our results indicate that MeJA and SA can act differentially on most tested enzymes reflecting preferential pathways routes regulating such activities in our model plant. © 2016 South African Association of Botanists

AB  - In this paper, both a structured catalyst based on FeCrAl (Kanthal) foam with in situ synthesized CuSSZ-13 and powder CuSSZ-13 were prepared and tested in NH3-SCR. The kinetic data derived at diffusion-free parameters window were combined with mass transport and pressure drop correlations (experiments from our previous work [1]) for three typical reactor packings: FeCrAl (Kanthal) foam, monoliths and packed beds with two latters used as a references. Based on correlations derived the three packings were compared in terms of pressure drop and reactor length. For the assumed evaluation criteria of 90 % of NOx conversion the simulations show that the packed bed reactor is beyond the comparison with the structured reactors. The foam reactor can demonstrate low pressure drop that is comparable to the monoliths and can be shorter than the monolithic one. The findings confirm high mass and heat transport parameters of metal foams. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Anchusa azurea is a lignocellulosic gramineous plant, and it has been selected as a renewable feedstock to be used in a liquefaction process to obtain biofuel. Milled Anchusa azurea stalks were converted to liquid products in methanol and isopropanol with (borax or iron(III) chloride) and without catalyst in an autoclave at temperatures of 260, 280, and 300°C. The liquefaction parameter effects such as catalyst, solvents, and temperature were investigated. The highest percentages of liquid yields from methanol and isopropanol conversions were 64.70% (with borax) and 29.20% (with borax) at 300°C in the catalytic runs, respectively. The highest conversion (73.80%) was obtained in methanol with borax catalyst at the same temperature. The obtained liquid products at 300°C were analyzed and characterized by elemental, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Seventy-three different compounds have been identified by GC-MS in the liquid products obtained in methanol at 300°C. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Trichoderma reesei (Tr.) cellulases, which convert cellulose to reducing sugars, are a promising catalyst used in the lignocellulosic biofuel production. Improving Tr. cellulases activity, though very difficult, is highly desired due to the recalcitrance of lignocellulose. Meanwhile, it is preferable to enhance the cellulase's promiscuity so that substrates other than cellulose can also be hydrolyzed. In this work, an attempt is made to improve the catalytic activity of a major endogluanase Tr. Cel7B against xylan which crosslinks with cellulose in lignocellulose. By using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the transition state of the xylo-oligosaccharide hydrolysis is identified. Then, mutations are introduced and their effect on the transition state stabilization is ranked based on the free energy calculations. Seven top ranked mutants are evaluated experimentally. Three mutants A208Q, A222D, and G230R show a higher activity than the wild-type Tr. Cel7B in the hydrolysis of xylan (by up to 47%) as well as filter paper (by up to 50%). The combination of the single mutants can further improve the enzyme activity. Our work demonstrates that the free energy method is effective in engineering the Tr. Cel7B activity against xylan and cellulose, and thus may also be useful for improving the activity of other Tr. cellulases. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - CeO2 was synthesized hydrothermally in supercritical water and applied to the catalytic pyrolysis of xylan. Acetic acid, which is the main component in bio-oil produced from the non-catalytic pyrolysis of xylan, deteriorates the fuel quality of the oil. Catalysis over CeO2 effectively converted the acetic acid to ketone species, such as acetone, thereby reducing the acidity of the oil considerably. The content of aromatics in bio-oil was also increased substantially by catalysis. Copyright © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of lignin, a major constituent of biomass, was performed. A nanoporous molecular sieve silicoaluminophosphate-11 (SAPO-11) was selected as catalyst. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that 500°C was the optimal pyrolysis temperature. Pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy was used to investigate the pyrolysis product distribution. Production of phenolics, the dominant product from the pyrolysis of lignin, was promoted by the increase in the catalyst dose. In particular, low-molecular-mass phenolics were produced more over SAPO-11, while high-molecular-mass phenolics and double-bond-containing phenolics were produced less. The fraction of aromatic compounds, including benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene, was also increased by catalytic reforming. The catalytic effects were more pronounced when the catalyst/biomass ratio was increased. The enhanced production of aromatic compounds by an acidic catalyst obtained in this study is in good agreement with the results of previous studies.

AB  - The 2% Fe modified HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange and characterized by laser particle size analyzer, specific surface area and pore size analyzer, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate the pore and surface properties. The catalytic pyrolysis of wood was carried out at 550 ℃ to get the maximum oil yield. After pyrolysis, the bio-oil was separated to the lighter (upper layer) and heavier component (bottom layer). The results indicate that with Fe modified HZSM-5 catalysts, the bio-oil yield increases significantly (maximum 7%) the same as that of the lighter one, while the heavier one is nearly constant. Ketones and furans in the lighter oil decreases, while acids and phenols increase significantly; in the heavier oil, ketones and furans decreased dramatically, phenols and naphthalenes increase significantly. The Fe modified HZSM-5 catalysts play an important role in pyrolysis of wood dusts, and have a critical influence on oil yield because the modified catalysts promote the shape-selective modifying of the initial pyrolysis steam and inhibit the secondary coking reaction of steam. The product tends to much lighter bio-oil component and lower oxygen content. © 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - This research reports cultivation of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) in a locally designed and fabricated closed tubular photo bioreactor and the subsequent extraction using super critical fluid extraction. Microalgae oil yield at various temperatures and pressures is reported. The algal oil is then transesterified into biodiesel using an in-house developed new heterogeneous catalyst. The process eliminates the undesirable saponification, apart from increasing the yield, reducing the reaction temperature, and substantially increasing reaction rate, thus providing the basis for benefiting the biofuel production economy directly. The biodiesel produced using the proprietary catalyst is then characterized by using analytical techniques like gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In order to study the effect of pyrolysis temperature on physical and chemical characteristics of bio-oil and bio-char, Yunnan pine pyrolysis was conducted on a fixed-bed reactor. The components of bio-oil obtained were analyzed by GC-MS, while the functional group, crystal structure and micro morphology of bio-char by FTIR, XRD, and SEM respectively. The ultimate analysis and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-char and bio-oil were also determined. The results indicated that low pyrolysis temperatures resulted in more char, while high pyrolysis temperatures inclined to yield more gaseous products. The higher pyrolysis temperature made the contents of the esters and alcohols higher but ketones and acids lower in the bio-oil. The increase of temperature led to significant decrease of carbon and hydrogen as well as prominent increase of oxygen. Moreover, higher temperature led to the reduction of HHV of bio-oil simultaneously. High pyrolysis temperature contributed to the decline and disappearance of -OH, -C = C-, and -C-O- in bio-char. When the pyrolysis temperature exceeded 400°C, a structure resembling graphite crystallite developed. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the contents of oxygen and hydrogen dramatically decreased in bio-char. The higher heating value (HHV) of bio-char augmented with the increase of temperature. Copyright © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - Lignocellulose, having great potential to become substitute for fossil fuels, can sustainably produce fuels and chemical resources. So far, the main techniques used to generate fuels and high value-added chemicals from lignocellulose have been catalytic hydrolysis and hydrogenation. In this study, MoS2 and CoS2/MoS2 catalysts were used in the hydrogenation of rice straw. In the obtained bio-oil it was detected that the main components were esters and phenols, which was the important part of transportation fuels and chemicals. The results of our study demonstrated that the MoS2 and CoS2/MoS2 samples could be used as effective catalysts for degrading lignocellulose to obtain important chemicals. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Rubisco catalyzes the first step reaction in the carbon fixation pathway, bonding atmospheric CO2/O2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate; it is therefore considered one of the most important enzymes in the biosphere. Genetic modifications to increase the carboxylase activity of rubisco are a subject of great interest to agronomy and biotechnology, since this could increase the productivity of biomass in plants, algae and cyanobacteria and give better yields in crops and biofuel production. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize in silico the catalytic domain of the rubisco large subunit (rbcL gene) of Cyanobium sp. CACIAM14, and identify target sites to improve enzyme affinity for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. A three-dimensional model was built using MODELLER 9.14, molecular dynamics was used to generate a 100 ns trajectory by AMBER12, and the binding free energy was calculated using MM-PBSA, MM-GBSA and SIE methods with alanine scanning. The model obtained showed characteristics of form-I rubisco, with 15 beta sheets and 19 alpha helices, and maintained the highly conserved catalytic site encompassing residues Lys175, Lys177, Lys201, Asp203, and Glu204. The binding free energy of the enzyme–substrate complexation of Cyanobium sp. CACIAM14 showed values around −10 kcal mol−1 using the SIE method. The most important residues for the interaction with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate were Arg295 followed by Lys334. The generated model was successfully validated, remaining stable during the whole simulation, and demonstrated characteristics of enzymes with high carboxylase activity. The binding analysis revealed candidates for directed mutagenesis sites to improve rubisco’s affinity. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Soap skimmings are an intermediate substrate in the production of tall oil from Kraft pulping black liquor. In this study, biodiesel was produced directly from soap skimmings before being processed into tall oil using acetyl chloride and sulfuric acid as accelerators. The effects of the accelerator amount, reaction time, and pH on the production yield were investigated. The yields of biodiesel reached 35%, and the hemicellulose by-product could be separated during the process and could be used as a chemical stock for other applications (e.g., carboxymethylated hemicellulose and biofuels).

AB  - The algae biomass is one of the potential biomass resources for extracting lipid to produce fuel. The off grade or residuals of dehydrated algae particles can be used in pyrolysis reactions to produce fuel or useful chemicals. Due to higher ash contents of algae biomass, pyrolysis process needs an appropriate design of pyrolysis reactor. The heating rate of algae biomass is a key factor for increasing of bio-oil production rate. Instead of heat transfer from reactor walls to the biomass, heated inert particles are added to the conventional fluidized bed reactor to increase heat transfer rate and yield of the bio-oil as called flash pyrolysis. The introduced pyrolysis reaction in the novel heating method of fluidized bed reactor studied numerically. For this purpose, an Eulerian-Eulerian CFD model utilized for modeling of the dehydrated algae pyrolysis in the fluidized bed reactor. The appropriate reaction rate of the algae pyrolysis is based on the heating rate, temperature sensitive activation energy and the reaction selectivity utilized to the algae pyrolysis. In addition, the segregation and density change of the biomass particles investigated in the CFD modeling to analysis mixing of the particles and corresponding heat transfer between the mixed particles. The validation of the CFD model investigated using results of prepared experimental setup. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.

AB  - Sulphated titania superacid (denoted as SO4 2?/TiO2) and sulphated zirconia-doped titania superacid (denoted as SO4 2??/ZrO2/TiO2) were prepared via a liquid-phase in-situ method. As-prepared SO4 2?/TiO2 and SO4 2?/ZrO2/TiO2 superacids were characterised by transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. Moreover, the catalytic performance of SO4 2?/TiO2 and SO4 2?/ZrO2/TiO2 for the aquathermolysis reaction and viscosity reduction of the extra-heavy oil recovered at Shengli Oilfield (Dongying, China) was investigated. It was found that SO4 2?/TiO2 and SO4 2?/ZrO2/TiO2 as the catalysts for the aquathermolysis process of the tested extra-heavy oil have good catalytic performance. Saturated hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon, resin and asphalt composition of the tested heavy oil sample before and after aquathermolysis reaction indicates that the amount of the saturated hydrocarbon and aromatic hydrocarbon are increased, while the amount of resin and asphalt are decreased, showing promising potential in the industrial production of heavy crude oil. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - In this study, the effect of inorganic constituents on the physicochemical properties of pyrolytic products produced from empty fruit bunch (EFB) by fast pyrolysis were investigated. Inorganic constituents were removed from the EFB by means of washing treatment with hydrofluoric acid (HF) and distilled water (D.I water). Ash content decreased from 6.2 wt% (EFB) to 2.4 wt% (HF-EFB) and 3.5 wt% (D.I-EFB), respectively. As a result of the inorganic component, a quantity of potassium in EFB has showed the highest removal efficiency in both HF and D.I water (HF: 80.3%, D.I water: 72.8%). Fast pyrolysis was performed with demineralized EFB in the fluidized bed reactor under the temperature of 500 at the residence time of 1.3 sec. The yield of bio-oil was determined to 57.3 wt% for HF-EFB and 52.1 wt% for D.I-EFB, respectively. Biochar yield decreased whereas yield of non-condensable gas increased with decreasing inorganic content of EFB. Water content decreased from 26.9% (EFB) to 9.9% (HF-EFB) and viscosity increased from 16.1 cSt (EFB) to 334 cSt (HF-EFB).

AB  - Biodiesel is considered as cost effective than regular diesel because normally it is made from low cost materials, extends greater engine life through better lubricity, better wear factor and smoother running. The present study involves in obtaining biodiesel from fresh water algae biomass. Algae are third generation biofuel source which are considered to produce economically good biodiesel. The prepared biodiesel was tested for its properties by adopting ASTM standards, pure diesel and its three blends with biodiesel were tested in a single cylinder, air cooled, vertical and compression ignition (CI) engine for getting its performance and emission characteristics. The test was conducted by advancing and retarding the Injection timing of 3 degree crank angle from the normal timing and the engine loading. The results confirmed that the brake thermal efficiency for the biodiesel blends were almost nearer to diesel. Due to lower calorific value of biodiesel its brake specific consumption values were higher. There were considerable reduction in CO, UHC and smoke emissions for biodiesel blends; its NOx emission values are slightly more than the diesel. Out of three injection timings used, the advanced injection timing shows improved performance and emission characteristics.

AB  - There are various outlets for disposal and utilization of the crude glycerol generated in biodiesel plants in Thailand. For large scale biodiesel manufacturers, crude glycerol can be refined into a pure form and then be used in food, pharmaceutical, or cosmetics industries. For small scale manufacturers, however, purification is too expensive to be performed in their manufacturing sites. Their crude glycerol is usually sold to large refineries for upgrading. In recent years, however, with the rapid expansion of biodiesel industry, the market is being flooded with excessive crude glycerol. As a result, biodiesel manufacturers only receive 0.07 - 0.1 US$/kg for this glycerol. Therefore, manufacturers must seek new, value-added uses for this glycerol. In order to convert crude glycerol into valued-added products through thermo-chemical methods with an alternative for utilizing this waste stream. This paper focuses on the conceptual design for the production of a promising biofuel source out of waste glycerol to be integrated within a small stand-alone biodiesel plant in the south of Thailand. The biodiesel production plant used in the process model, is supposed to give about 46,000 tons of crude palm oil per year. To produce this amount 14,735 kg/d raw glycerol material is needed. The simulation program proposes a detailed superstructure embedding the alternative technologies involved. The commercial simulators ASPEN Plus is used to construct the process modelling, simulations and economic potential are performed to investigate different conditions for an integrated plant. Briefly, glycerol as a waste product from the trans-esterification of small plant oils and animal fats is first reformed using steam reforming. By concept, the syngas obtained is cleaned up and its composition is adjusted in terms of the ratio H2/CO and then fed to the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactor. The novelty of this process lies in the use of a Ruthenium-based catalyst for the conversion of syngas to synthetic fuels. RYield model based on experimental data is used for formulating the product distribution of hydrocarbons (C5-C20) as stated by Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF). The synthetic fuel production is to be approximately 2,692 L/d in which overall conversion per pass equals to 35%. The production of FTs liquid is separated while the off-gas as by-product is using for cogeneration with gas engine system to produce the electricity. For providing good asset out of the glycerol based on current market prices, the analysis reveals that the production is economically feasible, with a production cost for the hydrogen of $4.71/kg, but still struggling to survive in business for reaching adequate profit. Meanwhile, the results from the FT process simulations, along with an economic evaluation, appear to be a very promising technology for synthetic fuel production, but the cost structure for benefit makeup is still under study. Noticeably, the integrated process simulation is as effective as possible and both the secondary steam from pre-treatment and steam drying would be used in the reforming and FTs plant, to knock down the production cost.

AB  - Biogas is a multi-purpose technology capable of harvesting renewable energy, converting organic wastes and supplying low-carbon biofuels for transport which all mitigate atmospheric carbon emissions. State-of-the-art biogas CHP technology is however characterised by relatively significant life cycle CO2 emissions intensity typically ranging from 200 to 450 gCO2eq/kWhe, depending on specific feedstocks and configurations. Due to high CO2 content in biogas, the direct biogenic CO2 emissions intensity of a biogas CHP plant is about 700 gCO2/kWhe, which is greater than the direct CO2 emissions intensity of natural gas combustion and it is comparable only with coal combustion. Therefore, in order to meet requirements of future low-carbon energy systems, solutions capable of cost-effectively mitigating various parasitic or even biogenic carbon emissions from biogas are needed. This study analyses the following categories of solutions alleviating CO2 emissions intensity of biogas technology: 1) anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic matter with increased CH4/CO2 selectivity; 2) biological H2 generation from organic matter; 3) AD with biogenic CO2 recycling; 4) biogas utilisation with facilitated CO2 sequestration; 5) low-carbon biofuels from biogas. For each of these categories solutions aiming at alleviating CO2 emissions intensity are provided and analysed. Finally, optimal embedding in the economic environment is discussed. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) converts biomass into a crude bio-oil by thermally and hydrolytically decomposing the biomacromolecules into smaller compounds. The crude bio-oil, or biocrude, is an energy dense product that can potentially be used as a substitute for petroleum crudes. Liquefaction also produces gases, solids, and water-soluble compounds that can be converted to obtain valuable chemical species or can be used as energy vectors. The process is usually performed in water at 250°C-370°C and under pressures of 4-22 MPa: depending on the adopted pressure and temperature the process can be carried out in sub-critical or super-critical conditions. In the conditions reached in hydrothermal reactors, water changes its properties and acts as a catalyst for the biomass decomposition reactions. One of the main advantages of this process is that the energy expensive biomass-drying step, required in all the thermochemical processes, is not necessary, allowing the use of biomass with high moisture content such as microalgae or olive residue and grape mark. In this work, the feasibility of a hydrothermal process conducted under sub-critical conditions to obtain a bio-oil from the residue of olive oil production is investigated. The experimental tests were performed at 320°C and about 13 MPa, using a biomass to water weight ratio of 1:5. The influence of two different catalysts on the bio-oil yield and quality was investigated: CaO and a zeolite (faujasite-Na). CaO allows the increase of bio-oil yields, while the selected zeolite enhances the deoxygenation reactions, thus improving the bio-oil quality in terms of heating value. © 2016 WIT Press.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomasses are gaining attention for biofuel production to supplement the increasing energy demands. This study is focused on identifying the candidacy of pinewood for hydrogen production through subcritical (300°C), near-critical (370°C) and supercritical (550°C) water gasification. Pinewood was gasified to study the impacts of temperature (300-550°C), feed concentration (20-30 wt%) and reaction time (20-60 min). The effects of metal catalysts (e.g., Ni/Al2O3, Ru/Al2O3, NaOH and KOH) were also examined to maximize hydrogen yields and carbon gasification efficiency. The individual gas yields, total gas yields and lower heating values were calculated for comparative evaluation between subcritical, near-critical and supercritical water gasification as well as between catalytic and non-catalytic gasification of pinewood. Supercritical water gasification at higher temperatures (550°C), longer reaction time (60 min) and lower feed concentration (20 wt%) improved water-gas shift reaction resulting in high hydrogen yields. Greater yields of hydrogen (0.52 mmol/g) and total gases (6.4 mmol/g) with lower heating value of 423 kJ/Nm3 was found with 20 wt% of pinewood at 550°C and 60 min. Ni/Al2O3 at a concentration of 5 wt% showed highest yields for hydrogen (2.54 mmol/g) in the gas products when compared to other catalysts. The catalytic activity towards hydrogen production decreased as Ni/Al2O3 &gt; KOH &gt; Ru/Al2O3 &gt; NaOH. The findings imply that pinewood is a promising feedstock for hydrogen production by supercritical water gasification. Copyright © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - This study describes acid-catalyzed production of 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose (D-AnG) from κ-carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide with an alternating backbone consisting of D-AnG and D-galactose (D-Gal). We analyzed four hydrolysis products (D-AnG, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), levulinic acid (LA), and D-Gal) and reducing sugar contents during acid hydrolysis. Acid screening was carried out using seven acid catalysts which have different acidity. The catalysts showing high D-AnG production and high selectivity were chosen for subsequent experiments. We selected four acid catalysts (HCOOH, CH3COOH, HNO3, and HCl), and studied the effects of catalyst acidity, hydrolysis temperature T, and reaction time t on the production of D-AnG and other hydrolysis products. The optimal condition for maximum production of D-AnG by κ-carrageenan hydrolysis was T = 100°C and t = 30 min using 0.2 M HCl. Under this condition, 2.81 g/L D-AnG (33.5% of theoretical maximum) could be obtained from 2% (w/v) κ-carrageenan. In general, the maximum values of D-AnG, D-Gal, and the sum of two by-products (HMF and LA) increased with the acidity of catalysts. However, HNO3 was an exception in that the maximum production levels of HMF and LA were unusually low compared with other acid catalysts. D-AnG was successfully purified from acid hydrolysates using silica gel chromatography and the product was nearly 100% pure. This effective D-AnG production could facilitate future studies on the conversion of D-AnG to biofuels and biochemicals. © 2016, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The catalytic effects of HZSM-5 during olive sludge pyrolysis on the product yields and chemical composition of the bio-oil produced were investigated. Three solvents of increasing polarity (cyclohexane &lt; methylene chloride &lt; acetone) were used to sequentially fractionate the HZSM-5 catalytic bio-oil at 500°C into four fractions (cyclohexane fraction, methylene chloride fraction A, methylene chloride fraction B, and acetone fraction). The yields for the four fractions cyclohexane, methylene chloride A, methylene chloride B, and acetone were 26.8%, 11.6%, 20.0%, and 39.7%, respectively. The HZSM-5 catalytic bio-oil and noncatalytic pyrolysis bio-oil were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, and their organic elemental compositions and calorific values were also determined. Furthermore, major compounds in both bio-oils were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Compared with the olive sludge pyrolysis bio-oil obtained without a catalyst, the HZSM-5 catalytic bio-oil had a lower viscosity and a higher calorific value. Chemical characterization revealed that hexadecanenitrile was the major component in the HZSM-5 catalytic bio-oil (23.8%), whereas oleic acid, ethyl oleate, and hexadecanoic acid were the dominant compounds in the noncatalytic bio-oil. Furthermore, the pyrolysis temperature strongly affected the yield of hexadecanenitrile, and most of the hexadecanenitrile could be obtained in a high purity by polarity-based separation plus silica gel column chromatography. Moreover, a series of experiments was conducted at varying temperatures, pressures, catalyst contents, and residence times to study the effects of these parameters on the hydrodeoxygenation reaction in a microreactor. As a result, HZSM-5 catalytic OMWS pyrolysis oil was successfully converted to HDO-upgraded oil. The experimental results indicated that the best performance conditions were 400°C, 550 psi, 15% catalyst content, and 45-min reaction time for nickel catalytic hydroprocessing of biocrude leading to free-flowing oil. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The gaseous emissions of stage III standard City bus with and without DOC+CDPF after-treatment fueled with biodiesel blends on real road in steady-state and transient conditions were studied using OBS-2200 gaseous portable emission measurement. The results showed that B20 led to a decrease of CO and THC emission rates compared with those of B0.In steady-state condition, CO and THC average mass emission rates of B20 decreased by 26.43% and 10.44% respectively and in transient condition the decrease rates were 22.78% and 4.95%. Meanwhile, B20 eventuated in higher CO2 and NOx emission rates. In steady-state condition, CO2 and NOx average mass emission rates of B20 increased by 8.41% and 8.26% respectively and in transient condition the increase rates were 7.15% and 9.13%. DOC+CDPF caused a more obvious reduction of CO and THC emission rates of B20 compared with B0.In steady-state condition, CO and THC average emission rates decreased by 60.58% and 79.92%, while in transient condition they decreased by 63.67% and 82.57%. The influence of DOC+CDPF on emission reduction of CO2 and NOx was not obvious. © 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is considered as a sustainable alternative to diesel fuel, as it can be utilized in current internal combustion (IC) diesel engine without any modification. It is transesterified from the combination of methanol or ethanol and triglycerides to form monoalkyl ester under the presence of catalyst. In this work, a newly designed continuous tubular reactor is modeled using coupled reactive flow. The model is based on Navier-Stokes, three-dimensional (3D), multiple-fluid species, turbulent internal flow for reactive and nonreactive flow. In particular, this work entails a nonreactive flow to estimate the total residence time and pressure drop in a newly developed tubular reactor assembly. The residence time in the new reactor found to be nearly an order of magnitude larger than the length-based transfer time under reasonable pressure drop. With the intent of developing a robust numerical model, a parametric study of the reactive flow was conducted. The simulation accounts to the different reaction temperatures and reactants molar ratios. The results demonstrated that higher conversion and product yield is achieved at higher temperature and prior to reaching boiling of the alcohol; whereas a lower product is achieved at higher alchol:oil ratios. The latter result is due to departing from the stoichiometric state (dilution of the flow) and to the reverse reaction. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - To study the influence of additives on the pyrolysis behavior of microwave-heated biomass, cotton stalk pyrolysis was performed using both a particular microwave pyrolysis reactor and an electric heating system with the addition of acid (H3PO4) and metal salts (NaCl, K2CO3, and MgCl2) at 550 °C. The derived products were evaluated by environmental scanning electron microscopy, gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection, and temperature adsorption analysis. The results indicated that microwave heating with additives was beneficial to enhance the quality of the pyrolysis products. The addition of H3PO4 was favorable for liquid oil formation with higher furfural and acetic acid contents. The highest yield of oil was achieved with 8% H3PO4, while the maximum char yield and surface area were obtained at 12% H3PO4, as higher percentages caused the formation of more porous solid char. The addition of metal salts promoted the formation of char at the cost of decreasing the liquid oil production. The maximum yields of bio-oil and char were achieved with the addition of MgCl2, while the minimum yields were obtained by adding K2CO3. The addition of MgCl2 (8%) promoted the formation and pore growth of char during the pyrolysis process; moreover, it was helpful for the production of furfural and acetic acid substances as well as a small amount of naphthalene. The addition of K2CO3 (8%) increased the gas production significantly but decreased the specific surface area of char. The addition of NaCl (8%) increased the char yield but decreased the oil and gas yields slightly. The comparative results showed that microwave pyrolysis with H3PO4 and MgCl2 additives were beneficial for the preparation of activated char with a large specific surface area and optimal formation of bio-oil. © 2016 Author(s).

AB  - Transesterification or alcoholysis is the most commonly applied method for biodiesel production. A catalyst is needed to improve the transesterification reaction and yield. The present study used soybean oil as the raw oil to mix with methanol and four strong alkali catalysts (NaOH, KOH, CH3ONa &amp; CH3OK) to undergo a transesterification reaction. Transesterification was carried out using 100% excess alcohol, i.e., molar ratio of alcohol to soybean oil was 6:1, and catalyst concentration of 1% at 60°C. Alkali metal alkoxides were found to be more effective transesterification catalysts compared to hydroxides. Sodium methoxide was the most efficient catalyst, although KOH and NaOH could also be used because they are cheaper and are used widely in large scale processing.

AB  - The transesterification of Thevetia peruviana seed oil with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) for preparing biodiesel has been studied using as an active catalyst potassium-methoxide (KOCH3). The effects of reaction conditions: Molar ratio of dimethyl carbonate to Thevetia peruviana seed oil, catalyst concentration, reaction time and agitation speed on dimethyl esters (DMC-Tp-BioDs) yield were investigated. The highest DMC-Tp-BioDs yield could reach 97.1% at refluxing temperature for 90 min with molar ratio of DMC-to-oil 5:1 and 2.0% w/w KOCH3 (based on oil weight). The fuel properties of the produced DMC-Tp-BioDs were compared with the ASTM D6751-02 biodiesel standard.

AB  - The rape straw was taken as raw materials, and the HZSM-5 and MCM-41 catalysts were used and loaded into bed in two layers with different ways (HZSM-5/MCM-41 and MCM-41/HZSM-5) to explore the synergistic catalytic mechanism on the basis of bio-oil quality and catalyst durability. The physical and chemical characteristics of organic phase in purified bio-oil were analyzed, the compositions were analyzed by FT-IR and GC-MS, and the durability of catalysts was analyzed by TG. The results show that compared with the singular catalytic reaction, the liquid yield from synergistic catalytic reaction lowers somewhat and the gas yield increases. The physciochemical properties of organic phase in purified bio-oil increase and the organic phase obtained from MCM-41/HZSM-5 synergistic catalytic reaction has a relatively higher calorific value, 34.31 MJ/kg. The organic phase in refined bio-oil contains a variety of aromatic substances and a small amount of carbonyl substances, the synergistic catalytic reaction can produce more hydrocarbons and less oxygen-contained aromatic substances. The MCM-41/HZSM-5 synergistic catalytic reaction can produce higher levels of hydrocarbons in organic phase of refined bio-oil, which are mainly in single ring aromatics. There are two weight loss peaks for deactivated HZSM-5 molecular sieve and only one weight loss peak for deactivated MCM-41 molecular sieve in the range of 300-800℃, which show that the coke deposited on the MCM-41 catalyst has a single composition and is easy to remove and the synergistic catalytic reaction forms less coke. © 2016, Science Press.

AB  - In this study, the potential of limestone based catalyst on microwave assisted closed heating transesterification of Malaysian rubber seed oil (RSO) which is rich in high Free Fatty Acid (FFA) was investigated. The experimental results showed that the conversion of high FFA oil to biodiesel is very efficient compared to various catalysts. The catalytic activity is not negatively affected by the free fatty acids and can be recycled very easily. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis was also used to find the surface area of the catalyst at each cycle. The highest conversion achieved was 96.80% with catalyst concentration of 6 wt%; methanol to oil molar ratio of 5:1; reaction temperature of 60°C and reaction time of 60 minutes. The biodiesel produced is within the limits being prescribed by ASTM D 6751. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - As a potential hydrocarbon production method, the hydrocracking of soybean biodiesel, using a commercial petroleum hydrocracking catalyst, was studied. Experiments were carried out in a 1,000 mL, high-pressure autoclave for 2–4 hr over the temperature range of 200–280°C under an initial hydrogen pressure of 10 MPa. Hydrocracking of soybean biodiesel produced n-paraffins in the C8–C17 boiling range, which includes both green gasoline and diesel. Both pressure and temperature play important roles in the transformation of soybean biodiesel. Hydrocarbons can be formed above 220°C with a liquid yield of 81.76%. The n-alkanes content of the liquid product reached 32.29% at 280°C, with 88.32% C11–C14 selectivity. In addition, hydrocracking results in many changes of catalyst such as physical properties, morphology, etc. For the used catalyst, the concentrations of Ni and C increased, and the pore channels were significantly reduced. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The work is based on a reported study which investigates the processability of canola oil (bio-feed) in the presence of bitumen-derived heavy gas oil (HGO) for production of transportation fuels through a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) route. Cracking experiments are performed with a fully automated reaction unit at a fixed weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 8 hr-1, 490-530 °C, and catalyst/oil ratios of 4-12 g/g. When a feed is in contact with catalyst in the fluid-bed reactor, cracking takes place generating gaseous, liquid, and solid products. The vapor produced is condensed and collected in a liquid receiver at -15 °C. The non-condensable effluent is first directed to a vessel and is sent, after homogenization, to an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) for refinery gas analysis. The coke deposited on the catalyst is determined in situ by burning the spent catalyst in air at high temperatures. Levels of CO2 are measured quantitatively via an infrared (IR) cell, and are converted to coke yield. Liquid samples in the receivers are analyzed by GC for simulated distillation to determine the amounts in different boiling ranges, i.e., IBP-221 °C (gasoline), 221-343 °C (light cycle oil), and 343 °C+ (heavy cycle oil). Cracking of a feed containing canola oil generates water, which appears at the bottom of a liquid receiver and on its inner wall. Recovery of water on the wall is achieved through washing with methanol followed by Karl Fischer titration for water content. Basic results reported include conversion (the portion of the feed converted to gas and liquid product with a boiling point below 221 °C, coke, and water, if present) and yields of dry gas (H2-C2’s, CO, and CO2), liquefied petroleum gas (C3- C4), gasoline, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil, coke, and water, if present. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Despite the introduction of the Nigerian Biofuel Policy and Incentive in 2007, little is known about the impact of that policy for biodiesel development in Nigeria. The objective of this study is to explore the determinants of smallholder farmers’ continued adoption of Jatropha as raw materials for biodiesel development in northern Nigeria, with Jigawa State as an area of study. Building on the literature, this paper proposes a model for Nigeria on determinants of smallholder farmers’ continued adoption of Jatropha as raw material for biodiesel production. A pilot testing using few samples in Jigawa state revealed that the determinants composed in the proposed model are likely to influence farmers’ decision on continued adoption of Jatropha as a raw material for biodiesel production. The proposed model if further validated using larger survey samples will guide policymakers towards the enhancement of farmers’ participation and retention in the Jatropha project for biodiesel raw materials production. As a byproduct, implementing research findings from the larger sample will be employment generation, poverty reduction, combating desert encroachment, economic diversification to renewable energy sources and electricity generation using biodiesel. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Macroporous poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) microparticles, with three different structural characteristics, have been synthesized and used as supports in the immobilization of lipase from Burkholderia cepacia. The best immobilization yield was found upon using microparticles with 35 % of divinylbenzene and the immobilized lipase on this type of particles was used as a catalyst to obtain biodiesel from soybean oil and ethanol. From the experimental results of the transesterification reaction, an empirical model quantitatively relating the temperature, the concentration of the enzyme and the transesterification yield was obtained. Statistical analysis of this model indicated that within the range of values of the variables studied (35–47 °C and 231–788 U/mg respectively) only the enzyme concentration exerted a significant influence on the reaction yield. Additionally, the good fit of a Michaelis–Menten-type model to the experimental results suggests that the limiting step of the reaction was the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The effect of the mechanical activation of rice husk on the reactivity of its carbohydrates was studied. The activation was performed in a pilot-scale centrifugal roller mill. The mechanical treatment of the raw material led to an increase in its reactivity due to the increase in the specific surface area and amorphization of the crystalline regions of cellulose. The optimum process conditions of activation, leading to the preparation of a reactive product from rice husk, were determined: rotor frequency 1500 rpm, raw material feed rate 30 kg/h. The rice husk particles were ground to 45–50 μm under these conditions. These changes led to a sevenfold increase of the yield of low-molecular carbohydrates in the complete enzymatic hydrolysis of the material. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The state of the art in biomass conversion into liquid hydrocarbon biofuels aimed at obtaining synthesis gas and hydrogen for duel elements is analyzed. The most promising liquid hydrocarbon and oxygencontaining fuels for synthesis gas production are vegetable oils, diesel fuel, and biodiesel. Mathematical models are developed for the autothermal reforming, steam reforming and pre-reforming of biodiesel into synthesis gas and for the steam reforming of pre-reforming products integrated with the membrane separation of hydrogen. The results of calculations are verified against experimental data. The solution suggested here ensures 93.5% efficiency of the membrane separation of hydrogen from the reaction mixture and a theoretical hydrogen yield of 128 mol per kilogram of biodiesel. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Micro-packed beds (μPBs) are seeing increasing use in the process intensification context (e.g. micro-reactors), in separation and purification, particularly in the pharmaceutical and bio-products sectors, and in analytical chemistry. The structure of the stationary phase and of the void space it defines in such columns is of interest because it strongly influences performance. However, instrumental limitations - in particular the limited resolution of various imaging techniques relative to the particle and void space dimensions - have impeded experimental study of the structure of μPBs. We report here a new method that obviates this issue when the μPBs are composed of particles that may be approximated by monodisperse spheres. It achieves this by identifying in successive cross-sectional images of the bed, the approximate centre and diameter of the particle cross-sections, replacing them with circles, and then assembling them to form the particles by identifying correlations between the successive images. Two important novel aspects of the method proposed here are: it does not require specification of a threshold for binarizing the images, and it preserves the underlying spherical geometry of the packing. The new method is demonstrated through its application to a packing of a near-monodispersed 30.5 μm particles of high sphericity within a 200 μm square cross-section column imaged using a machine capable of 2.28 μm resolution. The porosity obtained was, within statistical uncertainty, the same as that determined via a direct method whilst use of a commonly used automatic thresholding technique yielded a result that was nearly 10% adrift, well beyond the experimental uncertainty. Extension of the method to packings of spherical particles that are less monodisperse or of different regular shapes (e.g. ellipsoids) is also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the feasibility of Raman spectroscopy for studying the transesterification of canola oil with dimethyl carbonate to biofuel using triazabicyclodecene modified Mg-Al layered double hydroxide as a catalyst was investigated. The conversion of the oil was monitored at certain intervals over 1 h. The height of the C=C stretching mode of unsaturated fatty acids of the oil at 1655 cm-1 was measured to determine the conversion of the oil. Deconvolution algorithms were developed to differentiate between the peaks and optimize the spectra for quantitative analysis using Gaussian distribution. The developed Raman spectroscopy method was validated by gas chromatography analysis of the reaction. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Chlorella pyrenoidosa is one of the best candidates for biofuel production. The yield and chemical composition of decomposed products of Chlorella pyrenoidosa were determined using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and pyrolysis-gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) by varying the temperature ranges. The results indicated that the main decomposition temperature of Chlorella pyrenoidosa was 294.53°C and up to 46.7% of the mass was lost. A complete decomposition of Chlorella pyrenoidosa was detected until 642.64°C. The pyrolysis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa at 800°C produced 63.58% (the maximum yield) of pyrolysis products compared to 40.22% at 300°C. It is suggested that the generation of pollutants during microalgae pyrolysis can be avoided by controlling the temperature at a relatively low stage (approximately 300°C). © 2016 by De Gruyter.

AB  - The goal of this study was to analyse the combustion characteristics and emissions of Jatropha curcas biodiesel (JCB) when run in a diesel engine. Jatropha curcas oil was used to produce Jatropha curcas biodiesel (JCB) through a transesterification process. The major fuel properties of JCB, including the acid value, kinematic viscosity, flash point, gross heating value, and iodine value, were determined and compared with that of soybean biodiesel (SBM), sunflower seed biodiesel (SFM), mackerel fish oil biodiesel (MB), and premium diesel (D). JCB had a higher density, acid value, kinematic viscosity, iodine value and flash point, but a lower gross heating value, than D. JCB was then used to analyze combustion characteristics, CO, CO2, NO, NOx, SO2, and particulate matter (PM), under varied engine speeds and varied engine loads. The experimental results show CO2 concentration increased with increasing engine loads for all fuels. Engine trials on D exhibited better combustion efficiency at lower engine loads (0 kW–4 kW) but engine trials on JCB exhibited better combustion efficiency for higher engine loads (5 kW–8 kW). JCB emitted more NO and NOx on a loaded engine. Engine trials on JCB emitted higher PM concentration when the engine was not loaded, while engine trials on MB produced higher PM concentration when the engine was loaded. The estimated CO2 emissions for JCB, MB, and D are 9221.3, 9617.2, and 10185.0 g (gal fuel)–1, respectively. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - Due to the excessive use of fossil fuels around the world, more environmentally friendly alternatives have been studied. Technologies for the production of ethanol, biogas and biodiesel are focusing on the importance of improving costs and efficiency. Biodiesel can be used in automotive internal combustion, is biodegradable and has no presence of metals, however, it lacks competitiveness versus petrodiesel mainly by the high cost of the pure oils used for its production. The aim of this study was to obtain biodiesel from oil samples with high content of free fatty acids (>1 %) obtained from three fast food restaurants using their molecular weight and acidity index values in order to neutralize the free fatty acids in a one-step reaction and perform a screening for optimal conditions for transesterification. The experimental design consisted of two reaction times (60 and 90 min); four methanol–oil molar ratios—6:1, 10:1, 15:1 and 20:1; and two catalysts (NaOH and KOH) at three concentrations 0.5, 1 and 1.5 % with a constant temperature of 60 °C and 500 rpm. The optimum conditions for the different waste cooking oil feedstocks were established reaching a final yield up to 85.53 % of biodiesel, concluding that there is viability of production through the use of this raw material and free fatty acids neutralization technique, obtaining a biofuel that meets international quality standards. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Recently, research has focused on the biofuel production from local industrial wastes due to the risk of greenhouse emissions derived from land-use change (both directly and indirectly) of conventional feedstock and the social concern about the effect of conventional biofuel production on oil prices and its availability (the so-called food vs. fuel debate). Therefore, with the aim to evaluate the use of biofuels derived from wastes from traditional manufacturing industries in Turkey, biodiesel fuels from leather fat, obtained as a by-product in the leather industry, waste anchovy fish oil, derived from the fish-processing industry, and waste frying cottonseed oil achieved from food industry, have been tested in a three-cylinder DI diesel engine at a steady-state condition. In a previous work, the viability of these fuels was evaluated by analyzing measured and estimated properties and indicators for main diesel emissions, and recommendations were made on their alternative use to conventional biodiesels with the benefit of potentially lower life-cycle greenhouse emissions. The experimental results, which were compared with ULSD operation, demonstrated that the engine performance was not significantly affected, while a substantial change in emissions was observed with the use of biofuels. In general, the emission results reported here are in a similar range to those obtained with the use of conventional biodiesel fuels. Nonetheless, the exact magnitude of these changes depended upon the biodiesel origin. Lubricity of alternative biofuels was also tested, revealing an enormous capacity for protecting the fuel system from wear, in line with conventional biodiesel fuels. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 35: 847–852, 2016. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - The catalytic conversion of crude palm oil over HZSM-5 and HY zeolites modified with NiW as catalysts in the hydrocracking process was investigated. These zeolites supported by NiW catalysts were prepared employing the impregnation technique. NiW was added to the zeolites in order to induce bi-functional properties (both acid and metal sites) in the catalysts. Subsequently, the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3 -TPD) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms analysis. The catalytic activity of prepared catalysts was evaluated through the conversion of crude palm oil to biofuels. These results indicate that the incorporation of NiW over HZSM-5 and HY zeolites improves the conversion efficiency and enhances the yield of biofuel (gasoline, kerosene, and diesel), possibly due to NiW promote of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction.

AB  - Biodiesel has been becoming one of the most promising biofuels for global fuels market in recent years, due to the depletion of global petroleum and its increasing price. Researchers exploit oleaginous microorganisms as an alternative for biodiesel production. Currently, they are focused on reducing the production costs and searching waste materials as substrates. This study aimed to investigate the ability of Serratia marcescens UCP/WFCC 1549 to produce lipids using agro-industrial residues (cassava wastewater and waste vegetable oils), either alone or as additives of Luria Bertani (LB) medium. S. marcescens demonstrated that have good ability for growth in all media employed, mainly in LB medium supplemented with waste vegetable oils. However, the best results for lipids production were obtained in media consisting only by wastes, with values higher than 40% of lipids in biomass. In media comprising only residues, more balanced profiles of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were found, in terms of the proportion of saturated, mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (SFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs, respectively). The best result was obtained in lipids produced in medium containing 6 % cassava wastewater (CW) and 7.5 % waste soybean oil (WSO), which had the highest percentage of MUFAs (48.09 %), in accordance with the standards for biodiesel quality. In addition, a high content of oleic acid (46.82 %) was achieved in this medium, showing S. marcescens UCP/WFCC 1549 as an oleaginous microorganism that can be used as potential feedstock for producing good quality biodiesel. Also, this work demonstrated the suitability of CW and waste vegetable oils for microbial lipids production. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study focused on understanding the reaction kinetics for the hydrocracking process. Oleic acid, as the main component of most bio-oils, was selected as feedstock for the hydrocracking process. The hydrocracking of oleic acid was performed in a laboratory scale trickle-bed reactor in the presence of a Ni-Zeolite β catalyst and hydrogen for hydrogenation. The concentrations of oleic acid and the three main components of jet fuel range hydrocarbons produced, which are nonane, decane and dodecane (C9, C10 and C12), were measured with GC analysis. RESULTS: According to the aforementioned component concentrations, the rate of reaction and the related Arrhenius equation parameters were estimated. The reaction kinetic calculations were subjected to hydrocracking reactor modeling to gain a better understanding of hydrocracking. The concentrations of C9, C10 and C12 were assumed to be a separate lump of the hydrocarbons produced, namely middle hydrocarbon (MC). The reactant and MC lump concentrations throughout the reactor were measured and compared with experimental data. The modeling and experimental results are in reasonable agreement in terms of MC lump production and oleic acid conversion. The oleic acid and MC concentration profiles and reactor wall temperature profiles along the reactor were examined in this research. CONCLUSION: The outcome of this study can be applied in simulation and commercialisation of hydrocracking as a potential process for biofuel production. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Biogas is a multi-purpose technology capable of harvesting renewable energy, converting organic wastes and supplying low-carbon biofuels for transport which all mitigate atmospheric carbon emissions. State-of-the-art biogas CHP technology is however characterised by relatively significant life cycle CO2 emissions intensity typically ranging from 200 to 450 gCO2eq/kWhe, depending on specific feedstocks and configurations. Due to high CO2 content in biogas, the direct biogenic CO2 emissions intensity of a biogas CHP plant is about 700 gCO2/kWhe, which is greater than the direct CO2 emissions intensity of natural gas combustion and it is comparable only with coal combustion. Therefore, in order to meet requirements of future low-carbon energy systems, solutions capable of cost-effectively mitigating various parasitic or even biogenic carbon emissions from biogas are needed. This study analyses the following categories of solutions alleviating CO2 emissions intensity of biogas technology: 1) anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic matter with increased CH4/CO2 selectivity; 2) biological H2 generation from organic matter; 3) AD with biogenic CO2 recycling; 4) biogas utilisation with facilitated CO2 sequestration; 5) low-carbon biofuels from biogas. For each of these categories solutions aiming at alleviating CO2 emissions intensity are provided and analysed. Finally, optimal embedding in the economic environment is discussed. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The European Union (EU) has set a target in the 2009/28/EC directive, which aims that the share of biofuels in transportation has to be at least 10 energy % in 2020. However, only half of this target can be met by first generation biofuels (produced from sugars, oil crops, etc.). For this reason, the EU supports and encourages the development and application of advanced biofuels (0.5 energy % indicative target in 2015/1513/EC directive). So, the research and development of newer generation biofuels for Diesel engines are important, due to the high level gas oil consumption of the EU. Nowadays, the most widely used biocomponent of gas oils is biodiesel, which consists of a mixture of various fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and has many disadvantages. The actual diesel fuel product standard of EU (EN 590:2013) limits the blending rate of biodiesel to 7.0 V/V % and the preEN 16734 limits biodiesel to 10.0 V/V% maximum. Biodiesel could be replaced by bio gas oil, which is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of triglycerides and/or fatty acids from different origins (e.g. wastes, animal fats). Bio gas oil is a mixture of n- and iso-paraffins in gas oil boiling range and they are the most favourable energy source for running Diesel engines. The second generation bio gas oil is an excellent gas oil blending component and it is preferred by the car manufacturers, too. Consequently, the aim of our research work was to produce advanced biofuel, a gas oil blending component with bio gas oil content from waste feedstock. During our experiments we investigated the fuel purpose hydrogenation of waste free fatty acid by-products of vegetable oil processing (0 %, 3 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %) and heavy straight run gas oil mixtures on a commercial NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The effects of feed compositions and process parameters (temperature, pressure, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), hydrogen/feedstock ratio) on the quality and quantity of the main product were investigated. The applied process parameters were the following: P = 40 - 50 - 60 bar, T = 300 - 375 °C, LSHV = 1.0 - 2.0 h-1, hydrogen/feedstock ratio = 400 Nm3/m3. Copyright © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Biodiesel is an important renewable energy that stands out mainly due to the possible reduction of oil reserves and environmental impacts intensified by the use of fossil fuels. This biofuel is produced from various oily materials, catalysts and alcohols. Generates glycerin as a byproduct, which is used in different kinds of industries. Given the importance of the fuel and the need to integrate the theoretical content with the practical application of knowledge, this article aims to describe an experiment that can be used for teaching content such as chromatography and transesterification reaction in graduation courses. For biodiesel production were used: soybean oil, methanol and potassium hydroxide, and analysis on paper chromatography was employed: filter paper and the solvents hexane, ethyl ether and acetic acid as eluants. The viscosity and specific gravity of soybean oil and biodiesel were measured. With experiments the academics observed that the transesterification reaction changes the physical-chemical properties of oil when it is converted into biodiesel and understand basic principles governing the chromatographic techniques and organic reactions. © 2016.

AB  - In this work, as a continuation of our previous study on fast hydrothermal liquefaction of macro-alga, the chemical compositions of bio-oil and water soluble products were further studied by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) techniques, respectively. Bio-oil produced at different hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conditions including holding time (5, 10, 15, 20 min), heating rate (585 and 321 °C/min), with and without KOH catalyst addition, were used in this study. The results show that water soluble products consist of mainly C5-C6 sugars and C4-C2 organic acids. The formations of these compounds were resulted from the de-composition of carbohydrates and alginate in the kelp biomass. Moreover, increasing heating rate and adding catalyst have similar effect on the compositions of the HTL bio-oil. Copyright © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - The combination of microalgae-based biofuel with municipal wastewater treatment has major advantages. The study aims to figure out the ability of producing biodiesel from High Rate Algal Pond (HRAP) constructed to treat municipal wastewater. Facultative algal pond followed by (HRAP) were designed and constructed in sewage wastewater treatment plant Zinin, Giza. The removal efficiency of COD and BOD of facultative pond was 57% and 59.6% respectively. The COD & BOD removal percentage decreased to-50% after HRAP this could be explained by the algal production. The results showed that oil content of biomass collected from HARP was 5% and the biodiesel yield was 70.9%. The fractions of biodiesel produced contained variety of fatty acids such as Palmitic, Oleic and linolenic acids.

AB  - Results of investigation of furnace processes upon burning of pulverized fuel at a test bench with a power of 5 MW are presented. The test bench consists of two stages with tangential air and pulverized coal feed, and it is equipped by a vibrocentrifugal mill and a disintegrator. Such milling devices have an intensive mechanical impact on solid organic fuel, which, in a number of cases, increases the reactivity of ground material. The processes of ignition and stable combustion of a mixture of gas coal and sludge (wastes of concentration plant), as well as Ekibastus coal, ground in the disintegrator, were studied at the test bench. The results of experimental burning demonstrated that preliminary fuel grinding in the disintegrator provides autothermal combustion mode even for hardly inflammable organic fuels. Experimental combustion of biomass, wheat straw with different lignin content (18, 30, 60%) after grinding in the disintegrator, was performed at the test bench in order to determine the possibility of supporting stable autothermal burning. Stable biofuel combustion mode without lighting by highly reactive fuel was achieved in the experiments. The influence of the additive GTS-Powder (L.O.M. Leaders Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea) in the solid and liquid state on reducing sulfur oxide production upon burning Mugun coal was studied. The results of experimental combustion testify that, for an additive concentration from 1 to 15% of the total mass of the burned mixture, the maximum SO2 concentration reduction in ejected gases was not more than 18% with respect to the amount for the case of burning pure coal. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - As a step towards developing in-situ transesterification (in-situ TE) for seed-to-biodiesel production, four solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and acetone; neat and in blends) were investigated for their potential in soybean oil extraction. Neat isopropanol compared favorably with the other solvents tested in terms of oil yield and properties of biodiesel product; thus, isopropanol was selected for process optimization of liquid-solid ratio (L-S ratio), shaking speed, extraction time and temperature. L-S ratio had the most significant effect on oil yield, and an increase in extraction temperature was able to reduce the solvent loading and improve the oil yield. Finally, in-situ TE was accomplished by applying the optimal conditions of isopropanol soybean oil extraction together with use of sodium catalyst. Applying optimal catalyst concentration and other process conditions, the yield of fatty acid isopropyl ester was 86.7% of the maximum theoretical yield. Moreover, the biodiesel had a low cloud point with −10 °C. This promising biodiesel yield, simple process and superior cold flow property suggests in-situ TE may be feasible as a small decentralized process for rural areas. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The cost of bio-oil refining from microalgal biomass can be significantly reduced by combining extraction and transesterification. The characterisation and optimisation of the combined steps have been carried out on strains of Stichococcus bacillaris, focusing on catalyst type and concentration, reaction time and temperature, methanol/biomass ratio, pre-mixing time and water content in the biomass. The bio-oil yield has been referenced as production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The maximum yield (∼17%) was achieved using dried biomass with alkaline catalyst at 60 °C and methanol/biomass weight ratio of 79:1. Alkaline catalyst conditions gave faster reaction rates and higher bio-oil yields than acid catalyst. Yield was also strongly affected by water content in the biomass. A mechanistic interpretation has been proposed to elucidate the effect of the different operating conditions. However, the structural characteristics of the Chlorophyta cell wall can be very different, leading to different bio-oil yields when the same protocol is applied. Therefore, the optimised protocol of direct transesterification for Stichococcus bacillaris strains was tested on other Stichococcus strains and several other Chlorophyta species characterised by a different cell wall structure. It was clearly demonstrated that different results for bio-oil yield were obtained within the same microalgal species and much more within different microalgal genera. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Mexican tequila industry annually processes approximately 1 × 106Agave tequilana plants, generating approximately 1.78 × 108 kg of bagasse per year. This biomass is considered an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as an energy source and to produce biofuels and/or chemical products because it is produced and used without adversely affecting the environment. The first aim of the present work was to determine the effect of temperature, the concentration of H2SO4, and reaction time on the hydrolysis of agave bagasse to maximize the fermentable sugars using a steam explosion. This step process generated 71.11 g/L of reducible sugars in the supernatant (59.29 % glucose, 29.05 % xylose, and 11.66 % fructose) and unconverted organic matter of enzymatic hydrolysis bagasse (35.4 % α-cellulose, 7.33 % hemicellulose, 49.91 % lignin, and 7.31 % ashes). A mathematical surface response analysis of the hydrolysis was used for process optimization. The second aim involves the study of the thermodynamics of the reforming of unconverted organic matter from enzymatic hydrolysis of Agave tequilana bagasse (ATB) evaluated by the Gibbs free energy minimization method for hydrogen production. The effect of the parameters on the system performance measures, such as reaction temperature (T), Water/Biomass ratio (WBR), and pressure (P), were also investigated. The maximum H2 production obtained was 23.2 mol of H2/271.5 g ATB with a WBR ≥ 11 and a temperature of 740 °C. These findings indicate that the temperature and WBR are essential factors in the production of H2, which was reflected in the efficiency of the process. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A new combined method for the pre-extraction of essential oils (EOs) and the uniformly dispersion of alkaline earth metal oxide (AEMO) on pine sawdust (PS) was investigated. EOs were firstly extracted from PS after mixing with a certain amount of AEMO through steam distillation (SD), and then the pretreated PS was utilized in the process of fast pyrolysis to produce the upgraded bio-oil. A maximum extraction yield of EOs was 1.61 wt% from PS mixed with 5 wt% CaO within 300 min, compared with 1.21 wt% from the control (raw PS). The proportion of alcohols in EOs increased significantly when using PS mixed with AEMO. When PS was pretreated by the combined AEMO mixing and SD, the content of hydrocarbons in organic phase of the bio-oil increased significantly while that of acids and CnHmOx decreased. The analysis of physicochemical properties for the bio-oil further demonstrated that the quality of bio-oil was improved based on the new pretreatment method. Furthermore, the maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C in almost all cases. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, Scots pine wood (Pinus sylvestris L.) powder was liquefied in the presence of pyrolytic bio-oil as a reaction medium/reagent. Firstly, the bio-oil was produced via pyrolysis of the same wood species at three different temperatures by using an extruder type pyrolyzer. Then, the wood powders were liquefied at different ratios of the wood to pyrolytic bio-oil in a sealed pressure-proof tube. The liquefaction reactions were carried out under pressure ranging between atmospheric and 8.5-MPa pressures according to the experimental conditions. The effects of the reactant ratios and the process parameters such as reaction time and temperature on the wood conversion percentage were studied. The chemical composition of the pyrolytic bio-oil and liquefied wood oil were analyzed by means of GC-MS technique. The higher heating value (HHV) and UV–Vis spectrophotometric analysis of the pyrolytic bio-oil and liquefied wood oil were also performed. The results showed that the wood powder could easily be liquefied in the pyrolytic bio-oil at different temperatures under pressure. The highest wood conversion (97.40%) was obtained at 250 °C for 150 min at a wood to bio-oil ratio of 1:7 with the heavy fraction of the pyrolytic bio-oil. The amount of wood residue diminished dramatically when the reaction temperature rose at the same wood to bio-oil ratio. The HHV of the liquefied wood oil was almost similar to that of the pyrolytic bio-oil. As a result, it could be inferred that the usage of pyrolytic bio-oil instead of the phenol and acid catalyst was quite efficient in the wood liquefaction process.

AB  - Continuous flow transesterification of waste frying oil (WFO) with methanol for the biodiesel production was tested in a laboratory scale jacketed reactive distillation (RD) unit packed with clam shell based CaO as solid catalyst. The physiochemical properties of the clam shell catalysts were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Energy Dispersive Atomic X-ray Spectrometry (EDAX). The effects of the reactant flow rate, methanol-to-oil ratio, and catalyst bed height were studied to obtain the maximum methyl ester conversion. Reboiler temperature of 65°C was maintained throughout the process for product purification and the system reached the steady state at 7 hr. The experimental results revealed that the jacketed RD system packed with clam shell based CaO showed high catalytic activity for continuous production of biodiesel and a maximum methyl ester conversion of 94.41% was obtained at a reactant flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, methanol/oil ratio of 6:1, and catalyst bed height of 180 mm. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - To replace fossil resources with biomass, a lot of conversion methods have been studied. Most of each biomass-conversion usually correspond to one specific purpose, such as to produce chemicals, fuels, or energy. However, when a production of chemicals is through one or more oxidation reactions, co-production of electricity is possible through a conversion on an enzymatic bioanode in a biofuel cell. The simultaneous production will reduce the energy required for producing chemicals. According to the coproduction concept, here we show a production of meso-galactaric acid which is considered a platform chemical. meso-Galactaric acid can be obtained from C1 aldehyde oxidation of D-galacturonic acid, which exists in large quantities as pectin in food process residue. D-Galacturonic acid oxidation catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) and subsequent meso-galactaric acid production was confirmed for the first time by NMR measurements. PQQ-GDH is a useful catalyst for in vitro production, especially for electrosynthesis, because it requires neither the expensive cofactor nor O2. Hence, PQQ-GDH was fixed on an electrode to fabricate the PQQ-GDH electrode. The catalytic current from D-galacturonic acid oxidation with the electrode was confirmed in the electrochemical experiments to show the simultaneous production of meso-galactaric acid and the electric current. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Myxobacteria are able to produce the important metabolite isovaleryl coenzyme A by a route other than leucine degradation. The first step into this pathway is mediated by LiuC, a member of the 3-methylglutaconyl CoA hydratases (MGCH). Here we present crystal structures refined to 2.05 and 1.1 Å of LiuC in the apo form and bound to coenzyme A, respectively. By using simulated annealing we modeled the enzyme substrate complex and identified residues potentially involved in substrate binding, specificity, and catalysis. The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaconyl CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl CoA catalyzed by LiuC involves Glu112 and Glu132 and likely employs the typical crotonase acid-base mechanism. In this, Tyr231 and Arg69 are key players in positioning the substrate to enable catalysis. Surprisingly, LiuC shows higher sequence and structural similarity to human MGCH than to bacterial forms, although they convert the same substrate. This study provides structural insights into the alternative isovaleryl coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway and might open a path for biofuel research, as isovaleryl-CoA is a source for isobutene, a precursor for renewable fuels and chemicals. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - During the continuous catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of cracked vegetable oil (CVO), CO2 and CO occur as the main reaction gases, in addition to hydrocarbon gases such as CH4 and C2H6. The catalysts used were cobalt-molybdenum (CoMo) on an Al2O3 support and platinum (Pt) on an active carbon. All named gas components can result directly from the decomposition of CVO. The results of batch experiments for gas phase reactions (GPRs) under the same 50 bar H2 atmosphere using the same catalysts (CoMo, Pt) indicate that CO and CH4 can also be formed by GPRs. CO can result from the reverse water–gas shift reaction (RWGS), and CH4 from CO- or CO2-methanation. The found CO-yields from GPRs are within the theoretical thermodynamic limits based on equilibrium. An unexpected inhomogeneity of the gas component concentrations in the reactor during batch investigations was observed despite the elevated temperature (380 °C) and high RPM (1100) due to the high density difference compared to H2, especially in the case of CO2. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Weight- and volume-sensitive systems such as aircraft require restrictive ducting, which leads to high face velocities (10-40 m/s) in reactive structures. A head-to-head comparison was conducted experimentally among packed beds (estimated data), monoliths, and microfibrous entrapped catalysts (MFECs) during ozone decomposition to investigate the effects of system pressure on the effective reaction rate, gas-solid mass-transfer rate, and heterogeneous contacting efficiency (HCE, the ratio of the logarithmic ozone removal to the pressure drop across the reactor). For the same mass flow rate, higher-pressure systems (2-3 atm) operate at lower face velocities than atmospheric-pressure systems. These higher system pressures result in increased residence times and reaction rates; therefore, HCE is enhanced. In addition, the HCE for the MFEC was more than twice that of the packed bed or monolith at equivalent system pressures because of the higher gas-solid mass-transfer rates and reduced pressure drops of the MFEC. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A comprehensive compositional analysis was conducted on biofuel obtained from woody biomass hydroliquefaction in supercritical ethanol with a dispersed Ni-based catalyst. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to analyze the bio-oil compositions, and the results indicated the presence of carboxylic acid, ethyl ester, aldehyde, ketone, phenol, and its derivatives. As a result of the inherent limitations of these techniques, an intensive compositional characterization of bio-oil was accomplished through Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The results revealed that the dominant oxygen-containing compounds were O2-O13 with double bond equivalent (DBE) values of 1-20 and carbon numbers of 10-25. The minor N1Ox class species with 4-15 carbon numbers and 10-35 DBE were also detected. The use of FT-ICR MS provided an in-depth compositional analysis of liquefaction-derived oil and would improve the understanding of biocrude for further process upgrading. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A large energy input for preheating and recovering of high excess alcohols used are the main issue in the supercritical methanol (SCM) process. This work demonstrated the production of biofuel from used palm olein oil in SCM using a low methanol to oil molar ratio. The effects of the operating temperature (350–400 °C), methanol to oil molar ratio (9:1–12:1), and reaction time (2–10 min), and their reciprocal interactions were evaluated using a central composite design. The optimum process conditions were determined to be a temperature of 395 °C, methanol to oil molar ratio of 12:1, and reaction time of approximately 9 min through the use of response surface methodology. The modified quadratic regression model demonstrated that the triglyceride conversion (%XTG) and methyl ester content (%FAME) were sensitive to changes in the operating temperature and reaction time, while the effect of the methanol to oil molar ratio was minimal. Under the optimal operating conditions, the predicted values of %XTG and %FAME were 100% and 63.67%, respectively, which were in good agreement with the experimental values. The fuel properties of biofuel obtained from optimal conditions were examined and then compared to American and European standards for biodiesel. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Knowledge of the hydrodynamic character of micro-packed beds (μPBs) is critical to understanding pumping power requirements and their performance in various applications, including those where heat and mass transfer are involved. The report here details use of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) based simulation of fluid flow on models of μPBs derived from X-ray microtomography to predict the hydrodynamic character of the beds as a function of the bed-to-particle diameter ratio over the range 5.2≤Ddp≤15.1. It is shown that the permeability of the μPBs decreases in a non-linear but monotonic manner with this ratio to a plateau beyond Ddp≈10 that corresponded to the value predicted by the Ergun equation. This permeability variation was best represented by the model of Reichelt (Chem. Ing. Technik, 44, 1068, 1972) and also reasonably well-represented by that of Foumeny (Intnl. J. Heat Mass Transfer, 36, 536, 1993), both of which were developed using macroscale packed beds of varying bed-to-particle diameter ratios. Four other similarly determined correlations did not match well the permeability variation predicted by SPH. The flow field within the μPBs varied in an oscillatory manner with radial position (i.e. channelling occurred at multiple radial positions) due to a similar variation in the porosity. This suggests that use of performance models (e.g. for heat and mass transfer) derived for macroscale beds may not be suitable for μPBs. The SPH-based approach here may well form a suitable basis for predicting such behaviour, however. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the chemical exergy (ECH) of liquid products obtained from fast pyrolysis of biomass. I have calculated the chemical exergy values from a formula in literature and have developed a formula for estimating the chemical exergy of biomass from the higher heating value and their ultimate analysis values. The mean differences between these values range from –0.391% to 0.460%. The formula developed for estimating the chemical exergy of biomass from the higher heating value and their ultimate analyses had a correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9999), and the prediction of this formula is good. The goal is to identify desirable attributes that may serve as the basis for decision-making for future biofuel options. Studies on the pyrolytic oils showed that the oils obtained from chestnut cupulae and maple fruit can be used as a renewable fuel and chemical feedstock. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Nowadays, biofuel production of new raw materials has gained renewed interest. For that reason, the objective of this work is to use marine macroalgae for biodiesel and biomass production. The obtained results show that macroalgae are a suitable energy source for biodiesel production by direct transesterification, avoiding the previous step of oil extraction. It is an effective process because 95% of the oil is extracted. To analyze the optimum reaction conditions, the reaction was carried out at different amounts of methanol, catalyst concentrations, reaction temperatures, and reaction times. In addition, the macroalgae residue after transesterification was analyzed and it is suitable as fuel in biomass boilers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Catalytic conversion of sustainable cellulose to the value-added chemicals and high quality biofuel has been recognized as a perfect approach for the alleviation of the dependence on the non-renewable fossil resources. Previously, we successfully designed and explored novel and efficient cooperative ionic liquid pairs for this renewable material, which has advantages of high reactor efficiency than current technologies because of the dissolution and in situ catalytic decomposition mechanism. Here, the determinant of this process is further studied by the intensive investigation on the relationship between the cellulose conversion and the properties of ionic liquid catalyst and solvent. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and elemental analysis were used for the comparative characterization of raw cellulose and the residues. The results demonstrate that this consecutive dissolution and in situ catalysis process is much more dependent on the dissolution capability of ionic liquid solvent, while comparatively, the effect of in situ acid catalysis is relatively insignificant. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Laccase enzyme was used as a pretreatment agent to delignify empty fruit bunches (EFB) for sugar production. The degree of delignification of the biomass was assessed directly by the percentage of pre-pretreatment weight loss (%) after pretreatment and indirectly by the amount of total sugar produced after saccharification of the pretreated biomass with cellulase enzymes. Process parameters such as pretreatment time, temperature, enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, pH, and substrate size were studied using a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) analysis. The combined effect of temperature and pH on the pretreatment was studied using the face-centered central composite design (FCCCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized conditions for EFB pretreatment using laccase enzyme were achieved as follows: sample size, 2 mm; temperature, 25 °C; time, 4 h; substrate concentration, 5% (w/v); pH 5; and enzyme concentration, 20 IU/g of EFB. Although higher pretreatment was achieved with substrates of 1 mm size and at a temperature of 35 °C, these conditions were not considered energetically sustainable because of the need for energy during milling for sample size reduction and energy for temperature maintenance at 35 °C.

AB  - A sensor based in a graphite-polyurethane composite electrode modified with the mesoporous nanostructured silica with hexagonal array of pores called Santa Barbara Amorphous type material (SBA-15) containing nickel was built. The presence of Ni, incorporated during the synthesis of SBA-15, resulted in an increase in sensitivity when compared to the other electrodes based on the unmodified SBA-15. A procedure was proposed for the determination of Cu2+ in ethanol biofuel by square wave stripping voltammetry with linear response in concentration levels of 1.0×10-8 and 1.0×10-7molL-1, resulting in a limit of detection of 1.83×10-10molL-1 and precision (RSD) of 2.09%. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Karanja oil, containing 6.2% free fatty acids (FFAs), was considered for biodiesel production using a single-step solid-phase acid catalyzed process. Different types of zeolites and Amberlyst15 catalysts were tested and biodiesel was produced. Under similar conditions, the highest biodiesel yield was achieved using an Amberlyst15 catalyst, which contained 3-5% of moisture. The effects of operating parameters of the reaction such as reaction temperature, catalyst amount, and methanol-to-oil ratio were studied. An increase of methanol:oil ratio revealed a non-monotonic increase in biodiesel yields. Similar non-monotonic behavior was observed when Jatropha oil was used. Leaching and catalyst reusability were also considered. No significant effects of leaching were observed and catalyst reusability appeared to be affected by methanol interactions. The presence of a co-solvent, Tetrahydrofuran (THF), increased the biodiesel yield. Furthermore, an optimum amount of THF (THF:methanol volume ratio of 1:2) gave rise to the highest biodiesel yield. A biodiesel yield of 93% was achieved at 120 °C using a single-step process with Amberlyst15 as a catalyst, THF as a co-solvent, and a methanol:oil ratio of 30:1. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Conversion of Pongammia de-oiled seed cake to liquid biofuel at hydrothermal conditions is reported in this work. The main objectives were to identify an approach that would enable us to understand and optimize the relationships between process parameters. In this work, estimation of the optimized conditions for the maximization of two responses namely biocrude yield and transportation grade fuel (TGF) selective has been reported. Plackett–Burman design was used for parameter screening on seven different process parameters for biocrude yield. Further, centre composite design and response surface methodology approach were used to develop the quadratic models to study the effect of individual and combined interactions on the biocrude yield as well as TGF selectivity on four parameters. Quadratic models were modified for the significant (p &lt; 0.05) individual, quadratic, and interaction terms. Based on the statistical results, it is concluded that temperature is the most significant individual parameter for biocrude yield, whereas for TGF selectivity, all four parameters, considered for statistical analysis, are important. Temperature with pressure and temperature with time are the major interaction with p ≤ 0.05 for biocrude yield. In the case of TGF selectivity, temperature and pressure are the only significant interaction. Superimposed contour plots and predicted model confirmed 400 °C (temperature), 25 kg/cm2 (pressure), 35 min (reaction time) and 2 W/B ratio as optimal conditions for the maximum biocrude yield (~38.9 %) and TGF selectivity (~29.6 %). Verification experiments confirmed the validity of the predicted model. The predicted and experimentally obtained yields for biocrude and TGF selectivity were comparable with an error of ±12.5 and ±8.5 %, respectively. TGF fraction obtained at these conditions was characterized by silica gel adsorption chromatography, calorific value, total acidic number elemental composition and FTIR analysis, which showed a high percentage of oxygenated compounds. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The conversion of biomass into biofuels can reduce the strategic vulnerability of petroleum-based systems and at the same time have a positive effect on global climate issues. Lignocellulose is the cheapest and most abundant source of biomass and consequently has been widely considered as a source for liquid fuel. However, despite ongoing efforts, cellulosic biofuels are still far from commercial realization, one of the major bottlenecks being the hydrolysis of cellulose into simpler sugars. Inspired by the structural and functional modularity of cellulases used by many organisms for the breakdown of cellulose, we propose to mimic the cellulose binding domain (CBD) and the catalytic domain of these proteins by small molecular entities. Multiple copies of these mimics could subsequently be tethered together to enhance hydrolytic activity. In this work, we take the first step toward achieving this goal by applying computational approaches to the design of efficient, cost-effective mimetics of the CBD. The design is based on low molecular weight peptides that are amenable to large-scale production. We provide an optimized design of four short (i.e., ∼18 residues) peptide mimetics based on the three-dimensional structure of a known CBD and demonstrate that some of these peptides bind cellulose as well as or better than the full CBD. The structures of these peptides were studied by circular dichroism and their interactions with cellulose by solid phase NMR. Finally, we present a computational strategy for predicting CBD/peptide-cellulose binding free energies and demonstrate its ability to provide values in good agreement with experimental data. Using this computational model, we have also studied the dissociation pathway of the CBDs/peptides from the surface of cellulose. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A magnetic catalyst (sample MCat) consisting of KI supported on a mixture of silica and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) was prepared and used in the transesterification reaction for the synthesis of biodiesel. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrum of the catalyst showed signals due to Si, Fe, K, and I. Powder X-ray diffraction data revealed the amorphous nature of the SiO2 and the duly impregnation of the support with KI. 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and magnetization measurements confirmed the ferrimagnetic iron oxide in the catalyst to be maghemite. N2 adsorption-desorption data indicated that the silica is mesoporous with a specific area of 352 m2 g-1, enabling the impregnation of 40 and 11 wt.% of KI and maghemite, respectively, according to the chemical composition obtained by the X-ray fluorescence measurements. The MCat was found to be efficient in the transesterification reaction in the macaúba and soybean oils. The MCat was easily removed from the reaction medium, with a hand magnet, and efficiently reused for more four consecutive reaction cycles. The good catalytic activity along with its magnetic behavior, high chemical stability and recyclability make the MCat a suitable material for the green synthesis of biodiesel. ©2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - A high performance bioanode based on a nitrogen-doped short tubular carbon (N-STC) loaded Au nanoparticle (Au NP) co-immobilized mediator and glucose oxidase (GOD) was developed for glucose/ O2 biofuel cells (BFCs). Ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (Fc), as the mediator, was covalently linked with L-cysteine (CYS) and then immobilized on the surface of Au NP modified N-STCs through the Au–S bond to obtain Fc-CYS-Au/N-STC hybrids. GOD was then immobilized on the surface of the hybrids with glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking. The resulting GOD/Fc-CYS-Au/N-STC modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode exhibited good catalytic activity towards glucose oxidation and excellent stability. For the assembled glucose/O2 BFC with the GOD/Fc-CYS-Au/N-STC electrode as the bioanode and a commercial E-TEK Pt/C modified GC electrode as the cathode, the open circuit potential is 0.71 V and the maximum power density of 83.6 mW cm2 can be achieved at 0.21 V. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - We performed fast pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch (EFB) in the range of temperature from 400∼550°C and 1.3 s of residence time. The effect of temperature on the yields and physicochemical properties of pyrolytic products were also studied. Elemental and component analysis of EFB showed that the large amount of potassium (ca. 8400 ppm) presents in the feedstock. Thermogravimetric analysis suggested that the potassium in the feedstock catalyzed degradation of cellulose. The yield of bio-oil increased with increasing temperature in the range of temperature from 400∼ 500°C, while that of gas and biochar decreased and showed monotonous change each with increasing temperature. When the EFB was pyrolyzed at 550°C, the yield of bio-oil and char decreased while that of gas increased. Water content of the bio-oils obtained at different temperatures was 20∼30% and their total acid number were less than 100 mg KOH/g oil. Viscosity of the bio-oils was 11 cSt (centistoke), and heating value varied from 15 to 17 MJ/kg. Using GC/MS analysis, 27 chemical compounds which were classified into two groups (cellulose-derived and lignin-derived) were identified. Remarkably the concentration of phenol was approximately 25% based on entire chemical compounds.

AB  - Lignocellulose derived halogenated furfurals are important chemicals that can serve as starting materials for diverse products such as drugs, polymers and fuels, including fuel additives. In this paper a protocol for the synthesis of 5-chloromethyl furfural (CMF) and 5-bromomethyl furfural (BMF) is put forward. The proposed process is based on a two liquid phases reaction composed of an aqueous hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid phase and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) organic phase. We have optimized and compared the yields of CMF and BMF in an open flask and in a closed reaction vessels. Utilization of the close reaction vessel resulted in not only higher yields in a shorter reaction time but also eliminated the necessity of the customary lithium salts additives previously advocated for this process. These additives were required in the open reaction systems in order to achieve reasonable yields. While a closed reaction vessel was previously reported for the production of CMF, and in this work its production was further improved, it is the first time a close vessel protocol for the production of BMF has been reported. In addition, improvement of the substrate to organic solvent ratio has been carried while yields of halogenated furfurals were maintained almost intact. NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy were used for identification and quantification of the products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for process optimization to immobilize glucose oxidase (GOx) on ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC). Results showed that the maximum GOx adsorption on OMC was 37.38 mg g-1 OMC with the activity of 8531.59 U g-1 GOx-immobilized OMC under the optimized conditions. The interaction effect between GOx, OMC concentration and NaCl and pH were observed. By immobilizing GOx on OMC, we can improve the retained catalyst activity at high temperature (37.3°C) and shift the optimum reaction pH towards a high value (pH 7.2). The electrochemical characteristics of immobilized GOx can also be enhanced with higher current peak (85.12 μA cm-2) and lower reduction potential. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - In recent years, the rapidly growing consumption of fossil fuels negatively affects the environment and public health has attracted much attention. Much effort has been made to find a clean and renewable alternative energy. Bio-oil, produced by flash pyrolysis, is one of the more encouraging products for valorisation of biomass. It has been identified as a promising alternative energy source for fossil fuel owing to its outstanding characteristics such as higher energy density, more suitable for storage and transportation, less capital investment than any other products of biomass. However, the nature of bio-oil contains high acidity, strong corrosiveness, low heating value, thermal instability and chemical complexity, which severely restrict its wide range of applications as a high quality energy. Therefore, it is necessary to upgrade bio-oil. The upgrading techniques include steam reforming, esterification, emulsification, hydrodeoxygenation, catalytic pyrolysis etc. In this paper, catalytic pyrolysis experiments were performed in a fixed bed with inner diameter of 16mm and height of 380mm for bio-oil model compounds (diacetone alcohol, furfural, ethyl acetate and guaiacol) over different characteristics zeolites (HY, HZSM-5, ZSM-5, P/ZSM-5, La/ZSM-5, Ni/ZSM-5) at the condition of T=400℃, WHSV=4 h-1. The catalysts physical properties were investigated by BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area) analyse. Water content was detected by using the method of Karl Fischer (870 KF Titrino). The GC-MS was used to analyze the major constituents of the pyrolytic products qualitatively and quantitatively. After the addition of La, the pore size increased from 0.61 nm (ZSM-5) to 0.89 nm (La-ZSM-5). On the contrary, the pore size of P modified ZSM-5 is 0.49 nm which is smaller than that of ZSM-5.The pyrolytic products of the model compounds included organic fraction, water, coke and gas. Compared with ZSM-5, the coke deposition over the La modified ZSM-5 decreased from 2.61% to 1.99% and the organic fraction increased dramatically from 46.10% to 61.51%, which showed the best performance in terms of products distribution among all modified catalyst. The conversions of overall model components and single model component were calculated respectively. The difficulty of the model components pyrolysis is guaiacol &gt; furfural &gt; ethyl acetate&gt;diacetone alcohol. By adding catalysts, the conversion of totally compounds were increased in different degrees, which meaned zeolite promoted the degree of catalytic pyrolysis. HZSM-5 had a best catalytic pyrolysis activity with the highest totally compounds conversion rate of 65.98%. There was a slight decline in the conversion of model compounds contrasted ZSM-5 with La/P/Ni modified ZSM-5.The major components of catalytic pyrolysis were aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, phenols and so on. It means that a series of decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions were taken place during the pyrolysis process. On the one hand, the reduction of the oxygen content of bio-oil help to improve its stability, on the other hand it will enhance its heating value. The optimal selectivity of aromatic reached 7.36% over HZSM-5. The La modified ZSM-5 improved the selectivity of aromatic from 6.72% to 7.28%. The highest yield of saturated alcohol was 7.1% over ZSM-5 and decreased using modified ZSM-5.According to the catalytic pyrolysis products distribution, the different reaction pathways for model compounds were discussed, which provided a theoretical basis for experimental study of upgrading bio-oil. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - In the article, a new biofuel named ethylene glycol monomethyl ether palm oil monoester (EGMMEPOM) is developed as a clean alternative fuel for diesel engine. It was synthesized through transesterification reaction with a refined palm oil and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGMME) as reactants and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst under certain conditions. Its chemical structure was identified through Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses, and its main fuel properties were measured precisely. A two-cylinder diesel engine was utilized to investigate its combustion performances, fuel economy and emissions characteristics. When the engine was operated with the new biofuel at a high speed of 2000 r/min instead of diesel fuel, smoke emissions were decreased by 26.3% to 70.0% with carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon compounds (HC) emissions significantly reduced. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were decreased by 14.0% to 23.5%. The new palm oil monoester has a cetane number as high as 77.0 which leads to a shorter autoignition delay duration than diesel fuel and makes the curves of in-cylinder pressure increasing rate and heat release rate shift forward 2 to 3 degrees crank angle (°CA). Owing to more amount of oxygen existing in the new biofuel, both peak in-cylinder pressure increasing rate and peak heat releasing rate decreased. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Waste cooking oil is a potential substitution of refined vegetable oil for the production of biodiesel due to the low cost of raw material and for solving their disposal problem. In this study, optimization of esterification process of free fatty acids in artificially acidified soybean oil with oleic acid has been carried out using methanol as an agent and ion exchange resin as a heterogeneous catalyst. The esterification reaction has been investigated based on the mass balance of the developed model. The model has been validated against experimental data and effects of temperature and catalyst weight have been analyzed. Thereafter, optimization process has been fulfilled for two different objective functions as conversion of acid oil and benefit. Optimization results indicated that the maximum conversion of acid is 95.95%, which is achievable at 4.48-g catalyst loading and reaction temperature of 120°C. Maximum benefit was obtained as US$0.057 per batch of reaction at a catalyst amount of 1 g and temperature of 120°C. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass conversion to produce biofuels has received significant attention because of the quest for a replacement for fossil fuels. Among the various thermochemical and biochemical routes, fast pyrolysis followed by catalytic hydrotreating is considered to be a promising near-term opportunity. This paper reports on experimental methods used 1) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to produce bio-oils in a fluidized-bed reactor and 2) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for catalytic hydrotreating of bio-oils in a two-stage, fixed-bed, continuous-flow catalytic reactor. The configurations of the reactor systems, the operating procedures, and the processing and analysis of feedstocks, bio-oils, and biofuels are described in detail in this paper. We also demonstrate hot-vapor filtration during fast pyrolysis to remove fine char particles and inorganic contaminants from bio-oil. Representative results showed successful conversion of biomass feedstocks to fuel-range hydrocarbon biofuels and, specifically, the effect of hot-vapor filtration on bio-oil production and upgrading. The protocols provided in this report could help to generate rigorous and reliable data for biomass pyrolysis and bio-oil hydrotreating research. © 2016 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

AB  - This study reveals the synthesis of biofuel (BF) from Simarouba glauca (SG) oil through the process of transesterification using honeycomb (HC) coated with modified forms of zirconia as basic catalysts. Zirconia and its modified forms such as zirconia-calcia and zirconia-magnesia were coated on monoliths by the dip-dry method and were characterized for their surface basicity, powder X-ray diffraction, infrared, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The effect of incorporation of calcium/magnesium ions on the basicity, crystallinity, and catalytic activity of zirconia is discussed. Kinetic study reveals that zirconia-calcia coated on the HC exhibits the lowest energy of activation (Ea) in transesterification and hence is an efficient catalyst for BF synthesis. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Energy, liquid biofuels and chemicals can be produced from biomass via gasification followed by gas cleaning over ZrO2-based catalysts. When a small amount of oxygen is added, ZrO2-based catalysts can be utilized in tar decomposition reactions (tar molecules need to be removed before further use). Oxidation of toluene as tar model compound was studied by temperature-programmed experiments over ZrO2, Y2O3-ZrO2 and SiO2-ZrO2. In the first part of this study (Part A: Effect of oxygen on the formation of primary products), special attention was given to the effect of oxygen amount on the formation of synthesis gas components (CO and H2) from toluene. The data obtained in Part A was extended and subjected to kinetic modeling. As a result, the reaction mechanism of toluene oxidation over ZrO2-based catalysts was discovered. The first step in toluene oxidation is the adsorption of toluene as a benzyl species. Next, the surface benzyl species is oxidized, possibly via superoxide surface species (O2-), into four products in a single net primary reaction. Oxidation of CO and H2 are the secondary reactions in the model. Furthermore, the present study clearly demonstrates the strength of temperature programming as a transient technique for comprehensive mechanistic investigations, kinetic model development and parameter estimation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diverse methods for converting biomass into fuels are necessary for the functioning of a flexible and profitable biorefinery. Catalytic hydrocracking of fatty acids and their derivatives, which can be used as biofuels precursors, is rather scarce. In this work we introduce a highly selective hydrocracking process for castor oil fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) over a bifunctional polyoxometalate (POM) catalyst. Keggin-type polyoxometalates catalysts, with tungsten as addenda atoms, were examined in this research. Nickel substituted Keggin polyoxometalate, K6[SiNi(H2O)W11O39]⋅13H2O (Ni-POM), supported over γ-alumina, demonstrated the highest activity towards selective hydrocracking on a specific position in methyl ricinoleate, which is the predominant component of castor oil FAME. In addition, hydrogenation is unavoidable in this reaction and hydrogenation products, such as those with reduced double bond or without the hydroxyl group of methyl ricinoleate, are always present. The Ni-POM catalyst and other examined polyoxometalates catalysts were characterized using XRD, EDX, XPS and BET. The products were identified with GC-MS and their yields were recorded with GC. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The biomass char has an important influence on the release of volatile during the fast pyrolysis processes due to its complex structure features and the presence of inorganic minerals. Furthermore, as inherent catalysts, the large content of salts in biomass promotes the char to react with volatile. Thus this study aims to investigate the influence of char and inorganic salts on the volatile-char interactions. Experiments were conducted on a two-stage system with the same temperature of 500℃. Char pretreatments i.e. acid washing and salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2 and FeCl3) impregnating were introduced. Volatile derived from cotton stalk pyrolysis got reaction under the presence of fresh char with different mass. The condensed bio-oil obtained from the pyrolysis with and without the catalysts (cotton stalk char) was characterized by the GC-MS (gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer) analyses. The non-condensed pyrolysis gas via the filter and drier was characterized by the GC. The results indicated that: with the increasing of the mass of cotton stalk char, its ability of promoting the secondary cracking of pyrolysis volatile became stronger. As a result, the liquid bio-oil yield decreased from 56.70% to 51.32%, while the yield of small molecular gases continued to increase from 17.88% to 22.13%. When the dosage of the cotton stalk char was 2.0 g, the highest gas yield of 22.1% was obtained. When the cotton stalk char was added in the pyrolysis, the acids, aldehydes and lipid content declined sharply. It is deduced that the cotton stalk char plays an inhibiting effect in the formation of them. At the same time, this inhibiting effect is conducive to the formation of more phenols. After deliming, semi-coke group structure will weaken the inhibition of the formation of acids in the volatile. Likewise, the capacity of phenolic enrichment is also reduced. The cotton stalk loaded with metal chloride enhanced the semi-coke's effects on the volatile catalytic cracking and restructuring, generating the gas with smaller molecule. When loaded with KCl, the capacity of cotton stalk char to the secondary catalysis of volatile was enhanced. Compared with the cotton stalk char with pickling, the gas yield was increased under the pyrolysis with the fresh cotton stalk. It is deduced that the metal ions play more significant effects on the volatile reaction during the catalytic reforming. The metal ions could promote the conversion of CO2 and CH4. Meanwhile, Fe played the best promoting effect on the hydrogen yield, and the hydrogen content was up to 12.96%. When the cotton stalks char were loaded with the KCl and MgCl2, the content of CO contained in the non-condensed gas was increasing sharply. In the respect of the capacity of volatile cracking, the metal ions were stronger than simply increasing the quality of cotton stalk char in the lower catalytic section. The order of metal ions to the enrichment of phenolic was depicted as follows: K+&gt;Na+&gt;Fe2+&gt;Mg2+. For deliming cotton stalk char, it also benefitted the forming of the phenol, although most metal ions had been removed. It is concluded that the skeleton structure of cotton stalk char plays an effect on the volatile cracking. The fresh cotton stalk inhibited the formation of furans. However, the cotton stalk char promoted the yield of furans to increase, reaching 14.26%. Picking and loading with different metal ions played a different role in the yield of bio-oil. The catalysis and the structure both worked in the pyrolysis. The presence of metal ions also promoted the decomposition of acids, esters and aldehydes. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Green and efficient production of biodiesel from cheap and non-edible resources is highly desirable. Here we develop a practical method for the high-yielding one-pot conversion of low-cost waste grease to biodiesel (FAME) by using wet cells of E. coli expressing intracellular Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) as catalyst. E. coli (TLL) was genetically engineered and grew easily to a high cell density with the functional expression of TLL. The easily available and easy to handle wet cells were directly used as catalyst for the biotransformation of waste grease to FAME, with water content of 20–30 wt% (based on grease) and stepwise addition of methanol (4:1 molar ratio to grease) as the optimum conditions. Biotransformation of waste grease from Singapore (21 wt% FFA) and Malaysia (9.8 wt% FFA) with 31 wt% wet cells (26 wt% water) gave 99% and 97% FAME yield, respectively. During the biotransformation, the esterification of FFA was faster than the transesterification of triglycerides and the hydrolysis of triglycerides, and nearly no hydrolysis of FAME was observed. Preparative biotransformation was demonstrated to give FAME in >90% yield with a simple isolation procedure. The wet cells were recyclable and retained 55% productivity in the 5th cycle. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel possesses the record of mostly investigated eco-friendly biofuels, which can be fashioned by transesterification of natural fatty acids. Large volume of waste stream glycerol is generated as a byproduct during the production of biofuel. Disposal of this glycerol without proper treatment in the environment is hazardous as it contains copious impurities like methanol, organic salts, free fatty acids and water. Alternatively, waste stream glycerol can be utilized as cheap carbon source for the production of high-value chemicals like ethanol, citric acid, propanediol etc. In this study, waste glycerol was partially purified to increase its concentration by sequential steps like distillation, acidification and adsorption process to utilize it effectively as carbon source for the microorganisms. The concentration of acidified glycerol treated with sulphuric acid was found to be high when compared with phosphoric acid. The glycerol rich phase was high in phosphoric acid and GC-MS studies also reveal that the phosphoric acid removes major impurities when compared with sulphuric acid. The purified glycerol obtained could be stored and used as a carbon source for the production of high value chemical. © 2016 Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - The catalytic and non-catalytic fast pyrolysis process for converting Kraft pulp paper waste into bio-oil and biochar was studied. Catalysis free pyrolysis of untreated Kraft pulp resulted on good yields of bio-oil (39% at 400 °C), showing a relative high concentration of levoglucosan, while phosphoric acid-pretreated pulp produced lower yields of bio-oil (max. value 14% at 350 °C) being levoglucosenone the main component. The catalytic pyrolysis of pretreated pulp employing silica led to a high yield of the liquid fraction (57% at 400 °C) with a high selectivity to levoglucosan. The biochar produced from as received pulp could be envisaged for soil amendment. It displayed a relatively high specific surface area, showing micro and mesoporosity. Besides, no phytotoxic effect of the biochar obtained at 350 °C was recorded. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The integration utilization of fermentation residues from cellulosic bio-ethanol has attracted a great deal of attention to balance the total cost of bio-ethanol production while simultaneously dealing with bio-ethanol wastewater. A process of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of intact materials from cellulosic bio-ethanol in a batch reactor was proposed. The effects of the reaction temperature and time on the liquefaction characteristics were examined. The optimum condition for liquefaction fermentation residues was 370 °C (21.25 MPa) and 30 min with a bio-oil yield of 40.79 wt%. GC-MS results indicated that the major chemical species in the bio-oil were phenols, ketones, long-chain hydrocarbons and fatty acids. Supercritical conditions (375 °C, 23.50 MPa) was favored for the low-molecular-weight species formation compared to subcritical conditions (370 °C, 21.25 MPa), as some long-chain species decreased. This work thus can provide a novel idea for bio-oil production from HTL of cellulosic bio-ethanol fermentation residues. © 2016

AB  - Methanol is found to be a major product when glycerol decomposes under supercritical water conditions. Glycerol is a significant byproduct of biodiesel waste streams, the value of which is decreasing as biodiesel output increases. The transformation of glycerol into methanol, which is a feedstock for biodiesel production, would potentially reduce the costs and climate impact of biodiesel production. The highest yield of methanol was found at 450 °C, 300 bar after 30 min residence time. Addition of ethylsulfide increases the rate but does not improve the methanol yield. At longer residence times, methanol and acetaldehyde were consumed and acetic acid was produced. The generation of significant quantities of methanol (non-catalytically) from glycerol was not previously observed, and thus no mechanism for methanol production had been proposed in the published literature. A detailed kinetic model for the glycerol plus supercritical water system was constructed using the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software package. All the parameter values in this large model were predicted a priori based on quantum chemistry calculations; none were adjusted to try to match our data, which serves as a test set for the model predictions. The a priori kinetic model predicts yields of acrolein, acetic acid and acetaldehyde similar to those measured by previous researchers. However, the model underpredicted the yield of methanol measured in our experiments. We speculate that the generation of higher concentrations of methanol in our experiments than in prior work might be due to catalytic reactions on the reactor walls, since our reactor has different metallurgy than those used in prior studies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass is considered to the most promising feedstock with low carbon intensity for producing renewable and clean alternative fuels due to their abundant reserves, wide distribution and carbon neutral. In this study, direct liquefaction of Spartina alterniflora was performed in a 50 mL bath reactor with ethanol and water as a co-solvent. Experiments for optimal operating conditions such as reaction temperature, ethanol volume fraction in ethanol-water co-solvent and solvent to biomass ratio were conducted to understand its influence on liquefaction product distribution. Raw material and bio-oil were analyzed by thermogravimetry analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results showed that thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves of Spartina alterniflora were almost the same with the increase of heating rate from 10 to 40℃ /min. However, the temperature where the maximum rate of weight loss occurred, tended to move to higher value. This suggested that there was a hysteresis phenomenon on thermogravimetric characteristics of Spartina alterniflora with respect to the heating rate, which was caused by the combination of time and temperature. The bio-oil yield tended to increase but the solid residue yield tended to decrease with increasing temperature up to 340℃, while further increasing temperature increased the residue yield but decreased the bio-oil yield. The similar tendency for bio-oil yield and solid residue yield was observed when increasing ethanol volume fraction in ethanol-water co-solvent between 0 and 100%. As the solvent to biomass ratio increased from 6 to 10 mL/g, the bio-oil yield increased obviously and after that the trend went opposite. Meanwhile, the solid residue yield reduced gradually with the solvent to biomass ratio in the range of 6-10 mL/g and leveled after higher than about 15 mL/g. Optimal operating conditions were reaction temperature of 340℃, ethanol volume fraction in co-solvent of 50% and solvent to biomass ratio of 10 mL/g, resulting the highest bio-oil yield of 44.2% and minimum solid residue yield of 12%, respectively. Compared with single solvent like pure water or ethanol, ethanol-water co-solvent showed an obvious synergistic effect during direct liquefaction of Spartina alterniflora. Not only the yield of bio-oil was enhanced but also the quality of bio-oil was improved with ethanol-water co-solvent as the reaction medium. The result of GC-MS analysis indicated that the bio-oil obtained from direct liquefaction of Spartina alterniflora at optimal operating conditions was a complex and oxygen-containing organic mixture, mainly including acids, phenols, esters and ketones. The major components of bio-oil were phenols (29.62%) and esters (11.27%). The presence of ethanol could promote the formation of esters by reacting with acids through esterification while the majority of phenols were derived from the decomposition of lignin. Ester compounds were similar to biodiesel in composition. Thus, it was desirable to increase the amount of esters in bio-oil for a better bio-oil quality. The energy recover rate of bio-oil obtained from direct liquefaction in ethanol-water co-solvent with 50% ethanol volume fraction reached up to 76.5%, which was significantly higher than that in single solvent. Therefore, ethanol-water co-solvent was a potential medium with higher bio-oil energy recover during direct liquefaction of biomass. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Biofuel sector has been promoted in France for its environmental and societal advantages. However, controversial issues have emerged, especially on avoided GHG emissions, raising uncertainties regarding its future development. For an actor, investing in the appropriate pathway is yet not straightforward as resource availability, process efficiency and costs are uncertain and regulatory framework will impact future technological choices among current, second or third generation production processes. A better understanding of the dynamic of the whole industry is thus needed for informed policy. This paper relies on a TIMES prospective model of French bioenergy sector we developed that gives a dynamic technology allocation under constraints. We find that avoided emissions of the biofuel sector could range from 12 MtCO2eq for current regulatory context to 16 MtCO2eq for the future one. The higher is the mitigation level, the higher is the associated abatement cost: from less than 200 €/tCO2eq to more than 6000 €/tCO2eq as it would imply the development of advanced processes, such as algae biofuels. Externalities play a significant role on the technology merit order, and must also be considered for designing future incentive policy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic steam reforming of model oxygenates of bio-oil for hydrogen production was studied over La modified Ni/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by an impregnation-co-precipitation method and characterized by various characterization techniques. Characterization results revealed that a homogeneous CeO2–ZrO2–La2O3 (CeZrLa) solid solution was formed during support preparation and the Ni-impregnated catalysts demonstrated strong metal-support interaction. The hydrogen selectivity for the catalyst doped with 5 wt% La2O3 was significantly higher than that for other La content, and CO and CH4 selectivity also reduced. Conversion showed a sharp rise with increasing temperature from 600 to 800 °C, whereas hydrogen yield and selectivity exhibited maxima at 700 °C. At higher temperature, conversion increased due to steam reforming of oxygenates, while hydrogen yield decreased since the water gas shift reaction proceeds in the reverse direction. Increasing the space–time from 350 to 700 gcat s/gbio-oil, conversion increased from 60 to 85 % and hydrogen yield increased from 42 to 70 % due to the availability of greater contact time of the reactants with the catalyst. No significant decrease in selectivity or conversion was observed for 20 h, indicating that the Ni/CeZrLa (5) catalyst is quite stable. In the spent catalyst obtained after reaction, there is evidence of formation of La2O2CO3, which plays a key role in coke gasification and prolonged activity of the catalyst. Negligible coke deposition was found for the spent Ni/CeZrLa (5) catalyst compared to the undoped catalyst. The results revealed that the presence of lanthana helps in enhancing catalyst life by providing resistance to coking. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The simultaneous rise in commodity prices and the global production of biofuels, between 2007 and 2008, strengthened discussions, which persist currently, about the competition of land use between biofuel production and food production. The objective of this paper is to compare and evaluate the arguments from both sides. The methodology used was an analysis of the relevant and comprehensive reports and manuscripts on the topic, comparing them to the available data from international organizations and agencies. Biodiesel received special attention in this analysis. The conclusion is that hunger and poverty problems are due to structural and historical roots and they do not have a cause-effect relationship with biodiesel production. In fact, the production of biodiesel, under specific regulatory and production conditions, can be a driver of economic development improving energy security and promoting social inclusion in poor countries, which still have land available for agriculture. © 2016 International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

AB  - The hydrodynamically thinned diffusion layer at a sinusoidally rocking disc is approximately uniform and can be expressed in terms of a diffusion layer thickness (Formula presented.) with D, the diffusion coefficient of the redox active species, v, the kinematic viscosity, Θ, the total rocking angle (here 90 degrees), and f, the rocking frequency (ranging here from 0.83 to 25 Hz). For the one-electron oxidation of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in aqueous carbonate buffer pH 9.5, it is shown that there is quantitative agreement between the expression for the diffusion layer thickness and experimental data. Next, for seven primary alcohols, the catalytic TEMPO-mediated oxidation mechanism is investigated under rocking disc conditions. Chemical rate constants are evaluated (by varying the diffusion layer thickness) employing the DigiElch4.F simulation package. Trends in the chemical rate constants (compared with DFT calculations) suggest enhanced reactivity for methanol versus higher primary alcohols and for aromatic versus non-aromatic primary alcohols. Rocking disc voltammetry allows quantitative mechanistic analysis in the laminar flow regime. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - A novel synthesis method was developed to prepare a silica-supported monoclinic molybdenum dioxide (MoO2/SiO2) catalyst via calcination of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/SiO2 in N2 flow with 0.1 vol % O2. MoO2/SiO2 was employed as a catalyst for sawdust hydroliquefaction in ethanol at 320 °C under an initial H2 pressure (IHP) of 2-6 MPa, and the bio-oil yield as high as 72.3% was obtained under an IHP of 6 MPa. The high catalytic activity of MoO2/SiO2 should be attributed to the efficient cleavage of H2 on the surface of highly dispersed MoO2, which shows an unusual metallic characteristic. The obtained bio-oil was analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and the main organic compounds detected by GC/MS were phenolics and ethyl esters. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Rhizopus chinensis cells immobilized on loofah (Luffa cylindrica) sponges were used to produce biodiesel via the transesterification of soybean oil. In whole-cell immobilization, loofah sponge is considered to be a superior alternative to conventional biomass carriers because of its biodegradable and renewable properties. During cell cultivation, Rhizopus chinensis mycelia can spontaneously and firmly adhere to the surface of loofah sponge particles. The optimal conditions for processing 9.65 g soybean oil at 40°C and 180 rpm using a 3:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio were found to be 8% cell addition and 3-10% water content (depending on the oil’s weight). Under optimal conditions, an over 90% methyl ester yield was achieved after the first reaction batch. The operational stability of immobilized Rhizopus chinensis cells was assayed utilizing a 1:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, thus resulting in a 16.5-fold increase in half-life when compared with immobilized cells of the widely studied Rhizopus oryzae. These results suggest that transesterification of vegetable oil using Rhizopus chinensis whole cells immobilized onto loofah sponge is an effective approach for biodiesel production. © 2016 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Temperature programmed pyrolysis of high acid value waste cottonseed oil (WCO) was carried out in a batch type reactor. A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) method, which did not require a carrier gas, was used to study the properties of oil products. Weight loss data were obtained at heating rates (from 5 to 15 °C min−1) and used to estimate the pyrolysis activation energy. A systematic study of the molecular weight distribution was made for the pyrolysis of WCO and virgin cottonseed oil at different heating rates. The yields of the products including: gases, liquids (collected pyrolytic oil), and solids (residual char) were quantified in this work. The production of pyrolysis gas was estimated during heating. The weight loss results indicated that the optimum pyrolysis rate occurred between 400 and 450 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 600 °C. Our work indicated that high acid value WCO yields comparatively greater volumes of gases and masses of residual products when compared to virgin cottonseed oil. After the temperature programmed pyrolysis of WCO (acid value 8.66 mg KOH g−1), at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, the average boiling point of the pyrolytic oil was ∼349 °C, which is significantly lower than that of the unprocessed WCO (456 °C). The pyrolytic oil produced in this process after esterification with methanol, was found to comply with biofuel specification requirements. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research focuses on the effects of microwave-assisted activated carbon fibre (ACF) (MW-ACF) treatment on sewage sludge at alkaline pH. The disintegration and biodegradability of sewage sludge were studied. It was found that the MW-ACF process at alkaline pH provided a rapid and efficient process to disrupt the microbial cells in the sludge. The results suggested that when irradiated at 800 W MW for 110 s with a dose of 1.0 g ACF/g solid concentration (SS) at pH 10.5, the MW-ACF pretreatment achieved 55% SS disintegration, 23% greater than the value of MW alone (32%). The concentration of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, supernatant soluble chemical oxygen demand, protein, and polysaccharide increased by 60%, 144%, 145%, 74%, and 77%, respectively. An increase in biogas production by 63.7% was achieved after 20 days of anaerobic digestion (AD), compared to the control. The results indicated that the MW-ACF pretreatment process at alkaline pH provides novel sludge management options in disintegration of sewage sludge for further AD. © IWA Publishing 2016.

AB  - This article presents experimental results of an autothermal scaled-down system for H2 production. Pure atmospheric pressure H2, separated in situ by Pd-Ag membranes, is produced by steam reforming (SR) of methane, ethanol, or glycerol. Oxidizing the SR effluents in a separate compartment supplies the heat. The oxidation feed is axially distributed to avoid hotspots. The 1.3 L system, comprises 100 cm2 of membrane area, and generates H2 flow rate equivalent to 0.15 kW at an efficiency of ∼25%. This process leads to comparable performance when different fuels are used. A mathematical model, validated by the measurements, predicts that increasing the membrane area relative to the outer surface area will substantially increase the efficiency and power output. This design serves as proof of concept for on-board pure H2 generators, with flexible fuel sources, and holds a great promise to reduce the need for special H2 transport and storage technologies for portable or stationary applications. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - ABSTRACT: To date, non-food vegetable oil has been considered as the primary source for biodiesel production. Rubber seed oil has high acid value (34 mgKOH/g) and can be used for biodiesel synthesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate esterification of fatty acid, which derived from rubber seed oil, in a plug flow reactor system at high temperature and low methanol consumption. Response surface methodology was applied for design experiment and optimization of esterification reaction. Temperature, methanol consumption, and sulfuric acid were chosen as variables to examine their influence in a conversion to methyl ester. At 140°C, at 5:1 methanol to fatty acid ratio (by mole), H2SO4 1.5 (%v/w), and space time 20 min, the conversion to methyl ester attained 98.2%. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used for analysis and to confirm the formation of methyl ester. Methyl ester was characterized for biodiesel fuel properties in accordance to ASTM standard. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Liquefaction of cornstalk for producing bio-oil was conducted with different solvents (water, ethanol, and acetone) at temperatures of 280, 320, and 360 °C. The distribution characteristics of the inorganic elements K, Na, Mg, Ca, Al, and Fe during liquefaction were studied. The results demonstrated that liquefaction temperature and solvent clearly affected the distribution. The inorganic elements distributed mainly into biochars (>60.0 wt %) with acetone and ethanol as solvent, with less than 26 wt % into the bio-oils; however, K and Na distributed mainly into aqueous phases with water as solvent, and Ca, Al, and Fe distributed mainly into biochars, with less than 31 wt % into the bio-oils. Increasing liquefaction temperature (320 to 360 °C) reduced the contents of inorganic elements in bio-oils. In addition, ICP-OES showed that the concentrations of inorganic elements in bio-oils were very high and also affected significantly by liquefaction temperature and solvent. The concentrations of K, Na, Mg, and Al in bio-oil obtained from water were higher than those obtained from acetone and ethanol; however, the concentrations of Ca and Fe in bio-oil obtained from acetone were higher than those obtained from water and ethanol. It was suggested that the bio-oil should be pretreated before utilization. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Aromatic hydrocarbons were produced from lignin, a complex natural amorphous polymer commonly regarded as by-product of the pulping process and from biofuel production. The catalytic decomposition of lignin using supported Pt catalysts was performed to produce small molecule hydrocarbons. Aromatic small-molecule hydrocarbon products were identified and quantified using GC/MS and GC-FID, which demonstrated that 27.6% of aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained from the activated carbon-supported Pt (Pt/AC) catalyst which had the highest Pt surface area.

AB  - A theoretical investigation on the esterification mechanism of free fatty acid (FFA) in waste cooking oils (WCOs) has been carried out using DMol3 module based on the density functional theory (DFT). Three potential pathways of FFA esterification reaction are designed to achieve the formation of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), and calculated results show that the energy barrier can be efficiently reduced from 88.597 kcal/mol to 15.318 kcal/mol by acid catalyst. The molar enthalpy changes (ΔrHm°) of designed pathways are negative, indicating that FFA esterification reaction is an exothermic process. The obtained favorable energy pathway is: H+ firstly activates FFA, then the intermediate combines with methanol to form a tetrahedral structure, and finally, producing FAME after removing a water molecule. The rate-determining step is the combination of the activated FFA with methanol, and the activation energy is about 11.513 kcal/mol at 298.15 K. Our results should provide basic and reliable theoretical data for further understanding the elimination mechanism of FFA over acid catalyst in the conversion of WCOs to biodiesel products. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biofuel offers a promising solution to the adverse environmental problems and depletion in reserves of fossil fuels. Higher alcohols including 3-methyl-1-butanol were paid much more attention as fuel substitute in recent years, due to its similar properties to gasoline. In the present work, 3-methyl-1-butanol production in engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum was studied. α-Ketoisovalerate decarboxylase gene (kivd) from Lactococcus lactis combined with alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adh2, adhA, and adh3) from three organisms were overexpressed in C. glutamicum. Enzymatic assay and alcohol production results showed that adh3 from Zymomonas mobilis was the optimum candidate for 3-methyl-1-butanol production in C. glutamicum. The recombinant with kivd and adh3 could produce 0.182 g/L of 3-methyl-1-butanol and 0.144 g/L of isobutanol after 12 h of incubation. Further inactivation of the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex gene (aceE) and lactic dehydrogenase gene (ldh) in the above C. glutamicum strain would improve the 3-Methyl-1-butanol titer to 0.497 g/L after 12 h of incubation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Anodic bioelectrodes for biofuel cells are more complex than cathodic bioelectrodes for biofuel cells, because laccase and bilirubin oxidase can individually catalyze four electron reduction of oxygen to water, whereas most anodic enzymes only do a single two electron oxidation of a complex fuel (i.e. glucose oxidase oxidizing glucose to gluconolactone while generating 2 electrons of the total 24 electrons), so enzyme cascades are typically needed for complete oxidation of the fuel. This review article will discuss the lessons learned from natural metabolic pathways about multi-step oxidation and how those lessons have been applied to minimal or artificial enzyme cascades.

AB  - Vegetable oils are used as raw materials for biodiesel production using transesterification reaction. Several methods for the production of biodiesel were developed using chemical (alkali and acidic compounds) and biological catalysts (lipases). Biodiesel production catalyzed by lipases is energy and cost-saving processes and is carried out at normal temperature and pressure. The need for an efficient method for screening larger number of variables has led to the adoption of statistical experimental design. In the present study, packed bed reactor was designed to study with mixed immobilized biocatalysts to have higher productivity under optimum conditions. Contrary to the single-step acyl migration mechanism, a two-step stepwise reaction mechanism involving immobilized Candida rugosa lipase and immobilized Rhizopus oryzae cells was employed for the present work. This method was chosen because enzymatic hydrolysis followed by esterification can tolerate high free fatty acid containing oils. The effects of flow rate and bed height on biodiesel yield were studied using two factors five-level central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM). Maximum biodiesel yield of 85 and 81 % was obtained for jatropha oil and karanja oil with the optimum bed height and optimum flow rate of 32.6 cm and 1.35 L/h, and 32.6 cm and 1.36 L/h, respectively. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of kitchen waste was processed for bio-oil production. The effects of reaction temperature and solid-liquid ratio on products distribution and bio-oil properties were investigated systematically. The highest bio-oil yield of 16.7% was obtained at 320℃ and 1:15. Further increasing temperature or decreasing solid-liquid ratio would promote gas formation. Bio-oil had higher oxygen and nitrogen content compared to heavy oil or residue oil. Over 50% of bio-oil fraction was in the naphtha, kerosene and AGO range. The higher heating value of bio-oil was 32.33-34.82 MJ·kg-1. Bio-oil was characterized using GC-MS, FT-IR and FT-ICR MS. Bio-oil was a complex mixture composed of hydrocarbons, acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters, amines, phenols, alcohols and N-heterocyclic compounds. Further analysis on the acidic compounds in bio-oil indicated that oxygenated compounds were primarily comprised of O2 and O3 species, nitrogenous compounds were mainly N1O2, N1O3 and N1O4 species. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - The aims of this work were to evaluate K2CO3 as a potent alkaline catalyst for in situ transesterification of Aurantiochytrium sp. KRS 101, one step process in which oil extraction and conversion take place together. This K2CO3-based in situ transesterification was optimized in terms of recovery yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by way of varying biomass concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst concentration. The optimal condition was achieved at 50 g/L of biomass concentration and 1% of K2CO3 in the methanol, 25 °C of reaction temperature, and 5 min of reaction time, resulting in the FAME recovery yield over 90%. It was found that K2CO3 performed better than any other tested catalysts including acids, supporting the notion that K2CO3 is a promising catalyst, especially for in situ transesterification. © 2016.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) porous palladium (Pd) nanostructures are electrodeposited by using the improved hydrogen template protocol, involving a key step of the potential pulse. In contrast to the conventional porous Pd catalysts, which are achieved by adopting the potentiostatic method in the reduction process, these 3D frameworks exhibit a unique fractal morphology and more-abundant electrochemical surface area. For the application in implantable glucose biofuel cells, the 3D porous Pd nanocatalysts show sufficient open-circuit potential (0.650±0.005V), high power density (5.7±0.4μWcm-2), and satisfying long-term stability (&lt;10% degradation 30days). This new procedure yields benefits such as rapid fabrication, mild conditions, pure products with a unique 3D porous structure, and the identical preparation technology for both the anode and cathode. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Second generation biofuel technologies are well investigated to extend the amount of sustainable biofuels. One of the most important criterions for biofuels is their profitability. The bioCRACK process is a new and innovative biomass-to-liquid concept to produce advanced biofuels by liquid-phase pyrolysis. A refinery integrated pilot plant was built up at the OMV refinery in Schwechat (Austria) to provide data for up-scaling. The objective of this publication was to test the suitability of different processed heat carrier oils derived from the bioCRACK process as feedstock for the FCC process. Vacuum gas oil - a typical feedstock for fluid catalytic cracking - was used as heat carrier oil. Different case studies were evaluated, whereas spruce wood and wheat straw were used as feedstock for pyrolysis. All experiments were conducted in a fully continuous small scale pilot plant with internally circulating fluidized bed design. In general, the obtained results show a high conversion efficiency for all performed case studies. Thereby the yield of coke is increased a little. The investigation confirmed that the total fuel yield can be improved even more by additional hydrotreatment. It turned out that the use of a pre-hydrotreated vacuum gas oil for pyrolysis leads to the highest conversion level. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Novel biodiesel or fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was produced from dried biomass of Schizochytrium limacinum with dimethyl carbonate over a time period of 30 min. The highest FAME yield could reach 84% at 85 °C with a ratio of dried biomass to dimethyl carbonate of 1:4 w/w, with extra solvent of petroleum ether, 1.5 wt. % methanesulfonic acid (based on oil weight) and an agitation speed of 150 rpm. Biomass dried with 60-120 silica gels at 38 °C for 30 min was investigated. FAME was purified using Amberlyst™ 15 dry resin. FAME was analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with the internal standard method. The properties of FAME met the international standard ASTM D 6751-02. The results revealed that all of the reaction variables in study had positive effects. Present study indicate that FAME could be a potential alternative to diesel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As with many substances derived from natural products, pyrolysis bio-oils are complex chemical mixtures and are extremely challenging to chemically characterize, requiring multiple separation and pretreatment steps followed by several different analytical techniques that need tedious adjustments and modifications when sample properties change. In this study, we present a way to simplify this analysis by using 13C NMR to characterize such substances as a whole without modification. Using partial least-squares (PLS) regression, we report what we believe to be the first reported use of 13C NMR to derive elemental composition information (mass fractions of C, H, N, and O) as well as the enthalpy of combustion (higher heating value), phenol and cresols concentrations, and the total acid number. Several PLS models were created correlating these various properties with the binned intensities of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 73 different samples consisting of pyrolysis bio-oils from various biomass sources and treatment protocols as well as finished fuels (gasoline, diesel, and biodiesel) and small molecule standards. Two models based exclusively on 13C NMR data demonstrated the best overall ability to predict these same properties for unknown samples. The R2 and RMSE of the predicted values are discussed in detail and are acceptable for many biofuel-related applications. That such properties and compositional measurements may be extracted from 13C NMR spectra is a direct result of the detailed chemical structural information influencing the chemical shifts and resonance patterns. Because these models were built using a wide range of samples and conditions, they are expected to also be useful for a wider range of applications. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

AB  - In this investigation a range of ketone biofuels produced from the alkylation of isoamyl alcohol and isobutanol were examined as potential blending agents with Jet A-1 aviation kerosene. The fuels were synthesized under solvent-free conditions using a Pd/C catalyst with K3PO4, previously reported for the alkylation of acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixtures. Reasonable yields and selectivity were achieved for branched alkylation products with up to 61% produced from isoamyl alcohol and 64% from isobutanol. The key aviation fuel properties of the mixtures were tested unblended and in 50% and 20% blends with Jet A-1 aviation kerosene. The freezing points of the fuels were all found to be below the required -47 °C irrespective of blend or the temperature of the reaction. The energy density of the unblended fuels ranged between 30.4 and 41.36 MJ/kg depending on the temperature of the reaction and whether remaining alcohols were removed. While this is below the higher heating value (HHV) of the Jet A-1 used (45.69 MJ/kg), the energy densities of the 50% and 20% blends were more suitable with the isoamyl alcohol derived fuels having a maximum HHV of 44.31 MJ/kg at 50% blending and 44.99 MJ/kg at 20% blend with Jet A-1. The fuels derived from isoamyl alcohol produced above 140 °C were found to satisfy the flash point criterion (&gt;38 °C) of the Jet A-1 specification, though the isobutanol derived fuels did not, producing fuels with flash points between 33 and 35 °C. The kinematic viscosities of the fuels were also tested at -20 °C. Unblended only a few of the fuels analyzed met the maximum viscosity requirement at -20 °C of 8 mm2 s-1, though this fuel property was improved substantially on blending with jet fuel. This work demonstrates that ketones produced from isoamyl alcohol through a simple alkylation have the potential to be used as blending agents with Jet A-1. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignin biodegradation is an attractive approach for producing value-added products. These valuable products are produced by the processing and refining of lignocellulosic residues. A set of ligninolytic enzymes including lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP), and laccase (Lac) were individually produced from Ganoderma lucidum, Trametes versicolor, and Pleurotus ostreatus. Solid state fermentation under pre-optimized culture conditions with varying ratios of enzymes were used for the delignification of lignocellulosic biomass residues. The fungal enzymes were purified in four steps including ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzymes were subsequently used in varying ratios (with each containing 200 U/mL) for the delignification of wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, and rice straw. The consortium of enzymes caused the removal of 58.5%, 46%, and 52% of the lignin from the wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, and rice straw, respectively, at LiP: MnP: Lac ratios of 1:2:2, 1:1:2, and 2:1:2. The best delignification was observed in wheat straw (58.5%), exposing 76.54% cellulose content. The results suggested that the ligninolytic enzymes are effective catalysts for the selective partial delignification of lignocellulosic biomass residues. After delignification these lignocellulosic residues could be utilized as costeffective substrates for the production of enzymes, biofuels, and other industrially significant products. © 2016.

AB  - A sulfided cobalt-molybdenum-phosphorus/aluminium oxide (CoMoP/Al2O3) catalyst was studied in the hydroprocessing of bio-oil (BO) obtained from the pyrolysis of de-oiled Jatropha curcas seed cake. Hydroprocessing was carried out with different ratios of refinery gas oil (GO) and BO. The oxygen content in the products was reduced to trace amounts after hydroprocessing. A clear product obtained from the co-processing of BO with refinery GO contained 2-16% gasoline, 30-35% kerosene, 35-44% diesel, with 50-60% alkanes, 10-45% cycloalkanes, and 1-10% aromatics, with a negligible amount of char formed in the process. Hydroprocessing of 100% BO produced 30% kerosene and 30% diesel, together with 10% gasoline, with 15% of alkanes and 15% cycloalkanes, and 45% aromatics. A maximum amount of kerosene (41%) was obtained at 648 K and 75 bar from 100% BO, with a small amount of char (1.5%) deposited on the catalyst. In comparison, over sulfided CoMo/Al2O3 catalyst (without P promoter) only 31% of kerosene was produced, with 17% char, using similar reaction conditions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry

AB  - The wood industry produces large amounts of wood waste. This waste usually contains a number of nonwood materials, such as paints or varnishes. In this study, the pyrolysis characteristics of wood waste containing synthetic, polyurethane, and polyester varnishes were investigated for conversion into renewable liquid fuels. The elemental analysis and higher heating values of the biooils were determined. The chemical compounds present in the bio-oils obtained at an optimum temperature were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis. The product yields and compositions were affected by the types of varnishes. The maximum bio-oil yield of 46.7% was obtained from pyrolysis of waste wood containing polyester varnish at a final pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C. The bio-oil produced from wood waste containing varnishes was composed mainly of phenols, aldehydes, acids, ketones, alcohols, benzenes, and N-containing compounds. The phenols accounted for the largest amount of compounds in the bio-oils. Therefore, the bio-oil produced from varnished wood waste could be a potential substitute for biofuels and green chemicals. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel for diesel fuel, because of scarcity and crude oil prices researchers are focusing on this area. Pongamia pinnata (Karanja) is an oil bearing tree, which is non-edible feedstock and it is used for biodiesel production. Trans esterification process is used to produce biodiesel in the presence of methanol and KOH. Rice husk were pulverized and it was reduced to nanoparticles by using ball milling process. The prepared nanoparticles was also characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and EDAX, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). EDAX study confirms the presence of the elements C, O, Mg, Si, and K in the rice husk. XRD consequence showed that grain size of the rice husk as 0.026nm.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of microwave power and additives on the microwave-assisted pyrolysis of cotton stalk. Pyrolysis temperature profiles, product yields, and bio-oil components were analyzed. The results indicated that as the microwave power increased, so did the final temperature and heating rate. When microwave power increased from 800 to 1200 W, the yield of the solid residue decreased and gas yield increased, but the maximum bio-oil yield of 26.7% was achieved under a microwave power of 1000 W. All three of the additives (NaOH, Na2CO3, and H3PO4) increased the yields of solid residue and gas, while the yield of the bio-oil decreased. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated that the main components of bio-oil from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of pure sample were acetol, furfural, 2-methoxy-phenol, and 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol. Sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate (NaOH and Na2CO3) greatly favor the formation of acetol. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) remarkably promoted the formation of furfural and 4-methyl-2-methoxy-phenol, while H3PO4 inhibited the formation of acetol.

AB  - Modern technologies for the enzyme hydrolysis of cellulose-containing raw materials allow the production of sugars from which alcohols (biofuel), organic and amino acids, biopolymers, feed additives, and other value-added products can be obtained via microbiological conversion. Three types of cellulolytic enzymes are required for the bioconversion of cellulose containing materials: endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase, and ß-glucosidase. The prospects for improving the hydrolytic capabilities of the enzyme complex secreted from Penicillium verruculosum are investigated in this work by means of genetic engineering to add different combinations and ratios of homologous and heterologous cellulases: endoglucanase IV (EGIV) of Trichoderma reesei, endoglucanase II (EGII), and cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) of P. verruculosum, along with ß-glucosidase (ß-GLU) of Aspergillus niger. The optimum ratio of components is determined and the catalytic activity of enzymatic complexes is increased by as much as 100%. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The conversion of biomass and its derivatives is an alternative to replace the current fossil fuels. Various types of vegetable oils have been used as model systems for the synthesis of biofuels such as green gasoline and green diesel. This paper reviewed and analyzed the catalytic cracking of canola oil on a mesoporous acid catalyst (H-MCM41) at 400 C and atmospheric pressure. As a result, a modified reaction scheme was proposed, identifying reactions pathways that have not been previously included for the conversion of canola oil in the liquid fractions identified as green gasoline and green diesel. In addition, under the same reaction conditions, the conversion of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) on H-MCM41 was used as a model system, to evaluate the potential of industrial fermentation wastes in the production of green fuels. The results documented the absolute potential of lecithin for this purpose. This work provides basis for guiding the use of industrial by-products in the production of alternative fuels, and also some guidelines to facilitate the development of kinetic models required to optimize the process conditions and the catalysts suitable for the production of green fuels. © 2016, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - De-oiled algal biomass (algal cake) generated as waste byproduct during algal biodiesel production is a promising fermentable substrate for co-production of value-added chemicals in biorefinery systems. We explored the ability of Lactobacillus casei 12A to ferment algal cake for co-production of lactic acid. Carbohydrate and amino acid availability were determined to be limiting nutritional requirements for growth and lactic acid production by L. casei. These nutritional requirements were effectively addressed through enzymatic hydrolysis of the algal cake material using α-amylase, cellulase (endo-1,4-β-d-glucanase), and pepsin. Results confirm fermentation of algal cake for production of value-added chemicals is a promising avenue for increasing the overall cost competiveness of the algal biodiesel production process. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this study, homogeneously dispersed gold particles growth onto carbon felt were fabricated by electrodeposition method followed by a thermal treatment at 1000 °C under nitrogen. The thermal treatment induced the dewetting of gold and the formation of well-crystallized gold particles that exhibited large surface area. The structural properties of the resulted Au@CF material were evaluated by SEM, XRD and TGA. We studied the electrocatalytic properties of this new gold material through the abiotic glucose oxidation in alkaline medium and the enzymatic dioxygen electroreduction by the enzyme bilirubin oxidase. Finally, we showed the potentiality of the resulting Au@CF material to build a 3-dimensional glucose hybrid biofuel cell by assemblying an abiotic anode with an enzymatic cathode. The system exhibited high electrochemical performance with an open circuit voltage of 0.71 V and a maximum power density of 310 μW cm−2 at 352 mV (by taking into account the projected surface area), in spite of a low gold loading (0.2 wt%). The advance presented in this work is the efficiency of the synthesis technique to get a new free-standing material for electrocatalysis based on gold particles with high reactive surface area for electron transfer and macropores for diffusion transport. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper integrates acidolysis and in situ hydrogenation of biomass to produce bio-oil featuring a high yield and also a high effective hydrogen/carbon molar ratio (H/Ceff). A catalytic amount of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf) is found to be very effective to cleave glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates and β-O-4 bonds in lignin, resulting in the formation of various carbohydrate/lignin-derived radicals. The in situ hydrogenation in the presence of Ru/C and H2 stabilizes the resulting radicals and, thus, prevents their repolymerization. This HOTf-Ru/C system is applicable to a wide range of feedstocks. Typically, the yield of bio-oil (dichloromethane extract) from pine wood at 160°C can be as high as 43.2 wt % with a H/Ceff of 1.24, which is high enough to be co-processed in the existing refineries. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The knowledge of accurate hydrogen solubility values in bio-oil compounds is essential for the design and optimization of hydroprocesses relevant to biofuel industry. This work reports the solubility of hydrogen in three industrially relevant bio-oil compounds (allyl alcohol, furan, and eugenol) at temperatures from 342 to 473 K and pressures up to 16 MPa. Phase equilibrium data were acquired using a continuous flow synthetic method. The method is based on the visual observation of the bubble point using a high resolution camera. The measured solubility is modeled with Peng-Robinson EoS with classical van der Waals one fluid mixing rules. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) is an environmentally-friendly way to combust biomass and waste materials. However, as a side-product large amount of ash is created which is difficult to utilize due to its low reactivity and high heavy metal content. Instead, most of the ash ends up in landfills so novel utilization methods are needed. In this study lightweight aggregates (LWAs) were produced from recovered fuel-biofuel fly ash taken from a F boiler by granulating the fly ash with sodium silicate in a high-shear granulator. Blast furnace slag and metakaolin were studied as co-binders. Physical, chemical, and microstructural characterization was conducted for the precursors and LWAs. The crushing strength varied between 4.6 and 14.6 MPa. Addition of co-binders increased strength and produced denser structure. The loose bulk density was &lt;1.08 g/cm3 and dry particle density was &lt;1.77 g/cm3 for all prepared granules so they met the definition of lightweight aggregate in standard SFS-EN 13055-1. LWAs contained X-ray-amorphous material, indicating the formation of aluminosilicates and some crystalline phases, which were derived from the fly ash. This study presents a method of producing LWAs from fly ash that have physical properties comparable to LWAs manufactured by conventional methods without the need for high-temperature sintering or the usage of cement. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Abstract: C1–C4 primary carboxylic acids were selected as model compounds to observe the nature and stability of bio-oil adsorption in zeolite HZSM-5 via DFT-D2 theoretical calculation. Adsorptions with and without solvents of water, dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol, and ethanol were studied. The most stable adsorption configuration is hydrogen bonding (HB) through the carbonyl oxygen of acid over the Brønsted acid site of zeolite with the strong energies range from −133.2 to −154.8 kJ/mol. Partial transfer of the Brønsted proton to the acid was observed. Strength of intramolecular-zeolite acid site interaction increases in the order: carbonyl oxygen HB &gt; hydroxyl oxygen HB &gt; CH3 physisorption. The vdW interactions increase notably with the size of the acids. The adsorption energies are significantly reduced by solvation effect.

AB  - Carbohydrates active enzymes (CAZymes) have multiple roles in vivo and are widely used for industrial processing in the biofuel, textile, detergent, paper and food industries. A deeper understanding of CAZymes is important from both fundamental biology and industrial standpoints. Vast numbers of CAZymes exist in nature (especially in microorganisms) and hundreds of thousands have been cataloged and described in the carbohydrate active enzyme database (CAZy). However, the rate of discovery of putative enzymes has outstripped our ability to biochemically characterize their activities. One reason for this is that advances in genome and transcriptome sequencing, together with associated bioinformatics tools allow for rapid identification of candidate CAZymes, but technology for determining an enzyme's biochemical characteristics has advanced more slowly. To address this technology gap, a novel high-throughput assay kit based on insoluble chromogenic substrates is described here. Two distinct substrate types were produced: Chromogenic Polymer Hydrogel (CPH) substrates (made from purified polysaccharides and proteins) and Insoluble Chromogenic Biomass (ICB) substrates (made from complex biomass materials). Both CPH and ICB substrates are provided in a 96-well high-throughput assay system. The CPH substrates can be made in four different colors, enabling them to be mixed together and thus increasing assay throughput. The protocol describes a 96-well plate assay and illustrates how this assay can be used for screening the activities of enzymes, enzyme cocktails, and broths. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - With overall higher use of wood and wooden materials in the future, the importance of recycled wood will increase. Recycled wood is currently used for the production of wood based composites and for combustion. In the future, use of recycled wood will also be important as feedstock for biorefineries for the production of bio-based chemicals and biofuels. The present paper gives preliminary results on the feasibility of A I recycled wood (German classification, natural wood only treated mechanically) in a steam explosion and organosolv pre-treatment process. The presence of inorganic pollutants and non-wooden material in recycled wood material was investigated. The effect of recycled wood heterogeneity (e.g., variable wood species and wide particle size distribution) on performance of wood pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis was also evaluated. Microeconomic analysis of lignocellulosic feedstock for a biorefinery using organosolv cooking was calculated with various price scenarios and various proportions of recycled wood instead of fresh beech chips. The results show that the concentration of inorganic pollutants is higher than in fresh wood but below the limit values for polluted wood. Preliminary results on steam explosion and ethanol based organosolv cooking without an acid catalyst showed typical behaviour of softwood for recycled wood of A I quality in respect of hydrolysability, thus being a potential future raw material for sugar production. A I recycled wood can be used in a biorefinery without major problems and can significantly improve the economics of investment in an industrial scale biorefinery. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The worldwide rising energy demands and the concerns about the sustainability of fossil fuels have led to the search for some low-cost renewable fuels. In this scenario, the production of biodiesel from various vegetable and animal sources has attracted worldwide attention. The present study was conducted to evaluate the production of biodiesel from the oil industry waste following base-catalysed transesterification. The transesterification reaction gave a yield of 83.7% by 6:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, at 60°C over 80 min of reaction time in the presence of NaOH. The gas chromatographic analysis of the product showed the presence of 16 fatty acid methyl esters with linoleic and oleic acid as principal components representing about 31% and 20.7% of the total methyl esters, respectively. The fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum of oil industry waste and transesterified product further confirmed the formation of methyl esters. Furthermore, the fuel properties of oil industry waste methyl esters, such as kinematic viscosity, cetane number, cloud point, pour point, flash point, acid value, sulphur content, cold filter plugging point, copper strip corrosion, density, oxidative stability, higher heating values, ash content, water content, methanol content and total glycerol content, were determined and discussed in the light of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards. Overall, this study presents the production of biodiesel from the oil industry waste as an approach of recycling this waste into value-added products. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The present article deals with the production of bio-oil from algal biomass as well as the preparation and characterization of noble CaO-based heterogeneous catalyst for upgradation of bio-oil to biodiesel. The bio-oil has been extracted from algal biomass using hexane as solvent in soxhlet apparatus and upgraded to biodiesel by transesterification using noble CaO-based heterogeneous catalysts. Catalyst with TiO2:CaO molar ratio of 0.25 and calcination temperature of 700°C has been found to be most suitable among all the catalysts developed. Characterization of the catalysts has been done by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). The input--output model has been developed to correlate experimental and predicted value of biodiesel yield. Optimization of process parameters has been done using response surface methodology. Various properties and elemental composition of algal bio-oil and biodiesel have been determined and compared with biodiesel. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The growing interest in research and development for alternative biofuels has drawn special attention to biodiesel, a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) that can be obtained by the transesterification reaction of triacylglycerols (TAGs) with a short chain alcohol. During transesterification reaction kinetic studies, it is important to monitor the levels of diacylglycerols (DAGs) and monoacylglycerols (MAGs), as well as those of TAGs and FAMEs. These contents are generally determined according to reference methods by GC-FID analysis. This technique is expensive and time consuming, not to mention that samples with higher TAG contents can be harmful to the chromatography column and accessories. In this context, this study aims to determine the composition of a quaternary system, in which virtually only the four compounds cited previously are present, using a single-step chemometrics analysis that uses mathematical modelling to correlate the composition with three physical properties (density, refractive index and viscosity) of the same sample, one at a time. Subsequently, a sample with an unknown composition has the same properties determined and then a system of equations composed of three equations (one for each physical property) with three unknowns are solved to determine the unknown sample's composition. This method can be used as an initial screening method to determine both the TAG and FAME content in a sample, to be implemented prior to the performance of the GC analysis, because the results obtained in this study have shown that the approach proposed was able to determine mass fractions of quaternary systems with both a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of less than 0.03. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Acetylation of glycerol with acetic acid was carried out over bimetallic silver and copper deposited rice husk silica-alumina like ecofriendly green catalyst. Bio-additive like mono, di and tri acetyl glycerol synthesis from raw glycerol (one of the main product of biodiesel), which are gaining attention as additives for improving petroleum fuel properties towards biofuel additive development applications. Advantage of using bimetallic catalyst for glycerol acetylation due to possible synergistic effect between the metals and it enhances the catalytic conversion and selectivity compared to single metal catalyst. The prepared catalysts were characterised by XRD, FT-IR and TEM. Silver and copper incorporated RHS (rice husk silica)-alumina catalysts are shown higher activity and selectivity towards diacetin (di acetyl glycerol) and triacetins (tri acetyl glycerol) formation by catalytic acetylation of glycerol. Higher conversion (98 %) and good selectivity (51 %) is achieved. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Vegetable oils have gained continuous economic importance being increasingly used as renewable raw materials by the food, cosmetics and biofuel industries. As an alternative to the traditional sources of oils, unusual vegetable oils from Jatropha curcas, Bombacopsis glabra, Capparis flexuosa, Siparuna guianensis, Moringa oleifera, Hibiscus tiliaceus, Virola bicuhyba, Pouteria caimito and Syagrus coronata seeds are used. We describe herein the immediate as well as direct, fast and low cost characterization of such seed oils via triacylglycerol (TAG) and free fatty acid (FFA) profiles by easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry (EASI-MS) and chemometric analysis. The oils are shown to display indeed typical and unique chemical profiles of triacylglycerol (TAG) and free fatty acids (FFA) with contrasting carbon lengths, degree of unsaturation or with the presence of other chemical functions on the alkyl chain. V. bicuhyba and S. coronata seed oils were found to be constituted of relatively short chain TAG making them potential raw materials for obtaining biogasolines or biokeresones, which are used as aviation fuels. The TAG profiles of H. tiliaceus were very similar to those of soybean, P. caimito similar to those of andiroba oil, and C. flexuosa and S. guianensis similar to those of palm oil. FFA compositions from H. tiliaceus, P. caimito, C. flexuosa and S. guianensis are rich in oleic or linoleic acids, which are an important requirement of feedstock for biodiesel production. Some polyphenolic compounds determined by EASI-MS in some of these oils are also known to provide important nutritional and therapeutic benefits to human health. EASI-MS can therefore offer immediate characterization of such oils and help in quality monitoring and control of adulteration and to guide their application in food, cosmetics and the biofuel industries. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In the present report we focused on the substitution of metallic catalysts by biocatalysts to develop a high efficient biofuel cell. A bioanode and a biocathode were designed using ADH and laccase, respectively. Carboxylated multiwall carbon nanotubes (HOOC-MWCNTs) and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) were used for immobilizing the enzymes on either polymethylene green (PMG) modified glassy carbon or graphite electrodes. In this way, an ethanol-oxygen biofuel cell was designed in which PDDA/ADH/PDDA/HOOC-MWCNTs/PMG/GC and PDDA/Lac/PDDA/HOOC-MWCNTs/PMG/Gr operated as bioanode and biocathode, respectively. In the optimized condition of O2 saturated PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.5) containing 1 mM ethanol and 1 mM NAD+ the open-circuit voltage reached to a plateau at 504 mV based of which the power density of 3.98 mW cm-2 was obtained. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The increasing demand of renewable energy sources has pressed the need to search for biofuels. The world is not only thrusting for potential sources of biofuels but also surveilling not to hamper the food supply, particularly in the Third World countries, such as Bangladesh. Rice bran oil is a prominent source of biofuels. Rice, the main cereal in Bangladesh, is cultivated all the year round. Rice hull containing bran is mostly wasted and merely used as feedstock for cattle and for cooking purposes. This study considered rice bran as a prospective source of biodiesel in Bangladesh. The properties of oil collected from rice bran were investigated to ensure the production of biodiesel by transesterification. An economic analysis relative to Bangladesh was conducted, and the production rate of biodiesel under different percentage of catalyst was investigated. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuel production is an attractive alternative to conventional fossil fuel, effectively solving problems like resource depletion and greenhouse gas emission. Use of solid feedstock and organic wastes to produce biofuel is seen as a promising route from the economical and sustainability point of view. Pyrolysis is one of the possible thermochemical methods to convert solid biomasses to valuable liquid and gas products. However, the bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis can be used as biofuel only after an upgrading step. In facts, raw bio-oil contains various oxygenated organic compounds, which make it instable, and has high average molecular weight, high viscosity, and low heating value. A suitable method for upgrading bio-oil is catalytic cracking of the pyrolysis products. Catalytic upgrading converts high molecular weight compounds of the biooil into lower-weight molecules. This work investigated the slow pyrolysis and in-situ catalytic cracking of chicken manure in a lab-scale fixed bed reactor. The application to chicken manure is of upmost practical interest, since the pyrolysis process would provide an environmentally safe manner for solving the current problems about disposal of this waste. The catalyst considered was pellet-extruded zeolites (zsm-5). In order to study the effect of influential factors (temperature and catalyst to biomass ratio) on the obtained products, experimental design techniques were used. The process was investigated in both the absence and presence of the in-situ catalyst. The results were statistically analyzed and the influential factors were optimized with the aim of obtaining products with higher quality and heating value. The results can give a clue on how to compromise between the quality of the two potentially valuable products of pyrolysis process (bio-oil and biogas) and the energy requirement of the process. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - A novel mesophilic anaerobic digestion process with detoxification-treated coconut shell pyroligneous was established, exhibiting an effective advantage in biogas production. The pyroligneous collected contained 166.2 g l−1 acetic acid, indicating great potential for biogas production. Detoxification was an effective way of simultaneously enriching biodegradable ingredients and removing inhibitors (mainly as phenols and organic acids) for digestion process. The digestion process lasted 96 h and fermentation characteristics (chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal ratio, volatile fatty acid (VFA) consumptions, pH, total gas, methane yield, and phenol removal efficiency) were measured. The experiments successfully explored the optimum detoxification parameters, oxidized with 10 % H2O2 followed by overliming, and demonstrated 89.3 % COD removal, 91.4 % methane content, 0.305 LCH4/g COD removed CH4 yield, and 88.81 % phenol removal ratio. This study provided clues to overcome the negative effects of inhibitors in pyroligneous on biogas production. The findings could contribute to significant process in detoxified pretreatment of pyroligneous and develop an economically feasible technology for treating pyroligneous after producing charcoal. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A steady state, one-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model of wood char gasification in a downdraft reactor is presented. The model is not only based on reaction kinetics and fluid flow in the porous char bed but also on equations of heat and mass conservation. An original OpenFOAM solver is used to simulate the model and the results are found to be in good agreement with published experimental data. Next, a sensitivity analysis is performed to study the influence of reactor inlet temperature and gas composition on char conversion, bed temperature profile and syngas composition. In addition, the evolution of the complex reaction mechanisms involved in mixed atmosphere gasification is investigated, and the most suitable operating parameters for controlling syngas composition are evaluated. Our simulation results provide essential knowledge for optimizing the design and operation of downdraft gasifiers to produce syngas that meets the requirements of various biofuel applications. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Waste vegetable oil was co-liquefied with swine manure to determine the bio-oil potential in this study. The result shows that co-liquefaction of waste vegetable oil with swine manure can improve the bio-oil production and decarboxylation of waste vegetable oil. The weight ratio of swine manure to waste vegetable oil exerted a great effect on both the yield and quality of the bio-oil. The optimum weight ratio of swine manure to waste cooking oil was 1:3, where a maximum oil yield of 80% was obtained with higher calorific value up to 38 MJ/kg. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - An improved system for hydrogen production by the steam reforming of simulated bio-oil was developed. The coal ash was packed in front of nickel-based catalysts, acting as a guard catalyst. The model compounds passed through coal ash and were preliminarily reformed to smaller molecular intermediates containing more CO and CH4, which were then further reformed over the following nickel-reforming catalyst. The improved reaction system succeeded in effectively converting the complex simulated bio-oil into hydrogen and exhibited high activity. For 15 wt.% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with coal ash packing, the catalyst lifetime was extended to 8 h, with simulated bio-oil almost completely converted into hydrogen. In addition, coke deposition was suppressed.

AB  - The hydrothermal catalytic liquefaction of corn stalk (CS) in a 500 mL batch reactor was conducted. The influence of reaction temperature and catalyst quantity as well as reaction time on the products distribution was investigated. The main components and functional groups of bio-oil with and without catalysts were characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). The result shows that the optimal conditions of liquefaction are 15 g CS with 6.67% FeHZSM-5 at 340 ℃ for 30 min, at which the bio-oil yield reaches a maximum of 28.03% with the highest CS conversion of 81.73%. The main components of bio-oil are phenols and esters, and the HHV of the bio-oil reaches to 30.08 MJ/kg. © 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis of Alcell lignin with various additive ratios (5%, 10%, and 15%, mass ratio) of nano-NiO was investigated using a horizontal pyrolyzer. Characterization methods, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and elemental analysis, were utilized to identify the catalytic fast pyrolysis products. The results indicated that the nano-NiO catalyst had remarkable effects on the yield and quality of these products. The formation of gases, especially CO, CO2, and CH4, were greatly promoted when the additive ratio increased, while the formation of bio-char was clearly inhibited. However, when the additive ratio was 10%, the maximum yield of bio-oil (53.09 wt.%) was obtained, and the corresponding maximum higher heating value (HHV) was 25.33 MJ/kg. Furthermore, nano-NiO caused a large variation in the species of the compounds in bio-oil. Operating with the optimal nano-NiO additive ratio (10%), the carbon conversion rate was 65.50%, and the energy conversion rate was 74.53%.

AB  - The hydrogenation of natural triglycerides to produce motor fuels has an increasing importance. Therefore increase the efficiency of the production is important. So a special case of hydrogenation of triglycerides was studied on a sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst at wide range of process parameters (Pressure = 40 and 80 bar, Temperature = 320-380°C, Liquid Hourly Space Velocity = 0.75-2.0 h-1, H2/feed ratio = 600 m3/m3). The sulphur content of the feedstock was ensured with mixing a small amount (10%) of high sulphur containing (0.9%) gas oil into the sunflower oil to ensure the sulphided state of the catalyst. In comparison, the hydrogenation of a reference feedstock was examined which sulphur content was set to similar concentration (905 mg/kg) level by using an easily decomposable sulphur compound (dimethyl disulphide). By applying favourable process parameters (Temperature = 360-380°C, Pressure = 80 bar, Liquid Hourly Space Velocity = 0.75 to 1.0 h-1, H2/feed ratio = 600 m3/m3) the properties of the products being obtained in high yield satisfied the requirements of the EN 590:2013 standard, except Cold Filter Plugging Point and density values for both feedstocks. In case of the catalytic hydrogenation of triglycerides it was concluded to cover the sulphur content of the feedstock with straight run (high sulphur containing) gas oil is a suitable and cost-effective solution to preserve the sulphide state of the catalyst. Diesel fuel can be produced with blending of products of high cetane and low density into other gas oil streams. The hydrogenated vegetable oil products can improve the quality of low-quality gas oil streams to produce better quality diesel fuel with bio-component content. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic hydrocracking of Jatropha curcas oil over ZSM-5-supported catalyst was carried out to produce biofuels. The agglomerated catalyst was successfully prepared by a simple technique and characterized using several techniques. The hydrocracking reactions were studied in a batch reactor at 400°C under initial H2 atmosphere for 2 h reaction using 1 wt% catalyst loading. The effect of agglomerated catalysts on the yield of liquid fuels and hydrocarbon number distribution was discussed. The results showed that the hydrocarbon distribution largely changed depending on the type of catalyst. The powder catalysts seem selectively to produce hydrocarbon in the diesel range (C12–C22), whereas gasoline (C5–C12) and kerosene (C8–C16) had high formation after agglomerated catalyst was used. For agglomerated NiMo ZSM-5 catalyst, hydrocracking of Jatropha curcas oil produced more hydrocarbons in the gasoline range (about 43.23% in liquid fuels). © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aviation sector is nowadays looking for a biofuel to partially substitute the fossil fuel used for flights, i.e., jet fuel. Among the proposed processes for the production of the renewable jet fuel, the hydrotreating process has, to date, the best performance. At the final stage of the hydrotreating process, a distillation train is required to obtain hydrocarbon fractions useful as fuels. Conventional or thermally coupled distillation sequences can be used in this step, and it can be expected that thermally coupled sequences require less energy to perform the separation. Nevertheless, in the selection of the best sequence for a given separation, it is important to analyze its control properties. A controllability analysis was performed here for different distillation sequences used to obtain biofuels from a hydrocarbon renewable mixture, in order to detect the best sequence in terms of control properties.

AB  - Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing the seeds of the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis). Its production leads to high volumes of solid residues, the castor bean cakes. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of these castor bean cakes as a valuable source for production of high added value products such as bio-fuels and renewable chemicals. The upgrading of the castor bean cakes was attempted via thermochemical processes; specifically fast thermal and catalytic pyrolysis. Initially thermal pyrolysis of two different castor cakes and one type of castor stalks took place in a fixed bed fast pyrolysis reactor. The best feed was chosen for catalytic pyrolysis testing where industrially available microporous and one mesoporous catalyst were studied. Mass balances and products characterization via elemental analysis and two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS) in the case of the liquid products allowed for the estimation of the catalytic effect in each case. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydroconversion of pyrolysis bio-oils is a promising process that can greatly contributes to their deoxygenation. Other simultaneous reactions such as condensation or oligomerization leading to heavy molecular weight compounds are detrimental to the process and still not well understood. This study deals with the hydroconversion of D-glucose and furfural in a batch reactor with a NiMo/alumina catalyst. Considering the carbon balances and SEC-RI analysis of hydroconversion products, we describe fast reaction pathways leading to soluble macromolecules (up to 700 g mol−1) that are further precipitated into the solid phase. From the D-glucose conversion, 13C NMR analysis of residues revealed significant amounts of aromatic carbons. Also detected by FTICR-MS analysis of a liquid effluent, those structures were likely formed through dehydration reactions. Finally, a high water content in the feed demonstrated that D-glucose was preserved from dehydration reactions contrary to furfural which is prone to be hydrolyzed into soluble macromolecules precursors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass shows a great promise, however, needs further upgrading to potentially serve as an alternative to fossil fuels. Herein, we demonstrate that crude fast pyrolysis bio-oil can be directly used as a fuel for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) to generate high power density electrical energy at low temperature (⩽80 °C). A simple aqueous-phase reduction method was used to prepare carbon nanotube (CNT) supported noble metal (Pt, Pd, Au, and Ag) nanoparticles with average particle sizes: 1.4 nm, 2.0 nm, 3.8 nm, and 12.9 nm for Pt/CNT, Pd/CNT, Au/CNT, and Ag/CNT, respectively. Direct fast pyrolysis bio-oil AEMFCs with the Pd/CNT anode catalyst and a commercial Fe-based cathode catalyst exhibit a remarkable peak power density of 42.7 mW cm−2 at 80 °C using 30 wt% bio-oil + 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. Levoglucosan was identified as the major sugar compound with 11.1 wt% of the bio-oil composition, along with disaccharides, pyrolytic lignin, and oligomer of lignin-derived phenolic compounds. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies investigated the electrocatalytic oxidation of high purity levoglucosan over the four noble metal catalysts in half cell, as levoglucosan is the dominant sugar component in bio-oil. Pd/CNT, compared to other catalysts, displayed the highest activity and lowest onset potential of electrocatalytic oxidation of levoglucosan. AEMFC with high purity sugars shows ∼1.2 to 3 times higher power density than that with fast pyrolysis bio-oil fuel. © 2016

AB  - A mixture of levoglucosan (LG) and acetic acid (AA), representing water extracted fast pyrolysis oil, was continuously converted to ethyl levulinate (EL) and ethyl acetate (EA) using H-ZSM5 [120-230°C, 600 psig, 80% ethanol (v/v)]. Fractional conversion of both reactants was 65% or greater at temperatures above 120°C, and space time yields (STY) approached 140 and 15 g/L-cat/h for EA and EL, respectively, at 180°C (LHSV = 4.9 h-1). Two potential pathways for EL formation from levoglucosan were apparent, one with glucose and ethyl α-D-glucopyranoside as intermediates and the other with furfural. Adding metal functionality (Ru/H-ZSM5) resulted in the production of valerate biofuels (esters of carboxylic acids C3 or greater; e.g., pentanoic and hexanoic acid ethyl esters) and EA from the mixture in the presence of hydrogen. Conversions for LG and AA using Ru/H-ZSM5 were similar to H-ZSM5, but ethyl levulinate space time yield declined (∼5 g/L-cat/h) as valerate biofuel STY increased (∼10 g/L-cat/h) at an optimum temperature of 180°C. Our results indicate that valerate biofuels can be produced from levoglucosan (and possibly other sugars) in a continuous single stage, integrated process. However, due to low yields and coke formation, it is clear that ethanol/water ratios, pore size, and acid site type and density must be optimized when coupled with metal functionality for industrial application. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Superparamagnetic Fe3O4 hollow sub-microspheres (FHSM) with strong response to an external magnet were prepared via a solvothermal method, followed by acid etching. Lipase from Candida sp. 99–125 was directly immobilized onto the amino-functional FHSM by simple adsorption, without glutaraldehyde linkage. The immobilized lipase was used to catalyze the esterification/transesterification of waste cooking oil with methanol to produce fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), a major source of biodiesel. FAME yield exceeded 93.4% over a wide range of temperatures from 10 to 40 °C. Notably, stability was clearly improved at the lower temperatures, in particular, giving a FAME yield of 89.6% after eight cycles of use at 10 °C. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The aim of this study is to optimize the pretreatment of Alfa fibers Stipa tenacissima for the production of bioethanol second generation. The Alfa is a complex lignocellulosic substrate. It is mainly composed by cellulose (49.09% ± 0.015), hemicellulose (18.20% ± 0.3) and lignins (16.25% ± 0.475). In the current study, process of production of the biofuel was carried out through three successive steps: a pretreatment performed with dilute acid (3%) at 120 °C during 30 min, an enzymatic saccharification by a commercial enzyme (AP2) and fermentation steps. Dilute acid pretreatment of the biomass resulted in an efficient degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose by increasing the total sugars (39.951 g/L) and reducing sugars (22.36 g/L) yields. These yields were increased after enzymatic saccharification to reach 22.7 g/L of reducing sugars. The fermentation of the aforementioned hydrolysate was efficient with ethanol production being 36.36% of theoretical maximum. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, production of engine fuels and energy from biomass has drawn much interest. In this work, we conducted a novel integrated process for the preparation of bio-hydrogen and bio-fuels using lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis-oil (bio-oil). The process includes (i) the production of bio-hydrogen or bio-syngas by the catalytic cracking of bio-oil, (ii) the adjustment of bio-syngas, and (iii) the production of bio-fuels by olefinic polymerization (OP) together with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Under the optimal conditions, the yield of bio-hydrogen was 120.9 g H2/(kg bio-oil). The yield of hydrocarbon bio-fuels reached 526.1 g/(kg bio-syngas) by the coupling of OP and FTS. The main reaction pathways (or chemical processes) were discussed based on the products observed and the catalyst property. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.

AB  - Bio-oil upgrading by catalytic cracking faces problems of low aromatic hydrocarbon yield and coking because of its hydrogen-lacking property. In this work, an improved hydrogenation-cocracking process was developed to achieve the appropriate hydrogen supply in two stages. Furfural was selected as the model compound of bio-oil, and methanol was the coreactant. The hydrogen supply in the hydrogenation stage was successfully regulated by hydrogenation catalysts, and the 5Ni-5Cu/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the best performance because of a suitable degree of hydrogenation of furfural over it, which favored the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during cracking. With the optimum 5Ni-5Cu/SiO2 catalyst, hydrogenation cocracking was compared with single-stage cocracking, hydrogenation cracking, and direct cracking processes. The results confirmed that hydrogen supplements by hydrogenation pretreatment and methanol cocracking were both significant for the generation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the suppression of coke. On the basis of a proposed reaction mechanism, the corresponding hydrogen supply behaviors were revealed. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Pretreatment is a critical step in the biochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals. Due to the complexity of the physicochemical transformations involved, predictively scaling up technology from bench- to pilot-scale is difficult. This study examines how pretreatment effectiveness under nominally similar reaction conditions is influenced by pretreatment reactor design and scale using four different pretreatment reaction systems ranging from a 3 g batch reactor to a 10 dry-ton/days continuous reactor. The reactor systems examined were an automated solvent extractor (ASE), steam explosion reactor (SER), ZipperClave®Reactor (ZCR), and large continuous horizontal screw reactor (LHR). To our knowledge, this is the first such study performed on pretreatment reactors across a range of reaction conditions and at different reactor scales. Results: The comparative pretreatment performance results obtained for each reactor system were used to develop response surface models for total xylose yield after pretreatment and total sugar yield after pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. Near- and very-near-optimal regions were defined as the set of conditions that the model identified as producing yields within one and two standard deviations of the optimum yield. Optimal conditions identified in the smallest scale system (the ASE) were within the near-optimal region of the largest scale reactor system evaluated. The maximum total sugar yields for the ASE and LHR were $95\,\%$ 95 % , while $89\,\%$ 89 % was the optimum observed in the ZipperClave. Conclusions: The optimum condition identified using the automated and less costly to operate ASE system was within the very-near-optimal space for the total xylose yield of both the ZCR and the LHR, and was within the near-optimal space for total sugar yield for the LHR. This indicates that the ASE is a good tool for cost effectively finding near-optimal conditions for operating pilot-scale systems. Additionally, using a severity factor approach to optimization was found to be inadequate compared to a multivariate optimization method. Finally, the ASE and the LHR were able to enable significantly higher total sugar yields after enzymatic hydrolysis relative to the ZCR, despite having similar optimal conditions and total xylose yields. This underscores the importance of mechanical disruption during pretreatment to improvement of enzymatic digestibility. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrogenation of furfural is a possible route to produce potential renewable fuel component 2-methylfuran (MF) on carbon supported nickel catalyst. This study investigates the effect of process conditions on liquid phase hydrotreatment of furfural to 2-methylfuran over 10 wt-% Ni/C catalyst. The most important parameters tested were temperature, hydrogen pressure and metal loading of the catalyst. In addition, the effect of hydrogen addition method, atmosphere in heating, calcination gas, and stirring speed were tested to analyze optimal reaction procedure. As a result, the highest yield of MF achieved was 48.9 % applying 230 °C, 40 bar hydrogen pressure, and 10 wt-% Ni/C. This high yield of 2-methylfuran is higher than typically reported yields and thus the studied catalyst and reaction conditions offer excellent potential for MF production. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In order to study the catalytic pyrolysis process of the three components (Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) with participation of mesoporous ZSM-5, Firstly the pyrolysis of three major components in biomass and wood powder of Pinus yunnanensis were conducted. Then catalytic pyrolysis of the three major components (microcrystalline cellulose, xylan and alkali lignin) and wood powder of Pinus yunnanensis were carried out with the mesoporous ZSM-5 as catalyst. Compositions of the derived bio-oil were identified by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). By comparing the product distribution in bio-oil between pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis of three major components and wood powder, the catalytic pyrolysis mechanism of biomass was studied. What is more, ZSM-5 was analyzed by N2 adsorption-desorption and XRD diffraction, and ultimate analysis of bio-oil obtained were also identified. The results indicated that during catalytic pyrolysis of three major components and Pinus yunnanensis, mesoporous ZSM-5 showed different performance. The results of XRD diffraction pattern and N2 absorption/desorption demonstrated ZSM-5 used had abundant mesopores with mean pore size of 6.23nm. Through pyrolysis cellulose was mainly converted into β-D-allose (20.39%), furfural, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, 3-propyl glutaric acid, and 2, 4-Pentadienoic acid. In the process of catalytic pyrolysis, ZSM-5 transformed β-D-allose (20.39%), furfural, 3-Propyl glutaric acid, and 2, 4-Pentadienoic acid into 1-methylnaphthalene and 2, 6-dimethylnaphthalene. ZSM-5 performed the supreme catalytic activity for cellulose among 4 feedstocks, and the relative content of total aromatics in bio-oil obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose was 63.89%. The raw bio-oil from hemicellulose pyrolysis mainly contained furfural (67.78%) and 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. But in the course of catalytic pyrolysis, the relative content of furfural reduced drastically to 2.66% while the relative content of aromatics increased to 36.81%, especially, naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene. The primary composition in bio-oil from lignin pyrolysis was 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (82.33%), which was converted into 1, 7-Dimethylnaphthalene and 1, 8-dimethylnaphthalene by ZSM-5 through catalytic pyrolysis. The content of 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol decreased to 77.97% while the relative content of total aromatics increased to 14.14%. The bio-oil obtained from Pinus yunnanensis pyrolysis contained 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (9.73%), 2-methoxy-4 methyl phenol, (Z)-isoeugenol, and 4-hydroxy-3-tert- butylanisole. Through catalytic pyrolysis 2-methoxy-4 methyl phenol and (Z)-isoeugenol were obviously converted into 1-methylnaphthalene, 1-methylene-1 hydrogen-indene, and 2, 6-dimethylnaphthalene, and the total aromatics in bio-oil reached at 53.99%. When the Pinus yunnanensis was used as feedstock, the reusability and regeneration of mesoporous ZSM-5 were studied by comparing the chemical components and ultimate analysis of bio-oil. With the use time of ZSM-5 increasing from 1 to 3, in bio-oil the amount of oxygen compounds augmented while aromatics content reduced from 53.99% to 43.32%, and the ultimate analysis showed O content increased with the decreased C content. However, the full catalytic performance of regenerated mesoporous ZSM-5 restored almost. After regeneration ZSM-5 yielded bio-oil with aromatics content of 52.14% and O content of 26.89%. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Non-sulfided nickel-based catalysts with HNO3-pretreated CNT as support ((x1 + x2) wt.% NiMe/CNT, xi represents metal loading amount, Me = Cu, Co, Mo) were synthesized, and introduced to the hydrogenation of synthetic bio-oil (acetic acid, furfural, hydroxyacetone and guaiacol mixtures) and aqueous fraction of bio-oil. Synthetic bio-oil was chosen for the screening of catalysts. Results showed metal synergistic effect would improve the catalysts activity, and reduced (15 + 5) wt.% NiMo/CNT exhibited better catalytic activity with higher amount of alcohol compounds (up to 61.8%) and fewer undesirable compounds with low H/Ceff. An obvious aldol condensation between furfural and hydroxyacetone was observed to give a C8 compound, which could give most valuable hydrocarbon after deep hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of aqueous fraction of bio-oil over NiCu/CNT, NiCo/CNT, NiMo/CNT showed different catalytic activity for the conversion of compounds with low H/Ceff to alcohols, and the alcohol compound amount over NiMo/CNT after reaction was up to 63.9%. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - New and renewable fuels are the major alternatives to conventional fossil fuels. Biomass in the form of agricultural residues is becoming popular among new renewable energy sources, especially given its wide potential and abundant usage. This study deals with the characterization of the pyrolysis oil obtained from palmyra palm fruit bunch (Borassus flabellifer) produced by flash pyrolysis in the maximum yield. The pyrolysis oil was analyzed to determine its elemental composition and heating value. The chemical composition of the pyrolysis oil and fractions was investigated using various chromatographic techniques such as Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The bio-oil product was presented as an environmentally friendly green biofuel candidate. The analytical results showed that the pyrolysis bio-oils were very complex mixtures of organic compounds and contained a lot of nitrogenated and oxygenated compounds such as, phenols, aliphatic hydrocarbons, pyridines, amines, ketones, and so on. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Abstract: The tendency of coke formation was investigated using nickel catalysts supported on calcium and barium hexaaluminates, compared with a commercial catalyst of natural gas steam reforming. It was developed a methodology in a microactivity unit using cyclohexane as model compound and hydrogen as gas carrier, at low temperature (300–500 °C). After the coking tests, the catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis (CHN) and thermogravimetric analysis using air and steam. 6NiO-BaAl presented the lowest coke removal rate with air. After that, the methodology was modified for ethanol and acetic acid, important model compounds used in studies of biofuels, steam reforming and bio-oil pyrolysis. All model compounds lead to carbon formation with the same chemical nature, as indicated by the temperature of the oxidation peak. So, the methodology can be used as a tool for selection of catalysts. Additionally, cyclohexane and acetic acid are ideal model compounds, because of the lowest and highest coke removal rates with air.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is one of the most important platform intermediates for the future synthesis of liquid transportation biofuel and other valuable compounds. This study aimed to identify ionic liquids that can convert wood into 5-HMF without catalysts. Glucose was converted into 5-HMF without catalysts in ionic liquids that contain sulfonyl groups, such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogensulfate ([EMIM]HSO4) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ρ-toluenesulfonate ([EMIM]Tos). However, [EMIM]Tos produced less 5-HMF from cellulose and wood, compared with [EMIM]HSO4. This is due to the difference of ability to decompose cellulose and wood between these ionic liquids. Consequently, among various ionic liquids studied, [EMIM]HSO4 achieved the highest yield of 5-HMF from wood and cellulose at 4.5 and 10.2 wt% yields, respectively, after 10 h at 140 °C. © 2016, The Japan Wood Research Society.

AB  - Three-dimensional modeling of liquid drainage dynamics in vertical, inclined and oscillating packed bed reactors is virtually inexistent in the literature. An attempt was made in this work where liquid drainage dynamics in vertical, inclined and oscillating packed bed reactors was analyzed via an unsteady-state three-dimensional two-fluid hydrodynamic model. Angular oscillations of the packed bed reactor between two angled symmetrical positions and between vertical and inclined position were considered while bed non-uniformity was described using radial porosity distributions. The simulation results highlighted the fully interpretable trends of the transient liquid flow in packed beds and underlined the differences in the transient behavior of the vertical, inclined and oscillating packed bed reactors. Although the initial period of liquid drainage was dominated by gravity regardless of bed configuration, the packed bed angle with respect to gravity direction had a significant impact on the liquid drainage dynamics. Cross-sections along streamwise direction both for static and oscillating inclined positions of the bed highlighted gas-rich uppermost and liquid-rich lowermost domains. Unlike vertical beds for which drainage occurred according to a quasi-plug flow of the liquid core region, drainage of inclined beds underlined 3D liquid flow structures with liquid-rich lowermost cross-sections which accelerated liquid withdrawal. Compared to the inclined bed case, liquid drainage was delayed under oscillating regimes as a result of reverse secondary flows induced by the column motion. The initial drainage process was controlled by the liquid flow in the bed lowermost part whereas oscillations between two symmetrically angled positions led to almost cross-sectionally uniform liquid drainage distribution. This is valuable and it is plausible that at long time the performance of packed bed reactors onboard offshore floating nonstationary platforms is insignificantly affected by the oscillations between two symmetrically angled positions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the Aleurites moluccanus oil was obtained in high yield from the almonds (42%). The methyl and ethyl esters obtained by transesterification of the oil, have a high content of fatty acid unsaturated esters (>89%). Thermal properties in inert and oxidative atmospheres of oils and esters of A. moluccanus seed oil were estimated using Thermogravimetry - Derivative Thermogravimetry (TG/DTG). Low temperature properties of the methyl and ethyl esters were investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). From the experiments was found that A. moluccanus seeds oil was thermally stable up to 210.9 °C; the methanol biodiesel is stable up to 117.9 °C and the ethanol biodiesel is up to 122.0 °C in air. In nitrogen atmosphere the A. moluccanus seeds oil was thermally stable up to 291.2 °C; the methanol biodiesel up to 119.0 °C and the ethanol biodiesel up to 123.3 °C. The esters have satisfactory performance at low temperatures with respect to the point of crystallization, which were below -11 °C. The results showed that A. moluccanus found in Brazil can contribute as a non-edible raw material for the production of biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Agriculture residues such as palmyra fruit bunch are one of the biomass categories that can be utilized for conversion to bio-oil by using pyrolysis process. Flash pyrolysis experiments have been conducted in the electrically heated fluidized bed reactor to determine the effect of pyrolysis temperature, particle size, and sweep gas flow rate on the pyrolysis product yield. In this study the maximum oil yield of 48.2% was achieved at a temperature of 500°C, particle size of 1 mm, and at a sweep gas flow rate of 2 m3/h. The results show that the effects of pyrolysis temperature and particle size on pyrolysis yields are more significant than that of sweep gas flow rate. Bio-oil was identified as a biofuel candidate and it was further upgraded for better-quality biofuel. Various physical and elemental analyses were performed for bio-oil and the same characteristics study was also carried out for biofuel. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Microalgae have been considered as the feedstock for the third generation biofuels production, given its high lipid content and fast productivity. Herein, a catalytic approach for microalgae liquefaction to biocrude is examined in a temperature range of 250-300 °C in methanol and ethanol over zeolites. Higher biocrude yield was achieved in ethanol and at lower temperatures, while better quality biocrude with higher light biocrude ratio and lower average molecular weight (Mw) was favored in methanol and at higher temperatures. Application of zeolites improves the biocrude quality significantly. Among the catalysts, HY shows the strongest acidity and performs the best to produce high quality biocrude. Solid residues have been extensively explored with thermal gravity analysis and elemental analysis. It is reported for the first time that up to 99 wt.% of sulfur is deposited in the solid residue at 250 °C for both solvents. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has received widespread attention as a sustainable, environment-friendly, and alternative source of energy. It can be derived from plant, animal, and microbial organisms in the form of vegetable oil, fats, and lipids, respectively. However, biodiesel production from such sources is not economically feasible due to extensive downstream processes, such as trans-esterification and purification. To obtain cost-effective biodiesel, these bottlenecks need to be overcome. Escherichia coli, a model microorganism, has the potential to produce biodiesel directly from ligno-cellulosic sugars, bypassing trans-esterification. In this process, E. coli is engineered to produce biodiesel using metabolic engineering technology. The entire process of biodiesel production is carried out in a single microbial cell, bypassing the expensive downstream processing steps. This review focuses mainly on production of fatty acid and biodiesel in E. coli using metabolic engineering approaches. In the first part, we describe fatty acid biosynthesis in E. coli. In the second half, we discuss bottlenecks and strategies to enhance the production yield. A complete understanding of current developments in E. coli-based biodiesel production and pathway optimization strategies would reduce production costs for biofuels and plant-derived chemicals. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The liquefaction mechanisms of the algal biomass to bio-oil were investigated by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. It was found that NaOH was a satisfactory catalyst and contributed to helping the liquefaction of algal biomass. The bio-oil from algal biomass was composed of many compounds, including carbohydrates, alcohol, hydroxybenzene, carboxylic acid, alkene, ester, and others. The mechanism of hydrothermal catalytic liquefaction was discussed. It was found that, comparing with the husk bio-fuel, the algal bio-oil as a promising alternative fuel was more close to the traditional diesel fuel in physicochemical properties. The novel research outcomes contribute to improving the yield of bio-oil from microalgae, reducing the cost of the bio-oil and accelerating the commercial application of the algal bio-oil in the near future. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Non-food feedstocks including castor oil, palm fatty acid distillate and waste tallow were successfully converted into liquid hydrocarbon mixtures. This was achieved by a batch hydrotreating process over commercial Raney nickel as a catalyst within 5 h at a reaction temperature of 360 °C and an initial hydrogen pressure of 90 bar. The obtained liquid products consist of straight chain alkanes in the range from C8 to C20. Low amounts (2.5–4.4%) of higher n-alkanes (up to C28) could be detected. The occurrence of the latter indicates a Fischer-Tropsch like process under the chosen conditions besides the expected decarbonylation/decarboxylation and accompanying cracking reactions. Products obtained from castor oil also comprised an overall amount of 19% of ketones in the range from C8 to C19. All obtained products were tested on important fuel properties according to well-established methods given in EN 590, the European Standard for diesel fuel. Comparison with the obligatory boundary values given within this specification suggests an excellent suitability as blending components for fossil diesel fuel. For a full replacement further upgrading would be necessary. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Currently, semi-refined and refined vegetable oils are used as a feedstock in biodiesel production. However, criteria such as competition with conventional fossil fuel, economic reasons, shortage supply of food and its social impact on the global scale have somewhat slowed the development of the biodiesel industry. Spent bleaching earth is currently under-utilized by deposition in landfills with no attempt to recover the oil. In this study the waste oil adsorbed on spent bleaching earth, refined soybean oil, and waste cooking oil were evaluated as potential sources of biodiesel production in Iran. Different characteristics of the oil samples, such as fatty acid composition, peroxide, iodine, acid values, etc., were evaluated. A two-step esterification reaction using methanol was conducted to produce biofuel. Subsequently, physicochemical properties of produced biodiesel were analyzed. The oil content in spent bleaching earth was 19.3%, which was lowered to 3.7% using hexane as the solvent. Gas chromatography showed that palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids were predominantly fatty acids, respectively, and the highest content of saturated acids belonged to waste cooking oil (24%). The acidity of 8.3% was obtained for the oil recovered from spent bleaching earth followed by waste cooking oil (3.6%) and refined soybean oil (0.1%). Totally, the specifications of all biodiesel produced were in the range defined by ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. Since about 2000-3000 tones of spent bleaching earth residual oil is annually dumped and the amount of waste cooking oil produced yearly is 500,000 tones, there is a great potential for Iran to produce biodiesel from waste oils. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - To reach the target of smaller pressure drop and better heat transfer performance, packed beds with small tube-to-particle diameter ratio (D/dp&lt;10) have now been considered in many areas. Fluid-to-wall heat transfer coefficient is an important factor determining the performance of this type of beds. In this work, local fluid- to-wall heat transfer characteristic in packed beds was studied by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) at different Reynolds number for D/dp=1.5, 3.0 and 5.6. The results show that the fluid-to-wall heat transfer coefficient is oscillating along the bed with small tube-to-particle diameter ratio. Moreover, this phenomenon was explained by field synergy principle in detail. Two arrangement structures of particles in packed beds were recommended based on the synergy characteristic between flow and temperature fields. This study provides a new local understanding of fluid-to-wall heat transfer in packed beds with small tube-to-particle diameter ratio. © 2016, Science Press, Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The coke deposited on the surfaces of Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst in bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) was characterized by using a technique of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that the compounds with carbon related oxygen are the main constituent of the coke on the Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts. The amount of carbon compounds with two oxygen atoms is decreased with increasing reaction temperature due to their splitting by activated H2 during HDO processing of bio-oil. Carbon compounds with one oxygen atom are changed during the HDO of bio-oil processing, where soluble carbon compounds were converted to insoluble ones, with increasing reaction temperature leading to increase in hard carbon compounds. Graphite appeared on the surface of the Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts in the HDO of bio-oil at the highest temperature in the experiments. The related mechanism is presented in the paper. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Castor beans contain large quantities of oil and can grow in harsh environments. Unlike soybean oil, castor oil cannot be directly used for biodiesel production due to its extremely high viscosity. Here, we report an alternative source of biodiesel which possesses an ideal viscosity like soybean oil, and this new biodiesel could be obtained through simple synthetic routes from castor oil. Moreover, the properties of our newly designed ketone-containing triglycerides and its transesterified counterpart as biodiesel were systematically examined in our study, and their structures were characterized by using 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Practical application: The product obtained has the potential to be utilized as an alternative biofuel. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Background: Macroalgae represents a promising source of fermentable carbohydrates for use in the production of energy efficient biofuel. The primary carbohydrate in brown algae is the uronic acid-containing alginate, whereas green algae contains a significant amount of glucuronan. A necessary step in the conversion of these polyuronides to bioethanol is saccharification, which can be achieved by enzymatic or chemical degradation. Results: Polysaccharide lyases are a class of enzymes which cleave uronic acid-containing glycans via a β-elimination mechanism, acting both endo-And exolytically on their substrates. In the present work, we characterize a putative alginate lyase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a (Smlt2602) and describe a H208F mutant that, in addition to cleaving alginate-based substrates, displays significant, exolytic glucuronan activity. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first polysaccharide lyase to act exolytically on glucuronan and is an attractive candidate for the broad-spectrum digestion of polyuronides into fermentable monomers. © 2016 MacDonald et al.

AB  - Catalytic hydrogen production by methanol steam reforming is considered to be an attractive H2 source option. However, performance of conventional packed beds of methanol steam reforming is limited by heat transfer, which results in a low effective factor of the catalyst. In this work, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst coating has been generated by an innovate method named cold gas dynamic spray. Performance of the catalyst coating is investigated in a plate-type reactor after its characterization. SEM results of the catalyst coating show that it is rough and porous. Methanol steam reforming results of the coating are compared to that of the same catalyst in a packed bed of tubular reactor. Catalytic coating activity is superior to that of the packed bed due to more effective heat transfer. The highest methanol conversion of 90.45% is achieved at the temperature of 543 K when the space velocity is 1.09 h-1 on the coating. And the highest hydrogen production rate is 30.05 ml/min at the temperature of 543 K when the space velocity is 1.56 h-1 on the coating. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - In the present work, bio-oil derived from the catalytic pyrolysis of sewage sludge has been blended in small amounts with sunflower biodiesel with the aim of evaluating its potential as a novel, low-cost, and renewable biodiesel additive that could replace costly commercial biodiesel antioxidants normally used to date. The effect of blending small amounts of bio-oil with sunflower biodiesel on the biodiesel properties (oxidation stability, cold flow properties, flash point, and viscosity) has been analyzed. Furthermore, apart from studying the effect of adding low bio-oil concentrations (0.1, 1.8, and 3.5 mass %), the effect of other operating conditions, specifically the temperature (278-333 K) and mixing time (5-60 min), during the bio-oil and biodiesel blend preparations has also been analyzed. With regard the oxidation stability, blends prepared adding 3.5% mass fraction of bio-oil complied with the limits imposed by the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. Blending sewage sludge bio-oil and sunflower biodiesel did not result in an enhancement of the biodiesel cold flow properties in the studied range, while the flash point of these blends was lower than that of pure sunflower biodiesel. The viscosity was barely affected in all cases. The oxidation stability enhancement achieved by the addition of bio-oil obtained from sewage sludge catalytic pyrolysis was higher than the enhancement obtained with bio-oil from non-catalytic pyrolysis. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Kraft pulp and paper mills have several advantages for serving the emerging biorefinery industry as a source of raw materials. This review examines technologies for producing liquid biofuels, chemicals, and advanced materials from woody feedstocks to generate new sources of revenue. Market pull comes in part from government policies that drive substitution of petroleum-based products with biobased equivalents. Kraft mills have ample networks to supply feedstocks, whether these are forest residues or byproduct side streams. Pulp mills are well suited to expand sufficiently to accommodate production of value added platform chemicals that are in demand because of brand owner sustainability commitments. © 2016.

AB  - In this work, the oil of desert date (Balanite aegyptiaca) seed has been extracted using particle sizes of 0. 6mm and 1. 8 mm via solvent extraction. The chemical and physical properties of the oil were determined to ascertain its suitability for use in biodiesel production. The results of the analyses of the oil that were obtained to be saponification value, peroxide value, acid value, free fatty acid, specific gravity and moisture contentof 172. 5 meqKOH/g, 9. 37meq/kg, 0. 9256mg/g, 0. 47meq/g, 0. 9199 and 9. 8%, respectivelyhave shown that itis a good raw material for biodiesel production. The production of biodiesel was carried out using the extracted oil through transesterification process by varying catalyst concentration, oil to methanol molar ratio, reaction time and reaction temperature and analysed, and the analysis of the produced biodiesel showed that its cloud point, pour point, flash point and viscosity were 8 °C, -13°C, 170 °C and5. 2 respectively. The results of the analyses of the produced biodiesel, which were found to compare very well with the standard values, indicated that the liquid produced using the extracted desert date seed oil was biodiesel with a yield of 82%. © 2016, Sphinx Knowledge House.

AB  - The hydrogen production by conversion of liquid compounds containing hydrogen was investigated experimentally. The waveguide-supplied metal cylinder-based microwave plasma source (MPS) operated at frequency of 915 MHz at atmospheric pressure was used. The decomposition of ethanol, isopropanol and kerosene was performed employing plasma dry reforming process. The liquid was introduced into the plasma in the form of vapour. The amount of vapour ranged from 0.4 to 2.4 kg/h. Carbon dioxide with the flow rate ranged from 1200 to 2700 NL/h was used as a working gas. The absorbed microwave power was up to 6 kW. The effect of absorbed microwave power, liquid composition, liquid flow rate and working gas flow rate was analysed. All these parameters have a clear influence on the hydrogen production efficiency, which was described with such parameters as the hydrogen production rate [NL(H2)/h] and the energy yield of hydrogen production [NL(H2)/kWh]. The best achieved experimental results showed that the hydrogen production rate was up to 1116 NL(H2)/h and the energy yield was 223 NL(H2) per kWh of absorbed microwave energy. The results were obtained in the case of isopropanol dry reforming. The presented catalyst-free microwave plasma method can be adapted for hydrogen production not only from ethanol, isopropanol and kerosene, but also from different other liquid compounds containing hydrogen, like gasoline, heavy oils and biofuels.

AB  - The spatial positioning of enzymes and mass transport play crucial roles in the functionality and efficiency of enzyme cascade reactions. To fully understand the mass transport regulating kinetics of enzyme cascade reactions, we investigated the contribution of convective and diffusive transports to a cascade reaction of β-galactosidase (β-Gal)/glucose oxidase (GOx) confined in a microchannel. β-Gal and GOx are assembled on two separated gold films patterned in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel with a controllable distance from 50 to 100 μm. Experimental results demonstrated that the reaction yield increases with decreasing distance between two enzymes and increasing substrate flow rate. Together with the simulation results, we extracted individual reaction kinetics of the enzyme cascade reaction and found that the reaction rate catalyzed by β-Gal occurred much faster than by GOx, and thus, the β-Gal catalytic reaction showed diffusion controll, whereas the GOx catalytic reaction showed kinetic controll. Since the decrease in the enzymes distance shortens the transport length of intermediate glucose to GOx, the amount of glucose reaching GOx will be increased in the unit time, and in turn, the enzyme cascade reaction yield will be increased with decreasing the gap distance. This phenomenon is similar to the intermediates pool of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the metabolic system. This study promotes the understanding of the metabolic/signal transduction processes and active transport in biological systems and promises to design high performance biosensors and biofuel cells systems. © the Owner Societies 2016.

AB  - Biosynthesis approaches for the production of higher alcohols as a source of alternative fossil fuels have garnered increasing interest recently. However, there is little information available in the literature about using undirected whole-cell mutagenesis (UWCM) in vivo to improve higher alcohols production. In this study, for the first time, we approached this question from two aspects: first preferentially improving the capacity of expression host, and subsequently optimizing metabolic pathways using multiple genetic mutations to shift metabolic flux toward the biosynthetic pathway of target products to convert intermediate 2-keto acid compounds into diversified C4∼C5 higher alcohols using UWCM in vivo, with the aim of improving the production. The results demonstrated the production of higher alcohols including isobutanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol from glucose and duckweed under simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) scheme were higher based on the two aspects compared with only the use of wild-type stain as expression host. These findings showed that the improvement via UWCM in vivo in the two aspects for expression host and metabolic flux can facilitate the increase of higher alcohols production before using gene editing technology. Our work demonstrates that a multi-faceted approach for the engineering of novel synthetic pathways in microorganisms for improving biofuel production is feasible.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to evaluate the bioenergy and bio-based material recovery from fruit scraps through an innovative process, e.g., supercritical water gasification, which presents several advantages in comparison to the traditional processes for energy and matter recovery. In particular, experimental tests of peach scraps were carried out using bench-scale plant plug flow reactor type, in which the selected liquid matter can be pumped until 300 bar and heated until 600°C to achieve the supercritical water condition of the water. The main results showed that, in the range of the feed flow rate of 5-30 mL/min and at fixed operative conditions of T and P (T = 550°C, and P = 250 bar), it is possible to obtain tar-free syngas with a higher heating value of 14-16 MJ/kgdry basis. The influence of the residence time was studied for the gaseous and liquid phases. For each one of them, it was possible to highlight a specific trend. In the liquid phase, the main components were acetic acid, hydroquinone, and syringaldehyde that are intermediates for the chemical synthesis of interesting bio-based chemicals and biochemicals. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, we have designed and compared functionalized carbon-nanotube-based electrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of NADH. We show that oxidation of NADH at neutral pH values can be performed by pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and directly wired diaphorase or ruthenium phenanthrolinequinone molecular catalysts. Glucose dehydrogenase was immobilized on these MWCNT electrodes by an activated-ester-modified pyrene linker. Glucose-oxidizing bioelectrodes were compared and integrated into a bucky-paper-based glucose/O2 biofuel cell, using a bilirubin-oxidase-modified bucky-paper cathode. The best configuration was obtained using a NADH-oxidizing molecular catalyst at the anode. The biofuel cell exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 0.62 V and delivers a power output of 0.47 mW cm−2. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - We report the synthesis of a highly active microporous sulphonated monolithic catalyst (HCC-ML-SO3H) through the Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction between carbazole and α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst FeCl3 under refluxing conditions, followed by sulphonation reaction (chlorosulfonic acid treatment under controlled reaction conditions). This sulphonated solid acid catalyst can catalyze the ring opening of furanoid moiety of furfuryl alcohol (FA) and subsequent esterification with various alcohols in one-pot to produce levulinate esters, which are potential biofuels. Here the porous organic polymer bearing reactive SO3H groups (HCC-ML-SO3H) acts as a very reactive solid acid catalyst. Due to large surface area and extensive cross-linking this porous polymer is very attractive material for the synthesis of levulinate esters from FA under metal free conditions. The catalyst has been characterized by N2 sorption, HR-TEM, 13C solid state CP MAS NMR, XPS and FT-IR. The catalyst can be reused for four consecutive reaction cycles without appreciable loss of activity. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Background: Plant lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant, renewable feedstock for the production of biobased fuels and chemicals. Previously, we showed that iron can act as a co-catalyst to improve the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. However, directly adding iron catalysts into biomass prior to pretreatment is diffusion limited, and increases the cost of biorefinery operations. Recently, we developed a new strategy for expressing iron-storage protein ferritin intracellularly to accumulate iron as a catalyst for the downstream deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, we extend this approach by fusing the heterologous ferritin gene with a signal peptide for secretion into Arabidopsis cell walls (referred to here as FerEX). Results: The transgenic Arabidopsis plants. FerEX. accumulated iron under both normal and iron-fertilized growth conditions; under the latter (iron-fertilized) condition, FerEX transgenic plants showed an increase in plant height and dry weight by 12 and 18 %, respectively, compared with the empty vector control plants. The SDS- and native-PAGE separation of cell-wall protein extracts followed by Western blot analyses confirmed the extracellular expression of ferritin in FerEX plants. Meanwhile, Perls' Prussian blue staining and X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) maps revealed iron depositions in both the secondary and compound middle lamellae cell-wall layers, as well as in some of the corner compound middle lamella in FerEX. Remarkably, their harvested biomasses showed enhanced pretreatability and digestibility, releasing, respectively, 21 % more glucose and 34 % more xylose than the empty vector control plants. These values are significantly higher than those of our recently obtained ferritin intracellularly expressed plants. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that extracellular expression of ferritin in Arabidopsis can produce plants with increased growth and iron accumulation, and reduced thermal and enzymatic recalcitrance. The results are attributed to the intimate colocation of the iron co-catalyst and the cellulose and hemicellulose within the plant cell-wall region, supporting the genetic modification strategy for incorporating conversion catalysts into energy crops prior to harvesting or processing at the biorefinery. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Raw bio oil includes multicomponents. In order to avoid the interference between complex reactions, the model compounds, instead of the real bio oil, have been widely used for the study of raw bio-oil upgrade. In this work, the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of raw pine pyrolysis bio oil was investigated at 200 °C using Pd/Zn synergistic catalysis under hydrogen pressures of 200, 300, and 400 psi, separately. The resulting product included gas, liquid, and coke. The gas was characterized using a gas chromatography. The liquid was characterized using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The results showed that the HDO performance achieved promotion to some extent by the Pd/Zn synergistic catalysis compared with use of Pd/C or Zn2+, independently. The HDO also gave rise to improvements on physicochemical properties of bio oils. Notably, the highest water content (13.16 wt%) revealed that deoxygenation reaction could be promoted by Pd/Zn synergistic catalysis compared with use of Pd/C or Zn2+, independently. More importantly, the highest hydrocarbon yield (19.15% on the base of liquid part) could be obtained by the treatment of 300 psi pressure and 200 °C temperature over Zn/Pd/C synergistic catalysis.

AB  - In view of the potential use of pyrolysis-based technologies, it is crucial to understand the environmental hazards of pyrolysis-derived products, in particular bio-oils. Here, three bio-oils were produced from fast pyrolysis of pine wood and intermediate pyrolysis of corn stalk and poultry litter. They were fully characterized by chemical analysis and tested for their biodegradability and their ecotoxicity on the crustacean Daphnia magna and the green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata. These tests were chosen as required by the European REACH regulation. These three bio-oils were biodegradable, with 40-60% of biodegradation after 28 days, and had EC50 values above 100 mg L-1 for the crustacean and above 10 mg L-1 for the alga, showing low toxicity to the aquatic life. The toxic unit approach was applied to verify whether the observed toxicity could be predicted from the data available for the substances detected in the bio-oils. The predicted values largely underestimated the experimental values. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The sequences of development that cut across industrialization, population growth, environmental and economic reasons led individuals and organizations to have direct responsibilities in the development and implementation of sound technologies that will curtail the emissions of hazardous gases and particulate matter. As a result, this study focuses on the optimization and characterization of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. It involves the characterization of the feed stock, the transesterification, the purification of the transesterified waste cooking oil, the optimization of the biodiesel produced using 24 factorial experimental designs, and the characterization of the biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil. Result obtained reveals that operating temperature of 30°C, transesterification time of 60 min, catalyst weight of 0.5%, and alcohol to oil ratio of 6:1 are the optimum conditions with optimum yield of 90% of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. Experimental determinations of some useful properties of the biodiesel produced were carried out for the purpose of confirming the quality as well as the identification of the biofuel. These were moisture content, specific gravity, viscosity, acid value, sulfated ash, cetane number, cloud point, flash point, distillation characteristic, and refractive index. The results obtained were 0.097%, 0.854, 4.90 mm2/s, 0.80 mgKOH/g, 0.01%, 48.00, 53°F, 143°C, 320°C, and 1.412, respectively. The results obtained showed that all the parameters compare favorably with literatures and the standard biodiesel specifications; hence production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil is possible. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate the role of ethanol and temperature on the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in biopolyol produced from hydrothermal liquefaction of loblolly pine (Pinus spp.) carried out at 250, 300, 350 and 390 °C for 30 min. Water and water/ethanol mixture (1/1, wt/wt) were used as liquefying solvent in the HTL experiments. HTL in water and water/ethanol is donated as W-HTL and W/E-HTL, respectively. It was found that 300 °C and water/ethanol solvent was the optimum liquefaction temperature and solvent, yielding up to 68.1 wt.% bio-oil and 2.4 wt.% solid residue. 31P-NMR analysis showed that biopolyol produced by W-HTL was rich in phenolic OH while W/E-HTL produced more aliphatic OH rich biopolyols. Moreover, biopolyols with higher hydroxyl concentration were produced by W/E-HTL. Carbonyl groups were analyzed by 19F-NMR, which showed that ethanol reduced the concentration of carbonyl groups. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study combined phosphoric acid-catalyzed pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis to produce biosugars from Gracilaria verrucosa as a potential renewable resource for bioenergy applications. We optimized phosphoric acid-catalyzed pretreatment conditions to 1:10 solid-to-liquid ratio, 1.5 % phosphoric acid, 140 °C, and 60 min reaction time, producing a 32.52 ± 0.06 % total reducing sugar (TRS) yield. By subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis, a 68.61 ± 0.90 % TRS yield was achieved. These results demonstrate the potential of phosphoric acid to produce biosugars for biofuel and biochemical production applications. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The growing demand of diesel power generators in Iran has led to air pollution. Hence, it is necessary to ascertain the level of performance and emissions of the diesel power generators fueled with biofuels. For the first time, in this study, the effect of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and diesel fuel blends (B0, B20, B50, B80 and B100) on the performance (brake power, brake torque, BSFC, brake thermal efficiency and exhaust gas temperature) and emission characteristics (CO and NOx) of a diesel power generator model CAT3412 was investigated. The experiments were conducted at rated engine speed 1530 rpm and various engine loads (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). The results of the study showed an increase in brake power, brake torque, BTE and NOx emission and a reduction trend in BSFC and CO emission at higher engine loads for all the biodiesel-diesel blends. In addition, the research results indicated that B20 and B50 fuel blends in terms of performance emission characteristics could be recognized as the potential candidates to be certificated for usage in the diesel power generator. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This article predicts the optimum conditions for the production of fatty acid ethyl ester (Biodiesel) by trans-esterification process of waste cooking sunflower oil with ethanol in the presence of homogeneous catalyst (KOH). Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used for predicting the mathematical regression equation and optimizing the biodiesel yield. The optimum reaction conditions were found to be 9.05 (mole mole−1) of (ethanol to waste cooking sunflower oil ratio), 0.99 (wt% to oil) of catalyst concentration, 57.31°C of reaction temperature, 77.12 minutes of reaction time, and 494.94 rpm of mixing rate to achieve 96.33% biodiesel yield by weight. The production rate of produced biodiesel also increased significantly. The fuel properties were measured and found closer to the ASTM standards of biodiesel. Therefore, the suggested biofuel has good scope for use in compression ignition (CI) engines. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Intermediates for synthetic paraffinic kerosene with structures of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), were synthesized from algal oil extracted from Nannochloris sp. biomass. Microalgae were grown under mixotrophic conditions to improve biomass production, using glycerin as additional source of organic carbon, by-product in FAME obtaining process. Microalgae were supplementary stressed to increase the lipid productivity, by reducing the inorganic nitrogen and partially replacing it with organic nitrogen (hydrolyzed proteins from the same microalgae). Since algal oil has high free fatty acids (FFA) content, a two-step process for FAME synthesis was necessary. In the first step, FFA was esterified with methanol over SO42-/TiO2-La2O3 solid acid catalyst. The second step, i.e. methanolysis of pre-treated oil, was performed over Na2SiO3/Mg-Al-hydrotalcite (Na2SiO3/Mg-Al-HTC) heterogeneous base catalyst. The Na2SiO3/Mg-Al-HTC catalyst was synthesized and then characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), textural analysis (BET method), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis (EDXRF) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The influences of catalyst loading and stability, methanol-to-oil molar ratio and the reaction time on the FAME yield were carefully studied. FAME producing technology was investigated first in batch and then in a continuous flow process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study assesses some uses of nutrient-rich juice mechanically extracted from freshly harvested Miscanthus x giganteus (MxG) as part of a green biorefinery system. The juice was used for culturing Saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria. MxG juice was further used as substrate for fermentation to produce lactic acid using Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum. The results show that MxG juice was a highly nutritious source for the cultivation of bacteria. Higher concentrations of MxG juice used as culture media, resulted in higher cell growth both aerobically and anaerobically. The highest ethanol yield of 70% theoretical and concentration of 0.75 g/100 ml were obtained from S. cerevisiae cultivated with 90% (v/v) MxG juice media and used for miscanthus solid fraction fermentation. 11.91 g/L of lactic acid was also successfully produced from MxG juice through SSF. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel polymer-based alkaline catalyst was prepared with sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and N-[(2-Hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan chloride (HTCC), interlinked by epichlorohydrin (ECH), for biodiesel production. The structure and properties of the catalyst were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy. The effects of the variables on the transesterificaton of soybean oil to biodiesel were investigated. It is found that Na2SiO3 was bridged on HTCC chains through ECH and well dispersed in HTCC matrix in nano size. The transesterification conversion reached at 97.0% under the reaction conditions of methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, catalyst loading of 4.0 wt.% at 55 °C for 60 min. After the second run, the catalytic activity kept stable, which was contributed to the stability and dispersion of Na2SiO3 in the catalyst. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for identifying and quantifying chemical components in complex mixtures. It is often used to analyze gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, bio-diesel and the organic fraction of bio-crude/bio-oil. In most of those analyses, the first dimension of separation is non-polar, followed by a polar separation. The aqueous fractions of bio-crude and other aqueous samples from biofuels production have been examined with similar column combinations. However, sample preparation techniques such as derivatization, solvent extraction, and solid-phase extraction were necessary prior to analysis. In this study, aqueous fractions obtained from the hydrothermal liquefaction of algae were characterized by two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry without prior sample preparation techniques using a polar separation in the first dimension followed by a non-polar separation in the second. Two-dimensional plots from this analysis were compared with those obtained from the more traditional column configuration. Results from qualitative characterization of the aqueous fractions of algal bio-crude are discussed in detail. The advantages of using a polar separation followed by a non-polar separation for characterization of organics in aqueous samples by two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry are highlighted. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Fast catalytic pyrolysis ofwild reedwas carried out at 500 °C. Waste fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst disposed from a petroleum refinery process was activated through acetone-washing and calcination and used as catalyst for pyrolysis. In order to evaluate the catalytic activity of waste FCC catalyst, commercial HY zeolite catalyst with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 5.1 was also used. The bio-oil produced from pyrolysis was analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). When the biomass-to-catalyst ratio was 1:1, the production of phenolics and aromatics was promoted considerably by catalysis, whereas the content of oxygenates was affected little. Significant conversion of oxygenates to furans and aromatics was observed when the biomass-to-catalyst ratio of 1:10 was used. Activated waste FCC catalyst showed comparable catalytic activity for biomass pyrolysis to HY in terms of the promotion of valuable chemicals, such as furans, phenolics and aromatics. The results of this study imply that waste FCC catalyst can be an important economical resource for producing high-value-added chemicals from biomass. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - In response to demands for sustainable domestic fuel sources, research into biofuels has become increasingly important. Many challenges face biofuels in their effort to replace petroleum fuels, but rational strain engineering of algae and photosynthetic organisms offers a great deal of promise. For decades, mutations and stress responses in photosynthetic microbiota were seen to result in production of exciting high-energy fuel molecules, giving hope but minor capability for design. However, ‘-omics’ techniques for visualizing entire cell processing has clarified biosynthesis and regulatory networks. Investigation into the promising production behaviors of the model organism C. reinhardtii and its mutants with these powerful techniques has improved predictability and understanding of the diverse, complex interactions within photosynthetic organisms. This new equipment has created an exciting new frontier for high-throughput, predictable engineering of photosynthetically produced carbon-neutral biofuels. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Biodiesel production based on microalgae and using carbon dioxide as feedstock constitutes an attractive biofuel alternative. Technology development and process optimization are necessary to minimize the overall production cost. Moreover, in the framework of process sustainability, social and environmental impacts should include process safety aspects. In this context, the objective of this work is to develop a biodiesel production process based on microalgae and the subsequent estimation of the associated risks, thus contributing to more sustainable and safe processes. The biodiesel biorefinery is optimized, taking into account alternative configurations for algae cultivation and lipid extraction. Algae cultivation options are open ponds and tubular photobioreactors. Regarding lipid extraction, dewatering and subsequent n-hexane extraction, and combined ethanol/n-hexane extraction are the studied alternatives. Numerical results showed that open ponds and n-hexane extraction provide maximum net present value. However, n-hexane consumption dramatically rises, and industrial hazards have not been considered in the optimization process. To overcome this issue, a preliminary hazard analysis is carried out to identify hazardous materials and operations. Event trees are formulated to derive the frequencies of different accident scenarios, further determining the consequences. The major consequences of accidents involve toxic releases of high quantities of n-hexane. By comparing the proposed alternatives, this work aims to highlight the need to consider not only economic but also safety and environmental objectives in the development of a biodiesel production project. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Over 90% of the inherent Mg and Ca in wood can be released during wood hydrothermal processing in a semi-continuous flow reactor at 10 MPa and 150 °C. An increase in temperature to 180 °C results in rapid release of Mg and Ca, but a further increase in temperature has little effect. The release of Mg and Ca is associated with the conversion of organic matter during hydrothermal processing. In particular, the release of water-insoluble Mg and Ca correlates well with the arabinose recovery, suggesting that these species are bound to carboxylic acid functional group on hemicellulose side chains and their release requires the cleavage of these side chains. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the study was focused on extraction of fleshing oil from limed fleshings with different neutralization process by ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) followed by solvent extraction. The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from limed fleshing oil by two stage process has also been investigated. The central composite design (CCD) was used to study the effect of process variables viz., amount of flesh, particle size and time of fleshing oil extraction. The maximum yield of fleshing oil from limed fleshings post neutralization by ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) was 26.32g and 12.43g obtained at 200g of flesh, with a particle size of 3.90mm in the time period of 2h. Gas chromatography analysis reveals that the biodiesel (FAME) obtained from limed fleshings is rich in oleic and palmitic acids with weight percentages 46.6 and 32.2 respectively. The resulting biodiesel was characterized for its physio-chemical properties of diesel as per international standards (EN14214). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Production of solid particles significantly increases the dangerousness of combustion engines. The excellent sorbtion characteristics of the solid particles increases their harmful effects and makes them very dangerous component of emissions which causes health problems. Currently there are many design solutions which aim to reduce smoke of combustion engines. One of the most significant solutions suggests increasing the injection pressures up to the limit of 250 MPa and filtering the exhaust gases. The paper compares different fuels and biofuels, whether used alone or in mixtures, and their effect on smoke of supercharged CI engine. The comparison uses the 8-point NRSC (Non-Road Steady Cycle) test during which the following fuels were used: diesel, rapeseed methyl ester, rapeseed oil, Jatropha curcas oil, biobutanol, hydrotreated oil and other blended fuels. The measurement and comparison results show that using biofuels can significantly reduce smoke of combustion engine by up to tens of percent in comparison to diesel. © 2016, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - The development of multifunctional catalysts to selectively produce in one-step processes jet fuels (around C12) and diesel (around C16-C18) from bio-oils (vegetable and especially algal oil) is still a challenge to produce next-generation biofuels. This topic is addressed here by investigating the activity of Ni based catalysts in the methyl palmitate conversion, as model test reaction. The performance of Ni/HBEA (8%wt Ni) catalysts, where mesoporosity was introduced by desilication, were compared with those of mesoporous SBA-15. It is evidenced that desilication allows to introduce selective hydrocracking functionality together with HDO (hydrodeoxygenation), the latter prevailing occurring through hydrogenation of the acid group rather than via hydrodecarboxylation.

AB  - This work presents the techno-economic analysis results of a novel polygeneration process that converts biomass, petcoke, and natural gas into methanol, ethanol, DME, olefins, FT-liquids, and electricity, while eliminating CO2 emissions. A comprehensive process simulation model was developed in Aspen Plus. The economic optimization of the plant is performed for a wide range of biomass to petcoke ratios: 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%, using the particle swarm optimization technique. Moreover, five different optimization scenarios are considered for each feedstock including maximizing profitability of the plant, maximizing petcoke utilization, maximizing fuel production, maximizing olefin production and maximizing ethanol production. The economic optimization results showed that up to 65% of feedstock inlet can be a petcoke/biomass mixture while the process is still profitable. In addition, the results indicate that the methanol scenario leads to the minimum thermal efficiency and NPV compared to the other chemical production units. © 2016

AB  - In this work we integrate switchgrass and algae in order to operate a biorefinery with no need for fossil based raw materials in the production of biodiesel (FAME). A superstructure optimization approach is used to select the optimal integrated topology, gasification, and reforming technologies, that provide the thermal energy and the methanol that biodiesel production requires. The excess of methanol can be sold as biofuel or it can be further processed to gasoline. The optimal integrated process involves indirect gasification followed by steam reforming based on the need for a high H2 to CO ratio to produce methanol and to avoid the use of oxygen. The integrated process produces 776 ML/year (205 Mgal/year) of biofuels, 34% FAME, at 0.14 €/L (0.53 €/gal). The plant does not emit CO2, but captures 1.27 kg of CO2 per kg of methanol produced. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Abstract The potential of lignocellulosic biomass as a sustainable biofuel source is substantial. The development of an efficient and cost effective pretreatment approach remains challenging. In this study, we have explored a new, relatively cheap pretreatment option that works at ambient temperatures. By using microbubbles generated by fluidic oscillation, free radicals around the gas-liquid interface of the microbubble readily attack and degrade lignocellulosic biomass, rendering it more amenable to digestion. The combination of microbubbles and Pseudomonas putida—a robust delignification and cellulolytic microbe, further improved biomass degradation and consequently, increased glucose production from wheat straw in comparison to solo pretreatment of the biomass with microbubbles and Pseudomonas putida respectively. The microbubble-microbe approach to make biomass more amenable to sugar production is potentially a valuable alternative or complementary pretreatment technique. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The aim of the paper is a comparison among three innovative process layouts for biomethane and power production from humid biomasses: anaerobic digestion (AD), supercritical water gasification integrated in a supercritical steam turbine stages (SCWG + SuST) and a technology that combines these two, AD plus SCWG and SuST. All the solutions were implemented in an ad hoc simulative tool of Aspen Hysis® v.7.0.1. Livestock sludge (LS) with an energy content up to 10 wt% (ashes free) was used as reference biomass to establish and compare the performance of any proposed process scheme. LS feedstocks introduced in the SCWG + SuST increased both biomethane production and power production of about 50 % compared to AD process that produces 25 Nm3/(day t) of pure biomethane. Combining both technologies, the digestate from AD outflow is feeding the SCWG + SuST process, there is an increase of 50 % of power generation with a production of biomethane of about 36 Nm3/(day t). Another advantage of the SCWG + SuST is that, set the fed, it is possible to reduce drastically the volume of the plant because the fermentation step, which usually corresponds to 15–30 days, is not required. Considering that although AD process is a simple and consolidated technology, it does not allow the total recovery of the organic compounds and requires long period for the biomass, the proposed innovative processes could offer new solutions for biomethane and power production. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The demand for biofuels increases due to concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and depletion of fossil oil reserves. Many substances identified as potential biofuels are solvents or already used as flavors or fragrances. Although humans and the environment may be readily exposed little is known regarding their (eco)toxicological effects. In this study, the three potential biofuels ethyl levulinate (EL), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) and 2-methylfuran (2-MF) were investigated for their acute embryo toxicity and teratogenicity using the fish embryo toxicity (FET) test to identify unknown hazard potentials and to allow focusing further research on substances with low toxic potentials. In addition, two fossil fuels (diesel and gasoline) and an established biofuel (rapeseed oil methyl ester) were investigated as references. The FET test is widely accepted and used in (eco)toxicology. It was performed using the zebrafish Danio rerio, a model organism useful for the prediction of human teratogenicity. Testing revealed a higher acute toxicity for EL (LC50: 83 mg/L) compared to 2-MTHF (LC50: 2980 mg/L), 2-MF (LC50: 405 mg/L) and water accommodated fractions of the reference fuels including gasoline (LC50: 244 mg DOC/L). In addition, EL caused a statistically significant effect on head development resulting in elevated head lengths in zebrafish embryos. Results for EL reduce its likelihood of use as a biofuel since other substances with a lower toxic potential are available. The FET test applied at an early stage of development might be a useful tool to avoid further time and money requiring steps regarding research on unfavorable biofuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Byproducts from a photocatalytic pretreated model lignin chemical, sodium LS (lignosulfonate), was used to produce electricity in SCMFCs (single chamber microbial fuel cells). Pretreating LS was performed using TiO2-UV photocatalysis. Optimization and modeling of the photocatalytic degradation process was performed using the Box-Behnken design method to achieve a maximum BOD5 to COD ratio. LC-MS (Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) analysis was conducted to identify compounds produced from the photocatalysis of LS. The biofilm microbial diversity and performance of SCMFCs fed PrLS (pretreated LS) was compared to SCMFCs fed glucose at the same COD loadings and operating conditions. The PrLS fed SCMFCs, operated at 37 ± 1 °C, generated maximum current and power densities of 6556 ± 360 mA m-3 and 1881 ± 103 mW m-3, respectively. The corresponding maximum current and power densities normalized to the cathode area were 868 ± 48 mA m-2 and 248 ± 14 mW m-2, respectively. The SCMFCs removed 77.6 ± 2.3% of the COD of the PrLS and achieved a coulombic efficiency of 17.7 ± 1.2%. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of photocatalysis coupled with a bioelectrochemical system in treating lignin compounds and simultaneously generate electricity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Performance of yeasts on industrial processes can be dramatically improved by immobilization of the biocatalyst. The immobilization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae inside monolithic macroporous hydrogels were produced by in-situ polymerization of acrylamide around a live yeast suspension under cryogelation conditions. Preculture of the yeasts was not necessary and this innovative and simple procedure is amenable to scaling-up to industrial production. The yeasts were efficiently retained in monolithic hydrogels, presenting excellent mechanical properties and high cell viability. Macroporous hydrogels showed a fast mass transport allowing the hydrogel-yeast complexes achieved similar ethanol yield and productivity than free yeasts, which is larger than those reached with yeasts immobilized in compact hydrogels. Moreover, the same yeasts were able to maintain its activity by up to five reaction cycles with a cell single batch during fermentation reactions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Co-hydroprocessing of petroleum fractions with residual lipids is a promising technology for hybrid fuels production. The aim of this study is the identification of an effective operating window for co-hydroprocessing of Heavy Atmospheric Gas Oil (HAGO) with Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) within the nominal operating limits of a refinery. In particular, two Liquid Hourly Space Velocities or LHSVs (0.66 and 1 h-1) and three hydrogen-To-oil or H2/Oil ratios (300, 400 and 500 L H2/L feed) were studied for a HAGO/WCO 90/10 V/V blended feedstock over a commercial hydrotreating NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The two parameters were evaluated with respect to the attained diesel content and quality of the produced hybrid fuels. All experiments were performed at a constant pressure of 5.6 MPa and temperature of 350 °C. The results have shown that higher LHSV is preferable in terms of the hydrogen consumption affecting the conversion cost. As far as H2/Oil is concerned, high H2/Oil ratios are more effective, rendering higher conversion, diesel content and heteroatom removal. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Supercritical liquefaction process is used for producing energy from biomass. The common reaction conditions for supercritical liquefaction process are the 240-380 °C temperature range and 5-20 MPa pressure values range. Xanthium strumarium liquefaction experiments were performed in a cylindrical reactor (75 mL) in organic solvents (acetone, ethanol, methanol) under supercritical conditions with (zinc oxide, calcium hydroxide) and without catalyst at the temperatures of 250, 275 and 300 °C. The produced liquids at 300 °C in liquefaction were analyzed and characterized by Elemental, GC-MS and FT-IR. 36, 37 and 50 different types of compounds were identified by GC-MS obtained in acetone, ethanol and methanol respectively. The liquid product efficiency has been obtained at 300 °C in acetone with zinc oxide catalyst (74.80%). The highest HHV value has been calculated as 32.16 MJ/kg with calcium hydroxide catalyst in acetone. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aiming to retard the self-polymerization of the reaction intermediates during bio-oil upgrading process, a large amount of alcohol (e.g., 50 wt% with respect to bio-oil) was used in the stabilization of fast pyrolysis oil by esterification before hydrotreatment by the authors in a previous work. In order to reduce the amount of alcohol use and hence improve the process economy, effects of stabilizing fast pyrolysis oil by esterification with methanol, ethanol or glycerol at a small loading (5 wt% w.r.t. bio-oil) in the presence of Amberlyst-35 DRY - A solid acid catalyst on the subsequent hydrotreatment of the oil were investigated. The bio-oil hydrotreatment experiments were carried out at 300 and 350 °C in a combined batch and semi-batch operation mode with Ru/C catalyst. The results demonstrated that, although stabilization of the pyrolysis oil by esterification with a small alcohol loading had least effects on the mass and carbon distribution in the hydrotreatment products and the elemental composition of the hydrotreated oil products, it could effectively reduce the molecular weight of the feed, prevent self-polymerization and decrease the overall molecular weight of the hydrotreated oil products. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lipase from Candida sp. 99-125 is widely employed to catalyzed transesterification and can be used for biodiesel production. In this study, the lipase was immobilized by combined adsorption and entrapment to catalyze biodiesel production from waste cooking oil (WCO) via transesterification, and investigating co-immobilizing agents as additives according to the enzyme activity. The addition of the mixed co-immobilizing agents has positive effects on the activities of the immobilized lipase. Three different immobilizing methods were compared by the conversion ratio of biodiesel and structured by Atom Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), respectively. It was found that entrapment followed by adsorption was the best method. The effect of the co-immobilizing agent amount, lipase dosage, water content, and reuse ability of the immobilized lipase was investigated. By comparison with previous research, this immobilized lipase showed good reuse ability: the conversion ratio excesses 70% after 10 subsequent reactions, in particular, was better than Novozym435 and TLIM on waste cooking oil for one unit of lipase. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Energy can be recovered from stillage from cellulosic biorefineries in different ways, including direct combustion and fast pyrolysis. These different energy conversion routes require different level of inputs from natural resources, non-renewable resources, and economic services. Due to the high energetic and economic costs of stillage recovery methods, it is essential to perform a sustainability analysis of these different options before commercial deployment. Thus, the main objective of this study was to assess the relative sustainability and environmental impact of fast pyrolysis and direct combustion systems for the beneficial use of waste stillage using emergy analysis. The estimated emergy sustainability indices of direct combustion and fast pyrolysis were 0.09 and 0.07, respectively, where the renewable fraction of stillage was the most influential input parameter. Additionally, the net product transformity for direct combustion and fast pyrolysis were 7.06E+05 and 2.61E+05 seJ/J, respectively. Overall, a 23% higher emergy sustainability index for the direct combustion compared to the fast pyrolysis and a 63% lower overall product transformity for the fast pyrolysis compared to the direct combustion suggests that both systems, at the current state of the technology, offer differing advantages for stillage utilization depending upon the desired end products and uses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently, technologies have been developed to counter soil degradation and sequester carbon. One of these is application of biochar to the soils. Biochar is a material produced by pyrolysis of waste biomass or organic waste from urban life. Mexican soils exhibit severe physical, chemical and biological degradation, which has not been assessed in its proper dimension. Recent literature indicates positive results from the application of biochar to the soil, improving physical, chemical and biological properties and increasing crop productivity. Biochar, a recalcitrant form of carbon incorporated into the soil, acts as a long-lasting carbon reservoir, delaying its return to the atmosphere as CO2, a situation that would help mitigate climate change. An additional benefit of this product is that the raw material for its production comes from municipal organic waste, which often constitutes environmental pollution. Production of biochar and its application is a relatively recent alternative technology, which has been used little or not at all in Mexico. In addition, it is a potential non-conventional source of jobs for the agroforestry sector and municipalities that can generate added value to the organic residues in a product with commercial value. Little is known of the effect of the type of raw material or the pyrolysis used for the generation of biochar on plants. Nor is there much information on the presence of substances that may be toxic for soil microorganisms or plants. To avoid unnecessary risks or adverse effects, it is necessary to characterize the chemical and physical properties of different types of biochar and elucidate the effect of its application on soil properties and crops. The answers to the above questions will serve to generate a solid foundation to propose their use as a soil amendment and as a mechanism for carbon sequestration. © 2016 Mexican Society of Soil Science.

AB  - Bio-oil from pyrolysis of biomass is an important renewable source for liquid fuel and/or for chemicals. However, the application of bio-oil was severely restricted due to its high viscosity, acidity, and low heating value. Hence, it is necessary to upgrade the bio-oil for deoxygenation or for chemicals by catalytic reactions. In this paper, the catalytic behaviors of SAPO-34, ZSM-5, and Y zeolite on pyrolysis of cellulose were investigated via pyrolyzer combined with gas chromatography and mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS) method in Py-mode. The results showed that ZSM-5 and Y zeolite could promote the conversions of oxygen-containing components to gases, water, aromatics, and phenols. Comparatively, more gas and water were generated under the catalysis of Y zeolite at lower temperatures, while at temperatures above 700°C, the effect of ZSM-5 became more distinct; aromatics were more generated under the catalysis of ZSM-5, while Y zeolite exerted a more distinct role in promoting the formation of phenols. The effect of SAPO-34 caused more water and furfural derivatives, less aromatics and phenols, and exerted a weak influence on gases. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Py-GC/MS of microalgae (Chlorococcum sp.), grape marc and wood chips (Pinus radiata) and the bio-oils produced from CO/H2O reactions of these substrates has been studied. The Py-GC/MS technique provided a more complete understanding of the chemical composition of the bio-oil than conventional GC–MS and, also, more structural information on the biomass. Results show that the nature of the pyrolysis products depends on the original constituents of the biomass. The pyrolysate of the original feedstocks and the bio-oil included compounds derived from the original constituents in the biomass as well as from other secondary reactions for the bio-oil. The reactions of nitrogen compounds in the original biomass were elucidated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cubic Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) were synthesized using ascorbic acid as a reducing agent and were evaluated for the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction. PdNPs were confined with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) dispersions to form black suspensions and these inks were dropcast onto glassy carbon electrodes. Different nanoparticle sizes were synthesized and investigated upon oxygen reduction capacities (onset potential and electrocatalytic current densities) under O2 saturated conditions at varying pH values. Strong evidence of O2 diffusion limitation was demonstrated. In order to overcome oxygen concentration and diffusion limitations in solution, we used a gas diffusion layer to create a PdNP-based air-breathing cathode, which delivered-1.5 mA cm-2 at 0.0 V with an onset potential of 0.4 V. This air-breathing cathode was combined with a specially designed phenanthrolinequinone/glucose dehydrogenase-based anode to form a complete glucose/O2 hybrid bio-fuel cell providing an open circuit voltage of 0.554 V and delivering a maximal power output of 184 ± 21 μW cm-2 at 0.19 V and pH 7.0. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - It is easy to predict that in the coming years in Europe biodiesel will play an increasingly important role in the transport sector. The European Commission has set at 10% by 2020 the proportion that biofuels should represent in total fuel used in transport and biodiesel is currently the most widely used biofuel in the European Union. The most common way to produce biodiesel is through transesterification of vegetable oils with methanol; glycerol is the main co-product. Although glycerol has many industrial applications, increased production of biodiesel could make complete market placement of this chemical difficult. In this context, increasing interest is paid towards different methods of biodiesel production that provide alternative co-products. This article offers a "cradle to gate" evaluation of potential environmental impacts caused by an innovative process for the production of DMC-BioD, an alternative biofuel to biodiesel which does not involve the production of glycerol. Transesterification of soybean oil with dimethyl carbonate to obtain DMC-BioD has been modelled with the aid of the Chemical Process Simulation software Aspen HYSYS® that produced the material and energy balances and the preliminary sizing of the process units. Results have been also compared with background information from database on the production of conventional biodiesel from soybean oil and of fossil diesel. The study suggests that DMC-BioD can be an interesting route for the production of biofuels from an environmental point of view. Compared to fossil diesel, GHG (Greenhouse gases) emissions can be decreased, although trade-offs are registered in other environmental categories. In any case, future investigation is needed in order to understand and optimize its environmental profile through the entire life cycle and possibly bring its production to a commercial scale. This preliminary analysis of potential environmental impacts provides useful information to continue the testing and scale-up phases and to improve the environmental performances of the process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of new pathways for next-generation biofuel production has spurred recent investigations into the mechanisms of enzymes that biosynthesize hydrocarbons. One widely distributed group of enzymes, aldehyde decarbonylases, catalyze unusual deformylation reactions in which long-chain fatty aldehydes are converted to alkanes. These enzymes are all iron-dependent and in insects are represented by a cytochrome P450 enzyme that releases the aldehyde carbon as CO2. Here we describe a novel nonenzymatic reaction of an α-cyclopropyl-substituted aldehyde that mimics the enzyme reaction. This aldehyde is oxidatively deformylated in the presence of aqueous iron(II) salts and oxygen to yield an alkyl-substituted cyclopropane and CO2, in a reaction that competes with the more conventional oxidation of the aldehyde to the carboxylic acid. Like the enzymatic reaction, the reaction occurs with retention of the aldehyde proton in the alkane product and probably proceeds through an iron-peroxo species. Computational reaction discovery tools were used to search for potential reaction pathways and investigate their energetic feasibility. These identified a plausible reaction pathway leading to the experimentally observed products and reproduced the transfer of the aldehyde proton to the cyclopropane product. These studies provide further insight into how enzymes may control reactive iron-oxo species to catalyze the diverse range of iron-dependent oxidative transformations observed in biology. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study consists of the production of biodiesel from methanolysis of Sunn-hemp (Crotalaria juncea) oil, using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Calcium carbonate enriched sea shells like capiz and conch shell are used as natural catalysts after calcination for trans-esterification. These heterogeneous catalysts are physically characterized in order to locate the active sites using X-ray powder diffraction. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry is used to identify and estimate the fatty acid methyl esters of the biodiesel. Basic fuel properties like specific gravity, moisture content, kinematic viscosity, saponification value, iodine value, flash point, fire point, aniline point, cetane number and heat content are determined to establish this biodiesel as a diesel substitute for a fuel. The fuel properties indicate that after some modifications, Sunn-hemp seed oil based biodiesel could be a promising new source for the production of biofuel. Response Surface Methodology is used to optimize the operating parameters of the process. A Factorial and Box–Behnken Design is used to study the effects of time of reaction, type of catalyst, catalyst concentration and oil to methanol mole ratio on the yield of biodiesel. Statistical analysis shows that the model is significant with a R2 value of 0.997 having achieved the optimum conditions after 4.15 h, with an oil to methanol molar ratio of 11. 2 wt% catalyst concentration and potassium hydroxide as the best catalyst for the production of 90.25 % biodiesel. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The alkaline process for making biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, or FAME) is highly efficient at the transesterification of glycerides. However, its performance is poor when it comes to using oil that contain significant amounts of free fatty acids (FFA). The traditional approach to such feedstocks is to employ acid catalysis, which is slow and requires a large excess of methanol, or to evaporate FFA and convert that in a separate process. An attractive option would be to convert the FFA in oil feedstocks to FAME, before introducing it into the alkaline process. The high selectivity of enzyme catalysis makes it a suitable basis for such a pretreatment process. In this work, we present a characterization of the pretreatment of high-FFA rapeseed oil using immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (Novozym 435), focused on the impact of initial FFA and methanol concentration. Based on experimental results, we have identified limitations for the process in terms of FFA concentration in the feedstock and make suggestions for process operation. It was found that, using 5% catalyst and 4% methanol at 35°C, the FFA concentration could be reduced to 0.5% within an hour for feedstock containing up to 15% FFA. Further, the reaction was observed to be under kinetic control, in that the biocatalyst converts FFA (and FAME) at a much higher rate than glyceride substrates. There is thus, both a minimum and a maximum reaction time for the process to achieve the desired concentration of FFA. Finally, an assessment of process stability in a continuous packed bed system indicates that as much as 15m3 oil could potentially be pretreated by 1kg of biocatalyst at the given process conditions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Pretreatment has been regarded as the most efficient strategy for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars. In this work, sulfolane pretreatment was performed to break the intricate structure of shrub willow for inhabitation of the enzymatic accessibility to holocellulose. The effects of varying pretreatment parameters on enzymatic hydrolysis of shrub willow were investigated. It was found that sulfolane was more compatible with lignin instead of carbohydrate, and the loss of carbohydrate could be attributed to water and acid generated from sulfolane. The optimum conditions leading to maximal sugar recovery from enzymatic saccharification were confirmed. After pretreatment of shrub willow powder in sulfolane at 170 °C for 1.5 h with mass ratio of sulfolane to substrate of 5, the sugar release could reach 555 mg/g raw materials (352 mg glucose, 203 mg xylose) when combining 20 FPU cellulase, 20 CBU β-glucosidase, and 1.5 FXU xylanase, representing 78.2 % of glucose and 56.6 % of xylose in shrub willow. This enhanced enzymatic saccharification was due to delignification and removal of a proportion of hemicelluloses, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, gas chromatography, and ionic chromatography. Thus, these studies prove sulfolane pretreatment to be an effective and promising approach for biomass to biofuel processing. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Under the present research study, the co-pyrolysis of paper waste and mustard press cake was conducted in a 50 mm diameter and 640 mm long semi-batch pyrolyzer in the temperature range of 673 to 1173 K in nitrogen atmosphere and synergistic relationship between the pyrolysis of two feed stocks has been observed. The paper wastes were composed of local packing paper, newspaper-based food packets of grocery, and printing paper in the ratio of 6:3:1. During co-pyrolysis, response surface methodology (RSM) technique has been employed using Design Expert Version 7.0.0 to determine the collective effects of factors, namely, A: ratio of paper waste to mustard press cake and B: pyrolysis temperature, on the yield of bio-oil, energy yield, and oxygen content of bio-oil. Optimization has been done by using RSM to identify the individual sets of values of independent parameters corresponding to maximum bio-oil yield (A: 9.0:1, B: 874.75 K), energy yield (A: 8.80:1, B: 812 K), and minimum oxygen content of bio-oil (A: 2.75:1, B: 883.06 K). Bio-oil obtained at maximum energy yield condition has been characterized using the Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopic analyses. The array of compounds present in the bio-oil compounds has been compared with literature data available on pyro-oil obtained from similar feed stocks. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Upgrading of bio-oil extracted from palm kernel shell (PKS) was performed using a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor with HZSM-5 as a catalyst. The catalytic cracking was carried out at optimized conditions: 0.3-MPa pressure, temperature of 500°C, and oil to catalyst ratio of 1:5. One of the challenges in upgrading bio-oil by catalytic cracking is deactivation of catalyst due to coke formation on catalyst surface. To overcome coke deposition, the upgrading process was carried out at 0.3-MPa pressure. Characterization of raw and upgraded bio-oil obtained through catalytic cracking was discussed in detail, indicating improvement in its physical properties. The distribution of products after cracking of bio-oil includes 58.89 wt% of organic liquid product, 15.63 wt% of aqueous fraction, 7.84 wt% of coke, and 17.64 wt% of gases. The degree of deoxygenation and calorific value of organic liquid product is 43.74% and 31.65 MJ/kg respectively. Organic liquid product obtained comprises 17.55% of hydrocarbons within the gasoline range. Hence, HZSM-5 proved its effectiveness for upgrading the bio-oil in a continuous mode. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Populous deltoides wood is a suitable raw material for ethanol production, since it has high cellulose content. Efficient degradation and subsequent conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bio-ethanol, requires physico-chemical pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to obtain high overall yields of sugars. Microbial hydrolytic enzymes are actively utilized for biomass degradation and bio-ethanol production. Four glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) namely; three subunits of cellulase, endoglucanase (ThWF5-endoglucanase), exoglucanase (ThWF5-exoglucanase) and β-glucosidase (ThWF5-glucosidase), and xylanase (ThWF5-xylanase), from fungal strain Trichoderma harzianum WF5 - isolated from decayed wood, were pulled out and subsequently characterized. Analysis of full length sequences and prediction of secondary and tertiary structure showed that these enzymes shared homology with the respective enzymes of other Trichoderma species and have comparatively evolved structure to express catalytic activity under broad range of environmental conditions. Respective GHs were partially purified and used for the enzymatic hydrolysis of P. deltoids wood after pretreatments. The pretreatment of P. deltoides wood with sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2SO4 + H2O2) at 121 °C for 60 min was determined as the best condition to high recovery of reducing sugars after enzymatic hydrolysis. The overall high ethanol yield of 15.6 g/l and fermentation efficiency of 61.1% was obtained when fermentation was performed on pretreated poplar wood slurry followed by detoxification with calcium hydroxide. High bio-ethanol production from P. deltoides wood and molecular characterization of glycosyl hydrolases used, provide insights that this wood offers a potential source for biofuel production while T. harzianum WF5 is a treasure house of robust degrading enzymes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This investigation aimed to analyze the renewable phenolic compounds that separate from liquefied mason pine. One-step thermal conversion of biomass to phenolic products from waste mason pine using an acidic catalyst and methanol was accomplished under mild conditions. Three fractions (fractions 1#, 2#, and 3#) of phenolic compounds with high added-value were extracted with water-organic solvent from liquefied oil via a stepwise fractionation process. The structural features of three phenolic compounds and depolymerized lignin were analyzed and identified by a combination of heteronuclear single quantum correlation-nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis, showing interesting functionalities for biochemical and biofuel applications. In this investigation, guaiacyl (G) and p-hydroxybenzoate (PB) aromatics were the basic units of three phenolic compound fractions. Etherified syringyl aromatics were evident in fractions 1# and 3#. There were only single-aromatic-ring units (such as G and PB units) in phenolic compound fraction 2#. In the aromatic region, the absence of β-O-4′ ether linkage, resinol, and phenylcoumaran units in three phenolic compound fractions indicated that depolymerization of lignin occurred during the liquefied biomass process. The molecular weights of three phenolic compound fractions were significantly different (797, 249, and 497, respectively) along with fractions 1#, 2#, and 3#. The phenolic compounds could be separated into a high, lower, and lowest molecular weight fraction in this study. As evidenced by GC-MS spectra, the three phenolic compound fraction products and depolymerized lignin were mainly comprised of phenolic derivatives, such as 3-methyl-4-ethylphenol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol, and 3-methylcatechol. Percentages of the total phenols and derivatives in the three phenolic compound fractions and depolymerized lignin were 77.59%, 81.76%, 80.19%, and 78.86%, respectively. Therefore, the three phenolic compound fractions were clearly quantified and valuable, and can be used as chemical products. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The gene encoding RUM630-BX, a β-xylosidase/arabinofuranosidase, was identified from activity-based screening of a cow rumen metagenomic library. The recombinant enzyme is activated as much as 14-fold (kcat) by divalent metals Mg2+, Mn2+ and Co2+ but not by Ca2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. Activation of RUM630-BX by Mg2+ (t0.5 144 s) is slowed two-fold by prior incubation with substrate, consistent with the X-ray structure of closely related xylosidase RS223-BX that shows the divalent-metal activator is at the back of the active-site pocket so that bound substrate could block its entrance. The enzyme is considerably more active on natural substrates than artificial substrates, with activity (kcat/Km) of 299 s-1 mM-1 on xylotetraose being the highest reported. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Esterification of organic acids and alcohols in aqueous media is very inefficient due to thermodynamic constraints. However, fermentation processes used to produce organic acids and alcohols are often conducted in aqueous media. To produce esters in aqueous media, biphasic alginate beads with immobilized lipase are developed for in situ esterification of butanol and butyric acid. The biphasic beads contain a solid matrix of calcium alginate and hexadecane together with 5 mg/mL of lipase as the biocatalyst. Hexadecane in the biphasic beads serves as an organic phase to facilitate the esterification reaction. Under optimized conditions, the beads are able to catalyze the production of 0.16 mmol of butyl butyrate from 0.5 mmol of butyric acid and 1.5 mmol of butanol. In contrast, when monophasic beads (without hexadecane) are used, only trace amount of butyl butyrate is produced. One main application of biphasic beads is in simultaneous fermentation and esterification (SFE) because the organic phase inside the beads is very stable and does not leach out into the culture medium. SFE is successfully conducted with an esterification yield of 6.32% using biphasic beads containing iso-octane even though the solvent is proven toxic to the butanol-producing Clostridium spp. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although catalytic hydroconversion of pyrolysis bio-oils has been studied for many years, side reactions such as condensation or oligomerization leading to high molecular weight compounds still need comprehensive studies. In this work, the catalytic hydroconversion of D-glucose, furfural, acetic acid and guaiacol representative of pyrolysis bio-oils was investigated separately before testing a 5-component mixture. Thanks to a detailed analytical strategy (i.e. SEC, 13C NMR, GC, HPLC), this paper focuses on the effect of guaiacol conversion on sugar-like macromolecules. The study of single D-glucose and furfural revealed the fast production of high molecular weight compounds (up to 700 g mol−1) that were proven to further precipitate (from D-glucose). Guaiacol addition led to a decrease of the solid production through solubilizing and/or reacting with macromolecules. This phenomenon produced larger soluble macromolecules (up to 5000 g mol−1). Results show that guaiacol and its hydroconversion products formed soluble macromolecules at short reaction times and low temperatures. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbon footprint is broadly defined as carbon dioxide (CO2.) emissions normalized per unit mass of a product or per unit of an activity. It is considered as an important environmental indicator for comparing various products or activities. Fired solid clay brick is a popular walling material in India. Manufacturing of fired clay bricks involves combustion of fossil fuels during the firing process and during other unit operations and activities. Due to combustion of fossil fuels, dissociation of mineral calcite in the soil during the firing of green bricks and combustion of diesel during transportation of raw materials, the greenhouse gas emissions are associated with the manufacturing of fired clay bricks. About 250 billion bricks are manufactured annually in India. To fire the green bricks, mainly two types of brick kilns are used in India: Bull's trench kiln and Clamp kilns. The Bull's trench kilns are mainly used in northern and central India whereas the clamps are used in peninsular India. In the present study, carbon footprint of bricks manufactured in the clamps of a major clamp cluster in peninsular India is estimated and is compared with that of bricks manufactured in other types of kilns in India. Karad, District Satara, Maharashtra (India) located in peninsular India has a major cluster of clamp type brick kilns which has more than 300 clamp kiln sites with annual production of approximately 120 million bricks. A field survey of the clamps of Karad is conducted to collect the data about use of soil, fuels and water and its transportation. The CO2 emissions due to various unit operations and activities in a typical clamp are estimated using guidelines provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These total emissions are normalized per unit mass of fired brick and are presented as carbon footprint of a brick. The statistical mean of the carbon footprints of bricks manufactured in all the surveyed clamps is presented as the carbon footprint of bricks manufactured in the clamps of Karad. The average carbon footprint of the bricks manufactured in the clamps of Karad is estimated as 195 g CO2/kg of fired brick and 162 g CO2/kg of fired brick respectively, when the CO2 emissions due to the combustion of biofuels and transportation of raw materials are included or excluded. This is comparable to the carbon footprint of the other popular brick-making technologies, and defies the common notion that clamps are highly inefficient. The carbon footprint of bricks manufactured in the clamps of Karad is lower than that reported for the clay bricks manufactured in tunnel kilns in the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To utilize the whole Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 biomass for bioethanol and biodiesel production, the recyclable metal oxide mediated fractionation was performed. Metal oxides in individual, binary and ternary forms were used for fractionation of biomass and the efficiency was determined by recovery of glycogen and lipid contents. The catalytic system with mixed metal oxides showed high recovery of glycogen and lipid, whereby the binary metal oxide CaO-MgO exhibited highest glycogen (87%) and lipid (85%) extractions with potential reusability. Moreover, the compatibility of the obtained glycogen and lipid in fermentation and transesterification were analysed which showed about 88% and 86% of theoretical maximum, which confirms the potential of mixed metal oxides in bioethanol and biodiesel production, respectively. The novelty of the present work is that the simultaneous glycogen and lipid extraction with high yield can be achieved utilizing recyclable metal oxides, particularly with the binary CaO-MgO. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The promising development of catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) across a wide range of lignocellulosic biomass for bio-oil production is economically viable. Unreformed bio-oils are not directly compatible with the petrochemical infrastructure due to various physio-chemical properties of the oil. High oxygenation of bio-oil is one of its major problems and in situ catalytic upgrading is providing a potential way to overcome this obstacle. Empty fruit bunch (EFB) is a lignocellulosic by-product of the oil palm industry, which have been researched in the context of various fast pyrolysis studies without the usage of catalysts. Malaysia, being the second largest oil palm producer in the world, has a huge incentive to maximise the efficacy of this industry and the utilization of its EFB and other related wastes. This aim of this paper is to review the recent advances in CFP of EFB and compare it to other similar lignocellulosic materials particularly for the production of deoxygenated bio-oil. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Supported molybdenum/molybdenum-phosphides as inexpensive catalysts for bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) were in-house prepared using different support materials, i.e., Al2O3, activated carbon (AC), MgAl2O4, and Mg6Al2(CO3)(OH)16. The HDO activity of these catalysts were investigated using a 100 mL bench-scale reactor operating at 300°C with an initial hydrogen pressure of 50 bar for 3 h with a pyrolysis oil (PO). The catalytic efficiencies for bio-oil HDO for the catalysts were compared with the expensive but commercially available Ru/C catalyst. Addition of small amount of P to the Mo catalysts supported on either AC and Al2O3 led to increased degree of deoxygenation (DOD) and oil yield compared with those without P. MoP supported on AC (MoP/AC) demonstrated bio-oil HDO activity comparable to the Ru/C catalyst. Furthermore, three AC-supported metal phosphides for PO HDO were compared under the same conditions, and they were found to follow the order of NiP/AC &gt; CoP/AC &gt; MoP/AC. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 62: 3664–3672, 2016. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The present study focuses on the performance analysis of a biomass-to-liquid (BTL) process for the co-production of green diesel and electricity. The BTL process consists of biomass gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, and rice straw is investigated as the biomass feedstock. The modeling of the BTL process is performed using Aspen Custom Modeler (ACM). BTL processes with different configurations, i.e., with and without a tar removal unit based on steam reforming and autothermal (ATO) reforming, are compared. The amounts of green diesel and electricity produced and the overall potential environmental impact (PEI) derived from the Waste Reduction (WAR) algorithm are used as technical and environmental performance indicators and subjected to the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the BTL process with ATO reforming is the most practical configuration, and the process offering maximum internal heat recovery and minimum external utility requirements is proposed. Based on the parametric analysis of key operating parameters (i.e., gasifying temperature, FT operating temperature and pressure), the optimal operating conditions of the BTL process providing the highest AHP index are identified. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is being increasingly applied in commercial plants worldwide. They run exclusively on woody biomass, which has favorable properties for conversion with fast pyrolysis. In order to increase the synergies of food production and the energetic and/or material use of biomass, it is desirable to utilize residues from agricultural production, e.g., straw. The presented method is suitable for converting such a material on an industrial scale. The main features are presented and an example of mass balances from the conversion of several biomass residues is given. After conversion, fractionated condensation is applied in order to retrieve two condensates — an organic-rich and an aqueousrich one. This design prevents the production of fast pyrolysis bio-oil that exhibits phase separation. A two phase bio-oil is to be expected because of the typically high ash content of straw biomass, which promotes the production of water of reaction during conversion. Both fractionated condensation and the use of biomass with high ash content demand a careful approach for establishing balances. Not all kind of balances are both meaningful and comparable to other results from the literature. Different balancing methods are presented, and the information that can be derived from them is discussed. © 2016 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

AB  - Efficient conversion of lignin to fine chemicals and biofuel become more and more attractive in biorefinery. In this work, we used a series of silica-alumina catalysts (i.e., SiO2-Al2O3, HY, Hβ, and HZSM-5) to degrade lignin into arenes and phenols. The relationship between the catalyst structure and lignin depolymerization performance was investigated. The results showed that both acidity and pore size of the catalyst could influence the conversion of lignin. In the volatilizable product, phenols were identified as the main phenolic monomers via gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. SiO2-Al2O3 was the most efficient catalyst, giving 90.96% degree of conversion, 12.91% yield of phenols, and 2.41% yield of arenes in ethanol at 280 °C for 4 h. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that deoxygenation and alkylation occurred in this process. The effect of solvents was also investigated and the results showed that ethanol was the most efficient solvent. © 2016 Chinese Physical Society.

AB  - Ag/bauxite nanocomposites have been prepared using in situ reduction of aqueous AgNO3 solution in a bauxite matrix and investigated for the transesterification of sunflower oil with methanol in order to study their potential as heterogeneous catalysts. The prepared nanocopmosites were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, FT-IR, and TG- DTA. The Central Composite Design of the Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize the effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst loading and methanol to oil molar ratio on the yield of fatty acid methyl esters. The highest yield was obtained at 67 °C reaction temperature, 3 h reaction time, 0.3 wt.% catalyst loading and 9:1 methanol to oil molar ratio. Under the optimal conditions, the methyl ester content was 94% and the catalyst successfully reused for at least 7 cycles without significant deactivation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass feedstocks such as algae and cyanobacteria are highly sought after because of their high reproduction rates and growth densities, but their high concentrations of O and N heteroatoms are problematic for biofuel applications. Mild upgrading processes are necessary for producing fungible fuels from these renewable sources. We developed a process to upgrade spirulina-based bio-oil from tail-gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP), using a combination of catalytic hydrotreatment and purification of the upgraded product. The TGRP bio-oil was distillated at high organic yields, and the distillates served as the feedstock for catalytic upgrading. Simultaneous hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodenitrogenation (HDO/HDN) was carried out in one step using a commercial ruthenium catalyst on carbon support. Using bio-oil distillates as feedstocks for hydrotreatment produced hydrocarbons at high space velocities. Reactor temperature was the critical variable, wherein the optimal temperature compromised between excessive yields loss and catalyst inactivity. While the HDO/HDN product contained relatively significant amounts of residual O and N (∼1 wt % each), the remaining O and N-containing compounds were removed via single aqueous-phase extraction with hydrochloric acid. The extraction step serves as a milder alternative to deep HDO/HDN processes that diminish final product yields. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biocrude can be produced by direct liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass, which can be further upgraded into biofuels in an oil refinery. Refinery streams, namely vacuum gas oil (VGO) and light cycle oil (LCO), were found suitable liquefaction solvents in our previous study. This paper reports a process concept based on the liquefaction of wood in LCO followed by recovery and recycling of the LCO. The LCO is recovered from the reactor effluent by spontaneous liquid-liquid phase split upon cooling. The feasibility of this process concept was demonstrated experimentally by conducting a series of refill experiments with LCO recovery and recycling. This series shows a steady-state liquefaction of pine wood with constant product yields (liquid yield 57 C%) and constant oil qualities over eight recycles. Most of the ash present in the wood was concentrated in the char. A techno-economic assessment estimated that the biocrude could be produced at 13.9 $/GJ, which corresponds to an energy-equivalent crude oil price of 61 $/bbl (at a wood cost of 85 $/t dry). © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The low-boiling fraction (LBF) of bio-oil produced from the hydrothermal liquefaction of peanut straw and used engine oil (UEO) blends were co-hydrotreated. The effects of the catalyst type on the yields of the product fractions resulting from the co-hydrotreating of the LBF with UEO and on the properties of the upgraded oil were first examined. The results revealed that noble metals with one electron in the outermost shell demonstrated high performance in the removal of heteroatoms. Of all of the noble metals tested, Pt/C and Rh/C exhibited the highest performance in the overall removal of heteroatoms from the feedstock mixture. With Rh/C as the catalyst, the effects of the catalyst loading (0-0.3 kgcatalyst/kgfeed), UEO/LBF mass ratio (3:0-0:3), and temperature (350-430°C) were further examined. A positive synergistic effect occurred during the co-hydrotreating process at a UEO/LBF mass ratio of 2.5:0.5. The UEO/LBF mass ratio significantly affected the product yields and the properties of the upgraded oil. The presence of UEO suppressed char formation. The energy density of the vast majority of the upgraded oils was higher than that of petroleum diesel. This study suggested that UEO is a good solvent for the hydrotreating of bio-oil derived from the hydrothermal liquefaction of peanut straw. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In aqueous phase processing of bio-oil, hydrogen (H2) is produced in three steps: extraction with water, mild hydrogenation of the aqueous fraction and reforming in the aqueous phase. Polyols are the familiar hydrogenation products of the unsaturated oxygenates present in the bio-oil aqueous fraction. In this work, we decided on studying the aqueous phase reforming of two such polyols, viz. 1,2-propanediol and 1,4-butanediol. Activity trials were performed in a fixed-bed reactor using Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Reactions conditions selected for these studies were like so: temperature, 433-493 K, pressure, 0.9-2.67 MPa, polyol concentration, 5-15 wt%, and weight hourly space velocity, 0.08-0.68 1/h. A chemical control regime prevailed at these conditions. The dependency of polyol conversion and H2 yield on the aforesaid reaction variables was studied. The turnover frequency (TOFH2) was measured and it was found that the activation energy for H2 production from 1,2-propanediol and 1,4-butanediol was 82.7 and 70.1 kJ/mol. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - This paper describes the preparation and characterization of biocathodes for a methanol/O2 biofuel cell using the crude extract and a purified laccase from a strain of Pycnoporus sanguineus (PyS). The biocathode assembly with mediated electron transfer was achieved by immobilizing either the enzymes in the crude extract or the purified laccase with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers on top of a polypyrrole matrix containing entrapped 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) species as the redox mediator. Carbon nanotubes modified with anthracene moietieswere used to orientate the purified laccase and allow for direct bioelectrocatalytic O2 reduction. The kinetic characterization of the biocathodes showed that samples prepared with either the crude extract or the purified laccase retained ABTS oxidation activity after the immobilization procedure. The biofuel cell tests showed that the biocathodes were able to furnish maximum power densities of 51.2 and 99.8 μW cm-2 for the samples preparedwith the crude extract and the purified enzyme, respectively. Moreover, it was observed that both biocathodes tested displayed a very similar loss in power performance as a function of storage time, reaching 60% of the initial activity after 60 days. Overall, the laccase-based biocathodes prepared either with the crude extract or with the purified enzyme are able to provide electrochemically active and stable biomaterials. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Three mesoporous zeolites (Ni/Meso-Y, Ni/Meso-Hbeta, and Ni/Meso-HZSM-5) were used to catalytically convert palm oil into jet biofuel through various reaction pathways. Zeolite Ni/Meso-Y exhibited the highest jet range alkane yield (30.7%) and the lowest jet range aromatic hydrocarbon yield (13%). The acid density and surface area of zeolite Ni/Meso-Y were higher than those of zeolites Meso-Hbeta and Meso-HZSM-5. Of the palm oil, 53% was converted into jet range alkane and 17% was converted into jet range aromatic hydrocarbons over Ni/Meso-Y. On one hand, palm oil was converted into C15-C18 alkanes through decarbonylation, which further cracked into C8-C14 alkanes or dehydrogenated into aromatic hydrocarbons through aromatization. On the other hand, palm oil directly cracked into C8-C14 alkanes over Ni/Meso-Y. Zeolite Ni/Meso-Y exhibited higher selectivity of jet range alkane (55.32%) and lower selectivity of jet range aromatic hydrocarbons (9.47%) than those of regenerated Ni/Meso-Y (36.18% and 22.66%, respectively). © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The scope of this paper is to analyze the possibility and feasibility of the use of, the emulsification method applied to waste cooking oils and fatty acid distillates as diesel engine fuels, compared with other commonly used methods. These waste products are obtained from vegetable oil refining industry, food industry, service sector and frying process, mainly. However, they are a little bit applied as feedstocks to produce biofuels and constitute a potential source of environmental contamination. From the review of the state of arts, significant decreases in exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides, cylinder pressure as well as increases of the ignition delay, brake specific fuel consumption, hydrocarbon, smoke opacity, carbon monoxide, particulate matters to emulsified waste cooking oils and fatty acid distillates compared with diesel fuel are reported. In some experiments the emulsified waste cooking oils achieved better performance than neat fatty acid distillates, neat waste cooking oils and their derivatives methyl esters. © 2016, Aalborg University Press.

AB  - A predictive correlation of effective hydrogen to carbon ratio ((H/C)eff) of bio-oils was satisfactorily developed to describe the general trends of bio-oil quality in fluidized beds of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis for production of bio-oils compatible with petroleum refinery. The correlation was based on an empirical relationship with operating parameters including fluidization hydrodynamics in fluidized bed pyrolyzers, which was derived from the data of this study and literature. The increment of (H/C)eff from feedstock to bio-oil during pyrolysis was a strong function of fluidization variables related with hydrodynamics and bed mixing such as fluidization number, bubble fraction and entrainment flux of bed materials. The predicted (H/C)eff of bio-oil based on the correlation well accorded to the experimental data. The prediction results indicate that the correlation can predict an optimum operating condition for balancing quality against bio-oil yield. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A number of bioelectronic applications work with oxidase enzymes and many of them can operate with small molecule or polymer redox mediators. However, for some oxidases, there are no known redox mediators able to mediate electron transfer. Therefore, electron transfer must occur through peroxide production and oxidation at the electrode surface. Organic redox catalysts such as oxoammonium cations, are able to oxidize H2O2 to form nitroxyl radicals, which can be electro-oxidized and regenerate the oxoammonium cation form. In this study, we investigate the ability to use TEMPO as a platform for the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2O2 at different pHs. The results have shown that TEMPO can be used to monitor H2O2 in broad pH range (≥4) at 530 mV (vs SCE). Combining TEMPO with cholesterol oxidase, we have shown the possibility to monitor the cholesterol oxidation with a linear range between 20 μM and 2.5 mM with a sensitivity of 54.86 mA cm-2 M-1. Furthermore, we have studied the electrocatalytic oxidation of oxalate by oxalate oxidase for biofuel cell applications. These combined results demonstrate TEMPO as a promising electrocatalyst applied for the development of electrochemical biosensors or enzymatic biofuel cells. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a promising thermochemical process to convert lignocellulosic biomass to renewable biofuel. Much research has been conducted on the catalytic upgrading of either vapors derived from whole biomass scale or on individual model oxygenates. However, not many studies investigated the upgrading and deoxygenation of a mixture of several oxygenates. In this study, we use a combination of techniques to probe the reactions of guaiacol and hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA) on HZSM-5, their diffusion inside the zeolite catalyst pores, and the extractable products. The techniques we used included several NMR methods, gas chromatography, and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA-FTIR). In nitrogen at 280 °C with HZSM-5 catalyst, HAA decomposes, cyclizes to form aromatics and phenolic compounds, as well as produces coke. Under the same conditions, guaiacol neither reacts nor forms coke. When the two molecules are present together at 280 °C, their reaction pathways are independent of each other. For HAA at 480 °C, the quantity of aromatics produced is much higher than at 280 °C. At 480 °C guaiacol forms mostly substituted phenolics, BTEX type molecules, and coke. When guaiacol and HAA are mixed together at 480 °C, the amount of coke formed is slightly higher while the aromatics produced in the form of toluene, naphthalene, and their substituted compounds are substantially higher than that can be predicted by simple summation of products in individual cases. After reactions with guaiacol alone or a mixture containing both guaiacol and HAA, the available micropore surface area decreased to zero, indicating plugging of the pores or blocking of pore entrance. However, in both cases the guaiacol and phenolics can be desorbed in an N2 atmosphere at a relatively low temperature range of 100-200 °C. Diffusion measurements indicate that size has a large effect on the pore diffusion coefficients of different oxygen molecules. After coke forms on the catalyst the diffusion coefficients of larger molecules such as guaiacol are affected more significantly than diffusion of small molecules such as water and methanol. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - 5-(Chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) is rapidly being established as a renewable platform chemical of great promise. The effects of mass transfer, reaction temperature, Hansen solvent parameters, solvent fraction, and initial glucose concentrations on yields of CMF, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), 2-(hydroxyacetyl)furan (HAF), levulinic acid (LA), and humic matter were investigated in a two-phase system of 6M HCl and an organic solvent. The ability of the solvent to extract HMF from the aqueous phase is found to be critical to achieving high CMF yields. Effective solvents must possess at least a small degree of Hansen hydrogen bonding capacity, and a high polarity is beneficial. Yields of CMF and HAF decrease with increasing glucose concentration but the yield of HMF is largely unaffected. The maximum productivity of CMF is achieved at a glucose loading of ca. 1.5M across all solvent fractions tested. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The direct (trans)esterification of whole Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) kernels in subcritical solvent mixture of water, methanol and acetic acid was explored. A high fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 96.56% could be achieved at a solvent (water: acetic acid: methanol=1:5:15, v/v/v) to solid ratio of 7cm3g-1. The reaction mixture was pressurize with carbon dioxide and reacted for 1h at 523K and 12.5MPa. Qualitative tests on the recovered polar fractions of the product were found to have radical scavenging activities. The characteristics of the spent kernel residues were also studied. The method employed in this study provides an alternative approach to better utilize JCL kernels and cut down the number of production steps. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of trimethylamine (TMA) on the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process and the recycle of TMA. The results suggest that the peeling reaction occurred on the surface and the cleavage of cellulose leading to water-soluble substances and bio-oil. The highest content of organic acids was found in the water-soluble phase. Model compounds, different glucides with TMA were used to investigate the mechanism of the HTL. Results suggest that the OH− appeared to selectively interact with C–O–C bonds, and thus causing the key linkages of cellulose to become much easier to be cleaved under mild conditions. In addition, the conditions for TMA recovery were optimized and the highest TMA recovery rate reached 98.89%. The recovered TMA had the same properties as the original compound, and it was perfectly re-usable in the conversion process of HTL. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) is a useful metabolic engineering strategy, which allows the selection of the microorganisms with beneficial phenotype through accumulative beneficial mutations among genetic variations occurrencely. Following ALE strategy, a rational constructed Escherichia coli strain DQ101 for fatty acids synthesis was adaptively evolved for 90 days with increasing [C4mim]Cl concentration from 1% to 7% (w/v). The evolved strain DQ102 reached a final OD600 of 4.93 at the end of the 24 h culture with 7% (w/v) ionic liquid. DQ102/pDQTES with a thioesterase ‘TesA overexpression could produce 1.12 g/L fatty acid with a productivity of 0.023 g/L-h from ionic liquid-treated bamboo hydrolysate. With another β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases (fabZ) overexpression, DQ102/pDQTESZ could reach a higher concentration of 2.29 g/L with a productivity of 0.048 g/L-h. These results indicated that ALE could be implemented as a useful tool for metabolic engineering and production of bio-fuels, as well as commodity and specialty chemicals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three kinds of sulfonated cross-linked chitosan (SCCR) immobilized with metal ions of Cu2+, Fe3+ and Zn2+ individually were synthesized and firstly used as solid acid catalysts in the hydrolysis of bamboo biomass. FTIR spectra showed that metal ions had been introduced into SCCR and the N-metal ions coordinate bound was formed. The particle sizes of these catalysts were about 500–1000 μm with a pore size of 50–160 μm. All of the three kinds of catalysts performed well for bamboo hydrolysis with 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride used as solvent. The most effective one was sulfonated cross-linked chitosan immobilized with Fe3+ (Fe3+-SCCR). TRS yields were up to 73.42% for hydrolysis of bamboo powder in [C4mim]Cl with Fe3+-SCCR at 120 °C and 20 RPM after 24 h. These novel chitosan-based metal ions immobilized solid acid catalysts with ionic liquids as the solvent might be promising to facilitate cost-efficient conversion of biomass into biofuels and bioproducts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As an option for utilizing glycerol in stationary applications (e.g. combustion in boilers or furnaces), fuel mixtures prepared by the current approach of mixing crude glycerol, the whole bio-oil, and/or biochar have limitations of low glycerol blending ratio, high demand of methanol, and still in acidic nature. This study aims to overcome these limitations via preparing fuels from crude glycerol, the bio-oil-water-soluble fraction (WSF), and/or biochar. Three types of formulated crude glycerols (FCGs) were used in the experimental program: FCG1 and FCG3 representing crude glycerol without purification and FCG2 representing crude glycerol with an acidification process. The FCGs were mixed with the bio-oil-WSF obtained at the water/bio-oil ratio of 0.5 for preparing fuel mixtures, achieving remarkably high glycerol blending levels (50-70% for FCG1 and FCG3, while completely miscible for FCG2) without methanol addition. Moreover, the FCG/WSF blends have considerably lower acidities and water contents and higher densities and heating values than the WSF. Further addition of biochar into the FCG/WSF blends results in FCG/WSF/biochar slurry fuels that have similar energy density of bio-oil. The FCG/WSF/biochar slurry fuels exhibit favorably better viscosity, Ohnesorge number, and acidity than the bio-oil/biochar or glycerol/methanol/bio-oil/biochar slurries. Therefore, preparing FCG/WSF/biochar slurries is proven to be a good strategy to address the existing key issues associated with fuel mixture preparation from crude glycerol and the whole bio-oil, offering an attractive option of co-utilization of bio-oil fractions. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of this study is to convert spent mushroom substrate (SMS), a by-product from industrial mushroom production, to high production of biobutanol via integration with in situ butanol removal strategy. The modified organosolv pretreatment under mild conditions (35 °C, without acid catalyst) could efficiently improve the sugar yield (9.7% Vs 41.7%) of SMS by reducing lignin content (20.2% Vs 10.5%). The batch fermentation results using the organosolv treated SMS enzymatic broth indicate that adding extractant of biodiesel could enhance butanol production (14.65 g/L) compared to the control batch (12.03 g/L). Moreover, no significant toxicity of biodiesel is observed on the growth of solventogenic Clostridium acetobutylicum. In the fed-batch fermentation system with sugar feeding, the maximum amount of butanol is obtained at 30.21 g/L. This study suggests that in situ butanol removal using biodiesel from SMS enzymatic hydrolysate has great potential for commercial butanol production. © 2016 .

AB  - The global economic and population growth has significantly increased the demand for fuels. On the other hand, the strictness of environmental legislation and the depreciation of fossil fuel reserves have motivated the research for alternative energy sources. With this purpose, the preparation and characterization of catalysts based on Beta nanozeolites were described in this work, aiming to find active and selective catalysts to produce biofuels through the cracking of crude soybean oil. The samples were prepared by using different organosilanes such as phenylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane (PHAPTMS), phenyltrimethoxysilane (PHMTS) and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to functionalize the Beta zeolite seeds. The silanized seeds produced solids with smaller crystallites, more framework aluminum and different textural and acidic properties as compared to the Beta nanozeolite prepared without organosilane. APTES produced the solid with the smallest crystallites while PHAPTMS produced the sample with the highest external area, the differences being related to agglomeration of nanoparticles, generating voids related to the size of organosilane chains. The catalysts showed different selectivities during the cracking of crude soybean oil, depending on the organosilane used in the preparation. This finding was related to the different acidic properties and to the different particles size and porosity of the solids. The Beta nanozeolite obtained without any organosilane produced more gaseous compounds (C2–C4), due to the largest percentage of strong acidic sites, whereas those obtained with organosilanes were more selective to liquid hydrocarbons. The sample prepared with APTES was the most active and selective to hydrocarbons in the range of gasoline, diesel and kerosene, because of its smallest crystallite size and low acidity, as well as to the agglomeration of nanoparticles, which facilitates the hydrogen transfer reactions. Moreover, the sample prepared with PHMTS was the most selective to hydrocarbons in the gasoline range (C5–C11) while that obtained with PHAPTMS was the most selective to oxygenates. These changes were related to the combined effects of crystallite sizes, porosity and acidity on the catalytic properties of the solids, in the different pathways of the complex reaction network of cracking of soybean oil. It was shown that different organosilanes allowed tailoring the catalytic properties of Beta nanozeolites to produce biofuels or chemicals for several applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Renewable biofuels can lessen our reliance on fossil fuels. Cyanobacteria are being investigated for the production of biofuels directly from carbon dioxide, thus eliminating the steps of biomass production, harvest, logistics, and conversion required for 1st and 2nd generation biofuels. This study determined the initial tolerance of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 to four potential biofuels: farnesene, myrcene, linalool, and limonene. These cyanobacteria were then subjected to three rounds of directed evolution where the strains were exposed to increasing titers of each chemical. This led to a library of 12 putative mutants with higher tolerance to individual chemicals. These mutants were assessed for growth performance at chemical titers higher than the wildtype strains could tolerate. Power analysis was used to determine the necessary sample size to achieve statistical power of ≥. 0.95. Student's t-tests were performed to determine if the putative mutants had significantly improved growth parameters compared to the wildtype, thereby establishing whether an inheritable genetic change or possibly an epigenetic change had occurred. Three mutants were confirmed as having higher tolerance to individual chemicals. This work serves as proof-of-concept that directed evolution is a valid methodology to increase the tolerance of filamentous cyanobacteria to biofuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to determine the convective heat transfer coefficient (ht) for airflow through two randomly packed beds of microporous silica gel particles of nearly uniform diameter (i.e., for the average diameter of 1.60 and 2.58 mm). The experimental test facility was developed to induce a transient step change in the inlet uniform airflow while the temperature was measured at several locations within the silica gel beds (x/L = 0.29, 0.48, 0.69). The transient test data were simulated numerically using the volume averaging method for air flow through a homogeneous packed bed of particles for a range of Reynolds numbers (40 &lt; Redh &lt; 100). The convective heat transfer coefficient was determined by using the numerical inverse method to minimize the difference between the simulated and experimental temperature profiles. The sensitivity analysis stated that the thermocouple placed at the middle of the test section (x/L = 0.48) had the highest sensitivity during the first 400 s of transient testing. Using the ht values obtained by the inverse calculations, a good agreement is obtained within the experimental uncertainty limits for the experimental and numerical temperature temporal profiles at different locations within the beds; but the agreement is best using the transient temperature data at x/L = 0.48. Based on the ht values, a new correlation between Nusselt number and Reynolds number is presented with lower uncertainty (the maximum uncertainty of ±30%) compared to the correlations in the literatures. It was found that the proposed correlation is in agreement with the data in literature within their uncertainty bounds. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study elucidates the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated dibenzo-pdioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), that are emitted from a generator (non-road diesel engine) that is fueled with a blend of waste cooking oil biodiesels (WCO-biodiesels). Experimental results reveal that the mass concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDD/Fs and PBDEs from the diesel generator that is fueled with petroleum diesel (D100) under loads of 1.5 kW and 3.0 kW were 583-875 pg Nm–3, 580-810 pg Nm–3, 982-1408 pg Nm–3, and 134-216 ng Nm–3, respectively, while the toxicity concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PCBs, and PBDD/Fs were 33.2-58.6, 2.72-3.11, and 1.54-2.30 pg WHO2005-TEQ Nm–3, respectively. W20 and W40 emitted 15-65% and 23-85% less of these POPs by mass (and 25-47% and 46-91% by toxicity), respectively. Among the tested fuel blends, the W40 exhibited the greatest emission factor reductions of mass and toxicity of these four POPs, despite of the load. Therefore, WCO-biodiesels can feasibly be used as an alternative generator fuel, favoring the recycling/reuse of waste oils and mitigating hazards to human health and environment. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The synthesis of 1,1-diethoxybutane (DEB) through the acetalization reaction between ethanol and butyraldehyde was studied in a fixed-bed adsorptive reactor packed with Amberlyst-15 wet. The miscibilities of reactants and water were evaluated and breakthrough experiments with nonreactive pairs of ethanol-water and ethanol-DEB were performed. The parameters of the isotherms were fitted by a Langmuir competitive model. Synthesis of the acetal was carried out with mixtures of ethanol and butyraldehyde at different molar ratios. The dynamic behavior of the fixed-bed adsorptive reactor was described by a mathematical model developed taking into account the reaction kinetics, adsorption mechanisms, mass transfer resistances, and velocity variations.

AB  - An efficient and eco-friendly process is proposed for sugarcane bagasse liquefaction under mild condition using IL catalyst and environmental friendly solvent of ethanol/H2O. The relationship between IL acidic strength and its catalytic performance is investigated. The effects of reaction condition parameters such as catalyst dosage, temperature, time and solvent are also intensively studied. The results show that ethanol/H2O has a significant promotion effect on the simultaneous liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse carbohydrate and lignin. 97.5% of the bagasse can be liquefied with 66.46% of volatile product yield at 200 °C for 30 min. Furthermore, the IL catalyst shows good recyclability where no significant loss of the catalytic activity is exhibited even after five runs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Octanoic acid (OA) deoxygenation was investigated over silica- and carbon-supported palladium catalysts (each containing 5 wt.% Pd) at 235-300 °C and 1 atm in a continuous flow reactor. A commercial Pd/SiO2 (A) catalyst was active for OA decarbonylation (DCN) and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) at 260 °C under 10% H2; subsequent hydrogenation (HY) and DCN of the primary products, 1-heptene and octanal, respectively, produced n-heptane. Under equivalent conditions, a Pd/SiO2 (B) catalyst prepared using Pd(NO3)2 and Aerosil 300 produced n-heptane with very high selectivity (&gt;99%) via DCN/HY. In contrast, a commercial Pd/C (A) catalyst was highly active and selective to n-heptane (&gt;98%) and CO2 (65%) under these conditions. Moreover, CO2 selectivity and n-heptane yield increased with reaction temperature consistent with direct decarboxylation (DCX). Increasing H2 partial pressure resulted in markedly lower activity and CO2 selectivity; however, Pd/C (A) had negligible activity under He. Pd/C (A) exhibited greater water-gas shift (WGS) activity than Pd/SiO2 (A); however, differences in WGS activity alone cannot explain the observed support effect. A more highly dispersed Pd/C (B) catalyst was more active at 260 °C under H2 than Pd/C (A); however, under 10% H2, it had lower activity, CO2 selectivity (55%), and stability. Pd/C (A) and Pd/C (B) have very similar textural properties, but Pd/C (A) has a much higher Na content. By comparison, Pd supported on high-purity acetylene carbon black exhibited only DCN activity. These results indicate that carbon surface properties (e.g., polar functional groups, alkali metal content) influence the fatty acid deoxygenation performance of Pd/C catalysts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Butyl butyrate is an environmentally friendly biofuel component that can be produced through the esterification of butyric acid with n-butanol, both of which are obtainable from waste products. The reaction can be optimized by commercial catalysts; however they are currently hindered by issues such as environmental sustainability and cost. Thus, efforts have been made to develop catalysts with green characteristics by incomplete carbonization and sulfonation of pyrolysis products. RESULTS: Activated and non-activated catalysts were produced by sulfonation of char obtained from the carbonization of Miscanthus x giganteus to catalyze the production of butyl butyrate. The char surface area increased from 6.4 to 571m2g-1 after chemical activation at 500°C. Non-activated catalysts derived from char carbonized at 500°C gave a yield of 94.5% after 24h reaction, close to that achieved with H2SO4 (96%). Furthermore, the kinetic parameters associated with the production of butyl butyrate were derived with the implementation of a kinetic model. CONCLUSION: Chemical activation increased the surface area of the char but, due to the prolonged treatment at high temperatures, produced less polycyclic aromatic carbons available to be functionalized. This resulted in a lower acid density and an inferior performance. Conversely, activated catalysts displayed better recovery and reusability. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - About 3600 tonnes food waste are discarded in the landfills in Hong Kong daily. It is expected that the three strategic landfills in Hong Kong will be exhausted by 2020. In consideration of the food waste management environment and community needs in Hong Kong, as well as with reference to the food waste management systems in cities such as Linköping in Sweden and Oslo in Norway, a framework of food waste separation, collection, and recycling for food waste valorization is proposed in this paper. Food waste can be packed in an optic bag (i.e., a bag in green color), while the residual municipal solid waste (MSW) can be packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the refuse transfer stations, in which food waste is separated from the residual MSW using an optic sensor. On the one hand, the sorted food waste can be converted into valuable materials (e.g., compost, swine feed, fish feed). On the other hand, the sorted food waste can be sent to the proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities and sewage treatment works for producing biogas. The biogas can be recovered to produce electricity and city gas (i.e., heating fuel for cooking purpose). Due to the challenges faced by the value-added products in Hong Kong, the biogas is recommended to be upgraded as a biogas fuel for vehicle use. Hopefully, the proposed framework will provide a simple and effective approach to food waste separation at source and promote sustainable use of waste to resource in Hong Kong. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This article focuses on the optimization of the production of fatty acid ethyl esters from soybean oil using CaO-based heterogeneous catalysts. Three different catalytic promoters were evaluated: Magnesium, zinc, and potassium. The reaction has evaluated the promoter content (promoter to calcium molar ratio), catalyst load, alcohol to oil molar ratio, and temperature. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the influence of each variable on the yield of biodiesel. The addition of K2O or MgO in the catalyst has enhanced the yield in fatty acid ethyl esters, while the use of ZnO as a promoter was not successful. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biomass fast pyrolysis followed by hydrodeoxygenation upgrading is the most popular way to produce upgraded bio-oil from biomass. This process requires large quantities of expensive hydrogen and operates under high pressure condition (70-140 atm). Therefore, a novel methanolysis (i.e., biomass pyrolysis under methane environment) process is developed in this study, which is effective in upgraded bio-oil formation at atmospheric pressure and at about 400-600 °C. Instead of using pure methane, simulated biogas (60% CH4 + 40% CO2) was used to test the feasibility of this novel methanolysis process for the conversion of different solid wastes. The bio-oil obtained from canola straw is slightly less than that from sawdust in term of quantity, but the oil quality from canola straw is better in terms of lower acidity, lower Bromine Number, higher H/C atomic ratio and lower O/C atomic ratio. The municipal solid waste and newspaper can also obtain relatively high oil yields, but the oil qualities of them are both lower than those from sawdust and canola straw. Compared with catalysts of 5%Zn/ZSM-5 and 1%Ag/ZSM-5, the 5%Zn-1%Ag/ZSM-5 catalyst performed much better in terms of upgraded bio-oil yield as well as oil quality. During the methanolysis process, the metal silver may be used to reduce the total acid number of the oil while the metal zinc might act to decrease the bromine number of the oil. The highly dispersed Zn and Ag species on/in the catalyst benefit the achievement of better upgrading performance and make it be a very promising catalyst for bio-oil upgrading by biogas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Surface modification of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) through functionalization could improve the characteristics of these nanomaterials as support for enzymes. Carboxylation of MWCNTs (MWCNT-COOH) has been carried out in this study using the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor through humidified air. The chemical method was also used for further functionalization of the MWCNT-COOH through which the amidation of the surfaces with either butylamine (MWCNT-BA) or octadecylamine (MWCNT-OA) was performed. By immobilization of Candida antarctica B lipase (CALB) on these nanoparticles, performance of the immobilized enzyme in catalyzing methanolysis of rapeseed oil was evaluated. The CALB loading on the MWCNT-BA and MWCNT-COOH was 20 mg protein/g, while the value for MWCNT-OA was 11 mg protein/g. The yield of biodiesel was determined as percentage of mass of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) produced per initial mass of the oil, and the yield value for the two of these three supports namely, MWCNT-COOH and MWCNT-BA used for the CALB immobilization was similar at about 92 %, while 86 % was the yield for the reaction catalyzed by the lipase immobilized on MWCNT-OA. Thermal stability of the immobilized CALB and the catalytic ability of the enzyme in the repeated batch experiments have also been determined. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The performance and reliability of a commercial solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with the anode coated by a protective catalytic layer is demonstrated. Physico-chemical and electrochemical characterizations of a Ni-Fe/gadolinium-doped ceria (CGO) electrocatalyst forming the protective layer are reported. The anode layer was prepared by using a procedure that favors the interaction between Ni and Fe. Power densities approaching 0.3W cm-2 for the SOFC cell fed with dry organic fuels were obtained. A time test was performed in the presence of a large flow rate of dry organic fuels under operating conditions (0.8V) showing appropriate fuel flexibility for the device. The resistance to sulfur contamination was verified by feeding increasing amounts of H2S. The cell showed only moderate performance losses until 80ppm of sulfur contaminant. Multipurpose layer: An anode- supported solid oxide fuel cell modified with a protective layer coated on the anode generates high power densities by using biofuels and reliable tolerance in presence of sulfur contamination. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a very important renewable resource that can be used to produce biofuels and various platform chemicals. The conversion of biomass to reducing sugars is an important intermediate step that can impact the economic benefits of the process. Modified carbon-based solid acid is a novel catalyst used in the hydrolysis process of lignocellulosic materials. The catalyst material was prepared through the incomplete carbonization and subsequent sulfonation of a mixture of glucose and p-toluenesulfonic acid, followed by oxidation using 30% H2O2 to promote the acidity. The hydrolysis efficiency of the solid acid catalyst thus prepared was considerably increased. The effects of the carbonization temperature, time, and the glucose/p-toluene-sulfonic acid ratio on catalytic efficiency were investigated in this study. Under the appropriate preparation conditions, the catalyst could hydrolyze corncob to produce 78% xylose. The activity of the catalyst slightly declined after five cycles of application. © 2016.

AB  - Current work is devoted to the search of novel technologies of biofuel production from non-eatable or waste cooking oils and fats. One of such technique is hydrofining which includes the following processes - hydrodeoxygenation, hydrocracking, hydrogenation - and allows producing 2nd generation biodiesel in form of linear saturated hydrocarbons or alcohols with carbon number of 15-22. Palladium-containing catalytic systems on the base of hypercrosslinked polystyrene (HPS) with different metal loading were studied in stearic acid hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation processes to obtain target products (heptadecane and stearyl alcohol) with high yield. It was revealed, that the most effective catalytic system in both processes was the catalyst 1%Pd/MN-270, which allows achieving the high products yield in hydrodeoxygenation process (selectivity regarding n-heptadecane was 99% at 100% substrate conversion) as well as in hydrogenation reaction (selectivity regarding stearyl alcohol was 93% at 100% substrate conversion) of stearic acid. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - There is increasing demand for the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Lignocellulosic biomass consists mainly of three polymeric components: cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. The separation of these components requires an effective pretreatment process to ensure high quality glucose production, and is highly influenced by several factors, including moisture content, cellulose crystallinity, lignin content, and available surface area. Over time, numerous pretreatment methods have been utilized to change the lignocellulosic fiber structure and to enhance the enzymatic saccharification of cellulose to polysaccharides. This article reviews thermal-based pretreatment of lignocellulosic fiber used for glucose production. Based on the reviewed studies, autohydrolysis of lignocellusic biomass, followed by the "Instant pressure drop (DIC)," method can be regarded as an effective pretreatment process of lignocellusic biomass.

AB  - Bio-oil has a complex composition including acids and aldehydes, which lead to undesirable properties, such as high corrosiveness and instability. Upgrading was needed to improve bio-oil quality for its further application as transportation fuels. Hydrogenation and one step hydrogenation-esterification (OHE) were effective methods to convert acids and bio-oil to combustive alcohols and esters. Herein, various CNT-supported (carbon nanotube) non-sulfide catalysts were prepared and catalytic activity was investigated through hydrogenation of acetic acid and OHE of acetic acid and acetaldehyde. Mo-promoted NiMo/CNT catalysts exhibited better catalytic activity in both hydrogenation and OHE reaction for removing acetic acid. The optimal acetic acid conversion rate was up to 17%, with a selectivity of 85% toward ethanol during hydrogenation. OHE showed better efficiency for the conversion of acetic acid compared with hydrogenation. The effect of process parameters on esterification of acetic acid and acetaldehyde together with the selectivity of ethyl acetate were investigated in detail. It was found that addition of extra hydrogen during the OHE reaction was beneficial for improving both acetaldehyde conversion and ethyl acetate selectivity. When extra hydrogen was added twice, the acetaldehyde conversion rose from 66.0% to 81.4%, and the ethyl acetate selectivity improved from 21.8% to 36.8%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of wood with impregnated vegetable oil was investigated and compared with catalytic pyrolysis of jatropha cake making use of sodium based catalysts to produce a high quality bio-oil. The catalytic pyrolysis was carried out in two modes: in-situ catalytic pyrolysis and post treatment of the pyrolysis vapors. The in-situ catalytic pyrolysis was carried out in an entrained flow reactor system using a premixed feedstock of Na2CO3 and biomass and post treatment of biomass pyrolysis vapor was conducted in a downstream fixed bed reactor of Na2CO3/γ-Al2O3. Results have shown that both Na2CO3 and Na2CO3/γ-Al2O3 can be used for the production of a high quality bio-oil from catalytic pyrolysis of oil-impregnated-wood and jatropha cake. The catalytic bio-oil had very low oxygen content, water content as low as 1 wt.%, a neutral pH, and a high calorific value upto 41.8 MJ/kg. The bio-oil consisted of high value chemical compounds mainly hydrocarbons and undesired compounds in the bio-oil were either completely removed or considerably reduced. Increasing the triglycerides content (vegetable oil) in the wood enhanced the formation of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. Post treatment of the pyrolysis vapor over a fixed bed of Na2CO3/γ-Al2O3 produced superior quality bio-oil compared to in-situ catalytic pyrolysis with Na2CO3. This high quality bio-oil may be used as a precursor in a fractionating process for the production of alternative fuels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The catalytic upgrading of a lignin-derived bio-oil model compound, the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol, was performed using mesoporous solid catalysts. Platinum supported on silica and mesoporous silica (SBA-15 and KIT-6) were used as catalysts. The level of platinum incorporation and aluminum grafting did not alter the physical properties of the supports, such as surface area and pore size distribution. On the other hand, these treatments drastically affected the catalytic activities. A catalyst with platinum alone converted guaiacol to oxygenate compounds. In contrast, a series of catalysts with both platinum incorporation and aluminum grafting enhanced hydrodeoxygenation by converting guaiacol into hydrocarbons (cyclohexane and benzene). A comparison of the catalyst supports revealed the ordered mesoporous silica, SBA-15 and KIT-6, with high surface area, to have a higher hydrocarbon yield than conventional silica. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Several samples of activated carbon were prepared by physical (CO2) and chemical (H3PO4) activation of aspen wood and tested for the adsorption of organic compounds from water generated during the recovery of bitumen using steam assisted gravity drainage. Total organic carbon removal by the carbon samples increased proportionally with total pore volume as determined from N2 adsorption isotherms at -196 °C. The activated carbon produced by CO2 activation had similar removal levels for total organic carbon from the water (up to 70%) to those samples activated with H3PO4, but lower yields, due to losses during pyrolysis and activation. A method to increase the yield when using CO2 activation was proposed and consisted of recycling bio-oil produced from previous runs to the aspen wood feed, followed by either KOH addition (0.48%) or air pretreatment (220 °C for 3 h) before pyrolysis and activation. By recycling the bio-oil, the yield of CO2 activated carbon (after air pretreatment of the mixture) was increased by a factor of 1.3. Due to the higher carbon yield, the corresponding total organic carbon removal, per mass of wood feed, increased by a factor of 1.2 thus improving the overall process efficiency. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - The free radical 4-benzoyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4B-TEMPO) is active as an electrocatalyst for primary alcohol oxidations when immobilised at an electrode surface and immersed into an aqueous carbonate buffer solution. In order to improve the catalytic process, a composite film electrode is developed based on (i) carbon microparticles of 2–12 μm diameter to enhance charge transport and (ii) a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (here PIM-EA-TB with a BET surface area of 1027 m2 g−1). The latter acts as a highly rigid molecular framework for the embedded free radical catalyst with simultaneous access to aqueous phase and substrate. The resulting mechanism for the oxidation of primary alcohols is shown to switch in reaction order from first to zeroth with increasing substrate concentration consistent with a kinetically limited process with competing diffusion of charge at the polymer layer-electrode interface (here the “LEk” case in Albery-Hillman notation). Reactivity optimisation and screening for a wider range of primary alcohols in conjunction with DFT-based relative reactivity correlation reveals substrate hydrophobicity as an important factor for enhancing catalytic currents. The PIM-EA-TB host matrix is proposed to control substrate partitioning and thereby catalyst reactivity and selectivity.

AB  - The simulation and exergetic analysis on hydrogen production from conventional steam reforming (SR) and sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of acetic acid, as a major component in the aqueous bio-oil fraction, are presented in this work. The simulation of acetic acid SR and SESR systems were performed in Aspen Plus software where the main chemical reactors used in this work were Gibbs reactors based on Gibbs free energy minimization method. The equilibrium compositions of acetic acid SR and SESR reactors were investigated at different conditions including temperature (200–1000 °C) and steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C, 1–4.5). The increase of temperature and S/C favored hydrogen production in both SR and SESR processes. Higher purity and yield of hydrogen was obtained via SESR reactor than SR reactor. In addition, less CO and no coke were formed in SESR reactor, which showed the advantages of SESR over SR. The exergy efficiencies of acetic acid SR and SESR systems were 61.80% and 66.80%, respectively. The burner and reforming reactor were responsible for major exergy destruction in both SR and SESR systems. At the same time, large exergy destruction was also found in CO2 separation process in SR system. These results and the simplification of hydrogen production system show the better performance of SESR, which can be a promising way for green hydrogen production via aqueous bio-oil fraction. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - When produced biologically, especially by photosynthetic organisms, hydrogen gas (H 2) is arguably the cleanest fuel available. An important limitation to the discovery or synthesis of better H2 -producing enzymes is the absence of methods for the high-throughput screening of H2 production in biological systems. Here, we re-engineered the natural H2 sensing system of Rhodobacter capsulatus to direct the emission of LacZ-dependent fluorescence in response to nitrogenase-produced H 2. A lacZ gene was placed under the control of the hupA H2 -inducible promoter in a strain lacking the uptake hydrogenase and the nifH nitrogenase gene. This system was then used in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometry to screen large libraries of nitrogenase Fe protein variants generated by random mutagenesis. Exact correlation between fluorescence emission and H2 production levels was found for all automatically selected strains. One of the selected H2 -overproducing Fe protein variants lacked 40% of the wild-type amino acid sequence, a surprising finding for a protein that is highly conserved in nature. We propose that this method has great potential to improve microbial H2 production by allowing powerful approaches such as the directed evolution of nitrogenases and hydrogenases.

AB  - Biodiesel is a valuable alternative to fossil fuels and many countries choose biodiesel as an unconventional energy source. A large number of investigations have been done on microalgae as a source of oil production. In recent years, wastewater pollutions have caused many ecological problems, and therefore, wastewater phycoremediation has attracted the international attention. This paper studied the cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris in a crude oil polluted environment for biodiesel production. Intended concentrations were 10 and 20 g per liter (crude oil/water) at two times. The results showed that the growth of C. vulgaris was improved in wastewater and the maximum amount of dry mass and oil was produced at the highest concentration of crude oil (0.41 g and 0.15 g/l, respectively). In addition, dry mass and oil yield of the microalga were significantly enhanced by increasing the experiment duration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study evaluated the growth of Desmodesmus communis on column photobioreactor and its thermochemical treatment by catalytic pyrolysis using HZSM-5 zeolite. D. communis showed good results in terms of growth (0.05g L−1 d−1). Analytical pyrolysis of original algae and derived bio-oil mixed with zeolite was used as a screening method in order to gather information on the cracking process. Preparative pyrolysis on bench scale reactor was performed on algae biomass over a zeolite bed at 1:10 ratio (wt/wt). Py-GC–MS of biomass/catalyst mixture showed that the denitrogenation/deoxygenation increased with increasing zeolite load from 1:5 to 1:20 ratio and became significant at 1:10 ratio. The composition observed by analytical pyrolysis was featured by the predominance of alkylated monoaromatic hydrocarbons. The scaling-up to bench scale confirmed the results obtained with analytical pyrolysis in terms of monoaromatic hydrocarbons. However, low yield of catalytic oil (8% by weight) was observed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, bio-oil waste AAF (aqueous acid fraction) was used to recover iron from red mud (RM) waste by a reductive extraction process. In this process, extraction of iron from RM with AAF is followed by thermal treatment of AAF-Feextracted mixture, leading to the reduction of the Feextracted with the production of Fe/C composites, a valuable feedstock for the steel industry, and a gas fuel fraction. Analyses by IR, UV–vis, ESI-MS, CHN, potentiometric titration, TG, TG-MS, TOC and 1H NMR showed AAF can efficiently extract Fe3+ present in RM waste. After extraction, the mixture AAF-Feextracted was treated at 400, 600 and 800 °C to decompose mainly into two fractions: solid (30–40 wt%) and gas (60–70 wt%). Mössbauer and XRD analyses of the solid fraction showed the presence of reduced iron phases, e.g. Fe2+, Fe0 and iron carbide, with 76% of carbon. TG-MS analyses of gas fraction showed the production of H2 (58 mol%), C1–C4 (19 mol%) and COx (23 mol%), with potential application as a fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates on the efficiency of integrated reformer-MCFC system. Performances of a Ni catalyst working under steam reforming conditions of three different bio-fuels (biogas, ethanol and glycerol) are experimentally evaluated. Reformers outlet stream were applied as fuel for a MCFC stack in order to estimate the total integrated system efficiencies. It is found that the large amount of heat (20%–54% of the inlet fuel – LHV basis) is employed for the reforming of the biofuel during the heating phase of inlet stream to the reforming operative temperature. Moreover, among the examined biofuels the highest amount of externally supplied energy (∼79% of the inlet fuel – LHV basis) is wasted in the fuel processor unit for the steam reforming of ethanol, mostly due to the high amount of the water required (S/C = 4.2 mol/mol). Finally, it is also found that the combined biogas reformer-MCFC system is exhibited the highest electrical efficiency (76%). © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Biomass derived liquid fuels, bio-oil and biofuels, are attractive as a mix of future energy supply, and its combination with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) would substantially enhance the energy conversion efficiency as compared to the conventional direct combustion. Here we present the preliminary results on the performance and operation stability of tubular SOFCs with conventional Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet anode and (La,Sr)MnO3-YSZ (LSM-YSZ) composite cathode running on mallee wood derived bio-oil and biofuels for the electricity generation. The tubular SOFCs show high performance for liquid bio-oil and biofuels, achieving a peak power density ~600 mW cm-2 at 800 °C, close to that produced in pure hydrogen. Significant carbon deposition due to the coke formation of bio-oil and biofuels was observed, leading to the blocking of the reaction sites and structural damage of the cell. However, the addition of CO2 dramatically suppresses the coke formation and significantly enhances the cell operating stability. The results show that it is feasible to directly use biomass derived liquid bio-oil and biofuels in tubular SOFCs for the onsite electricity generation. The cell performance and stability can be enhanced by further optimisation and modification of the composition and microstructure of the anodes of the tubular cells. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present work, microalgae strains, such as Scenedesmus obliquus and Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown in indoor/outdoor photobioreactors (PBRs) and in open ponds (this is the first study on such strains cultivated in the local Southern Italy climatic conditions), were fully analyzed for their protein content, carbohydrates, lipids, and fatty acid profile in order to assess their potential use for the production of biofuels, chemicals, and omega-3, and as animal feed and human food. They are compared with Nannochloropsis sp. (commercial sample) which was fully analyzed in our laboratory and Chlorella (literature data). An economic evaluation was carried out, demonstrating that the cultivation of microalgae for the production of only biofuels will not match the economic standards. Conversely, if chemicals are also produced applying the biorefinery concept and using wastewater as a source of nutrients, it will be possible to have a good positive return from microalgae. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Pyrolysis of palm kernel shell was performed using a two-stage pyrolyzer consisting of an auger reactor and a fluidized bed reactor within the auger reactor temperature range of ∼290–380 °C at the fluidized bed reactor temperature of ∼520 °C, and with a variable residence time of the feed material in the auger reactor. The highest bio-oil yield of the two-stage pyrolysis was ∼56 wt%. The bio-oil derived from the auger reactor contained degradation products of the hemicelluloses of PKS, such as acetic acid, and furfural, whereas the fluidized bed reactor produced a bio-oil with high concentrations of acetic acid and phenol. The auger reactor temperature and the residence time of PKS in the auger reactor had an influence on the acetic acid concentration in the bio-oil, while their changes did not induce an observable trend on the phenol concentration in the bio-oil derived from the fluidized bed reactor. The maximum concentrations of acetic acid and phenol in bio-oil were ∼78 and 12 wt% dry basis, respectively. As a result, it was possible for the two-stage pyrolyzer to separately produce two different bio-oils in one operation without any costly fractionation process of bio-oils. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Low activity and high cost of electrocatalysts are the major challenge for the commercialization of the direct fuel cells (DFCs) and biofuel cells. In this work, we demonstrate the desirable "clean surfaces" effect of Cu nanocrystals in electrocatalysis. By a new reaction route of Cu2O nanospheres (Cu2O NSs), Cu nanowires (Cu NWs) with high purity and "clean surfaces" are first obtained under mild conditions. Benefiting from the path directing effects and abundant (100) facets, the as-prepared Cu NWs exhibit a lower overpotential to achieve the methanol electro-oxidation reaction (MOR) than that of analogous Cu nanoparticles (Cu NPs). Moreover, the "clean surfaces" provide more available active sites for the efficient transfer of electrons, enabling the Cu NWs to show their enhanced electrocatalytic activity. In the MOR, forward peak current density for the surface-cleaned Cu NWs is 2839 μA cm-2, which is ca. 6.45-fold higher than that of the Cu NWs with residual capping molecules on their surface. The "clean surfaces" effect can also be extended to the glucose electro-oxidation reaction (GOR), and the enhancement in specific surface area activity for the Cu NWs is 11.3-fold. This work enhances the electrocatalytic performance of Cu nanocrystals without the need for additional noble metals, which opens up new avenues for utilizing non-noble metals in the DFC or biofuel cell applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Conversion of nongrain biomass into liquid fuel is a sustainable approach to energy demands as global population increases. Previously, we showed that iron can act as a catalyst to enhance the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production. However, direct addition of iron catalysts to biomass pretreatment is diffusion-limited, would increase the cost and complexity of biorefinery unit operations and may have deleterious environmental impacts. Here, we show a new strategy for in planta accumulation of iron throughout the volume of the cell wall where iron acts as a catalyst in the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. We engineered CBM-IBP fusion polypeptides composed of a carbohydrate-binding module family 11 (CBM11) and an iron-binding peptide (IBP) for secretion into Arabidopsis and rice cell walls. CBM-IBP transformed Arabidopsis and rice plants show significant increases in iron accumulation and biomass conversion compared to respective controls. Further, CBM-IBP rice shows a 35% increase in seed iron concentration and a 40% increase in seed yield in greenhouse experiments. CBM-IBP rice potentially could be used to address iron deficiency, the most common and widespread nutritional disorder according to the World Health Organization. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - We describe the application of columns with highly polar stationary liquid phases based on pyridinium ionic liquids for the two-dimensional chromatography separation of bio-oil and product of coal pyrolysis. By using inverse combination columns—a first ionic liquid column and a second nonpolar column—good separation results have been obtained. In the analysis of coal pyrolysis products, the suggested approach provides a much better resolution between components in comparison with a less polar first-dimension column (based on polyethylene glycol). A good selectivity for the peaks of phenols is observed, and the group of phenols is well detached and separated from the group of diaromatics. A good separation picture was obtained also for bio-oil, the groups of phenols and guaiacol derivatives are distinguished with good resolution of substances within each group. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This paper explores the experimental investigation of the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of bio fuels from ceiba pentandra methyl ester (CPME), ceiba pentandra methyl ester-pine oil blends (CPMEP) and pine oil and the results are compared with diesel. In ceiba pentandra seed oil the CPME yield is 92% by using transesterification process with the optimum conditions of 560 rpm, reaction time 58 min, catalyst concentration 13 g and methanol amount 500 ml. The viscosity of CPME is high when compare with diesel. So the low viscosity of pine oil is blended with CPME and it can be directly used in diesel engine without any modification. At different loads the Pine oil, CPME and CPMEP blends were used in direct injection naturally aspirated compression ignition engine. The outcomes exhibited that at full load conditions for CPME and CPMEP blends increased brake specific fuel consumption, and decreased brake thermal efficiency, CO, HC emissions. NOx emissions decreased and smoke emissions are increased on CPME and CPMEP blends, expect B25 blend compared with diesel. The combustion analysis like the heat release rate, peak cylinder pressure, cumulative heat release rate and ignition delay for CPME, CPMEP blends slightly lower and combustion duration higher than diesel and pine oil. At the Same engine operating condition, the engine fuelled with pine oil the values of brake thermal efficiency 4.79%, peak cylinder pressure, heat release rate, cumulative heat release rate and ignition delay are increased. Brake specific fuel consumption, CO, HC, and smoke were 9.46%, 16.66%, 14.89% and 8.33% decreased. However, the NOx emission is 8.29% higher than that of diesel. Experimental fuels up to B50 (50% pine oil and 50% CPME) blends have proved good potential for future energy is needed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquid-liquid phase equilibrium (LLE) for the system of biodiesel, glycerol, methanol or ethanol is fundamental for modeling, simulation, design and economic evaluation of biodiesel production. This paper presents a correlated set of group interaction parameters (GIP) for the UNIFAC model that adequately describe the LLE of such biodiesel systems. To correlate and to verify the GIP, a database including 84 LLE experimental results reported in the literature was built. The database includes biodiesel produced using 23 different vegetable oils and 2 different alcohols (methanol and ethanol), as raw materials, at temperatures between 293.15 K and 353.15 K. The GIP were correlated using an evolutionary algorithm. The correlated set of GIP describes the LLE with an average deviation up to 0.7%, regardless of the type of biodiesel and the temperature (in the range studied). Model descriptions using the proposed set of GIP were compared with the description of others GIP reported in the literature. LLE descriptions using the new set of GIP proposed in this work exhibited the best fit between the experimental data and the calculated values for all the systems biodiesel-glycerol-methanol or ethanol evaluated. © 2016.

AB  - Background: Replacing fossil fuel with renewable sources such as lignocellulosic biomass is currently a promising alternative for obtaining biofuel and for fighting against the consequences of climate change. However, the recalcitrant structure of lignocellulosic biomass residues constitutes a major limitation for its widespread use in industry. The efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials requires the complementary action of multiple enzymes including xylanases and β-xylosidases, which are responsible for cleaving exo- and endoxylan linkages, that release oligocarbohydrates that can be further processed by other enzymes. Results: We have identified the endo-β-1,4-xylanase Xyl2 from Fusarium oxysporum as a promising glycoside hydrolase family 11 enzyme for the industrial degradation of xylan. To characterize Xyl2, we have cloned the synthetic optimized gene and expressed and purified recombinant Xyl2 to homogeneity, finally obtaining 10 mg pure Xyl2 per liter of culture. The crystal structure of Xyl2 at 1.56 Å resolution and the structure of a methyl-xylopyranoside Xyl2 complex at 2.84 Å resolution cast a highly detailed view of the active site of the enzyme, revealing the molecular basis for the high catalytic efficiency of Xyl2. The kinetic analysis of Xyl2 demonstrates high xylanase activity and non-negligible β-xylosidase activity under a variety of experimental conditions including alkaline pH and elevated temperature. Immobilizing Xyl2 on a variety of solid supports enhances the enzymatic properties that render Xyl2 a promising industrial biocatalyst, which, together with the detailed structural data, may establish Xyl2 as a platform for future developments of industrially relevant xylanases. Conclusions: F. oxysporum Xyl2 is a GH11 xylanase which is highly active in free form and immobilized onto a variety of solid supports in a wide pH range. Furthermore, immobilization of Xyl2 on certain supports significantly increases its thermal stability. A mechanistic rationale for Xyl2's remarkable catalytic efficiency at alkaline pH is proposed on the basis of two crystallographic structures. Together, these properties render Xyl2 an attractive biocatalyst for the sustainable industrial degradation of xylan. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The catalytic conversion of linoleic acid in ethanol/water mixtures (1:1 vol. ratio) was explored in a batch reactor using a Pt/C catalyst. Linoleic acid was converted into heptadecane with high yields (>80%) after 6 h at 350 °C under autogenous pressure. The reaction proceeded through consecutive steps: linoleic acid → stearic acid → ethyl stearate → heptadecane. Hydrogen was generated in-situ by oxidation of ethanol into acetaldehyde. A moderate sintering of platinum was evidenced after hydrothermal reaction. A reaction network based on products distribution and kinetic studies was proposed. It was found that the hydrogenation route proceeds via the free acids whereas the hydrogenation of the ethyl esters was negligible. The formation of heptadecane, on the other hand, proceeded via ethyl stearate and not via stearic acid. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Growth of the world energy consumption, depletion of energy sources and global warming related to fossil fuel consumption have increased the attention toward the production of renewable fuels. Conversion of vegetable oil and fats (natural triglycerides) to biofuel is one of the options to produce renewable fuels for the transportation sector, but the yield and quality of products are among the important factors in the process. This paper presents some of the results obtained from the study of deoxygenation and ketonization processes using thermal/catalytic cracking of sunflower oil and its methyl esters for the production of transportation biofuels. Sunflower oil was converted to methyl ester in the presence of KOH through transesterification reaction and was used as a feed for the cracking process. Fuel properties after thermal cracking of sunflower oil and its methyl esters have been compared to determine the benefits of transesterification process as a pretreatment step for the triglycerides. To reduce the oxygen content of the liquid products and improve properties of the fuel after catalytic cracking using HZSM-5, deoxygenation over γ-Al2O3 and ketonization over MnO2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were examined. Results show that depending on the thermal cracking severity, while the yields of the liquid organic products from thermal cracking of sunflower oil and its methyl esters were almost the same, their acidity vary between 3.78 and 5.41 mg KOH/g for methyl esters and between 66.16 and 123.41 mg KOH/g for triglycerides. The extracted heavier cuts similar to gas oil vary between 5.26% and 22.35% for methyl esters and between 18.39% and 51.03% for triglycerides, which proves the benefits of methyl ester cracking to the original oil cracking. Decarboxylation and ketonization of the liquid products with catalysts reduce the acidity and improve other properties of the fuel to the standard level. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 2,5-hexanedione, a valuable platform chemical which is being broadly used in biofuel, medicinal chemistry and drug discovery, was synthesized from biomass derived dimethyl furane using a highly efficient biphasic system. In this biphasic systems, mineral acids (HCl, H2SO4 and H3PO4) dissolved in aqueous phase were used as hydrolysis catalysts. The hydrolysis reaction is suggested to take place at the interface between the aqueous and the organic phase. But more importantly, water-immiscible organic phase could continuously extract the in-situ produced 2,5-hexanedione from the interface to prevent the extended contact between the 2,5-hexanedione and the acids, thereby avoiding the oligomerization side reactions A yield of 99 % could be obtained when methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) was the organic phase in the biphasic system. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The proof-of-concept for enzymatic electrosynthesis with simultaneous energy production has been demonstrated by using the regioselective conversion of D-sorbitol to D-fructose by D-sorbitol dehydrogenase as a model reaction. The bioreactor was composed of two electrodes, a carbon felt bioanode modified by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) containing D-sorbitol dehydrogenase immobilized in a silica matrix and an oxygen gas-flow cathode. The electrochemical regeneration of the NAD+ cofactor at the bioanode was achieved by using a poly(methylene green) mediator electrodeposited on the carbon felt/MWCNT electrode. The conversion rate was 1.18 mg day-1 cm-3 and an energy power output up to 14.6 μW cm-3 at 0.1 V was reached. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalysis of dioxygen (O2) reduction is an essential process for constructing a biocathode for use in an enzymatic biofuel cell. In this study, a gas-diffusion-type electrode without any binders or surfactants, which are both known to interfere with DET-type bioelectrocatalysis, was constructed. Bilirubin oxidase (BOD), a promising catalyst for DET-type O2 reduction, and water-dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes compatible with BOD were used. The electrode displayed high kinetic performance in the DET reaction and large steady-state current density under quiescent conditions. In addition, the electrode provided a platform that was eight times more suitable for BOD than a traditional electrode. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of value-added lignin products from industrial residues of pulping is still a challenge. The present study was aimed to use oil obtained from organosolv lignin by base-catalyzed depolymerization at 300 °C for 40 min as a wood-protecting agent. First, the bio-oil was diluted to 1 wt% into an acetone and water solution, and physicochemical properties such as density, pH and viscosity were analyzed. After that, Pinus sp. sapwood samples were impregnated with the diluted oil solution (WAO). The treated wood samples were characterized in terms of color variation, hardness (Shore D) tests, scanning electron microscope, pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy through attenuated total reflectance (ATR-IR) and mass loss after fungal attack. The inhibition effect of the oil solution was tested against Trametes versicolor (l. Ex fries) Pilat. The application of the oil solution in the wood improved significantly its fungal resistance as the mass loss was considerably lower in the treated samples. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We demonstrate here the transformation of waste cow manure into N rich porous carbons (NPC) with large amount of micropores and large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas. The transformation process was achieved via carbonization of cow manure in presence of ZnCl2 and FeCl3 additives, without using additional templates. The resultant NPC could be converted into microporous carbonaceous solid acids (NPC-[C4N][X]) by quaternary ammonization of samples with 1,4-butane sultone, and ion exchanging with strong acids such as HSO3CF3 and H2SO4. X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectra showed that NPC-[C4N][X] exhibit amorphous carbon network. N2 isotherms and SEM images showed that NPC-[C4N][X] have abundant nanopores with large BET surface areas. XPS, FT-IR and elemental analysis results showed the N rich network in NPC support, has been successfully and homogeneously functionalized with strongly acidic ionic liquid and sulfonic groups. 31P solid NMR spectra confirmed that NPC-[C4N][X] have typical Brønsted acid centers with strong and controllable acidity. Catalytic tests showed that NPC-[C4N][X] exhibits excellent activity and reusability in production of biofuels and fine chemicals through esterifications, transesterifications, and depolymerization of microcrystalline cellulose. This approach may provide a novel and cost effective way to recycle the waste cow manure into efficiently porous carbon based solid acids for heterogeneous acid catalysis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - For catalyst performance assessment of blast furnace slag as a low-cost catalyst, the cracking runs of frying sunflower oil were carried out in the presence of two different catalysts (blast furnace slag and calcium oxide) and also as non-catalytic. At the end of the studies performed, the catalysts were comparatively evaluated via the products of yields and some physicochemical properties such as density, viscosity, higher heating value, etc. The product generated by using the blast furnace slag exhibited better results than the others. On the other hand, it was seen that the product with blast furnace slag possessed the important hydrocarbon compounds in the range of C8-C14 atoms. © The Author(s) 2016 Reprints and permissions.

AB  - In this work, vanadium pentoxide supported on rice husk ash containing 5, 10 and 15 mass% of V2O5 were prepared by the urea combustion method. These samples were characterized by FTIR (Fourier - transform infrared spectroscopy) and XRD (X-ray diffraction) and applied in the reactions of transesterification with ethanol by using different triglycerides sources, namely as soybean oil, frying oil and chicken fat. The XRD data of the V2O5/RHA showed reflections associated with the silica, sodium silicate and V2O5. The FTIR spectra of the V2O5/RHA samples containing 5 to 15 mass% of V2O5 presented absorptions related to silica, silicates and possible V-O-Si interactions, also been observed in the 15% V2O5/RHA an FTIR band associated to V2O5. The 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) and GC-FID (gas chromatography with flame ionization detection) analysis of the transesterification reactions presented conversions of triglycerides for biodiesel over 90% in a period of 6 h, demonstrating the potential of V2O5/RHA for the synthesis of ethyl biodiesel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The void size distribution inside a packed bed is one of the most important parameters affecting the reactor performance. The non-uniform distribution of material and energy flows can be avoided by a reasonable arrangement of the void size distribution. In this work, the void size distributions in a packed bed with structured and random packing were investigated through both theoretical calculations and statistical analysis of experimental results to characterize the bed voids between the particles. In theoretical analysis, the equivalent diameters of voids at different two-dimensional layers in a packed bed with three types of structured packing were first calculated, and then the wax replacement method was adopted to measure the voids inside a randomly packed bed. Different two-dimensional layers of the bed were sliced and photographed for further analysis. The effects of particle size, shape, and packing method were investigated, and the results showed that the relative void size (void size/particle size) was not affected by the particle size. In contrast, the particle shape, which can be represented by particle sphericity, significantly affected the void size distribution. A more flat void size distribution curve was obtained for particles with sphericity close to unity. A new correlation was established based on statistical analysis of the experimental data to account for the void size distribution. This new correlation was validated by predicting the pressure drop of a packed bed and the results of comparison showed good agreement with experimental results. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Sugar beet tails are a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production. This work discusses a new process to produce a fermentable juice of sugar beet tails using pulsed electric field (PEF) and solid-liquid expression. The impact of PEF intensity E and duration tPEF on the expression kinetics of solutes from sugar beet tails was investigated. The optimal PEF intensity and duration were respectively E=450V/cm and tPEF=10ms corresponding to an energy input Q=1.91Wh/kg. At these PEF parameters, the yield of solutes was increased from 16.8% to 79.85% and the dryness of pressed cake was increased from 15% to 24% in comparison with the untreated tails. Moreover, the PEF expressed juice was more concentrated (10% vs. 5.2%) and had higher sucrose content (8.9 vs. 4.5°S) than the juice expressed from untreated tails. Batch fermentation experiments with commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast were realized using raw juices expressed from untreated and PEF treated sugar beet tails. It was found that the higher content of fermentable sugars in PEF expressed juice leads to a higher ethanol content in distillate (6.1% vs. 2.95% v/v) and a higher CO2 weight loss (57.2 vs. 28.3g/L) than that obtained from raw juice of untreated tissue. The obtained results are promising and open new opportunities for valorization of sugar beet by-products. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An innovative reference approach was developed to investigate the solvent effects on the liquefaction of sawdust by using tetralin as a chemical probe, and the corresponding solvent impact index was defined in this study. The influence of reaction conditions including reaction temperature and solvent types on solvent impact index were discussed. It was found that larger solvent impact index corresponds to improved sawdust conversion and higher bio-oil yield. The liquid and gaseous products obtained were characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), gas chromatography (GC), and elemental analysis (EA). The component of products highly depended on the employed solvents. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a novel low power, high frequency piezoelectric-based ultrasonic reactor was developed and evaluated for intensifying the transesterification process. The reactor was equipped with an automatic temperature control system, a heating element, a precise temperature sensor, and a piezoelectric-based ultrasonic module. The conversion efficiency and specific energy consumption of the reactor were examined under different operational conditions, i.e., reactor temperature (40-60 °C), ultrasonication time (6-10 min), and alcohol/oil molar ratio (4:1-8:1). Transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) was performed in the presence of a base-catalyst (potassium hydroxide) using methanol. According to the obtained results, alcohol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, ultrasonication time of 10 min, and reactor temperature of 60 °C were found as the best operational conditions. Under these conditions, the reactor converted WCO to biodiesel with a conversion efficiency of 97.12%, meeting the ASTM standard satisfactorily, while the lowest specific energy consumption of 378 kJ/kg was also recorded. It should be noted that the highest conversion efficiency of 99.3 %, achieved at reactor temperature of 60 °C, ultrasonication time of 10 min, and alcohol/oil molar ratio of 8:1, was not favorable as the associated specific energy consumption was higher at 395 kJ/kg. Overall, the low power, high frequency piezoelectric-based ultrasonic module could be regarded as an efficient and reliable technology for intensifying the transesterification process in terms of energy consumption, conversion efficiency, and processing time, in comparison with high power, low frequency ultrasonic system reported previously. Finally, this technology could also be considered for designing, developing, and retrofitting chemical reactors being employed for non-biofuel applications as well. © 2016 BRTeam.

AB  - The synthesis of γ-valerolactone from biomass-derived ethyl levulinate is of great importance for biomass conversion. However, development of efficient catalytic systems which are simple, commercially available, easy for preparation, and large-scale for the hydrogenation of ethyl levulinate to afford γ-valerolactone is still necessary. Here, a series of commercial zeolite supported catalysts were synthesized by using a wet impregnation method for the systemic investigation of the hydrogenation of biomass-derived ethyl levulinate. High yield and selectivity towards GVL were achieved and varied and systematic characterizations including XRD, XPS, TEM and BET were used to investigate these catalysts. The influence of different reaction condition parameters was also investigated and discussed. The construction of zeolite supported catalysts showed broad prospects for the conversion of biomass into biofuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study examines the GHG emissions associated with producing bio-hydrocarbons via fast pyrolysis of Miscanthus. The feedstock is then upgraded to bio-oil products via hydroprocessing and zeolite cracking. Inventory data for this study were obtained from current commercial cultivation practices of Miscanthus in the UK and state-of-the-art process models developed in Aspen Plus®. The system boundary considered spans from the cultivation of Miscanthus to conversion of the pyrolysis-derived bio-oil into bio-hydrocarbons up to the refinery gate. The Miscanthus cultivation subsystem considers three scenarios for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates. These were assumed as follows: (i) excluding (SOC), (ii) low SOC and (iii) high (SOC) for best and worst cases. Overall, Miscanthus cultivation contributed moderate to negative values to GHG emissions, from analysis of excluding SOC to high SOC scenarios. Furthermore, the rate of SOC in the Miscanthus cultivation subsystem has significant effects on total GHG emissions. Where SOC is excluded, the fast pyrolysis subsystem shows the highest positive contribution to GHG emissions, while the credit for exported electricity was the main ‘negative’ GHG emission contributor for both upgrading pathways. Comparison between the bio-hydrocarbons produced from the two upgrading routes and fossil fuels indicates GHG emission savings between 68% and 87%. Sensitivity analysis reveals that bio-hydrocarbon yield and nitrogen gas feed to the fast pyrolysis reactor are the main parameters that influence the total GHG emissions for both pathways. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Hydrogen (H2 ) consumption and methane (CH4 ) production in pure cultures of three different methanogens were investigated during cultivation with 0, 0.2 and 4.21 μM added nickel (Ni). The results showed that the level of dissolved Ni in the anaerobic growth medium did not notably affect CH4 production in the cytochrome-free methanogenic species Methanobacterium bryantii and Methanoculleus bourgensis MAB1, but affected CH4 formation rate in the cytochrome-containing Methanosarcina barkeri grown on H2 and CO2 . Methanosarcina barkeri also had the highest amounts of Ni in its cells, indicating that more Ni is needed by cytochrome-containing than by cytochrome-free methanogenic species. The concentration of Ni affected threshold values of H2 partial pressure (pH2 ) for all three methanogen species studied, with M. bourgensis MAB1 reaching pH2 values as low as 0.1 Pa when Ni was available in amounts used in normal anaerobic growth medium. To our knowledge, this is the lowest pH2 threshold recorded to date in pure methanogen culture, which suggests that M.bourgensis MAB1 have a competitive advantage over other species through its ability to grow at low H2 concentrations. Our study has implications for research on the H2 -driven deep subsurface biosphere and biogas reactor performance. © 2016 Neubeck et al.

They were pretreated with sodium hydroxide, then hydrolyzed with the cellulase from the on-site enzyme production by co-culture of Trichoderma reesei C10 and Aspergillus niger NL02. Glucose and xylose, main fermentable sugars produced, were converted by Mortierella isabellina to single cell oil (SCO). Subsequently, the unsaturated fatty acids from the SCO were transformed by metathesis to long chain DCAs. Overall, 115.7 g of corn stover could produce 4.2 g of DCAs, 4.2 g of alkenes, 4.1 g of saturated fatty acids, 4.9 g of glycerol and 9.3 g of lignin whereas 117.1 g of rice straw could produce 3.2 g of DCAs, 3.2 g of alkenes, 2.7 g of saturated fatty acids, 3.6 g of glycerol and 9.8 g of lignin. The DCAs production from lignocelluloses was successfully established and showed promising results in industry. Thus, this comprehensive utilization of agricultural residues is greatly meaningful to countries such as China which have high food demand and facing environmental problem due to abundance of agricultural waste. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mixed oxides are widely used as catalyst in biodiesel production. The synthesis of these materials is mostly performed through co-precipitation using a basic solution as precipitating agent. The presence of residual alkali metals in the catalyst is a problem. The use of non-edible raw materials is a challenging issue in biodiesel production. The effect of precipitating agent (NaOH/Na2CO3, urea and (NH4)2CO3/NH4OH), calcination temperature (450 and 750 °C), and Zn/La molar ratio in the catalytic performance of Zn,La-mixed oxides for edible and non-edible soybean oil methanolysis was studied. ZnO promoted biodiesel production and lanthanum oxide carbonate and carbonate hydroxide phases are more effective for transesterification reaction than lanthanum oxide. The catalytic results for the transesterification of edible soybean oil could be correlated to catalyst basicity. The esterification of oleic acid added to edible soybean oil was favored by La species. In the presence of oleic acid, FAME yield could not be correlated to acid-basic sites density and the lanthanum oxide carbonate and carbonate hydroxide species deactivated more than lanthanum oxide. The best performance for the methanolysis of soybean oil containing 10% of oleic acid (95%) was obtained by the catalyst prepared using urea as coprecipitation agent and calcined at 750 °C. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biobutanol is attracting increasingly interest as a source of renewable energy and biofuels because of its many advantages over bioethanol that include higher energy density, fuel efficiency, and reduced engine damages. Currently, there is a growing interest in producing biobutanol from bioethanol, in view of the tremendous potential benefits of this transformation for the bulk production of biobutanol in a target specific manner. This perspective paper describes recent progress for the ethanol to butanol process. The different catalysts, including homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems, for ethanol to butanol are outlined and compared, and the key issues and requirements for future developments are highlighted. A major challenge for further development and application of ethanol to butanol process is to find an optimal balance between different catalytic functions and to suppress the formation of side products that has plagued most catalytic bioethanol upgrading systems. © 2016 Science Press

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the pyrolysis of de-oiled seed cake of Jatropha Curcas and catalytic steam reforming of pyrolytic bio-oil to hydrogen. As per literature, presence of heavy nitrogenous and oxygenated compounds leads to catalyst deactivation. Here, an attempt has been made to tune pyrolytic reactions to optimize the N and O content of the pyrolytic bio-oil. Bio-oil conversion and hydrogen yield decreased as reaction progressed, which attributes to temporary loss of catalytic activity by blockage of catalyst pores by carbon deposition. Further, retention of steam reforming activity after repetitive steam activation suggests long-term catalyst usage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid fuel fired fluidized bed (FB) boilers are common in combined heat and power (CHP) plants in district heating- and process industry. In this study, utilization of such FB boilers for production of syngas in dual fluidized bed gasifiers and subsequent catalytic biofuel production to substitute natural gas (SNG), methanol (MeOH) and Fischer-Tropsch fuel (FT) has been examined. Based on the hypothesis that waste-heat and tail gas from the biofuel processes can be utilized in the CHP plant, process configurations aiming for operationally robustness and low investment cost rather than maximum stand-alone efficiency have been explored and implemented in actual industrial cases and over the full operating range of the boilers. The results of the study show that significant improvements of overall efficiency can be achieved by integration of the biofuel processes in the CHP plants and that a relatively high biofuel production capacity can be achieved. SNG showed the highest obtainable efficiency and production capacity of the studied biofuels, whereas the FT process showed largest increase in terms of efficiency when integrated in the CHP plant, compared to its stand-alone efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Furfural is directly converted to levulinate esters (isopropyl levulinate and furan-2-ylmethyl-levulinate) as potential biofuel feedstocks, through a combined catalytic strategy. Nb2O5-ZrO2 mixed oxide microspheres are used as bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen-transfer hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed alcoholysis in isopropanol. Bifunctional catalysts improve sustainability of furfural conversion through process intensification. Hydrogen transfer hydrogenation from isopropanol avoids dangerous hydrogen gas, and abates process and environmental costs. Isopropyl levulinate and furan-2-ylmethyl-levulinate are the main products that can be applied as blending components in biodiesel or hydrocarbon fuels. © 2016

AB  - The recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass poses a major challenge that hinders the economical utilization of biomass for the production of biofuel, plastics, and chemicals. Ionic liquids have become a promising solvent that addresses many issues in both the pretreatment process and the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond for the deconstruction of cellulosic materials. However, to make the use of ionic liquids economically viable, either the cost of ionic liquids must be reduced, or a less expensive solvent (e.g., water) may be added to reduce the overall amount of ionic liquid used in addition to reducing the viscosity of the binary liquid mixture. In this work, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of water dilution on the overall liquid structure and properties of three imidazolium based ionic liquids. It is found that ionic liquid-water mixtures exhibit characteristics that can be grouped into two distinct regions, which are a function of the ionic liquid concentration. The trends observed in each region are found to correlate with the ordering in the local structure of the ionic liquid that arises from the dynamic interactions between the ion pairs. Simulation results suggest that there is a high level of local ordering in the molecular structure at high concentrations of ionic liquids that is driven by the aggregation of the cationic tails and the anion-water interactions. It is found that as the concentration of ionic liquids in the binary mixture is decreased, there is a point at which the competing self and cross interaction energies between the ionic liquid and water shifts away from a cation-anion dominated regime, which results in a significant change in the mixture properties. This break point, which occurs around 75% w/w ionic liquids, corresponds to the point at which water molecules percolate into the ionic liquid network disrupting the ionic liquids' nanostructure. It is observed that as the cationic alkyl tail length increases, the changes in the binary mixtures' properties become more pronounced. © 2016 Author(s).

AB  - Fats, oils and greases (FOG) are the number one cause of sewer pipe blockage and have been mostly disposed of as a waste until recently. This study investigated a low cost and environmentally friendly approach to extract the lipid fraction (fatty acids and glycerides for biodiesel production) from sewer grease (SG), i.e., FOGs obtained from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The lipid fraction of the sewer grease was primarily in the form of free fatty acid (FFA), at 20.7 wt%. An innovative solvent-free extraction approach was developed using waste cooking oil (WCO) to overcome the challenges of emulsion, impurities and high moisture content of the sewer grease. A 95% extraction yield of sewer grease was achieved under the optimum operating condition of 3.2:1 WCO-SG ratio (wt/wt), 70 °C and 240 min. In addition, the reusability of the WCO was also investigated. WCO can be used two to three times for sewer grease extraction with more than 90% extraction efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The higher areal productivity and lipid content of microalgae and aquatic weed makes them the best alternative feedstocks for biodiesel production. Hence, an efficient and economic method of extracting lipid or oil from aquatic weed, Salvinia molesta is an important step towards biodiesel production. Since Salvinia molesta is an unexplored feedstock, its total lipid content was first measured as 16 % using Bligh and Dyer’s method which was quite sufficient for further investigation. For extracting more amount of lipid from Salvinia molesta, methanol: chloroform in the ratio 2:1 v/v was identified as the most suitable solvent system using Soxhlet apparatus. Based on the literature and the preliminary experimentations, parameters such as solvent to biomass ratio, temperature, and time were identified as significant for lipid extraction. These parameters were then optimized using response surface methodology with central composite design, where experiments were performed using twenty combinations of these extraction parameters with Minitab-17 software. A lipid yield of 92.4 % from Salvinia molesta was obtained with Soxhlet apparatus using methanol and chloroform (2:1 v/v) as solvent system, at the optimized conditions of temperature (85 °C), solvent to biomass ratio (20:1), and time (137 min), whereas a predicted lipid yield of 93.5 % with regression model. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis of S. molesta lipid using gas chromatograph mass spectroscopy (GCMS) with flame ionization detector showed that fatty acids such as C16:0, C16:1, C18:1, and C18:2 contributed more than 9 % weight of total fatty acids. FAME consisted of 56.32, 28.08, and 15.59 % weight of monounsaturated, saturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively. Higher cetane number and superior oxidation stability of S. molesta FAME could be attributed to its higher monounsaturated content and lower polyunsaturated content as compared to biodiesels produced from C. vulgaris, Sunflower, and Jatropha. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this work was produced an immobilized biocatalyst from Cercospora kikuchii lipase with beneficial catalytic activity and stability. The immobilized derivative was used in the ethanolysis of coconut oil. This is a great option for the Brazilian renewable fuel production, because both coconut oil and ethanol are promptly available in the country, at a reasonably low cost. For this, lipase was immobilized on rice husk (5.5 mgprotein g-1 support) by covalent binding using spouted bed drying (gas flow rate, 0.66 m3 min-1 temperature, 100 °C; and solution flow rate, 5.5 g min-1). In a typical batch run, the immobilized derivative was added at a vegetable oil/ethanol molar ratio of 1:12 using tert-butanol as the solvent. The feasibility of immobilization and drying processes was demonstrated toward biodiesel production, attaining a high ester content (97.1%) and low levels of acylglycerides (0.9%) after 72 h. Further properties, such as viscosity (4.56 mm cm-2) and density (888 kg m-3), are in agreement with specifications required by the ASTM D6751 to be used as alternative biofuel. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Packed beds find wide applications in chemical industries. In this paper, a Discrete Element Method (DEM) - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach has been adopted to predict the flow profile in the bed for different diameter of the bed/diameter of the particle. The randomly packed bed was created using the DEM technique. The radial voidage of the bed was calculated using the Monte Carlo integration method. The radial voidage showed an oscillating pattern up to approximately 4-5 particle diameter from the wall, which was validated with the experimental data reported by several researchers. The flow studies through these packed beds were carried using single-phase laminar flow model. The flow followed a similar oscillating pattern as the radial voidage. The numerical results were validated with experimental data. Preliminary studies to predict the residence time distribution has also been carried out using the multi-species transport model, which was also experimentally validated. The study suggests that DEM and CFD simulation can predict the flow behaviour as well as Residence Time Distribution (RTD) in a packed bed quite satisfactorily without the need to carry out experiments, which would be environmental friendly. © 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Deoxygenation of fatty acids (oleic and stearic acids) and non-edible oil (jatropha oil) over Pd(1-5 wt%) supported on two structurally different, three-dimensional, mesoporous silica (SBA-12 and SBA-16) catalysts was investigated. Pd/SBA-16 (cubic mesoporous structure with space group Im3¯m) showed higher catalytic activity than Pd/SBA-12 (hexagonal mesoporous structure with space group p63/mmc). The influence of reaction parameters like temperature, H2 pressure and Pd content as well as the nature of the feedstock on catalytic activity and product selectivity was studied. A temperature of above 320 °C, reaction time of 5 h and Pd content (on silica surface) of 3 wt% enabled complete conversion of the fatty compounds into diesel-range hydrocarbons. Deoxygenation proceeded through hydrodeoxygenation and decarboxylation mechanisms when a saturated (stearic) acid was used as a feed while it advanced mainly through decarboxylation route when an unsaturated (oleic) acid was employed. Higher surface hydrophobicity and smaller size particles of Pd are the possible causes for the superior catalytic activity of Pd/SBA-16. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cellulose was extracted from agricultural waste like Rice Husk (RH) a renewable resource of India as well as in the World. Cellulose was isolated from rice husk (RH) using eco-friendly method with Montmorillonite K-10/LiOH solution and bleaching with 2% H2O2. The reaction parameters like time, temperature, catalyst, acid and alkali were studied to evaluate the optimum reaction conditions 6 h, 80 °C, 20% maleic acid and 10% LiOH (in H2O) for time, temperature, acid and alkali, respectively. Renewable energy, biofuel from agricultural waste using Myrothecium gramineum was also investigated herein. Cellulose was converted to glucose by using acid hydrolysis and the optimum reaction conditions were 140 °C for 60 min. in presence of H2SO4 (5% v/v). It has been recognized significantly as potential sustainable sources of sugars for fermentation to bioethanol. So, our effort was given to obtain bioethanol from RH using new and novel renewable fungal strain M. gramineum. M. gramineum was isolated from acacia plant available in NE region of India. The results revealed that % yields of cellulose, glucose and bioethanol were 68%, 60% and 25%, respectively. Moreover, the bioethanol was compared with the standard ethanol (Laboratory grade) and also the ethanol produced from the known microb Aspergillus Niger. The synthesized products were characterized with the help of analytical techniques like FT-IR, GC, TGA, DSC and XRD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gaseous and particulate matter (PM) emissions were assessed from two current technology heavy-duty vehicles operated on CARB ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) blends, and a biodiesel blend. Testing was performed on a 2014 model year Cummins ISX15 vehicle and on a 2010 model year Cummins ISB6.7 vehicle. Both vehicles were equipped with diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC), diesel particulate filter (DPF), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. Testing was conducted over the Heavy-Duty Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) Transient Cycle. The results showed lower total hydrocarbons (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and methane (CH4) emissions for the HVO fuels and the biodiesel blend compared to CARB ULSD. Overall, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions showed discordant results, with both increases and decreases for the HVO fuels. NOx emissions with the biodiesel blend for both vehicles were higher compared to the HVO fuels and CARB ULSD. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were generally lower for the HVO fuels relative to CARB ULSD, but not for the biodiesel blend. Fuel economy showed some significant reductions for the HVO fuels and the biodiesel blend over both test cycles for one of the vehicles, but not for the other. PM mass emissions were higher for the biofuels, while particle number emissions were lower. Results of the particle size distribution for the ISX-15 vehicle revealed bimodal size distribution profiles for most cases, with a nucleation mode centered from 9 to11 nm size range and an accumulation mode peaking at around 125 nm.

AB  - The efficiencies of dioxygen reduction on common carbonaceous materials were compared using voltammetry and fuel cell measurements. Carbon paper (CP), carbon fibre (CF) or carbon cloth (CC) conducting supports were covered under water pump pressure with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to increase the working surface of the electrode, improve connectivity with enzyme molecules and provide direct electron transfer. Laccase was the biocathode catalyst catalyzing 4-electron reduction of oxygen to water on the nanostructured electrode. CP carbon paper was selected as the favourable electrode substrate, since it provided best durability holding firmly the carbon nanotubes together with the enzyme at the electrode surface. Zinc disc or fructose dehydrogenase was used as anode in the hybrid fuel cell and biofuel cell, respectively. The characteristics under externally applied resistances and potential-time dependencies under flowing solution conditions were evaluated. The hybrid fuel cell based on Zn anode and CP supported laccase cathode gave the best results in terms of power and open circuit potential (OCP). The full biofuel cell based on laccase and fructose dehydrogenase shows lower OCP but the power–time dependencies were similar to those of the hybrid biofuel cell. The nanostructured surfaces show good supercapacitor properties due to the presence of carbon nanotubes at the electrode surface. The fuel cells undergo self-charging/discharging and, therefore, can be conveniently employed in pulsed-work regime to power external devices. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigates the exergy concept for use in chemical engineering applications, and compares the energy and exergy methodology for the production process of biodiesel.A process for biodiesel production was suggested and simulated in view of the energy and exergy analysis. A method was developed to implement the exergy concept in Aspen Plus 7.3. A comparison between the energy and the exergy approach reveals that the concepts have similarities but also some differences. In the exergy study, the reaction section has the largest losses whereas in the energy study separation steps are the most important. An optimization, using both concepts, was carried out using the same parameters. The optimized results were different depending on the objective function. It was concluded that exergy analysis is crucial during the design or redesign step in order to investigate thermodynamic efficiencies in each part of the process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Dilute sulfuric acid (SA)-catalyzed pretreatment fractionates the first biomass into cellulose and hemicellulose-derived xylose, and these are then converted separately to levulinic acid (LA) using 2-sec-butylphenol (SBP) and lignin-derived (LD) alkylphenol solvents, respectively. LA is upgraded catalytically to butene oligomers via γ-valerolactone (GVL) and butene intermediates. Separation subsystems are designed to recover the alkylphenol solvents and biomass-derived intermediates (LA and GVL) for combination with the catalytic conversion subsystems of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. In addition, a heat exchanger network (HEN) design is presented to satisfy the energy requirements of the integrated process from combustion of biomass residues (degradation products). Finally, a technoeconomic analysis shows that the proposed process ($3.37/gallon of gasoline) is an economically competitive alternative to current biofuel production approaches. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the potential use of yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides for lipid production and removal of organics and nutrients while treating a mixture of distillery and domestic wastewater at low cost without sterilization. The highest specific biomass (24.1 × 10−9g L−1cell−1h−1), lipid yield (9.9 × 10−9g L−1cell−1h−1), and lipid content (8.54 × 10−3g lipid g−1biomass h−1) were achieved on the 2nd day of cultivation. The organics and nutrients removal also reached the highest removal rates within 2 days, with the specific removal rates for COD (chemical oxygen demand), TN (total nitrogen), and TP (total phosphorus) at 39.5, 2.57, and 0.29 × 10−9mg cell−1h−1, respectively. The indigenous microorganisms slightly contributed to both lipid production and removal of organics and nutrients. The direct transesterification process via microwave irradiation from wet biomass was further optimized under the conditions of solvent to wet biomass rate 16 mL/g, methanol and chloroform mix rate 1:1, addition of catalyst H2SO46%, and reaction time 10 min at the reaction temperature of 60 °C. The FAMEs (fatty acid methyl esters) composition and the possibility of biodiesel production from wet oleaginous yeast biomass by the direct transesterification were also assessed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study deals with the enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel by transesterification of Jatropha oil (Jatropha curcas L.) with ethanol in a solvent-free system. Seven commercial lipase preparations immobilized by covalent attachment on epoxy-polysiloxane-polyvinyl alcohol composite (epoxy-SiO2-PVA) were tested as biocatalysts. Among them, immobilized lipases from Pseudomonas fluorescens (lipase AK) and Burkholderia cepacia (lipase PS) were the most active biocatalysts in biodiesel synthesis, reaching ethyl ester yields (FAEE) of 91.1 and 98.3% at 72 h of reaction, respectively. The latter biocatalyst exhibited similar performance compared to Novozym® 435. Purified biodiesel was characterized by different techniques. Transesterification reaction carried out under microwave irradiation exhibited higher yield and productivity than conventional heating. The operational stability of immobilized lipase PS was determined in repeated batch runs under conventional and microwave heating systems, revealing half-life times of 430.4 h and 23.5 h, respectively. © 2016 Livia T.

AB  - Coke formation during the esterification of bio-oil in alcohols and water over a solid acid catalyst Amberlyst 70 has been investigated. The amounts of coke formed from the acid-treatment of bio-oil in various alcohols are half of that in water. Alcohols stabilize the major components in bio-oil such as sugars, furans, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and phenolics. On the other hand, water promotes the polymerisation of these components. In addition, experimental parameters also affect the coke formation during acid-treatment of bio-oil in alcohols. The elevated reaction temperature, long residence time, and high dosage of catalyst significantly promoted coke formation. The soluble polymeric material and insoluble polymeric material was characterized with FI-IR and UV-florescence spectroscopies. The results show that the coke formed is highly aromatic. The aromatics in bio-oil have a significant contribution to the formation of coke during the esterification of bio-oil. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The effect of ethanedioic acid (EdA) functionalization on Al2O3 supported Ni catalyst was studied on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), isomerization, kinetics and Arrhenius parameters of octadec-9-enoic acid (OA) into biofuel in this report. This was achieved via synthesis of two catalysts; the first, nickel alumina catalyst (Ni/Al2O3) was via the incorporation of inorganic Ni precursor into Al2O3; the second was via the incorporation nickel oxalate (NiOx) prepared by functionalization of Ni with EdA into Al2O3 to obtain organometallic NiOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Their characterization results showed that Ni species present in Ni/Al2O3 and NiOx/Al2O3 were 8.2% and 9.3%, respectively according to the energy dispersive X-ray result. NiOx/Al2O3 has comparably higher Ni content due to the EdA functionalization which also increases its acidity and guarantees high Ni dispersion with weaker metal-support-interaction leading to highly reducible Ni as seen in the X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, TPR and Raman spectroscopy results. Their activities tested on the HDO of OA showed that NiOx/Al2O3 did not only display the best catalytic and reusability abilities, but it also possesses isomerization ability due to its increased acidity. The NiOx/Al2O3 also has the highest rate constants evaluated using pseudo-first-order kinetics, but the least activation energy of 176 kJ/mol in the biofuel formation step compared to 244 kJ/mol evaluated when using Ni/Al2O3. The result is promising for future feasibility studies toward commercialization of catalytic HDO of OA into useful biofuel using organometallic catalysts. © 2015 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics.

AB  - A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was tailored with conducting polymer polythiophene and further immobilized by an enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx). A thin film of polymer was developed by electrochemical polymerization of thiophene monomer. During electrochemical polymerization of the monomer the enzyme GOx and the redox active mediator ferritin (Frt) were entrapped within this polymer matrix. In this novel approach, the entrapment of enzyme and mediators within a polymer matrix occurs without chemical reaction that could affect their activity. The entrapment of enzyme and mediator within the conducting polymer matrices increases the surface area of the electrode. The tailored GCE/Ptp/Frt/GOx electrode showed a high catalytic activity. The increased surface area causes a high rate of electron transfer between the electrode and Frt engaged as an electron transfer mediator. The electrochemical properties of the electrode were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The fabricated bioanode showed a current density of 3.9mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 45 mM glucose solution and suggests proficient chances in biofuel cells (BFCs) applications. © 2016, Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.

AB  - Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and pure Fatty Acids (FAs) derived from food processing represent sustainable feedstocks for biofuel production. The catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of these residual oils is a possible pathway to advanced biofuel production, alternative to catalytic hydrotreatment, already commercially deployed in large-scale installations. The present work first carried out a literature review of previous research works in the field, which provided the key information to the following implementation of a pilot-scale dedicated experimental work aimed at producing bio-hydrocarbons from residual vegetable oils, with a special focus on paraffinic fuels. Based on the literature survey, 4 different catalysts were selected for the experimental investigation. Catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of UCO was initially carried out in 1.5 kg h−1 (max) feed pilot unit, operated at 500 °C, with the catalytic reactor working at 4 and 2.5 h−1 Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV). Liquid yields and corresponding hydrocarbon fractions were investigated: these initial results suggested to extend the study to catalytic pyrolysis of pure FAs. At T = 500 °C and with activated carbons as catalyst, the total observed hydrocarbon yield mass fraction on UCO and FA increased from 23% (UWHSV = 4 h−1) to 35% (UCO, WHSV = 2.5 h−1) and finally to 40% (FA, WHSV = 2.5 h−1). A slight reduction in the overall liquid yield mass fraction was also observed in this last experiment with FAs (from 63% to ≈49%). Even if the current work on the pilot pyrolyser did not aim at investigating energy and process optimization, including yield maximization and catalyst lifetime, experimental results indicated that catalytic pyrolysis could be a promising way for industrial production of hydrocarbons from low quality lipid-based materials (as it is the case of UCOs) and without requiring hydrogen for catalytic hydrotreatment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, we report the aerobic oxidation of several bio-oils (pyrolysis and microwave) derived from Kraft lignin using oxovanadium complex catalyst, (HQ)2Vv(O)(OiPr) (HQ = 8-oxyquinoline) (2), ionic liquid (IL)-tagged oxovanadium complex, PF6-IL-salen-VIV(O) (3) (PF6 = hexafluorophosphate) and copper catalyst CuX/TEMPO/2,6-lutidine (4) [X = OTf, trifluoro-methanesulfonate), Cl; TEMPO = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl]. Cleavage of some lignin linkages and reduced phenolic content were observed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR and 1D/2D GC/MS analysis. Catalyst 2 oxidized chloroform extracts of the microwave bio-oil more extensively than those from the pyrolysis bio-oil although reactivity trends were similar. With catalyst 3 in [MMIM][MeOSO3], the phenolic conversion was modest compared with the increase in carboxyl and decrease in aliphatic OH groups. IR spectra were consistent with phenol oxidation to quinone-type structures. In contrast, copper catalyst 4 showed formation of high molecular weight compounds after oxidation, likely resulting from radical recombination. Comparison of reactivity between the different types of lignin-derived bio-oils is also discussed. © 2016

AB  - Levulinate ester has been identified as a promising renewable fuel additive and platform chemical. Here, the use of a wide range of common metal salts as acid catalysts for catalytic upgrading of biomass-derived furfuryl alcohol to butyl levulinate was explored by conventional heating. Both alkali and alkaline earth metal chlorides did not lead effectively to the conversion of furfuryl alcohol, while several transition metal chlorides (CrCl3, FeCl3, and CuCl2) and AlCl3 exhibited catalytic activity for the synthesis of butyl levulinate. For their sulfates (Cr(III), Fe(III), Cu(II), and Al(III)), the catalytic activity was low. The reaction performance was correlated with the Brønsted acidity of the reaction system derived from the hydrolysis/alcoholysis of cations, but was more dependent on the Lewis acidity from the metal salts. Among these investigated metal salts, CuCl2 was found to be uniquely effective, leading to the conversion of furfuryl alcohol to butyl levulinate with an optimized yield of 95%. Moreover, CuCl2 could be recovered efficiently from the resulting reaction mixture and remained with almost unchanged catalytic activity in multiple recycling runs. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - We propose a novel approach to continuous bioprocessing of gases. A miniaturized, coated-paper strip, high gas fraction, biocomposite absorber has been developed using slowly shaken horizontal anaerobic tubes. Concentrated Clostridium ljungdahlii OTA1 was used as a model system. These gas absorbers demonstrate elevated CO mass transfer with low power input, reduced liquid requirements, elevated substrate consumption, and increased product secretion compared to shaken suspended cells. Concentrated OTA1 cell paste was coated by extrusion onto chromatography paper. The immobilized system shows high, constant reactivity immediately upon rehydration. Cell adhesion was by adsorption to the cellulose fibers; visualized by SEM. The C. ljungdahlii OTA1 coated paper mounted above the liquid level absorbs CO and H2 from a model syngas secreting acetate with minimal ethanol. At 100 rpm shaking speed (7.7 Wm−3) the optimal cell loading is 6.5 gDCW m−2 to maintain high CO absorbing reactivity without the cells coming off of the paper into the liquid phase. Reducing the medium volume from 10 mL to 4 mL (15% of tube volume) did not decrease CO reactivity. The reduced liquid volume increased secreted product concentration by 80%. The specific CO consumption by paper biocomposites was higher at all shaking frequencies &lt;100 rpm than suspended cells under identical incubation conditions. At 25 rpm the biocomposite outperforms suspended cells for CO absorption by 2.5-fold, with an estimated power reduction of 97% over the power input at 100 rpm. The estimated minimum kLa for miniaturized biocomposite gas-absorbers is ∼100 h−1, 10 to 104 less power input than other syngas fermentation systems reported in the literature at similar kLa. Specific consumption rates in a biocomposite were ∼14 mmol gDCW −1h−1. This work intensified CO absorption and reactivity by 14-fold to 94 mmol CO m−2 h−1 over previous C. ljungdahlii OTA1 work by our group. Specific acetate production rates were 23 mM h−1 or 46 mmol m−2 h−1. The specific rates and apparent kLa scaled linearly with biocomposite coating area. Biotechnol.

AB  - In the present work m-xylene and an equimolecular mixture of m-xylene, 1-butanol and furfural, all of them bio-oil model compounds, were studied in steam reforming (SR) conditions. Three different nickel catalysts, which showed to be active in 1-butanol SR (Ni/Al2O3, Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 and Ni/La2O3-Al2O3), were tested and compared with thermodynamic equilibrium values. Tests were carried out at temperatures from 800 to 600 °C at atmospheric pressure with a steam to carbon ratio (S/C) of 5.0. Despite the different bio-oils fed, the amount of moles going through the catalytic bed was kept constant in order to obtain comparable results. After their use, catalysts were characterized by different techniques and those values were correlated with the activity results. All catalysts were deactivated during the SR of the mixture, mainly by coking. The highest hydrogen yields were obtained with Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts in the SR of m-xylene and SR of the mixture, respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil derived via fast pyrolysis is being developed as a renewable fuel option for petroleum distillates. The compatibility of neat bio-oil with six elastomer types was evaluated against the elastomer performance in neat diesel fuel, which served as the baseline. The elastomers included two fluorocarbons, six acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers (NBRs), and one type each of fluorosilicone, silicone, styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), polyurethane, and neoprene. Specimens of each material were exposed to the liquid and gaseous phases of the test fuels for 4 weeks at 60 °C, and properties in the wetted and dried states were measured. Exposure to bio-oil produced significant volume expansion in the fluorocarbons, NBRs, and fluorosilicone; however, excessive swelling (over 80%) was only observed for the two fluorocarbons and two NBR grades. The polyurethane specimens were completely degraded by the bio-oil. In contrast, both silicone and SBR exhibited lower swelling levels in bio-oil compared to neat diesel fuel. The implication is that, while polyurethane and fluorocarbon may not be acceptable seal materials for bio-oils, silicone may offer a lower cost alternative. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Enzymatic reactions involving lipases as catalyst in transesterification can be an excellent alternative to produce environmental-friendly biodiesel. In this study, lipase extracted from Cocoa Pod Husk (CPH) and immobilized through cross linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) technology catalysed the transesterification of Jatropha curcas oil successfully. Face centered central composite design (FCCCD) under response surface methodology (RSM) was used to get the optimal conditions of 3% (w/w) enzyme loading, 4 h reaction time and 1:6 oil/ethanol ratio to achieve the highest conversion of free fatty acid and glycerides into biodiesel (93%). The reusability of CLEA-lipase was tested and after seven cycles, the conversion percentage reduced to 58%. The results revealed that CLEA lipase from CPH is a potential catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nano-titanium dioxide (nanoTiO2) under ultraviolet irradiation (UV) followed by dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse was used to enhance the production of biohydrogen and biomethane in a consecutive dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion. Different concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 g nanoTiO2/L under different UV times of 30, 60, 90 and 120 min were used. Sulfuric acid (2% v/v) at 121 °C was used for 15, 30 and 60 min to hydrolyze the pretreated bagasse. For acidic hydrolysis times of 15, 30 and 60 min, the highest total free sugar values were enhanced by 260%, 107%, and 189%, respectively, compared to samples without nanoTiO2 pretreatment. The highest hydrogen production samples for the same acidic hydrolysis times showed 88%, 127%, and 25% enhancement. The maximum hydrogen production of 101.5 ml/g VS (volatile solids) was obtained at 1 g nanoTiO2/L and 120 min UV irradiation followed by 30 min acid hydrolysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A strategy is presented that produces liquid hydrocarbon fuels (butene oligomers (BO)) from cellulose (C6) fraction and commodity chemicals (tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA)) from hemicellulose (C5) of corn stover based on catalytic conversion technologies using 2-sec-butylphenol (SBP) solvents. This strategy integrates the conversion subsystems based on experimental studies and separation subsystems for recovery of biomass derivatives and SBP solvents. Moreover, a heat exchanger network is designed to reduce total heating requirements to the lowest level, which is satisfied from combustion of biomass residues (lignin and humins). Based on the strategy, this work offers two possible process designs (design A: generating electricity internally vs. design B: purchasing electricity externally), and performs an economic feasibility study for both the designs based on a comparison of the minimum selling price (MSP) of THFA. This strategy with the design B leads to a better MSP of $1.93 per kg THFA. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The NO2 oxidation kinetics and burning mode for diesel particulate from light-duty and medium-duty engines fueled with either ultra low sulfur diesel or soy methyl ester biodiesel blends have been investigated and are shown to be significantly different from oxidation by O2. Oxidation kinetics were measured using a flow-through packed bed microreactor for temperature programmed reactions and isothermal differential pulsed oxidation reactions. The burning mode was evaluated using the same reactor system for flowing BET specific surface area measurements and HR-TEM with fringe analysis to evaluate the nanostructure of the nascent and partially oxidized particulates. The low activation energy measured, specific surface area progression with extent of oxidation, HR-TEM images and difference plots of fringe length and tortuosity paint a consistent picture of higher reactivity for NO2, which reacts indiscriminately immediately upon contact with the surface, leading to the Zone I or shrinking core type oxidation. In comparison, O2 oxidation is shown to have relatively lower reactivity, preferentially attacking highly curved lamella, which are more reactive due to bond strain, and short lamella, which have a higher proportion of more reactive edge sites. This preferential oxidation leads to Zone II type oxidation, where solid phase diffusion of oxygen via pores contributes significantly to slowing the overall oxidation rate, by comparison. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The physical and chemical properties of raw bio-oil, two oxidized bio-oils, and hydrotreated bio-oil were compared before and after catalytic hydrodeoxygenation using sulfided CoMo/?-Al2O3 catalyst. Following continuous hydrodeoxygenation, the organic liquid products from treated bio-oils and raw bio-oil were compared for higher heating value, oxygen content, water content, and viscosity. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry were employed to identify functional groups and chemical species, respectively. Fresh and spent catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption for surface area and pore properties. The degree of coking of the spent catalysts was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis. Hydrodeoxygenation of hydrotreated bio-oil (HB) gave the longest reaction time on stream of 780 min, the least coking amount of 20 wt%, and the highest hydrocarbon selectivity of 70% up to 720 min of reaction time on stream. Moreover, organic liquid products from HB showed relatively stable properties such as low oxygen content, water content, and viscosity over a longer period of reaction time on stream.

AB  - Releases of C60 fullerenes to the environment will increase with the growth of nanotechnology. Assessing the potential risks of manufactured C60 requires an understanding of how its prevalence in the environment compares to that of natural and incidental C60. This work describes the characterization of incidental C60 present in aerosols generated by combustion of five common fuels: coal, firewood, diesel, gasoline, and propane. C60 was found in exhaust generated by all five fuels; the highest concentrations in terms of mass of C60 per mass of particulate matter were associated with diesel and coal. Individual aerosols from these combustion processes were examined by transmission electron microscopy. No relationship was found between C60 content and either the separation of graphitic layers (lamellae) within the particles, nor the curvature of those lamellae. Estimated global emissions of incidental C60 to the atmosphere from coal and diesel combustion range from 1.6 to 6.3tyr-1, depending upon combustion conditions. These emissions may be similar in magnitude to the total amount of manufactured C60 produced on an annual basis. Consequent loading of incidental C60 to the environment may be several orders of magnitude higher than has previously been modeled for manufactured C60. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Isopropanol-acetone-hydrogen chemical heat pump (IAH-CHP) is a system having the ability to improve energy-grade and to achieve energy storage simultaneously. Acetone hydrogenation is an important part of IAH-CHP and directly affects the performance of IAH-CHP. In this work, the fully three-dimensional simulations on acetone hydrogenation in randomly packed-bed reactors with small tube-to-particle diameter ratio D/dp were carried out by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The study focused on the heat and mass transfer characteristics at inter- and intra-particles of the bed. The results indicate that the resistance of mass transfer at intra-particles is maximum in the entire transport process. Particle-to-fluid heat transfer is the main resistance of heat transfer in the bed. In addition, the synergy between transport of components and reaction rate at intra-particles was analyzed for various structural parameters, such as porosity εp, pore diameter do, particle diameter dp and tube-to-particle diameter ratio D/dp, in order to improve the utilization efficiency of catalyst. This study provides a detailed understanding on transport characteristics both at intra-particles and in fluid zone in randomly packed-bed reactors with small D/dp, providing a guideline for catalyst and reactor design for this type of chemical heat pump. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The addition of self-MSBO (metathesized soybean oil) to biodiesel significantly depresses the onset temperature of crystallization (Ton). MSBO and self-MTO (metathesized triolein), used as model systems, were separated into their constituent "molecular families" using column chromatography and crystallization fractionation and tested as crystallization modifiers of biodiesel. The results indicate that cis-unsaturation combined with a straight chain moiety is a critical structural architecture for disrupting biodiesel crystallization. The data obtained with TAGs (triacylglycerols) propose that the most effective stereospecificity is when the two fatty acids in the cis-configuration are in the sn-and sn-positions and a trans-/saturated fatty acid is at the sn-position. The conversion of cis-double bonds to trans-double bonds by self-metathesis explains the lowering of Ton of biodiesel. The fractionation of MSBO, leading to a liquid fraction enriched with molecules having cis-unsaturated fatty acids out-performed MSBO in lowering Ton of biodiesel. This knowledge can be used for the design of economical and more functional materials from MSBO and other metathesized vegetable oils using selective and practical fractionation methods. The findings of the study suggest that the use of biodiesel with significant saturated methyl ester content can be extended in colder months of the year. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: To reduce the cost of the enzymes for the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, two main strategies have been followed: one, the reduction of enzyme dosing by the use of more efficient and stable enzymatic cocktails; another, to include accessory enzymes in the cocktails to increase yields by reducing the recalcitrant carbohydrate fraction remaining at the end of the process. To guide this second strategy, we have explored the chemical bond composition of different fractions of recalcitrant carbohydrates after enzymatic hydrolysis. Results: Two lignocellulosic feedstocks of relevance for the biofuels industry have been analyzed, corn stover and sugarcane straw. On comparing the composition of chemical bonds of the starting pretreated material with samples after standard and forced hydrolysis (with enzyme overdosing), we obtained similar sugar and chemical bond composition. Conclusions: This suggests that the current enzymatic cocktails bear the set of enzymes needed to hydrolyze these feedstocks. From our point of view, the results show the need for a parallel fine-tuning of the enzymatic cocktails with the pretreatment process to maximize sugar release yield. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Consecutive alkylation of acetone (A) with ethanol (E) in a ratio of 1:2 and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the obtained Guerbet products were studied. A fixed bed flow-through reactor system was applied at total pressure of 21 bar and in the temperature range of 175-350 °C using inert He or/and reducing H2 carrier gases. In the alkylation process catalysts based on a hydrogen borrowing strategy were applied using neutral activated carbon (AC) or alkaline hydrotalcite (HT) supports, namely 5 wt% Pd/AC in presence of a 30 wt% KOH alkaline additive or 5 wt% Pd/HT. After self- and cross-condensation of the reactants the effluent product mixture was treated in a H2 stream over a second commercial hydrodeoxygenating (HDO) catalyst (NiMo/alumina) layer. All the catalysts were activated in H2 flow at 350 °C. In inert helium carrier gas over Pd-catalysts C5-C7 mono- or dialkylated ketones were obtained as main products however different C7-C11 mono- or dialkylated ketones were also formed due to Guerbet coupling of ethanol to butanol mimicking the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixture as reactant. By replacing helium with hydrogen medium over Pd-catalyst systems the produced ketones could be reduced to alcohols. Finally, for hydrocarbon fuel production, the oxygen content of the alcohol-ketone mixture can be eliminated completely, by applying a second reactor section filled up with an industrial NiMo/alumina catalyst producing the parallel alkanes. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of red macroalgae Eucheuma cottonii (EC) as feedstock for third-generation bioethanol production. Dowex (TM) Dr-G8 was explored as a potential solid catalyst to hydrolyzed carbohydrates from EC or macroalgae extract (ME) and pretreatment of macroalgae cellulosic residue (MCR), to fermentable sugars prior to fermentation process. The highest total sugars were produced at 98.7 g/L when 16% of the ME was treated under the optimum conditions of solid acid hydrolysis (8% (w/v) Dowex (TM) Dr-G8, 120 °C, 1 h) and 2% pretreated MCR (P-MCR) treated by enzymatic hydrolysis (pH 4.8, 50 °C, 30 h). A two-stream process resulted in 11.6 g/L of bioethanol from the fermentation of ME hydrolysates and 11.7 g/L from prehydrolysis and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of P-MCR. The fixed price of bioethanol obtained from the EC is competitive with that obtained from other feedstocks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the European Union the demand for middle distillates is growing, while decrease in the gasoline demand can be observed. Even the most complex refineries are not able to produce the economic yield distribution from the processed crude oil which constantly meets the changing market demand. The growing need of diesel fuel can only be satisfied by using unconventional feedstocks, such as bio-originated resources and less valuable refinery streams (e.g. light cycle oil with high aromatic content, &gt;80%, from Fluid Catalytic Cracker). The aim of our experiments was the investigation (co-processing) of differently prepared mixtures from straight run gas oil (70-100%), light cycle oil (LCO: 0-10%) and waste animal fat (0-20%). There are no publicly available articles which present the use of these feedstock components. We investigated the effects of the process parameters (temperature: 300-380°C, pressure: 40-70 bar, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV): 0.75-2.0 -1, H2/feedstock ratio: 600 Nm3/m3) on the quality and quantity of products obtained from different composition feedstocks. We found that with the usage of favourable parameter combination the total conversion of triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA) into n-paraffins as well as the saturation of a significant part of the aromatic compounds and the desulphurisation of the LCO and straight run gas oil can be reached. Notable quality improvement was observed in case of all feedstock components at co-processing. High cetane number of alkanes formed from the conversion of triglycerides and FFAs, compensating the low cetane number of products (e.g. monoaromatics and diaromatics) from the saturation of polyaromatic components. Products obtained at advantageous process parameters can be excellent diesel fuel blending components, because they have low sulphur and aromatic content as well as adequate cetane number, density and cold flow properties. Besides these, they contain components from renewable sources, too. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Renewable fuels form an essential means to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions emitted by vehicles and non-road machines. Due to the limited production so far, different blends of renewable fuels in fossil fuels are a realistic way to implement the increasing use of renewable fuels. In addition to significant GHG emissions reduction, further benefits can be achieved when high quality renewable fuels are utilized as blending components since the pollutant exhaust emissions, such as unburned hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter mass (PM) and particle number (PN), may also decrease. A global Finnish forestry company has developed an innovative production process from crude tall oil (CTO), a wood-based residue of pulp making process, to renewable diesel. The fuel properties correspond to those of the traditional fossil fuels but the GHG emissions are reduced significantly. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) is an especially promising feedstock for the production of chemicals and biofuels, because it can be prepared from lignocellulosic biomass. Its conversion to γ-valerolactone (GVL), a fuel additive and precursor to transportation fuels, appears preferential. In this study, a heterogeneous Ru/C catalyst was employed for investigating the hydrogenation reaction of LA to GVL in the aqueous phase in a three-phase mechanically agitated contactor. To explore kinetics, runs were performed in a chemical-control regime between the temperatures 323–353 K, H2 partial pressures 0.69–2.07 MPa, initial LA concentrations 4.31–12.93 mmol/L, and catalyst loadings 0.3–0.7 kg/m3. Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) models were applied to describe the initial rates of LA disappearance. The model, which presumed that surface reaction between non-dissociatively chemisorbed H2 and LA is limiting, was most suited to describe reaction kinetics. From an Arrhenius plot, it was found that the value of Eact is 68.1 kJ/mol. © 2016 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering

AB  - The use of biofuel as an energy alternative has gain continuous increase over the years; this is due to their advantage in limiting global warming and harmful emissions arising from diesel engines; this couple with the fast dwindling rate of fossil fuels has increased attention towards their uses. Studies have been conducted in recent years to analyze different energy sources and fuel additives for diesel engines. In this study, the combustion and emission characteristics were investigated by adding organic based manganese additive into rapeseed methyl ester (R0) in four (4) different loads. The results showed that there was a decrease in the viscosity, density, and flash point of fuels treated with additives while the calorific value of the treated fuel was increased. These improvements in the fuel features enhanced the fuel atomization. A minimum ignition delay was obtained in the R0Mn12 fuel for all the loads. A fuel ignition delay of 13.21 °CA occurred in the maximum load, while the maximum cylinder pressure of 62.76 bar was recorded. As a result of enhancing the fuel characteristics, analysis of the combustion emission revealed a reduction of 25.28% in carbon monoxide (CO), 6.64% in total hydrocarbon (THC), 6.5% in smoke emission and 25.52% increase of nitrogen oxides (NOx) were recorded in the R0Mn12 fuel compared to the R0 fuel. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydrodynamics of a periodically operated packed bed subjected to column oscillations and obliquity was studied. Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and capacitance wire mesh sensors were employed to measure the local instantaneous liquid saturation in stationary slanted and moving packed beds, respectively. A swell simulator with six-degree-of-freedom motions was applied to emulate the behavior of floating packed beds. The results revealed that column inclination from the vertical position considerably decayed liquid waves excited by different cyclic operation strategies. However, ON–OFF liquid and gas/liquid alternating cyclic operations showed an attempt to conserve wave identity in the slanted bed and to decrease phase maldistribution resulting from bed inclination. It was also found that symmetric and non-symmetric split ratios of ON–OFF liquid cyclic mode were able to noticeably decrease fluid maldistribution in the oscillating packed bed. This study opens up possible prospects for process intensification of floating packed bed reactors and contactors. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 62: 4157–4172, 2016. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Graphene nanosheets were produced on the surface of carbon fibers by in situ electrochemical procedure including oxidative and reductive steps to yield first graphene oxide, later converted to graphene. The electrode material composed of graphene-functionalized carbon fibers was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammery demonstrating superior electrochemical kinetics comparing with the original carbon paper. The interfacial electron transfer rate for the reversible redox process of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− was found ca. 4.5-fold higher after the electrode modification with the graphene nanosheets. The novel electrode material is suggested as a promising conducting interface for bioelectrocatalytic electrodes used in various electrochemical biosensors and biofuel cells, particularly operating in vivo. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This article provides an overview of previous research contributions and the current status of technology on the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wood biomass into liquid fuels and valuable chemicals. This process involves the direct liquefaction of biomass, which operates from 200°C to 400°C, 5 to 25 MPa, and 10 to 60 min reaction time in hot-compressed water or solvent and with or without a catalyst in the presence of inert or reducing gas. The influence of process variables, including biomass composition, temperature, residence time, pressure, heating rate, particle size, catalysts, and so on, which are significant for the bio-oil yield and product quality, has been addressed in this review. This review focuses on the HTL fundamentals based on current knowledge and summarizes the state-of-the-art knowledge of the HTL of wood biomass. © 2016 by De Gruyter.

AB  - Ligno-cellulosic biofuels, notably ethanol produced in processes involving biological fermentation, have high potential as renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. However, ligno-cellulose pretreatment procedures generate substances that inhibit current biocatalysts. Thus, efficient methods are required for improving these organisms' tolerance or developing new biocatalysts with higher tolerance to the inhibitors. For this, greater knowledge of the mechanisms involved is needed. Therefore, we examined effects of common inhibitors (phenol, levulinic acid, HMF (hydroxymethylfurfural) and furfural) on growth, utilization of sugars (xylose, mannose and glucose) and enzyme activities of a tolerant organism, the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor, during 15-day incubations. The fungus metabolized and grew in the presence of all the inhibitors (singly and together) at the applied concentration (0.2-0.6 g/L). When all inhibitors were added, no significant effect of sugar utilization was shown. However, levulinic acid added solely reduced xylose (but not xylose-degrading enzymes) and mannose utilization, but not glucose utilization. Physiological and biotechnological implications of the findings are discussed such as usage of T. versicolor as a detoxifying agent in ethanol production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulos biomass can be converted to bio-oil containing aliphatic hydrocarbons via catalytic pyrolysis at 500°C in the presence of Cs modified amorphous silica alumina (Cs/ASA). The reaction routes for the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons was studied using biomass constituent, viz. cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and single model components in a pyrolyzer system in conjunction with GC/MS. The pyrolysis behaviour of each biomass constituent was also studied using TGA. The results showed that in the presence of Cs/ASA catalyst aliphatic hydrocarbons can be formed from all the three constituents but mainly from lignin (35% of total peak area compared to 10% for cellulose) resulting in high quality bio-oil with 40 Mj kg-1 heating value. On the other hand, the pyrolysis of single model compounds did not result in the aliphatic hydrocarbons. However, pyrolysis of mixture of the model compounds yielded in aliphatic hydrocarbons indicating effect of intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen transfer over Cs+ ions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomethanation of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a slow process and the yield of biogas is usually low. The present study was carried out to examine the effect of calcium chloride (CaCl2) on anaerobic digestion of MSW. Three anaerobic digesters with different concentrations of CaCl2 namely sample without additives (Control), sample with 2.5g/LCaCl2 (R1) and sample with 5g/LCaCl2 (R2) were studied separately and the significant results are presented. From the experimental results, it was observed that pH decreased with an increase in the dosage of CaCl2. Total solids and volatile solids reduction percentage in digester R2 was considerably lower than Control and R1 digesters. The significant positive correlation with small increments in volatile solids and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction were observed with an increase in pH. The cumulative biogas production in all the three digesters (Control, R1 and R2) were observed to be 35.38, 46.46 and 37.56L, respectively. It was also observed that the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) removal efficiency in digester R1 was the best among all the three digesters. A comparison of the effluent characteristics revealed improvement in the overall performance of the digester R1 amended with 2.5g/LCaCl2 over the other two digesters. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Alternative routes of the MixAlco® process, i.e., the ketonization (KR) and esterification (ER) routes, were evaluated for the production of mixed alcohols from brown algae. The alternatives were rigorously simulated using Aspen Plus v.8.6 for 400,000 tons dry brown algae/year. The simulation results were used to develop techno-economic models and to evaluate the alternatives based on their profitability, energy requirements, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results showed that the KR is superior, with a net present value (NPV) and present value ratio (PVR) of 61.1 million dollars and 1.57, respectively, over the ER, with a NPV and PVR of - 55.1 million dollars and 0.48, respectively. The total energy costs of the KR and ER were calculated to be 11.6 and 37.2 million dollars/year, respectively, while emitting 109.7 and 307.6 kton CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq)/year GHGs. The economic model was used to perform a sensitivity analysis and calculate a maximum dry seaweed price (MDSP) of 90.0 $/ton for the KR. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is currently the most common biofuel alternative for diesel engines due to its technical, environmental and strategic advantages. In Brazil, the use of mixtures B(X) biodiesel/diesel as fuels is growing every year, mainly due to the calorific power of biodiesel, that is closer to the diesel oil, and even when added in small amounts, biodiesel provides a reasonable improvement in the fuel lubricity. The aim of this current work is to evaluate the thermal stability and physicochemical properties of biodiesel obtained from seeds of cotton, sunflower and palm. In addition, the properties of its mixtures with diesel oil in a proportion of 10 mass% (B10) were evaluated. All samples were characterized by gas chromatography and thermogravimetry. The results of the physicochemical analysis of the vegetable oils, their respective biodiesel and the B10 blends were in accordance with the Brazilian Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biodiesel (ANP) specification, except for the acid value of palm biodiesel. The palm oil and the cotton biodiesel were the most stable ones. All the samples showed a single thermal event, except palm oil that had two events. The most stable B10 blends were those obtained from mixtures of sunflower and palm. Furthermore, the addition of 10 mass% of biodiesel in mineral diesel improves the viscosity, cetane number and flashpoint, besides decreasing the sulfur content. Concerning the thermal stability of vegetable oils, the palm oil was the most stable one. However, for thermal stability of biodiesel samples, the cotton biodiesel was the most stable due to a high percentage of polyunsaturated esters present in its composition. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The potential of two types of sludge obtained from the anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2/O) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) processes as lipid feedstock for biodiesel production via in situ transesterification was investigated. Experiments were conducted to determine the optimum conditions for biodiesel yield using three-factor and four-level orthogonal and single-factor tests. Several factors, namely, methanol-to-sludge mass ratio, acid concentration, and temperature, were examined. The optimum yield of biodiesel (16.6% with a fatty acid methyl ester purity of 96.7%) from A2/O sludge was obtained at a methanol-to-sludge mass ratio of 10:1, a temperature of 60 °C, and a H2SO4 concentration of 5% (v/v). Meanwhile, the optimum yield of biodiesel (4.2% with a fatty acid methyl ester purity of 92.7%) from MBR sludge was obtained at a methanol-to-sludge mass ratio of 8:1, a temperature of 50 °C, and a H2SO4 concentration of 5% (v/v). In this research, A2/O technology with a primary sedimentation tank is more favorable for obtaining energy from wastewater than MBR technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) have drawn great attentions because of its potential in energy conversion. However, designing of highly efficient EBFCs which can adapt to the anaerobic system is still a great challenge. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid enzymatic biofuel cell (HEBFC) which was fabricated by a glucose dehydrogenase modified bioanode and a solid-state silver oxide/silver (Ag2O/Ag) cathode. The as-assembled HEBFC exhibited an open circuit potential of 0.59V and a maximum power output of 0.281mWcm-2 at 0.34V in air saturated buffer. Especially, due to the introduction of Ag2O/Ag, our HEBFC could also operate under anaerobic condition, while the maximum power output would reach to 0.275mWcm-2 at 0.34V. Furthermore, our HEBFC had stable cycle operation and could keep high power output for a certain time as the result of the regeneration of Ag2O. Our work provides a new concept to develop EBFCs for efficient energy conversion in the future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The requirement for a miniature, high density, long life, and rechargeable power source is common to a vast majority of microsystems, including the implantable devices for medical applications. A model biofuel cell system operating in human serum has been studied for future applications of biomedical and implantable medical devices. Anodic and cathodic electrodes were made of carbon nanotube-buckypaper modified with PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase and laccase, respectively. Modified electrodes were characterized electrochemically and assembled in a biofuel cell setup. Power density of 16.12 μW cm -2 was achieved in human serum for lower than physiological glucose concentrations. Increasing the glucose concentration and biofuel cell temperature caused an increase in power output leading up to 49.16 μW cm -2 . © 2016 Güven, Sahin, Güven and Yu.

AB  - Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), the two typical biomass-derived furans, can be converted into biofuels and value-added chemicals via hydrogenation or acid catalysis or both. The potential competition between the hydrogenation and the catalyzed-conversion of HMF and furfural has been investigated with Pd/C and Amberlyst 70 as the catalysts at 170°C in various solvents. In water, the hydrogenation of HMF or the derivatives of HMF could take place, but the acid-catalyzed conversion of HMF to the diketones (2,5-hexanedione) was the dominant reaction pathway. On the contrary, with ethanol as the solvent, the full hydrogenation of HMF to 2,5-tetrahydrofurandimethanol was the dominant route, and the acid-catalyzed routes became insignificant. The efficiency for hydrogenation of HMF was much higher in ethanol than in water. As for furfural, its hydrogenation proceeded more efficiently in the polar solvents (i.e. ethanol, diethyl ether) than in non-polar solvents (i.e. toluene): a polar solvent tended to favor the hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural over that of the carbonyl group in the same furfural. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - The goal of this work was to develop a method for the direct power generation using macroalgae Enteromorpha prolifera. The process conditions for the saccharification of macroalgae were optimized and a type of alkaline fuel cell contained no precious metal catalysts was developed. Under optimum conditions (170 °C and 2% hydrochloric acid for 45 min), dilute acid hydrolysis of the homogenized plants yielded 272.25 g reducing sugar/kg dry algal biomass. The maximum power density reached 3.81 W/m2 under the condition of 3 M KOH and 18.15 g/L reducing sugar in hydrolysate, higher than any other reported algae-fed fuel cells. This study represents the first report on direct electricity generation from macroalgae using alkaline fuel cells, suggesting that there is great potential for the production of renewable energy using marine biomass. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Globally, tougher legislation in greenhouse gases emissions is prompting the hunt for more sustainable and competitive strategies to synthesize biodiesel. Although enzyme-catalyzed processes are considered as a more environmentally-friendly option, there are still challenges to be approached like the replacement of traditional solvents due to their well-known disadvantages such as their volatility, toxicity or carcinogenic character. Thus, the emergence of neoteric solvents such as perfluorocarbons, liquid polymers, ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents or supercritical fluids has opened up new opportunities to reach truly green processes. Nonetheless, literature analysis reveals the scarcity of research works, which are exclusively restricted to the last three types of solvents. One of the critical points to take into account refers to the performance of enzymes in this kind of milieu, as this environment may be deleterious in terms of protein structure, leading to enzyme deactivation. Therefore, the final purpose of this review paper is to identify the current trends of research in the field of neoteric solvents applied to enzyme-catalyzed synthesis of biodiesel and to shed light on the possible existing gaps. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents the thermodynamic analysis of thermally coupling steam and tri-reforming processes using a bio-oil aqueous fraction for hydrogen production. The total energy efficiency is investigated to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed system. It is found that the operating temperature, steam-to-bio-oil feed (S/F) ratio and split ratio of waste gas recovery have a positive effect on hydrogen yield; the optimal values are as follows: operating temperature of the steam reforming, 650 °C; tri-reforming operating temperature, 580 °C; S/F ratio, 6; and split ratio, 0.5. However, an increase in such parameters increases the energy requirement for the steam reformer. The new proposed system combining thermally coupled steam and tri-reforming processes with a membrane water gas shift reactor offers higher energy efficiency than a conventional steam reforming process. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This investigation highlights the feasibility of microemulsion based hybrid biofuel from waste cooking oil (WCO) as an alternative to petro diesel. In this study, microemulsification to produce biofuel has been demonstrated as energy intensive and economically viable alternative route of liquid biofuel production. The microemulsion based hybrid biofuel systems formulated using ethanol as dispersed phase exhibited fuel properties which satisfied ASTM D6751 standards for biodiesel. This study also emphasizes the preparation of simple biofuel system by microemulsification without using any externally added surfactant. These simple fuel systems formulated only by using butan-2-ol as cosurfactant showed excellent physical stability with the formation of transparent Winsor IV systems. The presence of nano-sized droplets in the formulations confirmed the formation of reverse micellar microemulsion system. Moreover, cold flow properties of the systems were much superior to that of biodiesel. The present investigation suggests that the microemulsion based biofuel systems formulated from WCO can be an attractive candidate for biofuel industry in near future. © 2015 Energy Institute

AB  - Oil from Virginia-type peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) was investigated as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. After harvest and peanut trituration, the oil was obtained by solvent extraction. The biodiesel production was carried out by chemical transesterification using bioethanol and potassium ethoxide as catalyst at 65 °C in a stirred glass reactor at 200 rpm during two hours. The formed biodiesel was purified to remove glycerol and other residuals and the reaction reached 100% conversion as verified by 1H NMR. The properties of peanut oil ethyl ester produced were characterized and found in agreement with the international ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 standards (specific gravity = 877.1 kg/m3, kinematic viscosity = 5.06 mm2/s, iodine value = 81.75 ± 0.03, cetane number = 58.9 ± 4.1, acid number = 0.21 mg KOH/g and oxidative stability = 4.54 h). These results suggest a good quality of produced biodiesel and thus, peanut oil can be considered as a feasible feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of bio-oil rich in methoxyaromatics during catalytic pyrolysis of Eucalyptus pulverulenta (EP) was studied using a fixed-bed reactor in the temperature range of 300–500 °C and the bio-oil composition was analyzed by using a GC–MS. The results showed that the highest bio-oil yield of 38.45 wt% was obtained at 400 °C in the presence of Na2CO3, and the concentration of methoxyaromatics reached the maximum value of 63.4%(area) in the bio-oil. The major methoxyaromatics identified in bio-oil were guaiacol, syringol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxy phenol, and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene. The analysis of gaseous products indicated that CO2 was the major gas at low-temperatures and concentrations of H2 and CH4 increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Na2CO3 promoted the formation of methoxyaromatics, while NaOH seems to have enhanced the formation of phenolics. The mechanism of the formation of methoxyaromatics during pyrolysis of EP was proposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein a new process is proposed to produce a syngas-rich gas fraction (&gt;80 vol% H2 + CO) from biowaste based on microwave heating within two differentiated steps in order to avoid tars production. The first step consists of the microwave pyrolysis of biowaste induced by a char-based susceptor at 400–800 °C; tars, char and syngas-rich gas fractions being produced. The tars are then fed into the second step where a portion of the char from the first step is used as a bed material in a 0.3:1 wt% ratio. This bed is heated up by microwaves up to 800 °C, allowing thermal cracking of tars and additional syngas (&gt;90 vol% H2 + CO) being then produced. This new concept arises as an alternative technology to the gasification of biowastes for producing syngas with no need for catalysts or gasifying reagents to minimise tars production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Continuous pyrolysis of corncob hydrolysis residue, coupled with ex situ catalytic upgrading of the pyrolysis vapor, was investigated in the combined system of an auger reactor and a downstream fixed-bed reactor. The effect of the zeolite catalyst, USY (ultrastable Y) and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25, 38) and catalytic temperature on the raw bio-oil upgrading were discussed. The results showed the strong acidity of porous zeolite was essential for catalytic deoxygenation during upgrading pyrolysis vapor. HZSM-5 (25), with the strong acidity and acidic sites, had favored the deoxygenation conversion of carbonyl/carboxyl-containing oxygenates in the pyrolysis vapor, which decreased its content to 2.3 area% via the GC-MS analysis of the upgraded bio-oil. Mono-phenols (phenol and alkylphenols) were enhanced to 53.2 area% over HZSM-5 (25), as compared with that of 17.3 area% during non-catalysis process. The addition of ex situ catalytic upgrading had improved the quality of organic bio-oil at the expense of its yield. Coke formation on the strong acidic sites by condensation of intermediates is detrimental to organic bio-oil yield. The increase of catalysis temperature at the fixed-bed reactor decreased oxygenate compounds to 7.1 area%, 2.3 area% and 1.9 area% at 450 °C, 550 °C and 650 °C, respectively, with 0.75 s of vapor residence time. The TG/DTG/DSC characterization of the used HZSM-5 (25) implied that the coke had deposited on the surface of HZSM-5 (25), which could be removed by combustion to recover its activity. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work describes an abiotic energy harvesting strategy from electrocatalytic glucose oxidation based on bimetallic FePt nanoparticles (NPs) with a unique onset oxidation potential of -0.63 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a maximum current density of 3.7 mA cm-2 at the physiological-like condition (pH 7.4). At first, the effect of Fe proportion and particle size on the electrocatalytic activity is investigated and it is found that the small size of Fe15Pt85 have the highest activity toward glucose oxidation. For the proposed abiotic system the cathode material is constructed from nitrogen doped graphene decorated with Pt NPs. The anode material is prepared via a simple one-step co-precipitation method and the cathode material was synthesized through a one-pot electrochemical synthesis route. The morphology, crystal structure and chemical composition of prepared nanostructure materials are characterized by various techniques. Based on the polarization profile and power density plot the designed glucose biofuel cell has an open-circuit potential of 0.64 V and provides a maximum power density of 95 μW cm-2 at a cell voltage of 0.44 V. Such abiotic glucose fuel cells have a great promise to be optimized, miniaturized to power bioimplantable devices without utilizing any complex system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Small scale biomass gasification is a sector with growth and increasing applications owing to the environmental goals of the European Union and the incentivised policies of most European countries. This study addresses two aspects, which are at the centre of attention concerning the operation and development of small scale gasifiers; reuse of waste and increase of energy efficiency. Several authors have denoted that the low electrical efficiency of these systems is the main barrier for further commercial development. In addition, gasification has several by-products that have no further use and are discarded as waste. In the framework of this manuscript, a secondary reactor is introduced and modelled. The main operating principle is the utilisation of char and flue gases for further energy production. These by-products are reformed into secondary producer gas by means of a secondary reactor. In addition, a set of heat exchangers capture the waste heat and optimise the process. This case study is modelled in a MATLAB-Cantera environment. The model is non-stoichiometric and applies the Gibbs minimisation principle. The simulations show that some of the thermal energy is depleted during the process owing to the preheating of flue gases. Nonetheless, the addition of a secondary reactor results in an increase of the electrical power production efficiency and the combined heat and power (CHP) efficiency. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Methyl or ethyl esters of long chain fatty acids are called biodiesel. Biodiesel is synthesized by the alcoholysis of oils/fats. In this work, lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus was precipitated over the clusters of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. This biocatalyst preparation was used for obtaining biodiesel from soybean oil. After optimization of both immobilization conditions and process parameters, complete conversion to biodiesel was obtained in 3 h and on lowering the enzyme amount, as little as 1.7 U of lipase gave 96% conversion in 7 h. The solvent free media with oil:ethanol (w/w) of 1:4 and 40 °C with 2% (w/w) water along with 20% (w/w) silica (for facilitating acyl migration) were employed for reaching this high % of conversion. The biocatalyst design enables one to use a rather small amount of lipase. This should help in switching over to a biobased production of biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, a bioanode was developed by using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of sulfonated graphene (SG)/ferritin (Frt)/glucose oxidase (GOx). The SG/Frt biocomposite was used as an electron transfer elevator and mediator, respectively. Glucose oxidase (GOx) from Aspergillus niger was applied as a glucose oxidation biocatalyst. The electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose using GOx modified electrode increases with an increase in the concentration of glucose in the range of 10-50 mM. The electrochemical measurements of the electrode was carried out by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different scan rates (20-100 mV s-1) in 30 mM of glucose solution prepared in 0.3 M potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). A saturation current density of 50 ± 2 mA cm-2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s-1 for the oxidation of 30 Mm glucose is achieved. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biodiesel has been attracting considerable attention as being a renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic fuel that can contribute to the solution of some energy issues as it presents potential to help mitigate climate change. The Life Cycle Assessment of biodiesel from soybean oil (transesterification double step process) was carried out herein. A pilot plant was considered, designed to produce 72 L of biodiesel in daily continuous flow, throughout a lifetime of 15 years (8000 annual hours). The materials and equipment utilized in the construction of the plant were considered as well as the energy and substances required for the production of biodiesel. Environmental impact assessment method IPCC 2013 GWP 100a was utilized within the SimaPro software to express the final result in kg CO2-equivalent. The results quantified the CO2 emissions associated with biodiesel production throughout the lifetime of the production plant (15 years), resulting in a total value of 1,441,426.05 kg CO2-eq. (96,095.07 kg CO2-eq. per year), which was equivalent to 4.01 kg CO2-eq. per liter of biodiesel produced. Decrease of environmental loads associated with the production of biodiesel could include improvements on the handling of biomass agriculture and on the technology production of biodiesel. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Superparamagnetic Fe3O4 sub-microspheres with diameters of approximately 200nm were prepared via a solvothermal method, and then modified with epoxychloropropane. Lipase was immobilized on the modified sub-microspheres. The immobilized lipase was used in the production of biodiesel fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from acidified waste cooking oil (AWCO). The effects of the reaction conditions on the biodiesel yield were investigated using a combination of response surface methodology and three-level/three-factor Box-Behnken design (BBD). The optimum synthetic conditions, which were identified using Ridge max analysis, were as follows: immobilized lipase:AWCO mass ratio 0.02:1, fatty acid:methanol molar ratio 1:1.10, hexane:AWCO ratio 1.33:1 (mL/g), and temperature 40°C. A 97.11% yield was obtained under these conditions. The BBD and experimental data showed that the immobilized lipase could generate biodiesel over a wide temperature range, from 0 to 40°C. Consistently high FAME yields, in excess of 80%, were obtained when the immobilized lipase was reused in six replicate trials at 10 and 20°C. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a conceptual design of optimal integrated processes for the production of dimethyl furfural (DMF) and furfural from biomass, switchgrass and algae. The processes consist of four stages: (1) biomass pretreatment into intermediates such as oil and glucose from algae and glucose and xylose from switchgrass; (2) dehydration of the sugars; (3) hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural purification; (4) synthesis of DMF out of HMF and fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) from oil in the case of using algae. We formulate mixed-integer nonlinear programming models so as to simultaneously optimize and heat integrate the processing of both raw materials. For switchgrass, the use of Ammonia Fiber Explosion (AFEX) pretreatment is recommended for a production of cost of DMF and furfural of $3/kg ($570 MM of fixed investment cost). For algae, the composition is 60% oil, 30% starch, and 10% protein to obtain 98 MMgal/yr of biofuels, 16% of DMF, at a cost of $1.98/gal ($693 MM of fixed investment). If the sugar concentration in the dehydration reactor increases from 10 to 30%, we can reduce the production costs by 25% and the investment costs up to 50%. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Birch wood was slowly pyrolyzed to produce bio-oil and biochar. Slow pyrolysis conditions including reaction temperature, residence time, and particle size of the feed were optimized to maximize bio-oil yield. Particle size had an insignificant effect, whereas yields of up to 56% were achieved using an optimized reaction temperature of 450 °C and a residence time of 2 h. Bio-oil was also produced from commercial Kraft lignin and was compared to the bio-oil obtained from birch wood. These bio-oils were characterized for elemental composition, phenolic compound identification using GC-MS, boiling point distribution using GC-FID, and molecular weight distribution using GPC. Simulated distillation indicated that a majority of the bio-oil compounds were found in the fraction between 200 and 300 °C, followed by fractions <200 °C and 300-400 °C. Phenolic fractions extracted from bio-oil using an alkali method were evaluated as antioxidant additives in soy biodiesel using Mihaljevic, Rancimat and PDSC test methods. The phenolic extract showed similar antioxidant activity as the commercial antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) typically used in biodiesel. These phenolic extracts were also evaluated as antioxidants in soybean oils for formulating biolubricants and exhibited improved oxidation stability similar to what was observed in soy biodiesel. It was found that many of the monomeric constituents of the phenolic mixture showed little or no antioxidant activity. However, a series of phenols present in the bio-oils exhibited molecular weights (MWs) of 302, 316, 330, and 344 corresponding to a group of dimers, which may be responsible for the observed antioxidant properties. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A highly efficient and versatile catalytic system for oxidation of primary and secondary aromatic alcohols to carbonyls has been developed. High efficiency, general synthetic applicability, broader functional group tolerance and versatility towards oxidation of both primary and secondary aromatic alcohols are the key features of this green and sustainable protocol. Selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to biofuel 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) has been observed in excellent yields. Use of sustainable bio-polymer cellulose as a Cu-nanoparticle support makes the catalytic system environmentally benign. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper discusses the determination of the optimal conditions for enzymatic transesterification of model waste oil (with 4% acid value) with butanol. It was found that biodiesel synthesis by the enzymatic transesterification of waste rapeseed oil rich in free fatty acid with butanol can be very effective if the catalysis is carried out in two steps. Both transesterification steps were catalysed by Lipozyme RM IM. The optimal conditions for the first step were determined: temperature of 39 °C, butanol and oil molar ratio of 4.5, lipase concentration of 6%, and reaction time of 9.8 h, with an expected yield of 60.1%. The removal of glycerol, enzyme renewal and subsequent addition of 7.8% lipase, with a 1.5 butanol and oil molar ratio and 8-h incubation at 39 °C predicted a 96.7% yield and resulted in a 96.6% butyl ester yield. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignin, an abundant terrestrial polymer, is the only large-volume renewable feedstock composed of an aromatic skeleton. Lignin has been used mostly as an energy source during paper production; however, recent interest in replacing fossil fuels with renewable resources has highlighted its potential value in providing aromatic chemicals. Highly selective degradation of lignin is pivotal for industrial production of paper, biofuels, chemicals, and materials. However, few studies have examined natural and synthetic molecular components recognizing the heterogeneous aromatic polymer. Here, we report the first identification of lignin-binding peptides possessing characteristic sequences using a phage display technique. The consensus sequence HFPSP was found in several lignin-binding peptides, and the outer amino acid sequence affected the binding affinity of the peptides. Substitution of phenylalanine7 with Ile in the lignin-binding peptide C416 (HFPSPIFQRHSH) decreased the affinity of the peptide for softwood lignin without changing its affinity for hardwood lignin, indicating that C416 recognised structural differences between the lignins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that this peptide adopted a highly flexible random coil structure, allowing key residues to be appropriately arranged in relation to the binding site in lignin. These results provide a useful platform for designing synthetic and biological catalysts selectively bind to lignin. © 2016, Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, mid-infrared spectroscopy and multivariate control charts based on the net analyte signal (NAS) were applied for quality control of B7 (7% biodiesel and 93% diesel) biodiesel/diesel blends of jatropha oil methyl esters (JOME) and crambe oil methyl esters (COME) relative to the biodiesel content. The construction of the multivariate control charts was based on the decomposition of the spectral signal of samples prepared within quality specifications. Three charts were generated: (i) a NAS chart to monitor the content of the biodiesel in the blend, (ii) an interference chart to monitor the diesel content, and (iii) a residual chart to monitor any systematic variations. For each chart developed, statistical limits were established using the same samples prepared under normal operating conditions, with biodiesel content between 6.5% and 7.5%, considering the range of ±0.5% (v/v) permitted by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels. To validate the control charts, new in-control and out-of-control samples relative to the biodiesel content were prepared. Of the two sets of out-of-control samples, the biodiesel content of one set (D) was below 6.5% (v/v) and the other set (E) was above 7.5%. The third set (C) of validation samples was prepared with biodiesel content within control of the quality specifications. The analytical methodology developed for each model (JOME and COME) was rapid, efficient, and able to correctly monitor the compliant and noncompliant samples relative to the biodiesel content in B7 biodiesel/diesel blends, demonstrating that this methodology is an alternative route to be used by the supervisory bodies for quality control of these types of biodiesel. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Annually, a great amount of waste fats and oils not suitable for human consumption or which cannot be further treated are produced around the world. A potential way of utilizing this low-cost feedstock is its conversion into biodiesel. The majority of biodiesel production processes today are based on the utilization of inorganic alkali catalysts. However, it has been proved that an organic base - tetramethylammonium hydroxide - can be used as a very efficient transesterification catalyst. Furthermore, it can be employed for the esterification of free fatty acids - reducing even high free fatty acid contents to the required level in just one step. The work presented herein, is focused on biodiesel production from waste frying oils and animal fats using tetramethylammonium hydroxide at the pilot-plant level. The results showed that the process performance in the pilot unit - using methanol and TMAH as a catalyst, is comparable to the laboratory procedure, even when the biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oils or animal fats with high free fatty acid content. The reaction conditions were set at: 1.5% w/w of TMAH, reaction temperature 65. °C, the feedstock to methanol molar ratio to 1:6, and the reaction time to 120. min. The conversion of triglycerides to FAME was approximately 98%. The cloud point of the biodiesel obtained from waste animal fat was also determined. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethylene is a petrochemical produced in large volumes worldwide. It serves as a building block for a wide variety of plastics, textiles, and chemicals, and can be converted into liquid transportation fuels. There is great interest in the development of technologies that produce ethylene from renewable resources, such as biologically derived CO2 and biomass. One of the metabolic pathways used by microbes to produce ethylene is via an ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE). By expressing a bacterial EFE gene in a cyanobacterium, ethylene has been produced through photosynthetic carbon fixation. Here, we present a conceptual design and techno-economic analysis of a process of biofuel production based on the upgradation of ethylene generated by the recombinant cyanobacterium. This analysis focuses on potential near-term to long-term cost projections for the integrated process of renewable fuels derived from ethylene. The cost projections are important in showing the potential of this technology and determining research thrusts needed to reach target goals. The base case for this analysis is a midterm projection using tubular photobioreactors for cyanobacterial growth and ethylene production, cryogenic distillation for ethylene separation and purification, a two-step Ziegler oligomerization process with subsequent hydrotreatment and upgradation for fuel production, and a wastewater treatment process that utilizes anaerobic digestion of cyanobacterial biomass. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) for the midterm projection is $15.07 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE). Near-term and long-term projections are $28.66 per GGE and $5.36 per GGE, respectively. Single- and multi-point sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine the relative effect that chosen variables could have on the overall costs. This analysis identifies several key variables for improving the overall process economics and outlines strategies to guide future research directions. The productivity of ethylene has the largest effect on cost and is calculated based on a number of variables that are incorporated into this cost model (i.e., quantum requirement, photon transmission efficiency, and the percent of energy going to either ethylene or cyanobacterial biomass production). © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - Conditions for the optimal production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by Pseudomonas mendocina PSU using a biodiesel liquid waste (BLW) were determined by response surface methodology. These were an initial carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of 40 (mole/mole), an initial pH of 7.0, and a temperature of 35 ° C. A biomass and PHA concentration of 3.65 g/L and about 2.6 g/L (77% DCW), respectively, were achieved in a growth associated process using 20 g/L glycerol in the BLW after 36 h of exponential growth. The PHA monomer compositions were 3HB (3-hydroxybutyrate), a short-chainlength-PHA, and the medium-chain-length-PHA e.g. 3-hydroxyoctanoate and 3-hydroxydecanoate. Both the phbC and phaC genes were characterized. The phbC enzyme had not been previously detected in a Pseudomonas mendocina species. A 2.15 g/L of an exopolysaccharide, alginate, was also produced with a similar composition to that of other Pseudomonas species. © 2016 Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a promising feedstock for biofuel production because Jatropha oil is highly suitable for the production of biodiesel and bio-jet fuels. However, Jatropha exhibits a low seed yield as a result of unreliable and poor flowering. APETALA1 (AP1) is a floral meristem and organ identity gene in higher plants. The flower meristem identity genes of Jatropha have not yet been identified or characterized. To better understand the genetic control of flowering in Jatropha, an AP1 homolog (JcAP1) was isolated from Jatropha. An amino acid sequence analysis of JcAP1 revealed a high similarity to the AP1 proteins of other perennial plants. JcAP1 was expressed in inflorescence buds, flower buds, sepals and petals. The highest expression level was observed during the early developmental stage of the flower buds. The overexpression of JcAP1 using the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter resulted in extremely early flowering and abnormal flowers in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Several flowering genes downstream of AP1 were up-regulated in the JcAP1-overexpressing transgenic plant lines. Furthermore, JcAP1 overexpression rescued the phenotype caused by the Arabidopsis AP1 loss-of-function mutant ap1-11. Therefore, JcAP1 is an ortholog of AtAP1, which plays a similar role in the regulation of flowering in Arabidopsis. However, the overexpression of JcAP1 in Jatropha using the same promoter resulted in little variation in the flowering time and floral organs, indicating that JcAP1 may be insufficient to regulate flowering by itself in Jatropha. This study helps to elucidate the function of JcAP1 and contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of flower development in Jatropha. © 2016 Tang et al.

AB  - The development of new energy sources has become particularly important from the perspective of energy security and environmental protection. Therefore, the utilization of waste resources such as industrial food wastes (IFWs) in energy production is expected. The central research institute of electric power industry (CRIEPI, Tokyo, Japan) has recently developed an energy-saving oil-extraction technique involving the use of liquefied dimethyl ether (DME), which is an environmentally friendly solvent. In this study, three common IFWs (spent coffee grounds, soybean, and rapeseed cakes) were evaluated with respect to oil yield for biodiesel fuel (BDF) production by the DME extraction method. The coffee grounds were found to contain 16.8% bio-oil, whereas the soybean and rapeseed cakes contained only approximately 0.97% and 2.6% bio-oil, respectively. The recovered oils were qualitatively analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The properties of fatty acid methyl esters derived from coffee oil, such as kinematic viscosity, pour point, and higher heating value (HHV), were also determined. Coffee grounds had the highest oil content and could be used as biofuel. In addition, the robust oil extraction capability of DME indicates that it may be a favourable alternative to conventional oil extraction solvents. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of eight types of green landscaping waste as feedstock to produce bio-oil through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The eight selected plants differed in terms of botanical classification, morphology, leaf state, and growth habit. Leaves and branches as waste from these plants were separately subjected to HTL in a high-pressure batch reactor at 300 °C for 0.5 h. Results indicated the bio-oils and biochars of leaves obviously differed from those of branches in terms of yields and higher heating values (HHVs). However, less difference in yields and HHVs was found for HTL products within the eight leaves even though they were different in composition components such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. The same was observed for branches. The average bio-oil yields of the leaves and branches were 33.74 and 43.22 wt%, respectively. The optimal bio-oil yield was 50.44 wt%, which was obtained when Cinnamomum camphora branches were used as feedstock. The average HHVs of light and heavy oils in the leaves were 25.13 and 31.27 MJ kg-1, respectively. These HHVs were higher than those of light and heavy oils in the branches (21.51 and 28.71 MJ kg-1, respectively). Among the oil products, the heavy oil derived from Salix alba leaves yielded the optimum HHV (35.63 MJ kg-1). The mean HHV of biochar was 24.17 MJ kg-1, which was considerably higher than that of feedstock (17.21 MJ kg-1). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry revealed the presence of value-added chemicals, such as phenolics, ketones, esters, acids, and alcohols, in bio-oils. The amounts of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes in the bio-oils derived from the leaves were higher than those in the bio-oils derived from the branches. These results indicated the feasibility of using different types of green landscaping waste as feedstock to produce bio-oils with high HHV and yield through HTL. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - The pyrolysis of soybean shell and the immediate catalytic upgrading of the bio-oil over an equilibrium FCC catalyst was studied in order to define its potential as a source for fuels and chemicals. The experiments of pyrolysis and immediate catalytic upgrading were performed at 550 °C during 7 min with different catalysts to oil relationships in an integrated fixed bed pyrolysis-conversion reactor. The results were compared under the same conditions against those from pine sawdust, which is a biomass source commonly used for the production of bio-oil. In the pyrolysis the pine sawdust produced more liquids (61.4%wt.) than the soybean shell (54.7%wt.). When the catalyst was presented, the yield of hydrocarbons increased, particularly in the case of soybean shell, which was four time higher than in the pyrolysis. The bio-oil from soybean shell produced less coke (between 3.1 and 4.3%wt.) in its immediate catalytic upgrading than that from pine sawdust (between 5 and 5.8%wt.), due to its lower content of phenolic and other high molecular weight compounds (three and five times less, respectively). Moreover, soybean shell showed a higher selectivity to hydrocarbons in the gasoline range, with more olefins and less aromatic than pine sawdust. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study provides first report on thermochemical conversion of residue from one of the underutilized crops, Bambara groundnut. Shells from two Bambara groundnut landraces KARO and EX-SOKOTO were used. Pyrolysis was conducted in a vertical fixed bed reactor at 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C; 50 °C/min heating rate and 5 L/min nitrogen flow rate. The report gives experimental results on characteristic of the feedstock, impact of temperature on the pyrolysis product distribution (bio-oil, bio-char and non-condensable gas). It evaluates the chemical and physicochemical properties of bio-oil, characteristics of bio-char and composition of the non-condensable gas using standard analytical techniques. KARO shell produced more bio-oil and was maximum at 600 °C (37.21 wt%) compared to EX-SOKOTO with the highest bio-oil yield of 32.79 wt% under the same condition. Two-phase bio-oil (organic and aqueous) was collected and analyzed. The organic phase from both feedstocks was made up of benzene derivatives which can be used as a precursor for quality biofuel production while the aqueous from KARO consisted sugars and other valuable chemicals compared to the aqueous phase from EX-SOKOTO which comprised of acids, ketones, aldehydes and phenols. Characteristics of bio-char and composition of the non-condensable were also determined. The results show that bio-char is rich in carbon and some minerals which can be utilized either as a solid fuel or source of bio-fertilizer. The non-condensable gas was made up of methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which can be recycled to the reactor as a carrier gas. This study demonstrated recovery of high quality fuel precursor and other valuable materials from Bambara groundnut shell. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The sustainable technologies to produce alternative energies as biofuel with focus on the harnessing of renewable sources and waste biomass is gradually gaining ground. Although the biodiesel is a very attractive biofuel its production from vegetable oils competes with the feed generation with the consequent socio-economic costs involved. Therefore, the reuse of waste oils appears as an alternative highly promising. However the high content of free fatty acid and water in this raw material difficult its use in the conventional processes employed in the actuality. In this work, we successfully develop hybrid catalysts based in Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase immobilized over Ca and Na modified mesoporous SBA-15 supports. The physic-chemical properties of the supports were determined by Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP) and N2 adsorption measurements. These hybrid catalysts were capable to process waste oils, and even, commercial ethanol (96%) obtained from a fermentative process An optimum activity, with around 90% of FAEE yield, was achieved with lipase immobilized on Ca modified SBA-15 using 4% of water respect to oil, 1:4 oil/ethanol ratio, 400 mg/g of enzyme immobilized, at 37 °C and 180 oscillations/min. This catalyst could contribute to development of a more environmentally and economically viable process to biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transition to renewable energies has mainly happened in the field of electric energy. In industrial processes only a negligible share of the energy consumption is supplied by renewable energies. To increase this share, several processes were proposed in the past. However, for a meaningful evaluation and optimization of such processes, no appropriate criterion exists. In particular, renewable energy is still the limited resource. To identify the best use of renewable energy, a new evaluation procedure for renewable industrial processes is proposed. The novel procedure is applied to the co-production of electricity and methanol from solar energy and natural gas. The SOLME process for solar methanol production is proposed, optimized and evaluated with the proposed criterion. The results indicate that the proposed SOLME process can make more efficient use of the solar energy than conventional solar power plants. Hence, the solar methanol production is promising to initiate a further penetration of solar energy into the chemical industry. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lime is pointed out as an effective catalyst for biodiesel production by oil methanolysis. Several Ca phases are formed during reaction. Each Ca phase has different contribution to the catalyzed process. Using CaO as a catalyst, S shape kinetics curve was observed and the induction period can be ascribed to the Ca(OH)2 formation. When Ca(OH)2, prepared by contacting CaO with H2O, is used as catalyst the initial period with a slow rate of transesterification has almost vanished. Besides, if the catalyst surface is totally converted into methoxide species the induction period is longer than the analogous obtained with CaO. This is an indication that the methoxide species strongly bonded to Ca are less reactive. The calcium diglyceroxide material (CaO_diglyc), prepared by contacting CaO with a mixture of methanol and glycerol, displays a totally different kinetics curve with no induction period. The faster kinetics and the Ca species detected in the glycerin phase seem to underline a non-negligible homogeneous process contribution. The characterization of the post-reaction catalysts underlines the relevance of the surface and bulk catalyst modifications. Calcium hydroxide can be pointed out as the active phase whereas calcium diglyceroxide is responsible for the catalyst deactivation due to calcium leaching. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this paper was to study the thermal degradation of soybean biodiesel attained by ethanolic route. The soybean biodiesel samples were subjected to heating treatment at 150 °C for 24 h in a closed oven under controlled atmosphere. During the experiments, samples were withdrawn at intervals of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 24 h for physicochemical and thermophysical properties analysis. The biodiesel degradation was validated by Thermogravimetric analysis since their profiles for control and treated biodiesel were different. Also, 1H NMR confirmed this result due to a significant reduction at the signals related to the 1H located near to the double bonds in the unsaturated ethyl esters in agreement with an iodine index reduction and viscosity increase observed during degradation. Nevertheless, degraded biodiesel, under study conditions, preserved its thermophysical properties. These results may be relevant to qualify the produced biodiesel quality and collect physicochemical and thermophysical data important for applications in combustion studies including project of fuel injection systems. © 2016

AB  - The purpose of this work is to investigate the overall performance of the iron-based chemical looping hydrogen (CLH) production from the heavy fraction of bio-oil (HFB). The multiple ASPEN models are employed to simulate a two-stage fluidized bed reduction reactor considering the thermodynamic equilibrium limit. Several important factors are discussed to determine the suitable reactor operation conditions for the process simulation of two operation modes. The results show HFB CLH process has a maximum hydrogen efficiency of 73.1% (LHV) and a total thermal efficiency of 59.2% (LHV) at the cost of decreasing the CO2 capture efficiency under the condition of supplementary firing. Within the complete self-sustaining operation range, the highest hydrogen thermal efficiency is 57.8% (LHV) corresponding to a total thermal efficiency of 58.3% (LHV) and a CO2 capture efficiency of nearly 100%. This study indicates the CLH process has significant advantages over the conventional coal gasification (CG) for hydrogen production owing to its high energy conversion efficiency and high-efficient CO2 capture with low cost. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the improvement in bio-oil stability via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) with noble metal catalysts. The bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis was subjected to the hydrodeoxygenative upgrading process with Pd/C, Ru/C, or Pt/C at 300 °C for 60 min with 3 MPa H2 pressure. Upgraded bio-oil (heavy oil) was stored in sealed glass bottles at 23 °C for 2, 4, 8, or 12 weeks. The major properties (water content, viscosity, and acidity) of heavy oils after storage and the chemical features (elemental composition and functional groups) of phenol polymers in the aged heavy oil were characterized. Most properties of the aged heavy oil were maintained at the initial levels during the storage period, which indicates that the oil properties were stabilized by HDO. The water content slightly increased from 0.3-2.1 wt% to 2.3-3.5 wt% during the storage, but the viscosity and acidity of the oil hardly changed. Chemical compositions of low-molecular weight compounds in the aged heavy oils were slightly modified during storage. A slight increase in molecular weight was also observed and was attributed to partial repolymerization of phenol polymers in the heavy oil during storage. Overall, this study suggests that HDO upgrading effectively improves the stability of bio-oil properties. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, conversion of soybean oil was carried out in a continuous pyrolysis system with feed injected through an atomizer. This allowed introduction of micron-sized droplets of oil that could be rapidly vaporized inside the reactor. With this novel design, we were able to achieve feed vapor residence times (τ) of 6–300 s without use of carrier gas, which would significantly reduce the overall cost of pyrolysis. Effects of reaction temperature (450 &lt; T &lt; 500 °C) and τ on conversion, product yields and composition were investigated. At the optimum experimental conditions of T = 500 °C and τ = 60 s, the yield of pyrolysis liquids was as high as 88% (relative to feed mass). Under these conditions, the identified products consisted of 38% hydrocarbons (22% C5[Formula presented]12 and 16% &gt; C12), 33% long-chain fatty acids (C16[Formula presented]18, but primarily oleic acid) and 15% short-chain fatty acids (C6[Formula presented]12). Upon distillation of the liquid products, the long-chain fatty acids were cleanly separated from the hydrocarbons. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of producing liquid products at high yields, including a wide range of fuels (gasoline, jet and diesel) and enriched oleic acid (for oleochemicals production), using our reactor design for pyrolytic conversion of vegetable oil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis was demonstrated to investigate the thermal decomposition characteristics and potential of lignin-rich cotton by-products cotton exocarp (CE) and spent mushroom substrate consisted of cotton by-products (MSC) for biorefineries. The chemical component and structure alteration of CE and MSC was found to affect their thermochemical behaviors. The bio-oil yield from CE was 58.13 wt% while the maximum yield from MSC was 45.01% at 600 °C. The phenolic compounds obtained from CE and MSC were 33.9% and 39.2%, respectively. The yield of acetic acid from MSC between 400 and 600 °C was about 30-38% lower than that from CE, which suggests the high quality of bio-oil was obtained. Biochar from MSC via slow pyrolysis had a high mass yield (44.38 wt%) with well-developed pore structure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current transition from petrochemical resources to biomass-derived platform molecules is in great demand for the development of synergies, scientific innovations and breakthroughs, and steep changes in the infrastructure of chemical industries. This article is focused on new opportunities for the production of biofuel additives from bioglycerol, which is obtained as waste and/or by-product from the current biodiesel industries. Here, we summarize the recent relevant processes for the production of biofuel additives from bioglycerol over various acid catalysts in two different pathways: (i) the esterification of bioglycerol with acetic acid, levulinic acid and other acids, and (ii) the acetalization of bioglycerol with acetone, furfural, benzaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds. It is evident that the synthesis of biofuel additives through esterfication and acetalization of bioglycerol is an important research area with imperative prospects for industrial applications. © 2015 Académie des sciences

AB  - Background: Solid acid catalyzed inexpensive ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment is promising because of its effectiveness at decreasing biomass recalcitrance to subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis or in situ hydrolysis of carbohydrate oligomers. However, the conventional strategy was limited by the complex non-isothermal process and considering only one aspect of sugar recovery. In this study, facile isothermal pretreatments using Amberlyst 35DRY catalyzed 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl) at mild conditions were developed on bioenergy crop Arundo donax Linn. to enhance the combined sugars released. The physicochemical differences, enzymatic digestibility, and sugars released in situ were evaluated and compared to define the best set of conditions. Results: The optimized isothermal pretreatment (110 °C, IL for 3 h, Amberlyst for 1 h) resulted in significant enhancement in combined sugars released (58.4 g/100 g raw materials), recovering 85.0 % of the total reducing glycan in the raw biomass. This remarkable improvement could be correlated to cellulose crystallinity reduction, crystalline conversion, and partial removal of the main chemical components caused by the pretreatment. Particularly, solubilization of hemicelluloses and partial depolymerization of cellulose contributed to the synergetic improvement of sugars production in enzymatic hydrolysis and in situ. Irrespective of the generous differences in mass recovery, the highest cellulose digestibility of 90.2 % and sugar released of 43.0 % (based on initial materials) in the pretreatment liquor were obtained. Interestingly, lignin (0.8-6.1 %) and sugars derived lactic acid (4.70-5.94 %) were produced without any notable deleterious effects. Conclusions: Isothermal [C4mim]Cl-Amberlyst pretreatment was a highly effective, simple, and convenient process that produced high yields of fermentable sugars from recalcitrant biomass by in situ hydrolysis of soluble biomass and enhancement of cellulose digestibility of the regenerated biomass. Relatively high amount of new revenues beyond sugars of this pretreatment could promote the commercial viability. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Rapeseed oil cakes are proteo-lignocellulosic residues obtained after oil extraction from rapeseed seed, featuring high protein, carbohydrates, phenolic compounds, and lignin contents. Most often used as an animal diet supplement, its fiber and phenolic part might be valorized for biofuels; biomolecules and biomaterial production proved its fractionation can be achieved without alteration of its nutritional qualities or generation of effluents and wastes. In this study, an innovative dry fractionation technology combining ultrafine milling (UFM) and electrostatic separation (tES) has been developed for rapeseed oil cake fractionation into protein- and lignin-rich fractions. The physical features as well as the biochemical composition of the produced fraction have been assessed herein. Thanks to UFM-tES technology, protein-rich fractions with 38.4% more proteins than in the initial material and lignocellulosic-rich fractions with 80.0% more fibers can be obtained without either external heating or using any additional solvent and catalysts. Boasting a low energy consumption, UFM-tES technology compared to conventional methods seems to be suitable for converting oil cakes biomass into ready-to-use fractions for feeding and fiber and phenolic to green platforms molecules and biomaterials © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We report a scalable method for recovery of cellular lipids and subsequent conversion to products. When in situ transesterification was performed at high solid loadings (&gt;20%(w/w)) by reacting microalgal biomass in acidified methanol (containing 5%(v/v) H2SO4), the released FAMEs were produced at sufficiently high concentrations such that their solubility limit in the reaction medium was exceeded. As a result, the FAMEs spontaneously formed a separate phase lighter than methanol that could be directly recovered without solvent extraction. Further, FAME production rates were easily predicted, even in concentrated biomass slurries, by models derived from fundamental reaction kinetics. Our results also suggest that un-reacted methanol and catalyst, when recovered, could be reused in subsequent reactions. Thus, this "one-pot" process represents a viable method for production of biodiesel from algal biomass since this approach (1) eliminates costs associated with co-solvent (e.g., hexane) use, recovery and storage, (2) is easily scalable by virtue of the reaction not being constrained by mass transport limitations, and (3) facilitates processing of concentrated biomass slurries that would reduce reactor volumes and minimize reactor and handling costs. © 2016 Z.

AB  - Biocrude produced from algae by hydrothermal liquefaction was treated with near- and supercritical ethanol and ethanol-water mixtures at 210-290 °C for 0.5-4 h. Longer reaction times and higher temperatures better promoted esterification reactions. Dilution of the ethanol with water led to lower yields of treated biocrude and reduced ester content. The viscosity of treated biocrude was an order of magnitude lower than that of the crude bio-oil, and the treated biocrude exhibited the characteristics of a Newtonian fluid. Overall, treatment of biocrude with near- and supercritical ethanol generated a treated bio-oil with lower viscosity, more ester content, and in nearly 100 wt% yield. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: β-Glucanase is one of the most extensively used biocatalysts in biofuel, food and animal feed industries. However, the poor thermostability and low catalytic efficiency of most reported β-glucanases limit their applications. Currently, two strategies are used to overcome these bottlenecks, i.e., mining for novel enzymes from extremophiles and engineering existing enzymes. Results: A novel endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase of GH16 (Tlglu16A) from the thermophilic fungus Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 was produced in Pichia pastoris and characterized. For potential industrial applications, recombinant TlGlu16A exhibits favorable enzymatic properties over most reported glucanases, i.e., remarkable stability over a wide pH range from 1.0 to 10.0 and superior activity on glucan substrates (up to 15,197 U/mg). The only weakness of TlGlu16A is the thermolability at 65 °C and higher. To improve the thermostability, the enzyme thermal stability system was then used to engineer TlGlu16A through optimization of residual charge-charge interactions. Eleven mutants were constructed and compared to the wild-type TlGlu16A. Four mutants, H58D, E134R, D235G and D296K, showed longer half-life time at 80 °C (31, 7, 25, 22 vs. 0.5 min), and two mutants, D235G and D296K, had greater specific activities (158.2 and 122.2 %, respectively) and catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m, 170 and 114 %, respectively). Conclusions: The engineered TlGlu16A has great application potentials from the perspectives of enzyme yield and properties. Its thermostability and activity were apparently improved in the engineered enzymes through charge optimization. This study spans the genetic, functional and structural fields, and provides a combination of gene mining and protein engineering approaches for the systematic improvement of enzyme performance. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - A solid super acid catalyst, S2O82 -/ZrO2, was prepared by a new synthesis route of one-pot method with ammonium persulfate via vapor phase hydrolysis to improve biodiesel production using expired soybean oil as reactant. Catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) to determine the optimum pretreatment conditions and understand the role of the active sites for transesterification. S2O82 -/ZrO2 calcined at 500 °C, which showed an amorphous phase by XRD characterization, was identified as composed of tetragonal phase ZrO2 microcrystallites by TEM examination. The microcrystallites which anchored more S2O82 - had abundant super acid and displayed high catalytic activity in the transesterification under mild reaction conditions. The reaction parameters over the catalyst were optimized and both the conversion of soybean oil and selectivity of biofuel reached 100% under the conditions of 110 °C of reaction temperature, 4 h of reaction time and 20:1 of methanol to oil molar ratio. Moreover, the catalyst showed high stability in the reactions and no sulfur leaching was found in the biodiesel products in cyclic utilization. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The issues of energy security, dwindling supply and inflating price of fossil fuel have shifted the global focus towards fuel of renewable origin. Biodiesel, having renewable origin, has exhibited great potential as substitute for fossil fuels. The most common route of biodiesel production is through transesterification of vegetable oil in presence of homogeneous acid or base or solid oxide catalyst. But, the economics of biodiesel is not competitive with respect to fossil fuel due to high cost of production. The vegetable oil waste is a potential alternative for biodiesel production, particularly when disposal of used vegetable oil has been restricted in several countries. The present study evaluates the efficacy of a low-cost solid oxide catalyst derived from eggshell (a food waste) in transesterification of vegetable oil and simulated waste vegetable oil (SWVO). The impact of thermal treatment of vegetable oil (to simulate frying operation) on transesterification using eggshell-derived solid oxide catalyst (ESSO catalyst) was also evaluated along with the effect of varying reaction parameters. The study reported that around 90 % biodiesel yield was obtained with vegetable oil at methanol/oil molar ratio of 18:1 in 3 h reaction time using 10 % ESSO catalyst. The biodiesel produced with ESSO catalyst from SWVO, thermally treated at 150 °C for 24 h, was found to conform with the biodiesel standard, but the yield was 5 % lower compared to that of the untreated oil. The utilization of waste vegetable oil along with waste eggshell as catalyst is significant for improving the overall economics of the biodiesel in the current market. The utilization of waste for societal benefit with the essence of sustainable development is the novelty of this work. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) or green diesel can be considered as a promising second-generation biofuel. Non-edible karanja oil (Pongamia pinnata) represents a candidate feedstock for HVO production. In the present work, karanja oil was hydrotreated at high temperatures (573-653 K) and high pressures (1.5-3.5 MPa) over sulfided CoMo and NiMo catalysts supported on Al2O3 in a fixed-bed reactor. A paraffin mixture (mainly C15-C18 n-paraffins) was produced from karanja oil, which is consistent with the effectiveness of Co/Ni and Mo for the hydroprocessing reactions. Smaller hydrocarbons (&lt;C15), water, propane, methane, and oxides of carbon were the byproducts of this process. The influence of the H2/oil ratio (400-600, v/v) and weight hourly space velocity (1.1-5 h-1) on the oil conversion and product yield was investigated. High temperature, pressure, and H2/oil ratio accelerated conversion. It was maximized (90.5%) at 653 K when the Ni-based catalyst was employed. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The general need to slow the depletion of fossil resources and reduce carbon footprints has led to tremendous effort being invested in creating "greener" industrial processes and developing alternative means to produce fuels and synthesize platform chemicals. This work aims to design a microwave-assisted cascade process for a full biomass valorisation cycle. GVL (γ-valerolactone), a renewable green solvent, has been used in aqueous acidic solution to achieve complete biomass lignin extraction. After lignin precipitation, the levulinic acid (LA)-rich organic fraction was hydrogenated, which regenerated the starting solvent for further biomass delignification. This process does not requires a purification step because GVL plays the dual role of solvent and product, while the reagent (LA) is a product of biomass delignification. In summary, this bio-refinery approach to lignin extraction is a cascade protocol in which the solvent loss is integrated into the conversion cycle, leading to simplified methods for biomass valorisation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In spite of the limited sources of fossil fuels, energy demand has been considerably increased since the last century. The problems associated with global warming due to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and scarcity of fossil fuels make it imperative to reduce our heavy dependency on fossil fuels. These reasons forced countries throughout the world to search for new fuel alternatives. Biofuel have gathered considerable attention due to their inherent benefits, like lower greenhouse gas emission, renewability, and sustainability. Commercially, biofuels are produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, and carbohydrates by using transesterification and fermentation. However, biofuel production suffers from high production costs and other technical barriers. Considering the environmental and economic issues, use of nanotechnology seems to be a viable solution. Nanoparticles have a number of interesting properties for the production of second-generation ethanol or transesterification of oils and fats to yield biodiesel. It is advantageous for recovery and reuse of catalysts. The present review discusses the role of nanotechnology in the production of bioethanol and biodiesel. Moreover, applications of nanoparticles for the production of biodiesel and second-generation ethanol with special reference to enzyme immobilization and chemical nano-catalysis have been described. © 2016 by De Gruyter.

AB  - This study presents a feasibility analysis of simultaneous bioethanol and xylitol production from lignocellulosic materials. In addition with the in situ power generation analysis employing the residual solids not converted in the process. This work is an extension of the Dynamic Lignocellulosic Bioethanol 1.0 modelling platform (Morales-Rodriguez et al., Bioresour Technol 2011; 102: 1174-84) in four process configurations that included operation in both continuous and continuous with recycling of unconverted materials. The benchmarking criteria employed was the potential profit of combined bioethanol and xylitol products. The best process configuration was simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation in continuous with recycling and continuous production of xylitol with 11.4% higher for combined production of bioethanol and xylitol compared with the selected base case (simultaneous saccharification and continuous co-fermentation). Besides, integrating the energy generation using the remaining solid materials and energy balance, allowed to determine that the energy necessary for the production process configurations could be generated with the residues from each configuration. The energy produced from solid material combustion was in the range of 1.9 and 2.2 times higher than the energy needed for each configuration. The potential depleted carbon dioxide from crude oil for energy production was up to 32,194 kg/h. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The facile preparation, aqueous stability, and hydrolysis characteristics of amorphous cellulose regenerated from cellulose solutions using amine/inorganic salt solvents was investigated. Highly crystalline cellulose was dissolved in a mixture of ethylenediamine and NaSCN, KSCN, or NaI at room temperature; subsequent addition of an excess of alcohol, acetone, or acetonitrile immediately precipitated the bulk cellulose in a completely amorphous state. Only a small amount of the amorphous cellulose crystallized during one month in 50°C water, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and cross-polarization magic angle spinning solid state 13C NMR analyses. The susceptibility of the amorphous cellulose to acid and enzymatic hydrolysis was remarkably enhanced compared with the original highly crystalline cellulose. This simple method for preparing the specific amorphous cellulose, coupled with the high susceptibility of the product cellulose to hydrolysis, suggests that this is a useful process for the production of biofuels and biochemicals from chemical pulp. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate the role of biomass heating time on bio-oil yield during fast pyrolysis in a free fall reactor. Biomass heating times were controlled using several configurations for conveying solids from the bottom of the free fall reactor. In all tests reactor wall temperature was 550 °C, sweep gas flowrate was 18 L/min, and heated reactor length was 2.77 m, which set the minimum biomass heating time of approximately 1.4 s (particles falling downward in sweep gas). Analysis of products included solid, liquid and gas mass yields; proximate analysis of the solids; and water-soluble sugar and carboxylic acid content of the liquid. These experiments showed that biomass continued to pyrolyze well beyond the few seconds frequently assumed to be adequate to achieve fast pyrolysis. Bio-oil yield increased with biomass heating times, even for times exceeding 40 s. Analysis of liquid products suggests that hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin all contributed toward the longer than expected pyrolysis times. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study employed a two-stage fluidized-bed gasifier as a gasification reactor and two additives (CaO and activated carbon) as the Stage-II bed material to investigate the effects of the operating temperature (700°C, 800°C, and 900°C) on the syngas composition, total gas yield, and gas-heating value during simulated waste gasification. The results showed that when the operating temperature increased from 700 to 900°C, the molar percentage of H2 in the syngas produced by the two-stage gasification process increased from 19.4 to 29.7mol% and that the total gas yield and gas-heating value also increased. When CaO was used as the additive, the molar percentage of CO2 in the syngas decreased, and the molar percentage of H2 increased. When activated carbon was used, the molar percentage of CH4 in the syngas increased, and the total gas yield and gas-heating value increased. Overall, CaO had better effects on the production of H2, whereas activated carbon clearly enhanced the total gas yield and gas-heating value. © 2015.

AB  - This paper presents the results of experimental and numerical research activities on a packed bed sensible thermal energy storage (TES) system. The TES consists of a cylindrical steel tank filled with small alumina beads and crossed by air used as the heat transfer fluid. Experimental tests were carried out while varying some operating parameters such as the mass flow rate, the inlet-outlet temperature thresholds and the aspect ratio (length over diameter). Numerical simulations were carried out using a one-dimensional model, specifically developed in the Matlab-Simulink environment and a 2D axisymmetric model based on the ANSYS-Fluent platform. Both models are based on a two-equation transient approach to calculate fluid and solid phase temperatures. Thermodynamic properties were considered to be temperature-dependent and, in the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, variable porosity of the bed in the radial direction, thermal losses and the effective conductivity of the alumina beads were also considered. The simulation results of both models were compared to the experimental ones, showing good agreement. The one-dimensional model has the advantage of predicting the axial temperature distribution with a very low computational cost, but it does not allow calculation of the correct energy stored when the temperature distribution is strongly influenced by the wall. To overcome this problem a 2D CFD model was used in this work. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Thermophilic enzymes have attracted much attention for their advantages of high reaction velocity, exceptional thermostability, and decreased risk of contamination. Exploring efficient thermophilic glycoside hydrolases will accelerate the industrialization of biofuels and biochemicals. Results: A multifunctional glycoside hydrolase (GH) CoGH1A, belonging to GH1 family with high activities of β-D-glucosidase, exoglucanase, β-D-xylosidase, β-D-galactosidase, and transgalactosylation, was cloned and expressed from the extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor owensensis. The enzyme exerts excellent thermostability by retaining 100 % activity after 12-h incubation at 75 ° C. The catalytic coefficients (kcat/Km) of the enzyme against pNP-β-D-galactopyranoside, pNP-β-D-glucopyranoside, pNP-β-D-cellobioside, pNP-β-D-xylopyranoside, and cellobiose were, respectively, 7450.0, 2467.5, 1085.4, 90.9, and 137.3 mM-1 s-1. When CoGH1A was supplemented at the dosage of 20 Ucellobiose g-1 biomass for hydrolysis of the pretreated corn stover, comparing with the control, the glucose and xylose yields were, respectively, increased 37.9 and 42.1 %, indicating that the enzyme contributed not only for glucose but also for xylose release. The efficiencies of lactose decomposition and synthesis of galactooligosaccharides (GalOS) by CoGH1A were investigated at low (40 g L-1) and high (500 g L-1) initial lactose concentrations. At low lactose concentration, the time for decomposition of 83 % lactose was 10 min, which is much shorter than the reported 2-10 h for reaching such a decomposition rate. At high lactose concentration, after 50-min catalysis, the GalOS concentration reached 221 g L-1 with a productivity of 265.2 g L-1 h-1. This productivity is at least 12-fold higher than those reported in literature. Conclusions: The multifunctional glycoside hydrolase CoGH1A has high capabilities in saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass, decomposition of lactose, and synthesis of galactooligosaccharides. It is a promising enzyme to be used for bioconversion of carbohydrates in industrial scale. In addition, the results of this study indicate that the extremely thermophilic bacteria are potential resources for screening highly efficient glycoside hydrolases for the production of biofuels and biochemicals. © 2016 Peng et al.

AB  - Biomass biorefining can improve the economy of biofuel production through synthesizing multiple value-added products and minimizing waste production. In this study, Eruca sativa was evaluated as a biorefining feedstock. High free fatty acid oil was first pretreated through an esterification process and then applied to an alkaline transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. The effects of the operating conditions were studied to maximize the biodiesel production yield. Sodium hydroxide pretreatment was employed to improve biogas and ethanol production from the plant residues. The pretreatment at 100 °C for 60 min represented the most promising potential for ethanol production, resulting in over 215% improvement in the yield. The pretreatment at 0 °C was more successful than the pretreatment at 100 °C for the biogas production; however, the results were not universal. Even though in the case of the straw, the pretreatment for 60 min increased the methane production by 233% compared to untreated straw, it showed a negative effect on the anaerobic digestion of the seed cake. At the best conditions, 1 kg of Eruca sativa yielded 140 g biodiesel, 16.8 g glycerol, 76.2 g ethanol from the pretreated straw, and 60.0 L (39.3 g) methane from the untreated seed cake. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - The development of novel methods to obtain biofuels and chemicals from biomass has been an immediate issue in both academic and industrial communities. The present work introduces a new route to synthesize 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) in a one-vessel system through a tandem pathway involving decrystallization, depolymerization and conversion of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in a molten hydrate solution. A 71.62 wt% ZnCl2 aqueous solution was employed as the reaction media and methylisobutylketone (MIBK) as the extracting solvent in the reaction system. A yield of 80.6 mol% of 5-HMF was obtained at 150 °C with a HCl concentration of 0.2 mol L-1 in the solution for 40 min. The aqueous phase can be reused without significant loss of catalytic activity. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Synthesized catalysts composed of hydrazine-bearing conducting polymer nanoparticles (poly[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-3′-yl hydrazine] (polyTHyd) and (poly[4-([2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophen]-3′-yl) phenyl) hydrazine] (polyTPHyd)) were prepared through self-assembling monomers on gold nanoparticles (monomers-AuNPs: Dia. 7.5 ± 2.0 nm). The monomers self-assembled on AuNPs were electrochemically polymerized to form conducting polymer nanoparticles, which possessed an enzyme-like catalytic activity for the reduction of H2O2. The polymer-assembled nanoparticles immobilized on microfluidic channel electrodes revealed well defined direct electron transfer (DET) processes, which were observed at +54.5/-20.9 and +64.8/+3.6 mV for polyTHyd and polyTPHyd. Glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were immobilized on the carboxylated polyterthiophene (poly[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-3′-(p-benzoic acid)])-assembled nanoparticle layer to use as counter electrodes in the cells. The performances of microfluidic biofuel cells composed of a GOx-modified anode and cathodes of HRP and hydrazine-bearing polymer-assembled nanoparticles were compared using standard glucose, urine, and whole blood samples as fuels. The cell operated with a 10.0 mM glucose solution generated a maximum electrical power density of 0.78 ± 0.034 mW cm-2 and an open-circuit voltage of 0.48 ± 0.035 V. The cell was also examined as a glucose-sensing device, which had a dynamic range of 10.0 μM to 5.0 mM with a detection limit of 2.5 ± 0.2 μM under alternating current potential modulation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - Trichosporon oleaginosus was grown in wastewater sludge to produce lipid. The obtained biomass was employed to study ultrasonication effect on lipid extraction and in-situ transesterification. Besides the most utilized solvents (the mixture of chloroform and methanol, 1:1 v/v), other solvents including water, hexane, and methanol were also studied to explore their capacities in lipid extraction with ultrasonication. The maximum lipid recovery was 11.8, 35.3, 62.0, and 95.3% (w/w) with water, hexane, methanol, and the mixture of chloroform and methanol (1:1 v/v), respectively within 20 min. Chloroform and methanol gave the best performance. However, due to the adverse environmental concern related to the utilization of chloroform, in-situ transesterification (single step lipid extraction and transesterification to obtain biodiesel) was investigated.In case of in-situ transesterification, biodiesel yield of 95% (w/w) was obtained in 60 min with the assistance of ultrasonication; whereas, 24 h was required to achieve similar yield without ultrasonication. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cellulose is the single largest component of lignocellulosic biomass and is an attractive feedstock for a wide variety of renewable platform chemicals and biofuels, providing an alternative to petrochemicals and petrofuels. This potential is currently limited by the existing methods of transforming this poorly soluble polymer into useful chemical building blocks, such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Ionic liquids have been used successfully to separate cellulose from the other components of lignocellulosic biomass and so the use of the same medium for the challenging transformation of cellulose into HMF would be highly attractive for the development of the biorefinery concept. In this report, ionic liquids based on 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cations [C4C1im]+ with Lewis basic (X = Cl-) and Brønsted acidic (X = HSO4 -) anions were used to investigate the direct catalytic transformation of cellulose to HMF. Variables probed included the composition of the ionic liquid medium, the metal catalyst, and the reaction conditions (temperature, substrate concentration). Lowering the cellulose loading and optimising the temperature achieved a 58% HMF yield after only one hour at 150 °C using a 7 mol % loading of the CrCl3 catalyst. This compares favourably with current literature procedures requiring much longer reactions times or approaches that are difficult to scale such as microwave irradiation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Cellulase bound magnetic nanoparticles was used as nanobiocatalyst for the hydrolysis of Sesbania aculeate biomass in the present study. The characteristic peak at 1624 cm−1 in FT-IR spectrum confirmed the presence of cellulase on MNP. The particle size of the nanobiocatalyst was found in the range of 90–100 nm and it was structurally found to be cubic in nature. The paramagnetic behavior of nanobiocatalyst was confirmed by VSM analysis. The optimal parameters are 1.5% (w/v) of nanobiocatalyst concentration, biomass concentration of 4% (w/v) and temperature at 30 °C. The maximum bioethanol yield of 5.31 g/l was obtained using Sesbania aculeate biomass hydrolysate under optimal conditions. The produced bioethanol was confirmed by GC-MS analysis. Reusability study was analyzed and proved that the nanobiocatalyst was efficient for the feasible production of bioethanol. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Date pits are considered one of the major agricultural wastes in Oman. The present work involves the synthesis of active catalysts from waste date pits carbon produced by carbonization and impregnation with Pt and Pd metals. Synthesized catalysts Pt/C and Pd/C were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, BET and XPS. The activity of the catalysts’ performance was evaluated by the hydrodeoxygenation of date pits oil for the production of second-generation biofuels, which includes jet fuel and green diesel fractions. Results indicate that the synthesized catalysts were highly active for the hydrodeoxygenation of date pits oil. Based on the elemental analysis, the degree of deoxygenation (DOD) of product oil was 97.5% and 89.4% for the Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts respectively. The high DOD was also confirmed by product analyses that mainly consist of paraffinic hydrocarbons. Results also showed that between the two catalysts, Pd/C showed a higher activity towards hydrodeoxygenation, a conclusion that was based on the high DOD of the product oil due to hydrocarbons formation. Based on the type of components in the product oil, the maximum fraction of hydrocarbons formed lay within the range of 72.03% and 72.78% green diesel, and 30.39% and 28.25% jet fuel using Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts respectively. It can be concluded that waste date pits can be a promising platform for the production of catalysts and biofuels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable source with great potential for biofuels and bioproducts. However, the cost of cellulolytic enzymes limits the utilization of the low-cost bioresource. This study aimed to develop a consolidated bioprocessing without the need of supplementary cellulase for butyric acid production from lignocellulosic biomass. A stirred-tank reactor with a working volume of 21 L was constructed and operated in batch and semi-continuous fermentation modes with a cellulolytic butyrate-producing microbial community. The semi-continuous fermentation with intermittent discharging of the culture broth and replenishment with fresh medium achieved the highest butyric acid productivity of 2.69 g/(L· d). In semi-continuous operation mode, the butyric acid and total carboxylic acid concentrations of 16.2 and 28.9 g/L, respectively, were achieved. Over the 21-day fermentation period, their cumulative yields reached 1189 and 2048 g, respectively, corresponding to 41 and 74% of the maximum theoretical yields based on the amount of NaOH pretreated rice straw fed in. This study demonstrated that an undefined mixed culture-based consolidated bioprocessing for butyric acid production can completely eliminate the cost of supplementary cellulolytic enzymes. © 2016 Ai, Chi, Meng, Sheng, Zheng, Zheng and Li.

AB  - A new enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) adopting multiple glucose oxidase (GOx) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) immobilized on carbon nanotube (CNT) ([GOx/PDDA]n/CNT) is fabricated and effects of [GOx/PDDA]n/CNT catalysts on EBC performance are investigated using various electrochemical characterizations. Initially, both redox reaction of flavin adenine dinucleotides (FADs) within GOx and stepwise deposition of PDDA and GOx on CNT are estimated to determine optimal [GOx/PDDA]n/CNT catalyst. Also, its electron transfer pathway and reaction mechanism related to oxygen mediator is elucidated. With the optimized [GOx/PDDA]5/CNT catalyst, excellent catalytic activity and EBC performance are measured. When the catalyst is used, its electron transfer rate constant is 15.97 s−1, glucose sensitivity is 17 μA mM−1 cm−2, Michaelis–Menten constant is 1.44 mM and EBC maximum power density (MPD) is 0.79 mW cm−2. It indicates that the values are better than those of other similar structures. Moreover, in a comparison with MPDs of EBCs without provision of glucose, it is proved that PDDA and GOx make key role in improving EBC performance. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - By starting first at the laboratory scale, optimal operating conditions for the reaction unit aimed at producing ethyl biodiesels from non-edible vegetable oils (NEVO) were determined with the ultimate objective of proposing an on-farm processing technology that should be sustainable for emerging countries. Three NEVO widely available in Burkina Faso were selected: Balanites aegyptiaca (BA), Azadirachta indica (AI), and Jatropha curcas (JC) oils. Their conversion to fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) was conducted via a two-stage procedure under atmospheric pressure: an alkali-catalyzed ethanolysis at ambient temperature for the BA and AI oils (leading to 93 and 87 wt.% FAEE respectively) and an acid-catalyzed ethanolysis at the normal boiling of the alcohol for the JC oil (leading to 89 wt.% FAEE). Based on the intermediate addition of glycerol at ambient temperature, the two-stage procedure combines chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, and phase equilibrium phenomena. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of upgraded bio-oils by an integrated process using a mixture of calcined limestone and sand as a heat carrier with catalytic properties was experimentally studied at pilot scale. The integrated process consisted of two main steps: biomass catalytic pyrolysis in an Auger reactor for bio-oil production and char combustion in a fluidised-bed combustor for heat carrier heating and regeneration. A temperature of 450 °C was fixed as an optimum value to carry out the catalytic pyrolysis step. Temperatures ranging from 700 to 800 °C were assessed in the char combustor. Process simulation demonstrated that solid recirculation from the combustor to the pyrolysis reactor was marginally affected in this temperature range. However, an optimum char combustion temperature of 800 °C was selected from an environmental point of view, since lower polyaromatic emissions were detected whilst NOx emissions were kept under the legislation limits. Under designated conditions, several pyrolysis-combustion cycles were carried out. A moderate deactivation of the catalyst by partial carbonation was found. This fact makes necessary the incorporation of a purge and an inlet of fresh heat carrier in order to maintain the bio-oil quality in the integrated process.

AB  - Amino group-functionalized, ordered mesoporous polymers (OMP-NH2) were prepared using a solvent-free synthesis by grinding mixtures of solid raw precursors (aminophenol, terephthaldehyde), using block copolymer templates, and curing at 140–180 °C. OMP-NH2 was functionalized with acidic sites and incorporated with palladium, giving multifunctional solid catalysts with large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas, abundant and ordered mesopores, good thermal stabilities, controllable concentrations, and good dispersion of active centers. The resultant solid catalysts showed excellent catalytic activities and good reusability in biomass conversions and cross-coupling reactions—much superior to those of various reported solid catalysts such as Amberlyst 15, SBA-15-SO3H, and Pd/C and comparable to those of homogeneous catalysts such as heteropoly acid, HCl, and palladium acetate. A facile green approach was developed for the synthesis of ordered mesoporous polymeric solid catalysts with excellent activities for conversion of low-cost feedstocks into useful chemicals and clean biofuels. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biodiesel can be used as an alternative fuel in diesel engines due to environmental and energy concerns. Considering the existing resources in Iran, interests on expansion of biodiesel production and application have been sped up by the Iranian government. So, in this study the effect of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and diesel fuel blends (B0, B20, B50, B80 and B100) on the performance characteristics (brake power, brake torque, BSFC and brake thermal efficiency) of a diesel power generator model CAT3412 was investigated. The experiments were conducted at rated engine speed 1530 r/min and various engine loads (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). The results of the study showed an increase in brake power, brake torque and brake thermal efficiency and a reduction trend in brake-specific fuel consumption at higher engine loads for all the biodiesel-diesel blends. In addition, the research results indicated that B20 and B50 fuel blends in terms of performance characteristics could be recognised as the potential candidates to be certificated for usage in the diesel power generator. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - In this investigation, oil extraction was performed in marine macroalgae Gracilaria edulis, Enteromorpha compressa and Ulva lactuca. The algal biomass was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Fourier Transform-Infra Red Spectroscopy. Six different pre-treatment methods were carried out to evaluate the best method for maximum oil extraction. Optimization of extraction parameters were performed and high oil yield was obtained at temperature 55 °C, time 150 min, particle size 0.10 mm, solvent-to-solid ratio 6:1 and agitation rate 500 rpm. After optimization, 9.5%, 12.18% and 10.50 (g/g) of oil extraction yield was achieved from the respective algal biomass. The rate constant for extraction was obtained as first order kinetics, by differential method. Stable intracellular Cal A and Cal B lipase producing recombinant Pichia pastoris was constructed and used as biocatalyst for biodiesel production. Comparative analysis of lipase activity and biodiesel yield was made with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymatic delignification is seen as a green step in biofuels production owing to its specificity towards lignin and its proper understanding requires a kinetic study to decipher intricate details of the process such as thermodynamic parameters viz., activation energy, entropy change and enthalpy change. A system of two coupled kinetic models has been constructed to model laccase mediated delignification of Lantana camara. From the simulated output, activation energy was predicted to be 45.56 and 56.06 kJ/mol, entropy change was observed to be 1.08 × 102 and 1.05 × 102 cal/mol-K and enthalpy change was determined to be 3.33 × 104 and 3.20 × 104 cal/mol, respectively from Tessier's and Michaelis Menten model. While comparing the prediction efficiency, it was noticed that Tessier's model gave better performance. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted and it was observed that the model was most sensitive towards temperature dependent kinetic constants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We developed a strategy for the catalytic production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels (butene oligomers) from cellulose and hemicellulose, which are the major fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. In this strategy the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions are separated through a pretreatment step and then converted to levulinic acid (LA) by monophasic and biphasic reactions using 2-sec-butylphenol (SBP) solvent respectively. The LA is upgraded catalytically to γ-valerolactone (GVL), and subsequently to butene oligomers. To design the integrated strategy, we developed separation subsystems to satisfy the optimized feed concentration for catalytic conversions and to recycle solvents (SBP). To satisfy energy requirements for our process from combustion of biomass residues, we designed a heat exchanger network (HEN) for minimum energy consumption by maximizing heat recovery from the process streams. Our technoeconomic evaluation shows that the integrated strategy using corn stover feedstock results in a minimum selling price of $3.71 per gallon of gasoline equivalent for butene oligomers if using the best possible parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hyper thermal (HT) acid hydrolysis of Kappaphycus alvarezii, a red seaweed, was optimized to 12% (w/v) seaweed slurry content, 180 mM H2SO4 at 140 °C for 5 min. The maximum monosaccharide concentration of 38.3 g/L and 66.7% conversion from total fermentable monosaccharides of 57.6 g/L with 120 g dw/L K. alvarezii slurry were obtained from HT acid hydrolysis and enzymatic saccharification. HT acid hydrolysis at a severity factor of 0.78 efficiently converted the carbohydrates of seaweed to monosaccharides and produced a low concentration of inhibitory compounds. The levels of ethanol production by separate hydrolysis and fermentation with non-adapted and adapted Kluyveromyces marxianus to high concentration of galactose were 6.1 g/L with ethanol yield (YEtOH) of 0.19 at 84 h and 16.0 g/L with YEtOH of 0.42 at 72 h, respectively. Development of the HT acid hydrolysis process and adapted yeast could enhance the overall ethanol fermentation yields of K. alvarezii seaweed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we propose and apply a hierarchical approach for an efficient exploitation of fundamental multi-scale modeling for the analysis and design of the kinetic-transport interactions in chemical reactors. In essence, detailed and computationally demanding analyses - based on computational fluid dynamics simulations (CFD) of the reactor - are first used to study in detail a selected and limited number of conditions. Then, the CFD results are interpreted by means of 1D heterogeneous models for the derivation of lumped parameters to be used in classical reactor models. On one side, this approach limits the use of computationally demanding simulations. On the other side, it allows for the rational derivation of parameters, which are related to a detailed and sound description of the governing phenomena. The very good agreement between the predictions of CFD and 1D heterogeneous models at different operating conditions shows that the CFD-based correlation for transport properties fully retains all the main features of the detailed CFD simulation. Moreover, we found that the hierarchical derived correlations to be very similar to the ones experimentally obtained for typical industrial scale packed bed reactors, thus confirming that the conventional correlations may be reliably used in micro-packed bed reactors. On a more general basis, this work clearly demonstrates the potentiality of the hierarchical application of CFD simulation for the derivation of transport parameters in reactor engineering, which can be used for the efficient and fundamental analysis and design of novel reactor technologies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traditional strategies to develop Au metal nanoparticle catalysts for glucose oxidation comprise Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on electrode surfaces. In this work, the fabrication of a new material capable of acting as an abiotic anode for the electrooxidation of glucose was developed. The material is composed of electrospun carbon fibers containing gold nanoparticles formed insitu from a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution with HAuCl4. This approach allows the pre-reduction of the gold salt by PAN under mild conditions without the need for extra energy and leads to very stable carbon-gold bonding with well-dispersed AuNPs, not previously reported. The gold-modified carbon fibers (Au@CFs) were characterized by SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, XRD, and electrochemical analysis. The Au@CF electrodes showed electrochemical activity toward glucose oxidation in alkaline media. Combined to a bilirubin oxidase modified biocathode (BOD@CFs), the resulting hybrid glucose biofuel cell showed open-circuit voltage and power density values of 0.75V and 65μWcm-2, respectively, which remained intact after 3weeks. Fueling the future: A new strategy is used to prepare Au metal nanoparticle catalysts incorporated insitu in electrospun carbon nanofibers for the electrooxidation of glucose in hybrid glucose biofuel cells (h-GBFCs). Substantial long-term stability of the h-GBFCs is highlighted (MWNTs=multiwall nanotubes, BOD=bilirubin oxidase, CF=carbon fibers). © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - A new pathway to upgrade directly the biocrude derived from Nannochloropsis oceanica hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to kerosene-range biofuel was conducted without using a solvent. The influential factors including the catalyst/biocrude ratio (wt/wt%) and temperature were investigated to improve the biofuel's yield, physical properties and component characteristics. The biofuel was characterized at 44.5 MJ kg-1 higher heating value (HHV) with 1.95% N and 0.72% O by two-stage hydrotreated upgrading. The carbon distribution was analyzed and the transfer of components and elements were discussed for a better understanding of the mechanism of the upgrading process. The results of component analyses suggested that the heteroatoms in phenols, pyrroles and indoles were difficult to remove. In order to obtain a further reduction of oxygen and nitrogen contents, they need a specific upgrading. Higher reaction temperature had a facilitative effect on the generation of aromatic hydrocarbons. The two-stage upgrading also improved the aromatic hydrocarbon contents from 9.64% (stage-1) to 17.38% (stage-2). In addition, the content of kerosene-range biofuel with carbon numbers from 8 to 16 was 65.53% in stage-1 upgrading biofuel and 79.02% in stage-2 upgrading biofuel. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Scum is an oily waste stream of the wastewater treatment process that can be used to produce biodiesel. Combining acid hydrolysis and solvent extraction, a free fatty acid and acyl-glycerol rich product was produced. Free fatty acids (FFAs) present were converted to acyl-glycols via a high temperature (238°C) glycerin esterification process known as glycerolysis. The inorganic catalysts zinc aluminum oxide and sodium sulfate were tested during glycerolysis to compare the reaction kinetics of converting FFA to acyl-glycerols. It was concluded that the zinc-based catalyst increased the reaction rate significantly, from a "k" value of 2.57 (uncatalyzed) to 5.63, completing the reaction in 60min, half the time it took the uncatalyzed reaction (120min). Sodium sulfate's presence however slowed the reaction, resulting in a "k" value of 1.45, completing the reaction in 180min. Use of the external catalyst Zn-Al2O3 showed the greatest catalytic potential, but also assumes additional costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work addresses the preparation, characterisation and screening of different Ni-Co catalysts supported on carbon nanofibres (CNFs) for use in the upgrading of bio-oil in supercritical water. The aim is to improve the physicochemical properties of bio-oil so that it can be used as a fuel. The CNFs were firstly oxidised in HNO3 and afterwards subjected to a thermal treatment to selectively modify their surface chemistry prior to the incorporation of the metal active phase (Ni-Co). The CNFs and the supported catalysts were thoroughly characterised by several techniques, which allowed a relationship to be established between the catalyst properties and the upgrading results. The use of Ni-Co/CNFs for bio-oil upgrading in supercritical water (SCW) significantly improved the properties of the original feedstock. In addition, the thermal treatment to which the fibres were subjected exerted a significant influence on their catalytic properties. An increase in the severity of the thermal treatment led to a substantial reduction in the oxygen content of the CNFs, mainly due to the removal of the less stable oxygen surface groups, which allowed their surface polarity to decrease. This decrease resulted in less formation of solid products. However, it also reduced the H/C and increased the O/C ratios of the upgraded liquid. Therefore, a compromise between the yield and the properties of the upgraded bio-oil was achieved with a Ni-Co supported on a CNF with a moderate amount of oxygen surface groups. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigates the year-round production potential and quality of biodiesel from wastewater treatment high rate algal pond (WWT HRAP) biomass and how it is affected by CO2 addition to the culture. The mean monthly pond biomass and lipid productivities varied between 2.0 ± 0.3 and 11.1 ± 2.5 g VSS/m2/d, and between 0.5 ± 0.1 and 2.6 ± 1.1 g/m2/d, respectively. The biomass fatty acid methyl esters were highly complex which led to produce low-quality biodiesel so that it cannot be used directly as a transportation fuel. Overall, 0.9 ± 0.1 g/m2/d (3.2 ± 0.5 ton/ha/year) low-quality biodiesel could be produced from WWT HRAP biomass which could be further increased to 1.1 ± 0.1 g/m2/d (4.0 ton/ha/year) by lowering culture pH to 6–7 during warm summer months. CO2 addition, had little effect on both the biomass lipid content and profile and consequently did not change the quality of biodiesel. © 2016

AB  - To ensure the sustainable production and consumption of biofuels, an increasing body of scientific literature has become available in recent years focusing on the environmental impacts of biofuels. Whilst the climate change mitigation is perhaps the primary driver behind the promotion of biofuels, climate change is not the only crucial impact associated with biofuel production and consumption systems. This study aims at analysing the extent of the dominant focus on climate impacts in Swedish research applying environmental systems analysis (ESA) tools to investigate the environmental impacts of biofuels, and why this may exist. A systematic literature review of Swedish research applying ESA tools in the study of transportation biofuels between 2000 and 2015 was conducted; identifying 64 studies. The results indicate that studies using life cycle assessment include a range of impact categories in addition to climate impacts, e.g. acidification and eutrophication. However, when also considering environmental footprints (i.e., carbon and water footprints) and material flow analyses, the dominance of carbon footprints leads to an overly dominant focus on climate impacts at the expense of other impact categories. The consideration of environmental impacts other than those related to climate impacts is discussed in terms of the influence of the dominant science-policy framework in Sweden and study dependent variables, such as data uncertainty and methodological limitations. Whilst biofuel production is inextricably linked to climate policy, the environmental impacts of Swedish biofuel production and consumption should also consider the broader context of the Swedish National Environmental Objectives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-situ production of fatty acid methyl esters from swine fat via thermally induced pseudo-catalytic transesterification on silica was investigated in this study. Instead of methanol, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was used as acyl acceptor to achieve environmental benefits and economic viability. Thermo-gravimetric analysis of swine fat reveals that swine fat contains 19.57 wt.% of water and impurities. Moreover, the fatty acid profiles obtained under various conditions (extracted swine oil + methanol + NaOH, extracted swine oil + DMC + pseudo-catalytic, and swine fat + DMC + pseudo-catalytic) were compared. These profiles were identical, showing that the introduced in-situ transesterification is technically feasible. This also suggests that in-situ pseudo-catalytic transesterification has a high tolerance against impurities. This study also shows that FAME yield via in-situ pseudo-catalytic transesterification of swine fat reached up to 97.2% at 380 °C. Therefore, in-situ pseudo-catalytic transesterification can be applicable to biodiesel production of other oil-bearing biomass feedstocks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, palm residues were pyrolyzed in a bench-scale (3 kg/h) fast pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor and bio-oil separation system for the production of bio-oil rich in acetic acid and phenol. Pyrolysis experiments were performed to investigate the effects of reaction temperature and the types and amounts of activated carbon on the bio-oil composition. The maximum bio-oil yield obtained was approximately 47 wt% at a reaction temperature of 515 °C. The main compounds produced from the bio-oils were acetic acid, hydroxyacetone, phenol, and phenolic compounds such as cresol, xylenol, and pyrocatechol. When coal-derived activated carbon was applied, the acetic acid and phenol yields in the bio-oils reached 21 and 19 wt%, respectively. Finally, bio-oils rich in acetic acid and phenol could be produced separately by using an in situ bio-oil separation system and activated carbon as an additive. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper describes the conversion of bio-oil into bio-carbon by using slow pyrolysis. The effects of two different temperatures (600 °C and 900 °C) and residence times (30 min and 60 min) on the morphology, elemental composition, thermal stability, functionality, as well as the thermal and electrical conductivity of the produced bio-carbon were investigated. Overall, it was found that differences in the residence time at the same temperature have no relevant effects on the elemental composition of the samples. Temperatures of pyrolysis of 900 °C were found to have a direct impact in the morphology of the synthesized bio-carbon. In general, X-ray diffraction showed the presence of amorphous carbon combined with hexagonal graphitic planes (002). However, it was found that the d-spacing between adjacent graphitic planes is reduced at higher temperatures of pyrolysis. The elemental and spectroscopic assessment also indicated that pyrolysis at 900 °C leads to a higher reduction of oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) compared to samples processed at 600 °C resulting in more pure forms of bio-carbon and a better thermal stability. A tendency of the electrical conductivity to decrease and the thermal conductivity to increase was found with the increase in the temperature of pyrolysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To synthesize the still missing C11 furoins as potential trifunctional difuranic building blocks for biopolymers and biofuels, the route based on the cross-coupling of two biofuraldehydes, furfural (FF) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), has been investigated using organic N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts. This NHC-catalyzed coupling reaction in solution gives a statistical mixture of products including homocoupled C10 and C12 furoins 1 and 4, as well as cross-coupled C11 furoins 2 and 3, regardless of the electronics or sterics of the NHC precatalyst used, but a slight preference for cross-coupled products (∼60% 2 + 3 combined) under neat conditions has been achieved. Cross-coupled products 2 and 3 have been isolated in 48.1% yield and further separated into their pure state in 22.2% and 19.9% yield for 2 and 3, respectively. The isolated 2 and 3 have been fully characterized by NMR, HRMS, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. A simple metal-free/in-air oxidation reaction converts these two isomeric furoins into the single α-diketone furanil structure 5, another new C11 bioderived building block. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The valorization of Rhizoclonium sp. algae through pyrolysis for obtaining bio-oils is studied in this work. The reaction is carried out at 400 °C, at high contact time. The bio-oil has a practical yield of 35% and is rich in phytol. Besides, it is simpler than the corresponding to lignocellulosic biomass due to the absence of phenolic compounds. This property leads to a bio-oil relatively stable to storage. In addition, heterogeneous catalysts (Al-Fe/MCM-41, SBA-15 and Cu/SBA-15), in contact with algae during pyrolysis, are analyzed. The general trend is that the catalysts decrease the concentration of fatty alcohols and other high molecular weight products, since their mild acidity sites promote degradation reactions. Thus, the amount of light products increases upon the use of the catalysts. Particularly, acetol concentration in the bio-oils obtained from the catalytic pyrolysis with SBA-15 and Cu/SBA-15 is notably high. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports the effects of hydrogen and bio-oil inlet temperature on the coke formation and product distribution during the hydrotreatment of bio-oil. A bench scale continuous hydrotreatment fixed-bed reactor set-up was used with pre-sulphided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 as the catalyst. The temperature of hot fluidised sand bath in which the hydrotreatment reactor was immersed was set at 390 °C while the pressure at the reactor exit was kept at around 70 bar. An LHSV of 1 h−1 (on the basis of organics in the bio-oil feed) was used. Our results show that the presence of hot hydrogen in the injection point of bio-oil to the reactor reduced the coke formation and reactor blockage for prolonged catalyst activity. This was due to the enhanced cracking and minimised polymerisation of bio-oil fragments when hot hydrogen was used to heat and activate the catalyst at the injection point. Moreover, lighter products with less coking propensity and smaller aromatic ring systems were formed when the injection point was maintained at a higher temperature with the use of hot hydrogen. These results indicate that the coke formation during hydrotreatment is at least partly because of the slow heating up of the bio-oil and the resulting bond breakage not being matched by the supply of active hydrogen from the catalyst. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Noble metal free CuCr based catalysts have been adopted for the production of γ-valerolactone (GVL) which is a biomass derived crucial platform molecule and potential liquid fuel candidate. However, the preparation of CuCr catalysts varies and in this research, a CuCr catalyst synthesized under mild conditions showed rather high catalytic capacity for the solvent-free hydrogenation of ethyl levulinate (EL) to GVL in a yield up to 95%. The catalyst was in-situ reduced and displayed excellent recycle capacity with no obvious activity decline within 5 successive runs, which was much more stable than ex-situ reduced CuCr catalyst. The high efficient, low cost and recyclability of this CuCr catalyst provides a promising pathway for biomass derived GVL production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microalgae play an important role in energy production to solve the major energy crisis. The present study demonstrates an efficient and environmental friendly route for bio-oil extraction from wet Nannochloropsis oculata algal biomass through photocatalysis. The method uses abundant solar energy and catalytic amount of titanium dioxide photocatalyst for the rupturing of wet algal cells and reduces most of the cost by avoiding dewatering and drying, for algal oil production. The various spectroscopy and microscopy techniques used show destruction of algal cell membrane by the photocatalyst, with a release of 52.2% lipid yield. The obtained lipid by photocatalysis on esterification yields biofuel which is in complete agreement with results obtained from conventional techniques. Algal oil is converted to biofuel through acid catalyzed transesterification. Bio-oil and biofuel samples were analyzed by ATR-IR, NMR and GCMS. The physicochemical characterization of photocatalyst was carried out by UV-Visible spectroscopy, XRD, EDS, BET and electron microscopy studies. The results suggest that the nanoparticles are efficient catalysts for rupturing the rigid micro algal cell membrane in an aqueous environment, using sunlight and hence prove to be a potential economic method for large scale bio-oil extraction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The intensive search of new and cleaner energy catches interest in recent years due to huge consumption of fossil fuels coupled with the challenge of energy and environmental sustainability. Production of renewable and environmentally benign energy from locally available raw materials is coming in the frontline. In this work, conversion of the combined biomass (cotton gin trash, cow manure, and Microalgae [Nannochloropsis oculata]) through batch pyrolysis has been investigated. The effect of temperature to the production of energy fuels such as bio-oil, char, and biogas have been simulated considering the yield and energy content as responses. Result of the investigation generally revealed that the proportions of the different biomass did not significantly affect the product yield and energy recovery. Significant effect of temperature is evident in the simulation result of energy recovery whereby maximum conversion was achieved at 400°C for char (91 wt%), 600°C for syngas (22 wt%), and 551°C for bio-oil (48 wt%). Overall energy conversion efficiency of 75.5% was obtained at 589°C in which 15.6 MJ/kg of mixed biomass will be elevated to pyrolysis products.

AB  - The utilization of bioethanol as the alcohol source for biodiesel production is more environmentally advantageous over methanol owing to its lower toxicity, lower flammability and its sustainable supply from renewable agricultural resources. However, as the presence of water in crude bioethanol is the critical factor limiting the biodiesel production process, the energy-intensive and costly purification of bioethanol is necessary for biodiesel application. Manganese glycerolate (MnGly) is reported the first time here as a robust heterogeneous catalyst that exhibited over 90% conversion by using aqueous ethanol containing 80 wt.% of water in the production of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE). The employment of 95 wt.% ethanol with respect to water could achieve 99.7% feedstock conversion in 6 hours under the optimal reaction conditions: reaction temperature (150 °C), feedstock-to-ethanol molar ratio (1:20) and catalyst loading (6 wt.%). Commercially available low grade crude bioethanol with the presence of impurities like sugars were applied which demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in 24 hours. The high water tolerance of MnGly towards biodiesel production could eventually simplify the purification of bioethanol that consumes less energy and production cost.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass produces organic liquids (bio-oil), biochar, water, and noncondensable gases. The noncondensable gas component typically contains syngas (H2, CO, and CO2) as well as small hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, and C3H8). To understand the influence of reactive gas in various pyrolysis processes, we have employed a laboratory scale microwave reactor and performed pyrolysis of switchgrass under varying gaseous atmospheres and characterized the bio-oils obtained. The batch (100 g of biomass) microwave pyrolysis was performed at 900-1000 W over the course of 7 min in the presence of a microwave absorber (10 g of activated charcoal). The products formed were quantified and the bio-oils were characterized by GC-MS, elemental analysis, Karl Fischer and TAN titrations, bomb calorimetry, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Pyrolysis experiments performed under a N2 atmosphere were used as the control and then compared to experiments performed under various reactive gases (CO, H2, and CH4) and a model pyrolysis gas mixture ("PyGas"). The use of a CO atmosphere had a negligible effect on the quantity and quality of bio-oils produced, whereas the use of H2, CH4, and PyGas atmospheres each provided more deoxygenated products (i.e., BTEX, naphthalenes, etc.) and lower oxygen content. The use of different particle sizes also displayed a pronounced effect on the product distribution and the composition of the bio-oils obtained.

AB  - Supercritical liquefaction of Syrian mesquite (Prosopis farcta) stems was performed to produce bio-oil in methanol and acetone without and with (zinc chloride, sodium hydroxide) catalyst at three different temperatures (255, 275 and 295 °C) using a high pressure (40 MPa) autoclave reactor for 75 min reaction time. The effects of process parameters including temperature, catalyst and solvent on liquefaction yields were investigated. The optimum conditions for liquefaction were provided with zinc chloride as catalyst and acetone as solvent at 295°C. According to the results, the highest conversion of 77.96% and liquid yield of 49.67% were obtained in acetone at 295 °C in the presence of zinc chloride. The produced bio-oils were analyzed and characterized by the methods including elemental analysis (EA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). EA indicated that the most of the raw material's energy was recovered in bio-oils with HHVs between 20 and 34 MJ/kg. GC-MS showed the formation of diverse compounds including aliphatics, aromatics, oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds. Acetone bio-oils were enriched in aromatics, ketones and esters while methanol bio-oils contained sugars and carboxylic acids. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The catalytic degradation of lignin is of considerable interest because the depolymerization of lignin to small molecules is the initial step for the conversion of lignin to biofuels and other useful chemicals. Because of the complex structure of lignin, methoxyethane was used in this study as a representative model of the most common linkage within lignin, the β-O-4 linkage. The completely renormalized coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CR-CCSD(T)] method was used to calculate the energetics of the C-O bond cleavage in methoxyethane by late 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal atoms and to evaluate the performance of a set of density functionals (BLYP, B97D, TPSS, M06L, B3LYP, PBE0, M06, TPSSh, and B2PLYP) in predicting the reaction energetics. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Eastern redcedar is a problematic plant in Oklahoma due to its extinguished environmental flexibility and rapid expansion. Thermally converting solid biomass polymers into liquid fuel intermediate, solid char and gaseous products through pyrolysis is one promising approach to use redcedar for the production of sustainable fuels. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of eastern redcedar wood zones (heartwood and sapwood), pyrolysis temperature (450 and 500 °C) and pyrolysis types (slow at lab-scale and fast at micro-scale) on the distribution and composition of the pyrolysis products. In fast pyrolysis conditions, the products were dominated by anhydrous sugars, phenols and guaiacols. The total yield of lignin-derived compounds from heartwood was higher than that from sapwood at 500 °C but the total yields were not significantly different at 450 °C. In slow pyrolysis conditions, acetic acid and furfural were the two most abundant species in bio-oil. Slow pyrolysis products consisted of less branched compounds of phenols and guaiacols as compared to fast pyrolysis products. Cedar oil components (alpha/beta-cedrene) were only produced at slow pyrolysis conditions and its maximum yield (21.04 ± 1.08 area%) of was obtained from heartwood at 500 °C. Heartwood produced significantly more cedrenes than sapwood. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose content of palm kernel cake (PKC) by different types of hydrolytic enzymes was studied to evaluate monomeric sugars released for production of biobutanol by Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 (ATCC 13564) in acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Experimental results revealed that when PKC was hydrolyzed by mixed β-glucosidase, cellulase and mannanase, a total simple sugars of 87.81 ± 4.78 g/L were produced, which resulted in 3.75 ± 0.18 g/L butanol and 6.44 ± 0.43 g/L ABE at 168 h fermentation. In order to increase saccharolytic efficiency of enzymatic treatment, PKC was pretreated by liquid hot water before performing enzymatic hydrolysis. Test results showed that total reducing sugars were enhanced to 97.81 ± 1.29 g/L with elevated production of butanol and ABE up to 4.15 ± 1.18 and 7.12 ± 2.06 g/L, respectively which represented an A:B:E ratio of 7:11:1. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, the crude biodiesel produced from spent fish frying oil through alkaline catalyzed transesterification was purified using a low-cost adsorbent viz. sulfonated tea waste. After separating the glycerol, the crude biodiesel was purified using the suggested adsorbent. Various methods of purification using the said adsorbent were applied such as purification using adsorption column chromatography and shaking methods. The results showed that purification using adsorption column chromatography exhibited the bst result. Properties of the purified fuels were determined and found conformed to those specified by the ASTM standards. For the sake of comparison, purification using zeolite and water washing method was also investigated. The result indicated that the suggested adsorbent was more successful on purification of the crude biodiesel compared to other methods. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Biodiesel is considered to be a good alternative in renewable energy generation; therefore it is well studied throughout for its efficient, economic and greener production. Present study illustrated the use of waste cooking oil and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a reactants, enzyme as catalyst that facilitated the biodiesel production by providing low cost reactant, ecofriendly methodology and glycerol carbonate as marketable by-product. It also includes resolution to the problems conjured using above combination like prolonged reaction time by applying microwave technology. Additionally the rate of reaction, activation energy and advantages of microwave technology over conventional method in terms of reduced requirement of DMC is also summarized in this manuscript. It is found that, about 94% conversion was obtained in just four hours using microwave irradiation when operated at optimised parameters which include temperature, enzyme loading, water content, molar ratio reactants and addition of surfactant. Lipase 435 used as a catalyst was found to recover 88% of its activity after catalysing six successive reaction cycles. Biodiesel obtained was observed to fit ASTM D 6751 standards after least downstream steps. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The modern scenario reveals that the world is facing energy crisis due to the dwindling sources of fossil fuels. Environment protection agencies are more concerned about the atmospheric pollution due to the burning of fossil fuels. Alternative fuel research is getting augmented because of the above reasons. Plant seed oils (vegetable oils) are cleaner, sustainable, and renewable. So, it can be the most suitable alternative fuel for compression ignition (CI) engines. This paper reviews the availability of different types of plant seed oils, several methods for production of biodiesel from vegetable oils, and its properties. The different types of oils considered in this review are cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) oil, ginger oil, eucalyptus oil, rice bran oil, Calophyllum inophyllum, hazelnut oil, sesame oil, clove stem oil, sardine oil, honge oil, polanga oil, mahua oil, rubber seed oil, cotton seed oil, neem oil, jatropha oil, egunsi melon oil, shea butter, linseed oil, Mohr oil, sea lemon oil, pumpkin oil, tobacco seed oil, jojoba oil, and mustard oil. Several methods for production of biodiesel are transesterification, pre-treatment, pyrolysis, and water emulsion are discussed. The various fuel properties considered for review such as specific gravity, viscosity, calorific value, flash point, and fire point are presented. The review also portrays advantages, limitations, performance, and emission characteristics of engine using plant seed oil biodiesel are discussed. Finally, the modeling and optimization of engine for various biofuels with different input and output parameters using artificial neural network, response surface methodology, and Taguchi are included. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This work presents a conceptual design of an integrated biorefinery using olive tree pruning as feedstock. The biorefinery combines a state-of-the-art thermochemical technology for producing high value-added antioxidants with an energy self-sufficient biochemical platform for lignocellulosic ethanol production. These plants are integrated by exchanging energy and feedstock. The process and design parameters employed in the plant designs are based on the authors’ own lab and pilot-scale data. The paper discusses the economic dilemma of using this feedstock for producing high value-added products in small amounts versus producing large amounts of low-profit biofuels. The feasibility of this production strategy at medium scale is demonstrated via a techno-economic analysis based on total production cost for each co-product. Each plant is energy integrated, and the energy performance of the bioethanol plant is assessed by calculating the end-use-energy ratio. Both analyses are parameterized with respect to plant capacity (100–1500 t dry weight (dw)/day) and raw material price (20–100 €/ton dry weight). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The biocatalytic synthesis of oxygenated biofuels (fatty acid solketal esters, FASEs) and biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, FAMEs) was carried out by both the direct esterification of fatty acids (i.e., lauric, myristic, palmitic, and oleic acids, respectively) with solketal or methanol, and the transesterification of vegetable oils (i.e. sunflower, olive, cottonseeds, and waste cooking oil) with the same alcohols, in hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) based on cations with long alkyl side-chains (e.g., octadecyltrimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C18tma][NTf2]). These hydrophobic ILs are temperature switchable ionic liquid/solid phases that behave as sponge-like system. As liquid phases, they are excellent monophasic reaction media for proposed biotransformations with all the assayed fat substrates, e.g. near to 100% yield of fatty acids solketyl esters (FASEs) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in 6 h at 60 °C. By using waste cooking oil mixed with free fatty acids as substrate, green biofuels containing either both FAMEs and FASEs (e.g., aprox. 80% FAMEs and 20% FASEs, etc.) can easily be prepared. Moreover, the reaction mixture can be easily fractionated by iterative centrifugations at controlled temperature into three phases, i.e. solid IL, water, and FAMEs + FASEs mixture leading to a straightforward and clean approach allowing the full recovery of the biocatalyst/IL system for further reuse and the simple product isolation. Furthermore, the enzyme did not shown any loss in activity during reuse in these reaction systems after six operation cycles. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In order to efficiently catalyze the transesterification of highly-acidic tree born oil (TBO) to produce biodiesel the magnetic cellulose microsphere (MCM) supported H3PW12O40 (MCM-HPW) catalyst was designed and prepared successfully, and it was characterized by Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Then, the MCM-HPW was used for transesterification of highly-acidic Pistacia chinensis seed oil to biodiesel for the first time. A high conversion yield (93.1%) of fatty acid methyl esters was obtained under the optimal conditions of catalyst amount 15 wt.%, methanol/oil ratio 10:1 (v:v), temperature 60 °C and reaction time 80 min. The catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction mixture under a magnetic field, and efficiently reused for at least four cycles. Thus, the prepared MCM-HPW catalyst possessed the potential of green and economic biodiesel production from highly-acidic TBO. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We apply Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) for direct characterization of iron-porphyrins in hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) biocrude oils derived from two algae: Tetraselmis sp. and cyanobacteria. The iron porphyrin compounds are shown to cause catalyst bed plugging during hydroprocessing due to iron deposition. Inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was utilized for iron quantitation in the plugged catalyst beds formed through hydroprocessing of the two HTL biocrudes and identifies an enrichment of iron in the upper five centimeters of the catalyst bed for Tetraselmis sp. (Fe = 100,728 ppm) and cyanobacteria (Fe = 115,450 ppm). Direct infusion FT-ICR MS analysis of the two HTL biocrudes with optimized instrument conditions facilitates rapid screening and identification of iron porphyrins without prior chromatographic separation. With FT-ICR MS we identify 138 unique iron porphyrin compounds in the two HTL biocrudes that have similar carbon number and double bond equivalent distributions to the metal porphyrins (e.g. Ni and V) reported for petroleum. No iron porphyrins are observed in the cyanobacteria HTL biocrude after hydroprocessing, which indicates that iron porphyrin structures in the HTL biocrude are degraded during hydrotreatment. Hydrodemetallization reactions that occur through hydroprocessing of HTL biocrudes could be responsible for the decomposition of iron porphyrin structures leading to metal deposition in the catalyst bed that result in catalyst deactivation and bed plugging, and must be addressed for effective upgrading of algal HTL biocrudes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Clostridium carboxidivorans P7 is a strict anaerobic bacterium capable of converting syngas to biofuels. However, its fermentation profiles is poorly understood. Here, various end-products, including acetic acid, butyric acid, hexanoic acid, ethanol and butanol were supplemented to evaluate their effects on fermentation profiles in C. carboxidivorans at two temperatures. At 37 °C, fatty acids addition likely led to more corresponding alcohols production. At 25 °C, C2 and C4 fatty acids supplementation resulted in more corresponding higher fatty acids, while supplemented hexanoic acid increased yields of C2 and C4 fatty acids and hexanol. Supplementation of ethanol or butanol caused increased production of C2 and C4 acids at both temperatures; however, long-chain alcohols were still more likely produced at lower temperature. In conclusion, fermentation profiles of C. carboxidivorans can be changed in respond to pre-added end-products and carbon flow may be redirected to desired products by controlling culture conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green chemistry, sustainability and eco-efficiency are guiding the development of the next generation of industrial chemical processes. The use of non-edible lignocellulosic biomass as a source of chemicals and fuels has recently raised interest due to the need for an alternative to fossil resources. Valorisation mainly focuses on cellulose, which has been used for various industrial scale applications for decades. However, creating an economically more viable value chain would require the exploitation of the other main components, hemicellulose and lignin. Here, we present a new low melting mixture composition based in boric acid and choline chloride, and demonstrate its efficiency in the fractionation of wood-based biomass for the production of non-condensed lignin, suitable for further use in the search for sustainable industrial applications, and for the selective conversion of hemicelluloses into valuable platform chemicals. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The current work presented the characteristics of liquefied products from solvolysis liquefaction of Chlorella pyrenoidosa in ethanol-water systems. The effect of different ethanol/water volume ratios on the physical and chemical characteristics of solid residue, dichloromethane-insoluble solid product (DCM-insoluble solid product), aqueous product, light bio-oil, and biocrude oil was systematically carried out. Elemental analysis and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the addition of ethanol contributed to the decomposition of solid residue. However, when the ethanol content exceeded 60%, the repolymerization of solid residue occurred. Moreover, on the basis of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, a plausible reaction mechanism of solid residues and DCM-insoluble solid products with respect to ethanol addition and reaction temperature was presented. The main chemical compositions of aqueous product, light bio-oil, and biocrude oil were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. It indicated that the ethanol-water cosolvent contributed to the generation of nitrogen-containing compounds in aqueous product and short-chain esters in light bio-oil, and decreased the content of toxic nitrogenous organic compounds with two or more methyl groups in aqueous product. The ethanol-water system could facilitate ester formation in biocrude oil through esterification and alcoholysis reactions. Through the thermal gravimetric analysis and thermal stability experiment of biocrude oils, it was demonstrated that the biocrude oil obtained from 60% ethanol content had the highest content of low boiling point components of C10-C20 and performed with the best thermal stability. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared using the impregnation method. The HZSM-5 and impregnated Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts were characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and X-ray diffraction. The HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts were used for prairie cordgrass (PCG) thermal conversion in a two-stage catalytic pyrolysis system. The products contained gas, bio-oil, and bio-char. The gas and bio-oil were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry separately. Higher heating values and elemental composition of bio-char were determined. The results indicated that 12% Ni/HZSM-5 treatment yielded the highest amount of gasoline fraction for hydrocarbons and showed a robust ability to upgrade bio-oil vapor. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper describes properties of molybdenum carbides as a potential catalyst for fast pyrolysis bio-oil hydroprocessing. Currently, high catalyst cost, short catalyst lifetime, and lack of effective regeneration methods are hampering the development of this otherwise attractive renewable hydrocarbon technology. A series of metal-doped bulk Mo carbides were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated in sequential low-temperature stabilization and high-temperature deoxygenation of a pine-derived bio-oil. During a typical 60 h run, Mo carbides were capable of upgrading raw bio-oil to a level suitable for direct insertion into the current hydrocarbon infrastructure with residual oxygen content and total acid number of upgraded oils below 2 wt % and 0.01 mg KOH g-1, respectively. The performance was shown to be sensitive to the type of metal dopant, Ni-doped Mo carbides outperforming Co-, Cu-, or Ca-doped counterparts; a higher Ni loading led to a superior catalytic performance. No bulk oxidation or other significant structural changes were observed. Besides the structural robustness, another attractive property of Mo carbides was in situ regenerability. The effectiveness of regeneration was demonstrated by successfully carrying out four consecutive 60 h runs with a reductive decoking between two adjacent runs. These results strongly suggest that Mo carbides are a good catalyst candidate which could lead to a significant cost reduction in hydroprocessing bio-oils. We highlight areas for future research which will be needed to further understand carbide structure-function relationships and help design practical bio-oil upgrading catalysts based on Mo carbides. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Softwood kraft lignin was depolymerized using subcritical water (623 K and 25 MPa) in a continuous small pilot unit. ZrO2 and K2CO3 were used as catalysts, and phenol was used as capping agent to suppress repolymerization. The effect of pH was investigated by adding KOH in five steps to the feed. The yield of water-soluble organics increased with pH. The yield of bio-oil was also influenced by the pH and varied between 28 and 32 wt %. The char yield on the zirconia catalyst showed a minimum at pH 8.1. The yield of suspended solids was low at pH below 8.1 but increased at higher pH values. The oxygen content in the bio-oil was only 15 wt %, compared to about 26 wt % in the kraft lignin. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of cardboard was carried out in a 300 mL Parr batch reactor using 5 wt % Ni(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)2, and NiCl2 in a temperature range of 225-300 °C for H2, biocrude, and bio-oil production. A slurry with cardboard to water weight ratio of 1:30, 1:10, 1:4, or 1:1.5 was loaded in the reactor and pressurized with N2 (40 or 200 psi). HTL was performed at various temperatures for 120 min. While HTL was in progress, gas samples were withdrawn periodically and analyzed by GC. The maximum H2 yield of 11.46 mL/g of cardboard was obtained using Ni(NO3)2 at 300 °C in 30 min. The percent liquefaction of biomass was quantified by TOC. The liquefaction yields were found to be dependent on reaction temperature, residence time, cardboard to water ratio, and operating pressure. The highest biocrude yield of 47.14% was observed at 275 °C in 30 min. Light bio-oil (LBO) and heavy bio-oil (HBO) were extracted by dichloromethane and acetone, respectively, and characterized by GC/MS and elemental analyzer. LBO contained mainly C4-C11 oxygenated hydrocarbons with a higher heating value (HHV) of 27.71 MJ/kg. HBO consisted of C17-C22 oxygenated compounds with a HHV of 29.62 MJ/kg. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A wild aquatic plant, Eichhornia Crassipes, and polyethylene have been converted into liquid product thermo-catalytically and cost effectively through co-pyrolysis using batch steel pyrolyzer. The Fe and CaCO3 catalysts were obtained as wastes from various mechanical processes. The catalytic process was compared with non-catalytic pyrolysis. The effect of various reaction conditions was investigated in order to find out the optimized process conditions. It was found that the favorable reaction conditions were 450°C temperature and 1-h reaction time at a heating rate of 1°C/s and 0.4-mm biomass particle size. The bio-oil yield was found to be 34.4% and 26.6% using Fe and CaCO3 respectively with catalysts particle size of 0.4mm at the optimized reaction conditions and 5wt% of biomass. The non-catalytic and catalytic co-pyrolysis using Fe as catalyst produced 23.9% and 28.7% oil respectively. Thus the efficiency of processes in terms of bio-oil production was found in order of: Fe&gt;CaCO3&gt;non-catalytic pyrolysis. The GC/MS analysis of n-hexane extract of bio-oil shows that Fe catalyst favors formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons while CaCO3 and non-catalytic pyrolysis favors formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Mostly unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons were formed in case of co-pyrolysis reactions. The calorific value of bio-oil was also measured in order to find out the fuel properties of the products. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of alkalis (NaOH, Na2CO3, KOH and K2CO3) on hydrothermal liquefaction of waste furniture sawdust (mixture of different types of waste woods) under sub-critical water conditions in a batch reactor operating at 280°C for 15 min. The liquefaction products were analysed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental composition, higher heating value and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The highest total bio-oil yield (34.9 wt%) and lowest solid residue yield (6.8 wt%) was obtained in the presence of 1.0 M K2CO3. Reactivity order for alkalis based on biomass conversion and liquid yield was found to be K2CO3 &gt; KOH &gt; Na2CO3 &gt; NaOH. The experimental results showed that the bio-oils produced were enriched in carbon and hydrogen and had reduced level of oxygen compared with original sawdust. The GC-MS analysis showed that light bio-oils and heavy bio-oils comprised a complex mixture of organic compounds, which mainly include phenols and their derivatives. © 2015 Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) is a versatile thermochemical pathway that converts wet or moist biomass into a bio-oil with promising properties as a future replacement of fossil oil. Lignocellulosic biomasses are of particular interest as they are representative of almost all terrestrial plant material. The fibrous nature of lignocellulosic biomass may however induce clogging and damage in continuous HTL reactors systems. This study investigates the pretreatment of Miscanthus × Giganteus (a perennial grass) in order to achieve stable feedstock slurries. To this end, the stabilizing effects of homogeneous catalysts are studied as well as the use of carboxymethyl cellulose as additive to prevent sedimentation. Finally, the impact of the applied pretreatment methodologies on the HTL process was evaluated with particular emphasis on product distribution and carbon balances. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Efficient dehydration of alcohols to olefins, acting as a control step in the upgrading of phenolic biofuel into alkane fuels, is an important topic in biomass conversion. Here, we report the design and synthesis of hydrophobic aluminosilicate ZSM-5 zeolites by an organosilane-modification approach (ZSM-5-OS). Water-droplet contact angle tests confirm the formation of hydrophobic surface after the modification. Interestingly, the obtained ZSM-5-OS catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic properties in dehydration of various alcohols into the corresponding olefins in water solvent. The approach reported in this work would be potentially important for developing more efficient catalysts for biomass conversion in the future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, the residual fat material (scum) from grease traps were submitted to catalytic cracking in order to systematically investigate the feasibility to produce light and heavy diesel-like fractions. The cracking reactions were carried out in a stirred tank slurry reactor of 143 L, operating in batch mode at 450 °C and 1.0 atmosphere; using 5, 10, and 15% (wt.) activated Red Mud obtained by calcination at 1000 °C as catalyst. The catalyst was prepared and characterized by FT-IR, XRF, XRD, SEM, EDX, and BET. The organic liquid products (OLP) were physical chemistry analyzed for acid and saponification values, specific gravity, refractive index, kinematic viscosity, flash point, and copper strip corrosion using AOCS and ASTM methods. The chemical composition of OLP, light and heavy diesel-like fractions were determined by FT-IR and GC-MS. The results showed an average OLP yield ranging from 62.34 to 75.92% (wt.) with acid values between 84.65 and 109.55 mg KOH/g, saponification values between 104.93 and 132.52 mg KOH/g, and kinematic viscosity between 10.96 and 14.08 mm2 s-1. For OLP obtained with 5% (wt.) activated Red Mud, the yield of light diesel-like fraction average 6.39% (wt.) with an acid value of 126.24 mg KOH/g, while that of heavy diesel-like fraction average 41.33% (wt.) with an acid value of 94.18 mg KOH/g. FT-IR analysis of OLP and diesel-like fractions confirms the presence of functional groups characteristic of hydrocarbons (alkenes, alkanes, ring-containing alkanes, and aromatics) and oxygenates (carboxylic acids, ketones, and esters). The GC-MS analysis of OLP and light diesel-like fraction obtained with 15% (wt.) activated Red Mud confirms that OLP is composed by 37.49% of hydrocarbons (10.83% alkenes, 14.16% alkanes, and 12.50 ring-containing alkanes) and 62.51% of oxygenates (59.49% carboxylic acids, 1.14% ketones, and 1.88 allyl esters). The light diesel-like fraction is composed by 73.86% of hydrocarbons (29.98% alkenes, 29.38% alkanes, 11.75% ring-containing alkanes, and 2.78% aromatics), and 26.14% of oxygenates compounds (23.48% carboxylic acids and 2.66% ketones), showing that thermal-catalytic cracking of scum from grease traps using activated red mud as catalyst is technically feasible. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of biomass requires multi-stage catalytic hydroprocessing to produce hydrocarbon drop-in fuels. One process design currently in development involves fixed beds of ruthenium-based catalyst and conventional petroleum hydrotreating catalyst. As the catalyst is spent over time as a result of coking and other deactivation mechanisms, it must be changed out and replaced with fresh catalyst. A main focus of bio-oil upgrading research is increasing catalyst lifetimes to 1 year. Biofuel life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) assessments typically ignore the impact of catalyst consumed during fuel conversion as a result of limited lifetime, representing a data gap in the analyses. To help fill this data gap, life cycle GHGs were estimated for two representative examples of fast pyrolysis bio-oil hydrotreating catalyst, NiMo/Al2O3 and Ru/C, and integrated into the conversion-stage GHG analysis. Life cycle GHGs are estimated at 5.5 kg CO2-e/kg catalyst for NiMo/Al2O3. Results vary significantly for Ru/C, depending on whether economic or mass allocation methods are used. Life cycle GHGs for Ru/C are estimated at 80.4 kg CO2-e/kg catalyst using economic allocation and 13.7 kg CO2-e/kg catalyst using mass allocation. Contribution of catalyst consumption to total conversion-stage GHGs at 1-year catalyst lifetimes is 0.5% for NiMo/Al2O3 and 5% for Ru/C when economic allocation is used (1% for mass allocation). This analysis does not consider the use of recovered metals from catalysts and other wastes for catalyst manufacture and therefore these are likely to be conservative estimates compared to applications where a spent catalyst recycler can be used. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Novel approaches for the production of liquid fuels from biomass are continuing to be explored; these approaches are enabled by the improved properties of advanced biofuels. The production of synthetic biodiesel via catalytic hydrotreating of vegetable oils and other feed with high triglyceride content is among these possibilities. The aim of the study was to hydrotreat rapeseed oil for the production of hydrocarbons in the diesel fuel range. We assessed what proportions of rapeseed oil were converted into n-alkanes through three different reactions (hydrodecarbonylation, hydrodecarboxylation, and hydrodeoxygenation) and what compounds other than n-alkanes were produced from rapeseed oil. The mixture of rapeseed oil and tetralin with a mass ratio of 2:8 was hydrotreated (320-380 °C, 4 MPa, co-current reactor) on a commercial Co-Mo/Al2O3 + SiO2 hydrotreating catalyst. The proportion of C17 and C18 isoalkanes in liquid products increased with increasing reaction temperature from 16 wt.% at 320 °C to 28 wt.% at 380 °C. Hydrodecarboxylation/hydrodecarbonylation dominated over hydrodeoxygenation in the hydrotreating mechanism. This dominance increased with increasing reaction temperature. The products of rapeseed oil conversion suppressed hydrogenation of tetralin into decalin. Therefore, the hydrotreating of a middle petroleum feedstock with a rapeseed oil addition will impair the ability of the Co-Mo/supporter catalyst to reduce content of monoaromatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the feedstock. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oil model compounds dry (CO2) reforming for hydrogen production over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is presented in this paper. The research investigates the effects of reaction conditions such as temperature, weight hourly space velocity of the aqueous phase (WHSV), CO2 to carbon in bio-oil ratio (CO2/Bio-oil) on hydrogen yield and products distribution. And also study the coke formation rates versus different reaction temperature and different CO2/Bio-oil ratio. Meanwhile analyze the types of carbon deposited on Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The experimental results show that, the optimum reaction temperature is 700 °C, CO2/Bio-oil is 0.75, WHSV is 0.9 h-1, under these conditions, hydrogen yield and bio-oil model compounds conversion reach 88.19% and 96.87% respectively, the molar ratio of H2/CO reaches 1.08. The coke formation rate exists a maximum at 600 °C, higher temperature (&gt;600 °C) and higher CO2/Bio-oil (&gt;0.75) are all good for carbon elimination of dry reforming. The forms of carbon deposit on Ni/Al2O3 catalyst are mainly filamentous carbon and graphitic carbon. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Micro-meso-macroporous polymers (MOPs) grafted with versatile functional groups, such as sulfonate, amine, triazole, pyridine, strong acidic ionic liquids and triphenylphosphine, were synthesized by in situ cross-linking of different functional molecules with 1,4-bis(chloromethyl)benzene in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts without using additional templates. The resultant hyper-cross-linked nanoporous polymers show unique characteristics such as large BET surface areas (up to 1523 m2 g-1), abundant micro-meso-macropores (4.5-131 nm), and tunable and versatile active sites (acid, base and palladium). These functional polymers exhibit excellent activities and good reusability in biomass conversions, cross-coupling reactions and condensation. The catalytic activities are much better than those of various conventional catalysts such as H3PW12O40, SBA-15-SO3H, Amberlyst 15, and mesoporous H-ZSM-5 Pd/C and even as comparable as those of homogeneous H2SO4 and HCl in the depolymerization of crystalline cellulose into fine chemicals and towards transesterification to biodiesel. This work highlights a low cost route to the synthesis of solid catalysts based on functional nanoporous polymers for catalyzing the production of clean biofuels and fine chemicals. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - Cracking-Deoxygenation process is one of the important reaction pathways for the production of biofuel with desirable n-C17 hydrocarbon chain via removal of oxygen compounds. Calcium-based catalyst has attracted much attention in deoxygenation process due its relatively high capacity in removing oxygenated compounds in the form of CO2 and CO under decarboxylation and decarbonylation reaction, respectively. In the present study, deoxygenation of triolein was investigated using Ca(OH)2 nanocatalyst derived from low cost natural waste shells. The Ca(OH)2 nanocatalyst was prepared via integration techniques between surfactant treatment (anionic and non-ionic) and wet sonochemical effect. Results showed that sonochemically assisted surfactant treatment has successfully enhanced the physicochemical properties of Ca(OH)2 nanocatalyst in terms of nano-particle sizes (∼50 nm), high surface area (∼130 m2 g-1), large porosity (∼18.6 nm) and strong basic strength. The presence of superior properties from surfactant treated Ca(OH)2 nanocatalysts rendered high deoxygenation degree, which are capable of producing high alkane and alkene selectivity in chain length of n-C17 (high value of C17/(n-C17 + n-C18) ratio = 0.88). Furthermore, both Ca(OH)2-EG and Ca(OH)2-CTAB nanocatalysts showed high reactivity with 47.37% and 44.50%, respectively in total liquid hydrocarbon content of triolein conversion with high H/C and low O/C ratio. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a sustainable energy source that can help meet the demand for biofuels in the United States. However, the quality and availability of such feedstocks greatly affect their suitability for downstream conversion. This work reports the effects of dilute-acid leaching at various aqueous loadings, temperatures and catalyst loadings (sulfuric acid) on the quality of a traditional biochemical feedstock, corn stover, as a potential feedstock for thermochemical conversions. At 95 wt% aqueous, dilute-acid leaching was observed to effectively remove 97.3% of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals that can negatively affect degradation pathways during pyrolysis and result in greater yield of non-condensable gases. In addition, up to 98.4% of the chlorine and 88.8% of the phosphorus, which can cause equipment corrosion and foul upgrading catalysts, respectively, were removed. At 25 °C in the absence of the acid catalyst, only 6.8% of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals were removed; however, 88.0% of chloride was still removed. The ratio of alkaline/acidic ash species has been suggested to proportionately relate to slagging in combustion applications. The initial alkali/acid ratio of the ash species present in the untreated corn stover was 0.38 (significant slagging risk). At 95 wt% aqueous, this ratio was decreased to 0.18 (moderate slagging risk). At 0 wt% catalyst and 90 °C, the ratio was decreased to 0.07, 0.08 and 0.06 at 0.5 wt% catalyst at 25 °C, 50 °C and 90 °C, respectively (low slagging risk). Increasing the catalyst loading to 1.0% slightly decreased the measured alkali/acid ratio of remaining ash. The results presented here show that a water wash or a dilute-acid preprocessing step can improve corn stover quality for pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction and combustion. © 2016

AB  - In this study, spherical γ-Al2O3 supported metal and metal phosphide (Ni, Co, Ni2P and CoP) catalysts were successfully prepared by combining sol-gel and spray pyrolysis methods. First boehmite sol was prepared based on the Yoldas process and then the corresponding metal salts were added to the sol at the desired concentration, followed by spray pyrolysis of the mixed solution. As the well-mixed solution was transformed to spherical γ-Al2O3 supported metal and metal phosphide catalysts during spray pyrolysis process, the metal species were uniformly distributed in the mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supports. The product catalysts were investigated under different conditions for hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil model compound, 2-furyl methyl ketone (FMK), which is the main component of the bio-oil product from pyrolysis of Saccharina japonica. Among the investigated catalysts, the 10 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after calcination at 800 °C showed the highest FMK conversion of 83.02% at the reaction temperature of 400 °C. The gas and liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with TCD/FID detectors and GC–MS, respectively, to determine the product compositions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The algal biomass of different species of Gracilaria were collected from coasts of Orissa and Tamil Nadu, India and characterized biochemically. Among various species, G. verrucosa was found to be better in terms of total carbohydrate content (56.65%) and hence selected for further studies. The agar was extracted from algal biomass and the residual pulp was enzymatically hydrolyzed. The optimization of algal pulp hydrolysis for various parameters revealed a maximum sugar release of 75.8 mg/ml with 63% saccharification yield. The fermentation of enzymatic hydrolysate of algal pulp was optimized and 8% (v/v) inoculum size, 12 h inoculum age, pH 5.0 were found to be optimum parameters for maximum ethanol concentration (27.2 g/L) after 12 h. The process of enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation were successfully scaled up to 2 L bioreactor scale. © 2016

AB  - Wear is an important characteristic because of its great value in connection with the engine parts. The main focus of this work is to analyze the effect of neural network models for predicting engine performance such as wear of the DI diesel engine using B20 blend of Methyl Ester of Mahua (MEOM) and diesel. Experimental results revealed that 20% biodiesel blend is the optimum blend in terms of performance, emission and combustion characteristics. For B20 blend, it was also found experimentally that 15% hot EGR and 20% cold EGR were the optimum EGR ratios. Under the optimum EGR ratios identified, a series of experimental work was done with B20 blend and diesel at various loads to obtain the concentration of wear metals from the lubricating oil. Experimentally, it was found that wear metals were found to be lower for B20 biodiesel compared to diesel. Artificial neural networks (ANN) have become the premier candidate as the modeling tool. Using the experimental data, ANN models based on probabilistic neural networks (PNN) and radial basis function neural networks (RBFN) for predicting the engine wear were developed. The results show that ANN is sufficient enough in predicting the engine wear in terms of mean square error (MSE) and regression coefficient (R). Also among the ANN models tested, RBFN performs significantly better than PNN. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 3D graphene aerogel (GA) was synthesized from graphene oxide (GO) using a hydrothermal procedure combined with freeze-drying. Then, they were used to assemble the supported H3PW12O40 (HPW) catalysts. The optimization of the reaction parameters for levulinic acid esterification with ethanol was performed and the catalytic performance of the HPW/GA catalysts was comparatively investigated. The results showed that these catalysts had abundant porous structure. In particular, they were found to be efficient in the synthesis of ethyl levulinate, which is promising in reducing the consumption of petroleum-derived fossil fuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Arundo donax Linn is one of the best-known herbaceous crops whose industrial potential is now being intensively reconsidered. The high productivity and low input requirements make it a promising feedstock for production of chemicals and biofuels. Besides, many studies have discussed its great potential as a renewable precursor with unique chemical composition for preparation of activated carbons (ACs) with high-grades. This article provided an overview of the different studies that included conversion of A. donax Linn or giant reed to carbon by various techniques. The effects of preparation variables such as time, temperature or power, impregnation ratio, and different activators on pore characteristics and yield of carbon were reviewed. Application of giant reed-carbons as adsorbents for attraction of organic and inorganic pollutants has also been reviewed. ACs obtained from giant reed biomass have shown excellent performance for wastewater treatment, thus solving environmental problems of waste disposal and pollution control. © 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The twin crises in depletion of fossil fuels and environmental degradation have motivated researches to consolidate the use of biofuels for internal combustion engine applications. In the present study, the performance and emission characteristic of Calophyllum inophyllum oil-based methyl ester and its diesel blends are analyzed at various compression ratios. Comprehensive optimization by considering the performance parameter along with emission characteristic is rather involved and is done carefully with designed set of experiments and analyzed statistically using design expert software. Higher compression ratio (CR) induces high cylinder temperature which enhances vaporization and thereby better performance only to a certain extent, that is, up to a CR of 19. However, due to high operating temperature, the oxides of nitrogen emission increase with CR and also for high biofuel blends, but better combustion phenomenon at these conditions reduces the emissions of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon. The designed empirical statistical model for optimum performance with lower emission is found to be B30 (30 % biofuel) at a CR of 19, which is then tested and validated. © 2015, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostar synthesized by simple and up-scalable microwave-assisted surfactant free hydrolysis method was applied as catalyst for biodiesel synthesis through one-step simultaneous esterification and transesterification from high free fatty acid (FFA) contaminated unrefined feedstock. It was found that ZnO nanostar catalyst was reacted with FFA to yield zinc oleate (ZnOl) as intermediate and finally became zinc glycerolate (ZnGly). With the re-deposition of ZnGly back to the ZnO nanostar catalyst at the end of the reaction, the catalyst can be easily recovered and stay active for five cycles. Furthermore, the rate of transesterification is highly promoted by the presence of FFA (6 wt.%) which makes it an efficient catalyst for low grade feedstock like waste cooking oil and crude plant oils. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Usage of plastics has been ever increasing and now poses a tremendous threat to the environment. Millions of tons of plastics are produced annually worldwide, and the waste products have become a common feature at overflowing bins and landfills. The process of converting waste plastic into value-added fuels finds a feasible solution for recycling of plastics. Thus, two universal problems such as problems of waste plastic management and problems of fuel shortage are being tackled simultaneously. Converting waste plastics into fuel holds great promise for both the environmental and economic scenarios. In order to carry out the study on plastic wastes, the pyrolysis process was used. Pyrolysis runs without oxygen and in high temperature of about 250–300 °C. The fuel obtained from plastics is blended with B20 algae oil, which is a biodiesel obtained from microalgae. For conducting the various experiments, a 10-HP single-cylinder four-stroke direct-injection water-cooled diesel engine is employed. The engine is made to run at 1500 rpm and the load is varied gradually from 0 to 100 %. The performance, emission and combustion characteristics are observed. The BTE was observed to be higher with respect to diesel for plastic-biodiesel blend and biodiesel blend by 15.7 and 12.9 %, respectively, at full load. For plastic-biodiesel blend, the emission of UBHC and CO decreases with a slight increase in NOx as compared to diesel. It reveals that fuel properties are comparable with petroleum products. Also, the process of converting plastic waste to fuel has now turned the problems into an opportunity to make wealth from waste. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The stability of lignin-derived bio-oil obtained from a continuous process [base (K2CO3)-catalyzed, using phenol as a capping agent] under subcritical conditions of water (25 MPa, 290-370 °C) was investigated. The lignin-derived bio-oil obtained was stored at ambient temperature for 2 years. Our results show that the base concentration in the feed solution affects the stability of this lignin-derived bio-oil during its long-term storage. It was found that, at low base concentrations (i.e., 0.4%-1.0%), the yields of all lignin-derived bio-oil fractions were relatively stable. At high base concentrations (i.e., 1.6%-2.2%), however, the yield of high-molecular-weight (high-Mw) structures increased and that of low-molecular-weight (low-Mw) structures decreased after storage. This indicated that the low-Mw materials had been polymerized to form high-Mw materials. In addition, it was found that the yield of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-identified compounds (excluding phenol) in this lignin-derived bio-oil decreased from 15% to 11%. This is probably due to the presence of solids in these lignin-derived bio-oils, which promotes the catalytic polymerization reactions, suggesting that it is beneficial to remove the solids from this lignin-derived bio-oil in order to enhance its stability. Compared to the results obtained from bio-oil derived from biomass pyrolysis, our results show that bio-oil derived from the conversion of lignin in subcritical water has better chemical stability during long-term storage. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sugars are among the main compounds in bio-oil produced by biomass pyrolysis. However, they can easily form coke, resulting in fast deactivation of the catalyst and severe blockage of the reactor during catalytic upgrading of bio-oil. Molecular distillation may be performed to retain sugars and pyrolytic lignin in the heavy fraction and thus to provide a primary stage for the subsequent sugar separation and utilization. A new method involving extraction, heat treatment, and column chromatography was introduced to separate further the aqueous phase obtained from the bio-oil heavy fraction by methanol-water extraction. Thus, monophenols and sugars were coextracted through these combined separation technologies. A fraction rich in monophenols was obtained by solvent extraction. Other impurities were further removed by heat treatment and column chromatography. An alcohol sedimentation method further separated the combined sugar-rich fraction into an ethanol-soluble fraction (SF-1) and an ethanol-insoluble fraction (SF-2). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography were performed to characterize sugars in the obtained fractions. SF-1 mainly contained monosaccharides such as levoglucosan, glucose, and xylose, whereas SF-2 still had a small amount of cellobiose besides monosaccharides. The ultimate recovery rates for several identified monosaccharides were in the range of 75-86 wt %. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Our society currently faces the twin challenges of resource reclamation from rapidly escalating KW (kitchen waste) and increasingly expensive depletion costs and restrictive disposal legislation due to environmental impacts and fast depleting global resources necessitate action. This work studied the influence of thermal hydrolysis on the utilization of KW based on the principle of split phase processing, including solid phase for pig feed, liquid phase for anaerobic digestion and floating oil for biodiesel. It shows that the solid phase of KW after thermal treatment could satisfy the nutrition content requirements as raw materials for pig feed. The efficiency of the subsequent anaerobic digestion of liquid phase increased for KW pretreated at 120 °C and higher methane production and soluble chemical oxygen demand reduction were achieved after a pretreatment time of 40 min. Composition analysis of floating oil during thermal hydrolysis indicates that unsaturated fatty acid accounts for more than 61% and the main ingredients are monounsaturated fatty acid (more than 36%). All parameters important for biodiesel quality except the acid value could satisfy the biodiesel requirements according to the European standard. From overall analysis, the thermal pre-treatment was profitable with output value of $ 57.52 ton-1 KW. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of biofuel use on the operation of Diesel Exhaust Aftertreatment System is investigated both numerically and experimentally, by focusing on the contribution of three main factors: raw PM-NOx emissions trade-off, NO-NO2conversion efficiency of the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and PM reactivity toward oxidation. The possibility of limited interventions on assessed engine technologies is key toward the deployment of the potential related to fuel based greenhouse reduction policies, for both road and non-road markets. To verify its impact on the Aftertreatment System, a Diesel engine for non-road applications has been tested with Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) biodiesel blended with commercial fossil fuel at 6% and 30% v/v. Six engine operating modes have been selected as the most representative of the reference standard cycle (NRTC) for non-road Diesel engines and have been run to evaluate the biodiesel impact on engine emissions. Experimental results indicate a significant reduction of soot emissions, in line with literature trends, especially at high loads, as fuel oxygen enhances oxidation in the fuel rich regions of the combustion chamber. On the other side, only a slight increase in NOx emissions has been observed, along with a similar trend of the equivalence ratio due to both the lower heating value and stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of biodiesel in comparison with fossil fueling. The study has been also focused on the analysis of PM/NO2ratio, in presence of the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, when biodiesel is used. Engine tests have in fact demonstrated that, although the NO2/NOx ratio on raw exhaust is almost unaffected, a slight reduction of the NO2/NOx light-off temperature of the DOC is observed. This gives, along with a greater PM reactivity oxidation, more favorable conditions for the Diesel Particulate Filter passive regeneration process, with the final aim of a higher engine conversion efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A series of lipase-catalysed transesterification experiments were carried out to study the effect of the presence of free fatty acids on synthesis reaction rate and the stability of the biocatalyst, and also to elucidate the underlying process, which remains a subject of debate. Based on the results, the reaction rate and biocatalyst stability increased with increasing content in free fatty acids of the reaction mixture. Also, tests carried out with a mixture of triolein and linoleic acid revealed that the transesterification is a combination of direct alcoholysis of triacylglycerols and a two-step reaction involving hydrolysis of acylglycerols and further esterification of previously released free fatty acids. The time course of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols revealed that the enzyme is similarly selective for both types of substrate. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable production of liquid transportation fuels and chemicals remains essential both commercially and scientifically. Isobutanol has gained great attention as an improved "drop-in" biofuel and important commodity chemical with broad applications. Ethanol could be upgraded with methanol in water for the production of isobutanol through cross condensation. High isobutanol selectivity is obtained (>90%) due to precise control on the reactivity of methanol and ethanol feedstock over Ir catalysts immobilized on N functionalized carbon materials. Only under a narrow range of preparation conditions could the catalysts distinguish the reactivity of methanol and ethanol nicely. The experimental results evidenced that the properties of Ir, especially the particle size and oxidation state, were particularly important for the desired activity. Control experiments also indicated that the effect of Ir catalysts on the intermediate aldol C-C formation step, rather than the dehydrogenation step, was critical in determining the product selectivity. Furthermore, the Ir catalysts could tolerate some typical biogenic impurities, which enables catalytic upgrading of bio-ethanol broth after centrifugation and decolourization. All these results indicate the promising application of the developed Ir catalysts in producing biofuels as well as useful chemicals from ethanol upgrading. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes continue to hold great promise as synthetic biology platforms for the production of novel therapeutic agents, biofuels, and commodity chemicals. Dehydratase (DH) catalytic domains play an important role during polyketide biosynthesis through the dehydration of the nascent polyketide intermediate to provide olefins. Our understanding of the detailed mechanistic and structural underpinning of DH domains that control substrate specificity and selectivity remains limited, thus hindering our efforts to rationally re-engineer PKSs. The curacin pathway houses a rare plurality of possible double bond permutations containing conjugated olefins as well as both cis- and trans-olefins, providing an unrivaled model system for polyketide dehydration. All four DH domains implicated in curacin biosynthesis were characterized in vitro using synthetic substrates, and activity was measured by LC-MS/MS analysis. These studies resulted in complete kinetic characterization of the all-trans-trienoate-forming CurK-DH, whose kcat of 72 s-1 is more than 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of any previously reported PKS DH domain. A novel stereospecific mechanism for diene formation involving a vinylogous enolate intermediate is proposed for the CurJ and CurH DHs on the basis of incubation studies with truncated substrates. A synthetic substrate was co-crystallized with a catalytically inactive Phe substitution in the His-Asp catalytic dyad of CurJ-DH to elucidate substrate-enzyme interactions. The resulting complex suggested the structural basis for dienoate formation and provided the first glimpse into the enzyme-substrate interactions essential for the formation of olefins in polyketide natural products. This examination of both canonical and non-canonical dehydration mechanisms reveals hidden catalytic activity inherent in some DH domains that may be leveraged for future applications in synthetic biology. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) are a family of heme peroxidases in which a catalytic distal aspartate is involved in H2O2 activation to catalyze oxidations under acidic conditions. They have received much attention due to their potential applications in lignin compound degradation and biofuel production from biomass. However, the mode of oxidation in bacterial DyPs remains unknown. We have recently reported that the bacterial TcDyP from Thermomonospora curvata is among the most active DyPs and shows activity toward phenolic lignin model compounds. On the basis of the X-ray crystal structure solved at 1.75 Å, sigmoidal steady-state kinetics with Reactive Blue 19 (RB19), and formation of compound II like product in the absence of reducing substrates observed with stopped-flow spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), we hypothesized that the TcDyP catalyzes oxidation of large-size substrates via multiple surface-exposed protein radicals. Among 7 tryptophans and 3 tyrosines in TcDyP consisting of 376 residues for the matured protein, W263, W376, and Y332 were identified as surface-exposed protein radicals. Only the W263 was also characterized as one of the surface-exposed oxidation sites. SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that W376 represents an off-pathway destination for electron transfer, resulting in the cross-linking of proteins in the absence of substrates. Mutation of W376 improved compound I stability and overall catalytic efficiency toward RB19. While Y332 is highly conserved across all four classes of DyPs, its catalytic function in A-class TcDyP is minimal, possibly due to its extremely small solvent-accessible areas. Identification of surface-exposed protein radicals and substrate oxidation sites is important for understanding the DyP mechanism and modulating its catalytic functions for improved activity on phenolic lignin. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - During the past decade, there has been increasing global concern over the rise of anthropogenic CO2 emission into the Earth’s atmosphere (J Air Waste Manage Assoc 53:645–715, 2003). The utilization of CO2 to produce any valuable product is need of the hour. The production of syngas from CO2 and CH4 seems to be one of the promising alternatives in terms of industrial utilization, as it offers several advantages: (a) mitigation of CO2, (b) transformation of natural gas and CO2 into valuable syngas, and (c) producing syngas with H2/CO ratio 1 which may further be used for the production of valuable petrochemicals (J Air Waste Manage Assoc 53:645–715, 2003). A conceptual design for the production of synthesis gas by dry reforming of methane is presented here. An economic assessment of this process with an integrated methanol production section as a case was conceptualized and compared with the conventional steam methane reforming route to produce methanol. The economic study indicated that dry reforming of natural gas/methane is a competitive process with lower operating and capital costs in comparison with steam reforming assuming negligible cost of CO2 import. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids has recently received significant attention as a low-hydrogen approach to biomass feedstock deoxygenation for production of hydrocarbon fuels with superior properties to biodiesel. Unfortunately, it is a challenging reaction to push to high yields. Of typical catalysts, Pd/C is typically reported to give the best performance, while most oxide supports are inferior, with exceptions for very specific preparation and pre-treatment protocols. Here, we investigate the role of organosilane-modified silicas as supports for the Pd-catalyzed deoxygenation of stearic acid at 300 °C under inert atmosphere. Comparing aminopropylsilane-modified, phenylsilane-modified, and unmodified silica supports with Pd incorporated by several methods, it is first shown that changes in dispersion alone do not account for improvements in deoxygenation yields. Capping silanols with phenylsilane is also ineffective on its own in improving deoxygenation yields. The most effective treatment is shown to be a co-deposition of phenylsilane and aminopropylsilane before Pd incipient wetness impregnation, followed by direct reduction of the catalyst, which gives heptadecane yields >85%, exceeding even the productivity of Pd/C. These results demonstrate that basic, aromatic-rich surfaces are accessible through organosilane grafting and that these surfaces can control Pd particle sizes and the adsorption of stearic acid and products. This work improves our understanding of support effects for biomass feedstock deoxygenation catalysts and could help design new catalysts that take advantage of modified inorganic supports. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Seaweeds are marine macroalgae found abundantly and viewed as potential source of phycocolloids to produce biofuel. In this study, seaweed spent biomass obtained from alginate production industry and biomass obtained after pigment extraction were found to contain a considerable amount of phycocolloids. These two spent biomasses were investigated for the production of ethanol. In this study, the red seaweed spent biomass of Gracilaria corticata var corticata showed higher content of polysaccharide (190.71 ± 30.67 mg g-1 dry weight) than brown seaweed spent biomass (industrial) (136.28 ± 30.09 mg g-1 dry weight). Hydrolysis of spent biomasses with different concentrations of sulfuric acid (0.1%, 0.5% and 1%) was also investigated. Brown seaweed spent biomass and red seaweed spent biomass exhibited high amount of sugar in 0.5% and 1% sulfuric acid treatment, respectively. Proximate and ultimate composition of seaweed spent biomasses were analysed for energy value. The FT-Raman spectra exhibited similar stretches for both acid hydrolysed spent biomasses with their respective standards. Ethanol produced through a fermentation process using spent hydrolysates with baker's yeast at pH 5.3 was found to be significant. The ethanol yield from brown seaweed spent biomass and red seaweed spent biomass was observed to be 0.011 g g-1 and 0.02 ± 0.003 g g-1 respectively, when compared with YPD (0.42 ± 0.03 g g-1) and d-galactose (0.37 ± 0.04 g g-1) as standard on day 4. The present study revealed the possibility of effective utilization of spent biomass from seaweed industry for ethanol production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oil derived from fast pyrolysis of rice husk was gasified for producing gas. The effectiveness of equivalence ratio and gasifying agents on the gas composition, ratio of H2/CO, tar amount, low heating value, degree of oxidation and cold gas efficiency of the gas were comprehensively investigated. Under different equivalence ratios and gasifying agents, the gases can be used as synthesis gas for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, fuel gas for gas turbines in a power plant and reducing gas for ore reduction, respectively. The H2 concentration, CO level and cold gas efficiency of the resulted gas derived from gasification of bio-oil were significantly higher, while tar content was remarkably lower than those derived from gasification of solid biomass using the same equivalent ratio value and gasifying agent. In short, bio-oil gasification is economically feasible for large scale production of fuels and chemicals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hypergolic fuel has unique importance in missiles and satellite launch vehicles. Hydrazine and its derivatives (Monomethyl hydrazine, MMH and Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine, UDMH) are the continuous choices of fuel in bipropellant though it is carcinogenic and toxic. Development of new, green and cost-effective fuel blends based on trust-worthy, ionic liquid and biofuel in different volume proportion have been reported. The blends exhibit reasonably good stability (chemical and thermal), low viscosity (η &lt; 15 mPa⋅s), high density (ρ &gt; 1 g/cm3), low ignition delay and high performance in comparison with UDMH - a proven liquid fuel presently being used as promising fuels for liquid rocket application. The reported blends appear to be a technologically promising, eco-friendly and affordable fuel blend to replace currently used liquid toxic fuels. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Biofuel cells are often limited by the current density produced by the cathode; this is especially true when such fuel cells are scaled down to fit a desired application. Herein, we created a computational model to examine the effects of carbon nanotube (CNT) connectivity and surface activity on the current density of a biofuel cell cathode. The model was motivated by the creation of a novel contact lens biofuel cell that, although more stable and biocompatible than previously reported designs, was cathode limited. The device produced a maximum current density of 22 ± 4 μA cm-2, and a maximum power density of 2.4 ± 0.9 μW cm-2 (at 0.163 V) with an open-circuit voltage of 0.44 ± 0.08 V. Computational results showed that in a Nafion film containing 1.6% CNTs by volume, less than 20% of the CNT fibers were connected to the electrode, assuming a planar electrode. The simulations predicted that a three-fold increase in CNT loading would lead to a roughly two-fold increase in total CNT connectivity. The simulations further estimated that for the CNTs connected to the electrode, only 21% of their sidewalls were contributing to cathodic current, meaning that the remaining surfaces were not electrochemically active. Given the low bilirubin oxidase (BOD) enzyme surface concentration, which was experimentally found to be 1.24 × 10-13 mol cm-2, it is likely that large portions of the CNT surfaces are not connected to enzymes. This result validates the push by the research community to increase BOD and laccase adsorption/orientation to CNT surfaces. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A sustainable process of value-added utilization of wastes including waste cooking oil (WCO) and post-consumer PET bottles for the production of biodiesel and polyurethane (PU) foams was developed. WCO collected from campus cafeteria was firstly converted into biodiesel, which can be used as vehicle fuel. Then crude glycerol (CG), a byproduct of the above biodiesel process, was incorporated into the glycolysis process of post-consumer PET bottles collected from campus to produce polyols. Thirdly, PU foams were synthesized through the reaction of the above produced polyols with isocyanate in the presence of catalysts and other additives. The characterization of the produced biodiesel demonstrated that its properties meet the specification of biodiesel standard. The effect of crude glycerol loading on the properties of polyols and PU foams were investigated. All the polyols showed satisfactory properties for the production of rigid PU foams which had performance comparable to those of some petroleum-based analogs. A mass balance and a cost analysis for the conversion of WCO and waste PET into biodiesel and PU foams were also discussed. This study demonstrated the potential of WCO and PET waste for the production of value-added products. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The catalytic properties of surfaces are highly dependent upon the effect said surfaces have on the geometric and electronic structure of adsorbed reactants, products, and intermediates. It is therefore crucial to have a surface-level understanding of the adsorption of the key species in a reaction in order to design active and selective catalysts. Here, we study the adsorption of guaiacol on Fe (110) and Pd (111) using dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations as both of these metals are of interest as hydrodeoxygenation catalysts for the conversion of bio-oils to useable biofuels. Both vertical (via the oxygen functional groups) and horizontal (via the aromatic ring) adsorption configurations were examined and the resulting adsorption and molecular distortion energies showed that the vertical sites were only physisorbed while the horizontal sites were chemisorbed on both metal surfaces. A comparison of guaiacol's horizontal adsorption on Fe (110) and Pd (111) showed that guaiacol had a stronger adsorption on Pd (111) while the Fe (110) surface distorted the C-O bonds to a greater degree. Electronic analyses on the horizontal systems showed that the greater adsorption strength for guaiacol on Pd (111) was likely due to the greater charge transfer between the aromatic ring and the surface Pd atoms. Additionally, the greater distortion of the C-O bonds in adsorbed guaiacol on Fe (110) is likely due to the greater degree of interaction between the oxygen and surface Fe atoms. Overall, our results show that the Fe (110) surface has a greater degree of interaction with the functional groups and the Pd (111) surface has a greater degree of interaction with the aromatic ring. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapeseeds were used for the production of biodiesel via alkaline transesterification. The effect of direct sonication (24 kHz) during in situ and conventional transesterification was studied without the use of external heating and was compared to that of mechanical stirring (600 rpm, 60 °C). In the in situ transesterification the use of ultrasonication and mechanical stirring led to a similar high % FAME content (97.2 ± 0.4 and 95.7% ± 0.8 respectively) after 120 min. However the % yield of the extracted methyl esters using mechanical stirring was considerably lower compared to ultrasonication (37.0 and 80.6% respectively) when same conditions were applied (7.5% NaOH w/w of oil, 400:1 methanol to oil molar ratio). The kinetics study of the rapeseed oil methanolysis process via direct sonication and mechanical stirring showed that the reaction rate constant is not affected by the method of stirring under specific conditions. Properties of rapeseed biodiesel determined agree with the specifications of the European Standard EN 14214. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The acetalization of six different types of glycerol including pure, wet, and crude-like grade compounds of compositions simulating those of crude glycerols produced by the biodiesel manufacture, was carried out with two model ketones such as acetone and 2-butanone. The reaction was investigated under continuous-flow (CF) conditions through a comparative analysis of an already known acetalization catalyst such as Amberlyst 36 (A36), and aluminum fluoride three hydrate (AlF3· 3H2O, AF) whose use was never previously reported for the synthesis of acetals. At 10 bar and 25 °C, A36 was a highly active catalyst allowing good-to-excellent conversion (85%-97%) and selectivity (99%) when either pure or wet glycerol was used as a reagent. This catalyst however, proved unsuitable for the CF acetalization of crude-like glycerol (CG) since it severely and irreversibly deactivated in a few hours by the presence of low amounts of NaCl (2.5 wt %) which is a typical inorganic impurity of raw glycerol from the biorefinery. Higher temperature and pressure (up to 100 °C and 30 bar) were not successful to improve the outcome. By contrast, at 10 bar and 100 °C, AF catalyzed the acetalization of CG with both acetone and 2-butanone, yielding stable conversion and productivity up to 78% and 5.6 h-1, respectively. A XRD analysis of fresh and used catalysts proved that the active phase was a solid solution (SS) of formula Al2[F1-x(OH)x]6 (H2O)y present as a component of the investigated commercial AF sample. A hypothesis to explain the role of such SS phase was then formulated based on the Brønsted acidity of OH groups of the solid framework. Overall, the AF catalyst allowed not only a straightforward upgrading of CG to acetals, but also a more cost-efficient protocol avoiding the expensive refining of raw glycerol itself. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.

AB  - Acids, aldehydes, ketones and phenols, which are the main components of bio-oil, have negative effects on the properties. In this paper, the mixture of acetic acid, furfural, hydroxyacetone, ethanediol, phenol and water were chosen as hybrid model compounds of bio-oil (MCB). To convert these compounds into stable and combustible oxygenated organics (alcohols and esters), one step hydrogenation-esterification (OHE) was carried out over Raney Ni catalyst (RN) and Mo, Sn, Fe, Cu modified Raney Ni catalysts (RNs) in the presence of methanol. 100% conversions of furfural and hydroxyacetone were achieved over RNs with high selectivity to desired products. The acetic acid conversion was only 35.1% with no methanol addition, while within 6 g/8 g methanol/MCB addition, the conversion of acetic acid increased to 81.1%. The esterification activity of alcohols was followed by methanol > tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), the hydrogenation product of furfural > ethanediol. Among the RNs, the addition of Fe catalyst restrained the aqueous-phase reforming of methanol and promoted the esterification of methanol and acetic acid. The Mo-RN showed the most favorable performance in the hydrogenation of phenol among the RNs. But the RN modified by both Fe and Mo did not give a good performance. After the OHE of light fraction of raw bio-oil over Mo-RN, there was no ketone & aldehyde detected and the contents of acids and phenols decreased from 49.04% and 7.35% to 8.21% and 3.84%. The conversion of acids could reach to 85.01% which was nearly to the conversion of acetic acid in MCB. The contents of alcohols and esters increased from 5.79% and 4.74% to 53.61% and 33.66%. The content of stable and combustible oxygenated organics reached to 87.27% after OHE of light fraction of raw bio-oil. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel can be produced from vegetable oils using different catalysts including enzymes. This publication presents the development of a mathematical model for biodiesel production using the liquid lipase Callera Trans L (CTL) and analyzes the first block of reactions: esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) in biodiesel and hydrolysis of the latter. The relevant rate constants were evaluated by changing water, methanol, FFA and enzyme concentrations. The results were compared to the immobilized catalyst Novozym 435 (Nvz). The intriguing difference was observed for the apparent equilibrium constants of CTL (high Keqapp) and Nvz (low Keqapp). This thermodynamic "inconsistency" was explained by absence or presence of the catalyst carrier. Nvz carrier particles apparently help to disperse water, increasing its surface and hydrolytic activity in comparison to CTL. Another reactant, methanol, had a dual effect acting as (i) a substrate and (ii) a solvent of water in oil phase. The latter effect added to hydrolytic activity and decreased Keqapp at increasing methanol (0-0.5M). Inhibition and inactivation of CTL by methanol (&lt;8% v/v) were insignificant. FFA acted as both substrate and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme suppressing its activity to approximately 25% at FFA &gt;1.5M. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Development of lignocellulosic biorefineries requires improved environmental and cost-effective processes in addition to tailoring the lignocellulosic constitutions with the desired biofuels and chemicals. Here, we first report a novel strategy of lignocellulose fractionation at solid biomass loadings up to 40 wt% through irradiation assisted self-catalysis (IASC) with a green solvent aqueous system consisting of 40 wt% γ-valerolactone and 60 wt% water (40:60 GVL/H2O) with no adscititious catalyst. Each fraction of cellulose, hemicellulsoe and lignin can be prone to upgrade to desired biofuels and bioproducts. The irradiation-mediated carboxyl, aldehyde, and phenol groups in biomass act as weak active acid sites for (hemi) cellulose cleavage in 40:60 GVL/H2O and their subsequent self-catalyzed hydrolysis to soluble carbohydrates and their derived products, which are catalytically upgraded to furans with an 80% conversion rate, and/or fermentative upgrading to microbial oils (biomass 31 g L-1 and lipid content 36.5 wt%). The regenerated cellulose can achieve approximately 184.3 g L-1 monomeric glucose (total concentration of soluble C5 and C6 sugars is 231 g L-1) and high potential ethanol titers of 88.5 g L-1 during SSF fermentation. The obtained lignin also showed good reactivity for valorization to nanoparticle functional materials and/or low molecular aromatics. In the end, the overall process mass balance at the laboratory-scale level was preliminarily evaluated. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - A layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique was employed to modify glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) and screen printed electrodes (SPEs) utilizing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/polyelectrolyte binary composites and an enzyme cascade to facilitate efficient electron transfer in sucrose/O2 biofuel cell. In this study, MWCNTs immobilized invertase (INV) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) were alternatively assembled upon polyethyleneimine (PEI) and DNA nanocomposites to construct a bioanode. [Ni(phendion)(phen)]Cl2 complex and methylene green (MG) were investigated as redox mediators for electrocatalytic oxidation of NADH at reduced overpotentials. The LbL architecture showed advantages for sequential enzymatic reaction that favored the efficient penetration of substrate and products in a cascade system while MWCNTs facilitated the efficient electron transfer from sucrose oxidation and enhancement of the current density. With a GCE bioanode modified with a MG or Ni complex, the biofuel cell produced a higher power density (μW/cm2) with 145.8% and 130.11% enhancement comparing to a SPE bioanode, respectively. Moreover, the Ni complex modified GCEs and SPEs produced power densities (μW/cm2) 93.7% and 107.0% higher compared to MG modified bioanodes, respectively. The maximum current density of 1400 ± 46 μA/cm2 was obtained with the Ni complex on GCE at an OCP of 604 ± 17 mV with a maximum power density of 405 ± 6 μW/cm2. The LbL assembly showed great feasibility as a simple and efficient way to construct controlled MWCNT-multi-enzyme modified electrodes for biofuel cell applications. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Renewable and abundant carbohydrates are being strongly focused upon as a green and sustainable alternative for the production of valuable chemicals and biofuels. In this study, we chemically integrated acid-base bifunctionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs-SO3H-NH2) and a macroporous polymer foam poly(HIPE) (PH) matrix that is derived from water-in-oil (W/O) high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) templating. After the subsequent sulfonation process, a SPHs@MSNs-SO3H-NH2 catalyst with a hierarchical porous structure and bifunctional sites was prepared and used for the highly efficient synthesis of top value-added 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from renewable cellulose in an ionic liquid (i.e., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [EMIM]Cl) based system. Evaluation of the catalytic activity revealed that the designed macropores were favorable for ready mass transfer, whereas the high surface area for active-site anchoring provided by the mesoporous structure was beneficial in enhancing the catalyst performance. A theoretical study also suggested that acidic and basic active sites synergistically work for the transformation reaction. Under the optimized conditions, a remarkably high HMF yield (44.5 %) was obtained efficiently. Furthermore, the as-prepared catalyst was recycled in four consecutive cycles with a total loss of only 4.9 % activity. Sweet success: Hierarchically macro-/mesoporous polymer foam has been successfully synthesized and used for the sustainable production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF; see figure) from renewable cellulose. The as-prepared catalyst was also effective for the conversion of glucose and fructose to HMF in a DMSO/H2O system. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Lignocellulose is one of the most abundant renewable feedstocks that has attracted considerable attention as a substrate for biofuel and biochemical production. One such biochemical product, lactic acid, is an important fermentation product because of its great potential for the production of biodegradable and biocompatible polylactic acid. High-titer lactic acid production from lignocellulosic materials has been achieved recently; however, it requires biodetoxification or results in large amounts of waste washing water. In this study, we employed two alkaline pretreatment methods and compared their effects on lactic acid fermentation of pretreated corncob by Bacillus coagulans LA204 using fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and fermentation under non-sterile conditions. The lactic acid titer, yield, and productivity from 16% (w/w) NaOH-pretreated and washed corncob were 122.99 g/L, 0.77 g/g corncob, and 1.37 g/L/h, respectively, and from 16% NH3-H2O2-pretreated and washed corncob were 118.60 g/L, 0.74 g/g corncob, and 1.32 g/L/h, respectively. Importantly, the lactic acid titer, yield, and productivity from 18.4% NH 3-H 2 O 2-pretreated and unwashed corncob by using fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and fermentation reached 79.47 g/L, 0.43 g/g corncob, and 1.10 g/L/h, respectively, demonstrating that this method is possible for industrial applications and saves washing water. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - This study used toxicogenomics to identify the complex biological response of human lung BEAS-2B cells treated with organic components of particulate matter in the exhaust of a diesel engine. First, we characterized particles from standard diesel (B0), biodiesel (methylesters of rapeseed oil) in its neat form (B100) and 30% by volume blend with diesel fuel (B30), and neat hydrotreated vegetable oil (NEXBTL100). The concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives in organic extracts was the lowest for NEXBTL100 and higher for biodiesel. We further analyzed global gene expression changes in BEAS-2B cells following 4 h and 24 h treatment with extracts. The concentrations of 50 µg extract/mL induced a similar molecular response. The common processes induced after 4 h treatment included antioxidant defense, metabolism of xenobiotics and lipids, suppression of pro-apoptotic stimuli, or induction of plasminogen activating cascade; 24 h treatment affected fewer processes, particularly those involved in detoxification of xenobiotics, including PAHs. The majority of distinctively deregulated genes detected after both 4 h and 24 h treatment were induced by NEXBTL100; the deregulated genes included, e.g., those involved in antioxidant defense and cell cycle regulation and proliferation. B100 extract, with the highest PAH concentrations, additionally affected several cell cycle regulatory genes and p38 signaling. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Recently, many studies have been published on the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass, to improve the quality of the liquid product from fast pyrolysis, especially with ZSM-5 catalysts. However, only a few studies in the literature were not limited to the use of woody biomass as feed. This paper describes a catalytic pyrolysis study with two different biomass types (sugarcane bagasse and pinewood) using a commercial ZSM-5 catalyst and silica as a reference in a pilot- scale circulating fluidized bed unit. The chemical characterization of the liquid products was performed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS). The gas yields increased with temperature and the presence of ZSM-5 contributed to greater quantities of gaseous deoxygenation products. The coke yields decreased with reaction temperature, but were not influenced by the bed reactor material. Bagasse produced more gas and less coke than pinewood. The liquid yields passed through a maximum at 500 °C. The catalytic pyrolysis with ZSM-5 generated a significantly greater amount of valuable aromatic compounds, such as toluene and C2-benzene isomers (xylenes and ethyl-benzene), which are petrochemical intermediates with high added values. The source of biomass proved to be relevant to define bio-oil chemical composition. Hydrocarbon and ketone yields were higher for pyrolysis of pinewood, while carboxylic acids, cycloketones, and O-heterocyclic compounds increased when bagasse was pyrolyzed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microwave enhanced fast and efficient alcoholysis (methanolysis and ethanolysis) of non-edible oils (algal, jatropha and pongamia) is achieved using chemically activated waste egg shell derived CaO (i.e. CaO(cesp)) as heterogeneous catalyst. CaO(cesp) was extracted from waste chicken egg shell and further activated chemically by supporting transition metal oxide. The maximum conversion was achieved using 3 wt% catalysts under 700 W microwave irradiation and 10:1 alcohol/oil ratio in 6 min. Alcoholysis using ZnO activated CaO(cesp) catalyst has shown higher reaction yields in comparison to other modified catalysts. Methanolysis has shown better biodiesel conversion in comparison to ethanolysis. The catalyst has shown longer lifetime and sustained activity after being used for four cycles. Due to more saturated fatty acid content; algal biodiesel has shown improved fuel properties in comparison to other biodiesels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper describes a novel integrated biorefinery based on fast pyrolysis and subsequent bio-oil upgrading to produce three product portfolios: hydrocarbon biofuels (gasoline and diesel), bio-based products (bioasphalt, calcium acetate, and dextrose), and hydrocarbon chemicals (aromatics, olefins, and fuel oil). Based on the economic assumptions and historical market prices of the products, we calculate internal rates of return (IRRs) of the biorefinery (2000 dry metric tons per day) over 30 years to evaluate its performance. Given the historical low, average, and high prices of the products, a total of 27 scenarios are explored and the maximum IRR for each scenario is determined. Results indicate that upgrading bio-oil to bio-based products yields the maximum IRR of 67.9% if bio-based products can be marketed at a historical high price level (between $257 and $1491 per metric ton) and an IRR of 42.5% at an average price level (between $240 and $950 per metric ton). Under some market conditions, the biorefinery should produce hydrocarbon chemicals or biofuels to increase the IRR. We also estimate the IRR probability distribution using Monte Carlo simulation by -incorporating distributions of product prices and bio-oil fractions allocated for three product portfolios. Average IRRs of −3.9% for biofuels, 42.7% for bio-based products, and 17.3% for hydrocarbon chemicals are observed with standard deviations of 24.4%, 24.1%, and 6.5%, respectively. The integrated -biorefinery exhibits an IRR distribution of 16.2% ± 16.4% suggesting that the integrated biorefinery could balance the economic disadvantages and benefits from individual product portfolio to achieve profitable IRRs. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

The physiochemical properties of syngas, bio-oil and biochar were assayed to understand the impact of pyrolysis temperature on these parameters and then to evaluate their potential values. The results showed that syngas yield (26.07–46.37%) increased with pyrolysis temperature, while biochar yield (47.54–26.83%) decreased. Bio-oil yield (26–30%) was hardly affected by pyrolysis temperature. Both syngas and bio-oil had poor values as direct fuel. The euhalophyte-derived biochar had higher aromaticity (H/C 0.16–0.85, O/C 0.06–0.26), higher cation exchange capacity (198.82–435.74 cmol kg−1), and higher K+ (59.35–80.42 g kg−1) and Na+ (37.56–53.26 g kg−1) compared with glycophyte-derived biochars. Our findings imply that halophyte biochar may be more suitable to use as a soil conditioner, which is worthy of further study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present work, an one-pot Aqueous Phase Reforming (APR) and Aqueous Phase Hydrogenolysis (APH) of crude glycerol in a batch reactor containing commercial SiO2Al2O3 supported 65%Ni catalyst is performed. The effect of: i) the glycerol's impurities, ii) the operating temperature (200-240 °C) and iii) the crude glycerol concentration (10-40 wt%) is investigated.The main gaseous products are H2, CH4 and CO2, while the main liquid products are propylene glycol (PG), ethylene glycol (EG), ethanol and acetol. The selectivities of the gaseous and liquid products are not strongly affected by the addition of low concentration impurities of methanol and sodium chloride. Glycerol's conversion increases as temperature and glycerol's concentration increases. Total conversion for both pure and crude glycerol is &gt;90%. The yield of the most useful liquid product (propylene glycol) is reaching up to 30% for a 40 wt% of crude glycerol solution at T = 240 °C and 4 h of reaction time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The lipase/acyltransferase from Candida parapsilosis (CpLIP2) immobilized on two synthetic resins (Accurel MP 1000 and Lewatit VP OC 1600) was used as catalyst for the production of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, FAME) by transesterification of jatropha oil with methanol, in a lipid/aqueous system. The oil was dispersed in a buffer solution (pH 6.5) containing methanol in excess (2 M in the biphasic system; molar ratio methanol/acyl chains 2:1). Transesterification was carried out at 30 °C, under magnetic stirring, using 10% (w/w) of immobilized enzyme in relation to oil. The maximum FAME yields were attained after 8 h reaction time: 80.5% and 93.8%, when CpLIP2 immobilized on Accurel MP 1000 or on Lewatit VP OC 1600 were used, respectively. CpLIP2 on both Accurel MP 1000 and Lewatit VP OC 1600 showed high operational stability along 5 consecutive 8 h batches. © 2016

AB  - With growing interest in the biomass value chain, a multitude of reactions are proposed in literature for the conversion of biomass into a variety of biofuels. In the early design stage, data for a detailed design is scarce rendering an in-depth analysis of all possibilities challenging. In this contribution, the screening methodology process network flux analysis (PNFA) is introduced assessing systematically the cost and energy performance of processing pathways. Based on the limited data available, a ranking of biorefinery pathways and a detection of bottlenecks is achieved by considering the reaction performance as well as the feasibility and energy demand of various separation strategies using thermodynamic sound shortcut models. PNFA is applied to a network of six gasoline biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. While 2-butanol is ruled out due to a lack in yield and selectivity, iso-butanol and 2-butanone are identified as economically promising fuels beyond ethanol.

AB  - Herein, we investigate the effects of altering the multifunctional nature of a series of FeMoP catalysts for biomass deoxygenation reactions. Unsupported FeMoP catalysts were synthesized at reduction temperatures between 650 °C and 850 °C. The reduction temperature used during the synthesis of FeMoP altered the surface properties of these materials (i.e., acidity and CO-titrated metal sites) while leaving the bulk crystal structure of FeMoP unaffected. This alteration in the surface properties significantly affected the catalytic performance of FeMoP materials in the deoxygenation reactions. The catalytic performance of the FeMoP catalysts was first investigated using the acid catalyzed, non-aqueous, dehydration of cyclohexanol. Aside from showing high selectivities to cyclohexene (>99%) for all catalysts, the experiments demonstrated that FeMoP-650 showed the highest initial rate due to the largest number of surface acid sites among these catalysts. In addition, these FeMoP catalysts were examined using the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol. While all FeMoP catalysts were highly selective to benzene (∼90%) at conversions less than 15%, studies at higher conversions of phenol provided evidence that catalysts with a higher amount of acid sites maintained enhanced selectivity to benzene. Furthermore, the stability of FeMoP catalysts for phenol HDO was tested with a 48 h time-on-stream (TOS) study. FeMoP exhibited excellent stability, as evidenced by the retention of the initial reaction rate, selectivity to benzene, and oxidation state of surface species throughout the TOS run. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study fundamentally investigated the pseudo-catalytic transesterification of dried Nannochloropsis oceanica into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) without oil extraction, which was achieved in less than 5 min via a thermo-chemical pathway. This study presented that the pseudo-catalytic transesterification reaction was achieved in the presence of silica and that its main driving force was identified as temperature: pores in silica provided the numerous reaction space like a micro-reactor, where the heterogeneous reaction was developed. The introduced FAME derivatization showed an extraordinarily high tolerance of impurities (i.e., pyrolytic products and various extractives). This study also explored the thermal cracking of FAMEs derived from N. oceanica: the thermal cracking of saturated FAMEs was invulnerable at temperatures lower than 400 °C. Lastly, this study reported that N. oceanica contained 14.4 wt.% of dried N. oceanica and that the introduced methylation technique could be applicable to many research fields sharing the transesterification platform. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Highly efficient hydrogen production can be produced via catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil. On the basis of fixed-bed reactor system, a bio-oil model compound (m-cresol) was steam reformed on commercial Ni-Co/MgO catalyst. Under the optimal reaction conditions of 850 °C and steam to carbon ratio 5:1, as high as 79.8% of hydrogen yield and 96.8% of carbon conversion can be obtained during 5 h time-on-stream. The results indicated that carbon elimination appears in temperature range of 400-600 °C, and the carbon can be removed completely through its combustion in the air flow at 600 °C. By using the recycling and secondary steam reforming of liquid toxics, the organic pollutants can be eliminated perfectly, and additional hydrogen production was recovered at 850 °C. The compositions of H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 in recovered gas production were 71.5%, 3.7%, 0.2% and 25.0%, respectively. High hydrogen composition of 71.5% was obtained due to the water-gas shift reactions to form hydrogen. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - A series of alkalized polysulfones (APSF) were synthesized by several chemical reactions (chloromethylation, quaternization and alkalization). Among these reactions, chloromethylation and quaternization are two key reactions and have been studied in detail regarding the optimization of both chloromethylation and quaternization. FTIR and 1H NMR spectrum confirmed the successful preparation of chloromethylated polysulfone. The best IEC of APSF was obtained for 1.68 meq g-1 under reaction time of 10 h and reaction temperature of 45 °C. The APSF membrane as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol was prepared through the method of solvent evaporation phase inversion. The effects of co-solvent types, mass ratios of soybean oil/co-solvent, water content and free fatty acids (FFAs) content in soybean oil on the conversions using the APSF membrane during transesterification were studied. The reusability of the APSF membrane and the kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by the APSF membrane were also investigated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Autothermal Chemical-Looping Reforming (a-CLR) is a process which allows hydrogen production avoiding the environmental penalty of CO2 emission typically produced in other processes. The major advantage of this technology is that the heat needed for syngas production is generated by the process itself. The heat necessary for the endothermic reactions is supplied by a Ni-based oxygen-carrier (OC) circulating between two reactors: the air reactor (AR), where the OC is oxidized by air, and the fuel reactor (FR), where the fuel is converted to syngas. Other important advantage is that this process also allows the production of pure N2 in the AR outlet stream. A renewable fuel such as bioethanol was chosen in this work due to their increasing worldwide production and the current excess of this fuel presented by different countries.In this work, mass and heat balances were done to determine the auto-thermal conditions that maximize H2 production, assuming that the product gas was in thermodynamic equilibrium. Three different types of bioethanol has been considered according to their ethanol purity; Dehydrated ethanol (≈100 vol.%), hydrated ethanol (≈96 vol.%), and diluted ethanol (≈52 vol.%). It has been observed that the higher H2 production (4.62 mol of H2 per mol of EtOH) has been obtained with the use of diluted ethanol and the surplus energy needed could be compensated by the energy save achieved during the purification of ethanol in the production process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy recovery from lignocellulosic solid marine wastes, Posidonia oceanica wastes (POW) with slow pyrolysis responds to the growing trend of alternative energies as well as waste management. Physicochemical, thermogravimetric (TG/DTG) and spectroscopic (FTIR) characterizations of POW were performed. POW were first converted by pyrolysis at different temperatures (450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C and 600 °C) using a fixed-bed reactor. The obtained products (bio-oil, syngas and bio char) were analyzed. Since the bio-oil yield obtained from POW pyrolysis is low (2 wt.%), waste frying oil (WFO) was added as a co-substrate in order to improve of biofuels production. The co-pyrolysis gave a better yield of liquid organic fraction (37 wt.%) as well as syngas (CH4, H2. . .) with a calorific value around 20 MJ/kg. The stoichiometric models of both pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis reactions were performed according to the biomass formula: CαHβOγNδSε. The thermal kinetic decomposition of solids was validated through linearized Arrhenius model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The base-catalyzed condensation of levulinic acid (LA) under mild conditions (0.1MPa, 323K, 0.45mol L-1 aq solution of levulinic acid, catalyst/reactant=1:24wt.) was proposed as a new approach for the upgrading of this molecule by using mixed oxides as catalysts. Three products were identified: α-angelica lactone (AL) and two aldol condensation adducts, LA-LA and AL-LA. These last ones (obtained with selectivities higher than 90 % at 30 % conversion upon using MgZr) present high value as fuel and chemical precursors. The distribution of basic and acidic sites on the catalyst governs the performance and selectivity of the catalyst, whereas the stability of the catalyst in the reaction media determines the deactivation behavior. Bulk MgZr oxides present a good balance of these properties. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - The study evaluates the technical feasibility of the fluidized bed gasification of three solid recovered fuels (SRFs), obtained as co-products of a recycling process. The SRFs were pelletized and fed to a pilot scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor, operated in gasification and co-gasification mode. The tests were carried out under conditions of thermal and chemical steady state, with a bed of olivine particles and at different values of equivalence ratio. The results provide a complete syngas characterization, in terms of its heating value and composition (including tars, particulates, and acid/basic pollutants) and of the chemical and physical characterization of bed material and entrained fines collected at the cyclone outlet. The feasibility of the fluidized bed gasification process of the different SRFs was evaluated with the support of a material and substance flow analysis, and a feedstock energy analysis. The results confirm the flexibility of fluidized bed reactor, which makes it one of the preferable technologies for the gasification of different kind of wastes, even in co-gasification mode. The fluidized bed gasification process of the tested SRFs appears technically feasible, yielding a syngas of valuable quality for energy applications in an appropriate plant configuration. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Macauba is a still little investigated and exploited palmaceae native to South America with a high oil yield (6200 kg/ha). Its almond oil is rich in lauric acid and presents low acidity. In this study, we carried out the transesterification of crude Macauba almond oil over homogeneous catalysts using methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and isobutanol. Its products were characterized by 1H NMR, kinematic viscosity, density, lubricity and cold performance through DSC analysis and cold filter plugging point. A worse conversion to monoesters was obtained over the isopropyl route, while high conversions were observed with ethanol if compared with methanol. Also, winterization of the ethanolysis product was conducted and the crystallization temperatures of the synthesized biofuels and blends with fossil diesel or jet fuel were evaluated. The results indicate the feasibility of replacing conventional commercial biodiesel with those proposed in this work as they exhibit possible performance gains. However, the preliminary results indicate that only small proportions could fit the biojet fuel performance specifications at low temperatures. ©2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using FeCl3-modified resin as heterogeneous catalyst was investigated. In the optimum conditions, Fe load rate of resin of 10.97%. Comparison of effects of modified resin, unmodified resin, and homogeneous catalyst (FeCl3·6H2O) for the transesterification of waste cooking oil and methanol revealed that the transesterification rate of modified resin as catalyst reached 92.13%, which was 13.37% and 27.81% higher than those of unmodified resin and FeCl3·6H2O as catalysts, respectively. After the ninth run of reusing modified resin, transesterification rate stilled reach 73%. The result of NH3-Fourier transform infrared analysis proved that FeCl3 reacted with Bronsted acid site (SO3H) to form a new Lewis acid site. Results of Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that -OH group disappeared and no crystalline phase was present in modified resin, which illustrated that the new Lewis acid site was formed by chemical reactions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to develop a sono-assisted acid pretreatment strategy for the effective removal of lignin and hemicelluloses and to improve the sugar yield from chili post harvest residue. Operational parameters that affect the pretreatment efficiency were studied and optimized. Inhibitor analysis of the hydrolyzate revealed that major fermentation inhibitors like furfural, hydroxymethyl furfural and organic acids like citric acid, succinic acid and propionic acid were absent. Changes in structural properties of the biomass were studied in relation to the pretreatment process using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis, and the changes in chemical composition was also monitored. The biomass pretreated with the optimized novel method yielded 0.465 g/g of reducing sugars on enzymatic hydrolysis. Fermentation of the non-detoxified hydrolysate yielded 2.14% of bioethanol with a fermentation efficiency of 71.03%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - So far, the effect of the carbon matrix on ORR catalytic efficiency over carbon/cobalt oxide nanohybrids in biofuel cells has not been investigated, which is vital to guiding the scientific research on ORR catalysts. Moreover, although cobalt oxide crystals have been reported with electrocatalytic activity, studies on square-like nano cobalt oxide are very few, and it has not been reported as an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst, let alone used in biofuel cells. Thus, herein, square-like nano cobalt oxide anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG/Co-NS), carbon nanotube (CNT/Co-NS) and carbon black (CB/Co-NS) were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method for the application as an ORR catalyst in microbial fuel cells (MFC). The results indicated that NG/Co-NS exhibited outstanding ORR activity with a more positive on-set potential (-0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and higher limiting diffusion current (5.8 mA cm-2 at -0.8 V) than CB/Co-NS and CNT/Co-NS, attributed to the synergistic catalytic effect of NG and Co-NS. Besides, in MFC tests, the maximum power density of NG/Co-NS was improved significantly to 713.6 mW m-2, which was 24.9% higher than Pt/C (571.3 mW m-2, 0.2 mg Pt cm-2). In addition, the internal resistance of MFCs with NG/Co-NS was lower than CB/Co-NS and CNT/Co-NS, which favored the electricity generation performance. Thus, NG/Co-NS was promising material for an alternative oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst of Pt/C in MFCs. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - N rich porous carbon based solid acids (NPC-[CxN][X]) have been successfully synthesized by treatment of N rich porous carbon (NPC) with various quaternary ammoniation reagents such as iodomethane, 1,3-propane sultone, and 1,4-butanesultone, and ion exchange with various strong acids such as HSO3CF3, H2SO4, H3PW12O40, HBF4etc. The NPC support was synthesized by carbonization of KOH-activated polypyrrole without using additional templates. Various characterizations showed that NPC-[CxN][X] possesses abundant nanopores, large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas, good stability, and strong and controllable acid sites with Brønsted characteristics. The immobilized acidic groups were homogeneously dispersed into NPC-[CxN][X]. Notably, NPC-[CxN][X] acted as efficient, reusable and generalized solid acids, which showed excellent activity in various acid-catalyzed reactions such as esterification and transesterification in the synthesis of biodiesel, dehydration of fructose into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, depolymerization of crystalline cellulose into sugars, and condensation of phenol with acetone in the synthesis of bisphenol A, much higher than that of various solid acids such as Amberlyst 15, H-ZSM-5, H-USY, and sulfonic group functionalized ordered mesoporous silicas. The preparation of NPC-[CxN][X] leads to the development of porous carbon based solid acids with controllable structural characteristics and excellent catalytic activity. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of furfural is an important reaction for the production of biofuels because its product, 2-methylfuran, has excellent fuel properties: it can be added easily to the existing gasoline pool and it is renewable and, therefore, carbon neutral. The reaction network of hydrodeoxygenation is a two-step reaction from furfural to furfuryl alcohol and then to 2-methylfuran. Silica-supported Cu is a mild hydrogenation catalyst that is selective for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. We have found that Fe-containing Cu-based catalysts show much higher reactivity and very high selectivity towards 2-methylfuran (85 %+). It is of interest to understand the structural and chemical effects of the Fe promotion (0.15 % w/w) over the Cu catalyst (1 % Cu w/w) and characterize the species responsible for the high hydrogenation performance. Our investigations indicate that after the catalyst is pretreated in hydrogen, Cu is reduced fully, whereas Fe is only reduced partially (a mixture of FeIII and FeII is observed). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy suggests that FeII species are present on the catalyst surface, as indicated by the adsorption of NO. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Bioproduction of hydrocarbons is one of the challenges facing post-peak oil production in the future. A credible option for the production of sustainable biodiesel or biojetfuels could be microalgae oils. The species Botryococcus braunii has attracted particular interest due to its ability to accumulate large amounts of long-chain hydrocarbons, according to some special characteristics, which differentiate it from other organisms, as well as plants or bacteria. Indeed, the same species includes strains producing a high chimiodiversity of hydrocarbons, strains therefore classified into four races. In addition, this photosynthetic microorganism accumulates high hydrocarbon concentrations, which are trapped in an extracellular matrix, composed of polysaccharides and polymerized hydrocarbons. However, more work is required to understand the biological processes involved in the control of extracellular hydrocarbon accumulation. Recently, despite their slow growth rates, some strains of this microalga were grown relatively efficiently as continuous cultures in controlled photobioreactors. Potential perspectives would depend on current studies focusing on ways to improve the return on investments through either a milking-like process to separate biomass from hydrocarbons production or co-valorization of the biomass residues according to biorefinery approaches to produce compounds of industrial interest, from carotenoids to squalene, and even syngas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The work was concerned with improving understanding of the chemical and physical trade-offs when employing transient over-fuelling to control auto-ignition in gasoline spark ignition engines under knock intensities not usually tolerated in optical engines. The single cylinder engine used included full bore overhead optical access capable of withstanding unusually high in-cylinder pressures. Heavy knock was deliberately induced by adopting inlet air heating and a primary reference fuel blend of reduced octane rating. High-speed chemiluminescence imaging and simultaneous in-cylinder pressure data measurement were used to evaluate the combustion events. Under normal operation the engine was operated under port fuel injection with a stoichiometric air-fuel mixture. Multiple centred auto-ignition events were regularly observed, with knock intensities of up to ∼30 bar. Additional excess fuel was then introduced directly into the end-gas in short transient bursts. As the mass of excess fuel was progressively increased a trade-off was apparent, with knock intensity first increasing by up to 65% before lower unburned gas temperatures suppressed knock under extremely rich conditions. This trade-off is not usually observed during conventional low intensity knock suppression via over-fuelling and has been associated with the competing effects of reducing auto-ignition delay time and charge cooling/ratio of specific heats. Overall, the results demonstrate the risks in employing excess fuel to suppress knock deep within a heavy knocking combustion regime (potentially including a Super-Knock regime). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: Catalytic fast pyrolysis is the most promising approach for biofuel production due to its simple process and versatility to handle lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks with varying and complex compositions. Compared with in situ catalytic fast pyrolysis, ex situ catalytic pyrolysis has the flexibility of optimizing the pyrolysis step and catalytic process individually to improve the quality of pyrolysis oil (stability, oxygen content, acid number, etc.) and to maximize the carbon efficiency in the conversion of biomass to pyrolysis oil. Hydrodeoxygenation is one of the key catalytic functions in ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis. Recently, Fe-based catalysts have been reported to exhibit superior catalytic properties in the hydrodeoxygenation of model compounds in pyrolysis oil, which potentially makes the ex situ pyrolysis of biomass commercially viable due to the abundance and low cost of Fe. Here, we briefly summarize the recent progress on Fe-based catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of biomass, and provide perspectives on how to further improve Fe-based catalysts (activity and stability) for their potential applications in the emerging area of biomass conversion.

AB  - Volatile organic acids are byproducts of fermentative metabolism, for example, anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass or organic wastes, and are often times undesired inhibiting cell growth and reducing directed formation of the desired products. Here, we devised a general framework for upgrading these volatile organic acids to high-value esters that can be used as flavors, fragrances, solvents, and biofuels. This framework employs the acid-to-ester modules, consisting of an AAT (alcohol acyltransferase) plus ACT (acyl CoA transferase) submodule and an alcohol submodule, for co-fermentation of sugars and organic acids to acyl CoAs and alcohols to form a combinatorial library of esters. By assembling these modules with the engineered Escherichia coli modular chassis cell, we developed microbial manufacturing platforms to perform the following functions: (i) rapid in vivo screening of novel AATs for their catalytic activities; (ii) expanding combinatorial biosynthesis of unique fermentative esters; and (iii) upgrading volatile organic acids to esters using single or mixed cell cultures. To demonstrate this framework, we screened for a set of five unique and divergent AATs from multiple species, and were able to determine their novel activities as well as produce a library of 12 out of the 13 expected esters from co-fermentation of sugars and (C2-C6) volatile organic acids. We envision the developed framework to be valuable for in vivo characterization of a repertoire of not-well-characterized natural AATs, expanding the combinatorial biosynthesis of fermentative esters, and upgrading volatile organic acids to high-value esters.

AB  - Mesoporous silica nanoparticles were synthesized by using tannic acid as a pore-forming agent, which is an environmentally friendly, cheap, and non-surfactant template. SEM and TEM images indicated that the tannic acid-templated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (TA-MSNs) are monodisperse spherical-like particles with an average diameter of 195 ± 16 nm. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) results showed that the TA-MSNs had a relatively high surface area (447 m2/g) and large pore volume (0.91 cm3/g), and the mean pore size was ca. 10.1 nm. Burkholderia cepacia lipase was immobilized on the TA-MSNs by physical adsorption for the first time, and the properties of immobilized lipase (BCL@TA-MSNs) were investigated. The BCL@TA-MSNs exhibited satisfactory thermal stability; strong tolerance to organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isooctane, n-hexane, and tetrahydrofuran; and high operational reusability when BCL@TA-MSNs were applied in esterification and transesterification reactions. After recycling 15 times in the transesterification reaction for biodiesel production, over 85 % of biodiesel yield can be maintained. With these desired characteristics, the TA-MSNs may provide excellent candidates for enzyme immobilization. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the hydrotreatment of bio-oil in a continuous packed-bed reactor at around 375°C and 70 bar. The bio-oil was produced from the grinding pyrolysis of mallee wood in a grinding pyrolysis pilot plant. Our results indicate that the lighter and heavier components in the same bio-oil could behave very differently. Their behaviour can be affected very significantly by the overall bio-oil liquid hourly space velocity. While the residence time of the light species that evaporate instantly could be very short, the residence time of heavy species passing through the catalyst bed in the form of liquid could be very long. When a commercial pre-sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst came into contact with the heavy bio-oil species, significant exothermic reactions would take place, which result in the deactivation of hyperactive sites in the catalyst. The NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst used was less active in hydrotreating the heavier bio-oil species than in hydrotreating the lighter bio-oil species. However, even at very low extents of hydrotreatment, the bio-oil structure and properties, e.g. coking propensity, could be drastically improved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Applications of bio-oil are limited by its challenging properties including high moisture content, low pH, high viscosity, high oxygen content, and low heating value. Separation of switchgrass bio-oil components by adding water, organic solvents (hexadecane and octane), and sodium hydroxide may help to overcome these issues. Acetic acid and phenolic compounds were extracted in aqueous and organic phases, respectively. Polar chemicals, such as acetic acid, did not partition in the organic solvent phase. Acetic acid in the aqueous phase after extraction is beneficial for a microbial-electrolysis-cell application to produce hydrogen as an energy source for further hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil. Organic solvents extracted more chemicals from bio-oil in combined than in sequential extraction; however, organic solvents partitioned into the aqueous phase in combined extraction. When sodium hydroxide was added to adjust the pH of aqueous bio-oil, organic-phase precipitation occurred. As the pH was increased, a biphasic aqueous/organic dispersion was formed, and phase separation was optimized at approximately pH 6. The neutralized organic bio-oil had approximately 37% less oxygen and 100% increased heating value than the initial centrifuged bio-oil. The less oxygen content and increased heating value indicated a significant improvement of the bio-oil quality through neutralization. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising technique for the production of bio-oil. The process produces an oil phase, a gas phase, a solid residue, and an aqueous phase. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is used to analyze the complex aqueous phase. Especially small organic acids and nitrogen-containing compounds are of interest. The efficient derivatization reagent methyl chloroformate was used to make analysis of the complex aqueous phase from hydrothermal liquefaction of dried distillers grains with solubles possible. A circumscribed central composite design was used to optimize the responses of both derivatized and nonderivatized analytes, which included small organic acids, pyrazines, phenol, and cyclic ketones. Response surface methodology was used to visualize significant factors and identify optimized derivatization conditions (volumes of methyl chloroformate, NaOH solution, methanol, and pyridine). Twenty-nine analytes of small organic acids, pyrazines, phenol, and cyclic ketones were quantified. An additional three analytes were pseudoquantified with use of standards with similar mass spectra. Calibration curves with high correlation coefficients were obtained, in most cases R 2 &gt; 0.991. Method validation was evaluated with repeatability, and spike recoveries of all 29 analytes were obtained. The 32 analytes were quantified in samples from the commissioning of a continuous flow reactor and in samples from recirculation experiments involving the aqueous phase. The results indicated when the steady-state condition of the flow reactor was obtained and the effects of recirculation. The validated method will be especially useful for investigations of the effect of small organic acids on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The utilization of biomass and agricultural wastes for production of biofuels is of interest as a research topic, since it could provide a cheaper process due to the wide availability and low cost of raw materials. RESULTS: In this work the vapor phase hydrogenation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone over copper catalysts supported on ZrO2 was investigated. The catalysts were prepared by a wet impregnation method with Cu loadings varying from 2 to 20wt% and characterized by various physico-chemical techniques. It was observed that copper dispersion and particle size obtained using a N2O decomposition method are in agreement with the findings derived from XRD and TPR. The catalytic functionalities are discussed in relation to the dispersion of copper and other structural properties of Cu species supported on ZrO2. A comparison of catalytic results of Cu/ZrO2 was made with CuO supported on Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of 5wt% copper on ZrO2 resulted in well dispersed copper oxide on the support, evidenced by XRD, TPR and N2O decomposition studies. This catalyst exhibited good conversion (81%) of levulinic acid with good selectivity (83%) towards γ-valerolactone. The activity results are directly related to the dispersion of copper and acidity. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Finding a more efficient method for the transesterification of triglycerides to biodiesel fuel (BD) is important in today's world. In this study, transesterification of trilaurin was carried out in a solution containing 4wt% of the Lewis acid AlCl3 dissolved in a cosolvent of ethanol and 5 MPa CO2. A conversion rate of over 90% was achieved within 1h at the low temperature of 180°C. The process indicates a co-catalytic effect of the Lewis acid and CO2. We postulate several key steps for the mechanism. First, the CO2-ethanol mixture enhances the hydrogen bonding, increasing the concentration of C2H5O<sup/>. Second AlCl3 attacks the oxygen of COC to weaken the bonds to form carbonyl carbon OR1, which is then easily attacked by C2H5O<sup/> to give the transesterified product (C2H4COOR1). Third, AlCl3 is finally replaced by H to form glycerin (GL) and intermediates, such as unmethyl esterified compounds (uME). AlCl3 was used as a flocculant and catalyst for converting waste cooking oil (WCO) to BD. The process achieved 97% free fatty acid (FFA) conversion at 120°C in 90min, making it one of the most efficient systems available for WCO recovery. AlCl3 was also successfully applied to microalgae, signaling the potential for a process that combines harvesting, lipid extraction, and transterification, leading to fully integrated, microalgae-based BD production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Strategies to improve copper-catalyzed alkaline hydrogen peroxide (Cu-AHP) pretreatment of hybrid poplar were investigated. These improvements included a combination of increasing hydrolysis yields, while simultaneously decreasing process inputs through (i) more efficient utilization of H2O2 and (ii) the addition of an alkaline extraction step prior to the metal-catalyzed AHP pretreatment. We hypothesized that utilizing this improved process could substantially lower the chemical inputs needed during pretreatment. Results: Hybrid poplar was pretreated utilizing a modified process in which an alkaline extraction step was incorporated prior to the Cu-AHP treatment step and H2O2 was added batch-wise over the course of 10 h. Our results revealed that the alkaline pre-extraction step improved both lignin and xylan solubilization, which ultimately led to improved glucose (86 %) and xylose (95 %) yields following enzymatic hydrolysis. An increase in the lignin solubilization was also observed with fed-batch H2O2 addition relative to batch-only addition, which again resulted in increased glucose and xylose yields (77 and 93 % versus 63 and 74 %, respectively). Importantly, combining these strategies led to significantly improved sugar yields (96 % glucose and 94 % xylose) following enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, we found that we could substantially lower the chemical inputs (enzyme, H2O2, and catalyst), while still maintaining high product yields utilizing the improved Cu-AHP process. This pretreatment also provided a relatively pure lignin stream consisting of ≥90 % Klason lignin and only 3 % xylan and 2 % ash following precipitation. Two-dimensional heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (2D HSQC) NMR and size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that the solubilized lignin was high molecular weight (Mw ≈ 22,000 Da) and only slightly oxidized relative to lignin from untreated poplar. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the fed-batch, two-stage Cu-AHP pretreatment process was effective in pretreating hybrid poplar for its conversion into fermentable sugars. Results showed sugar yields near the theoretical maximum were achieved from enzymatically hydrolyzed hybrid poplar by incorporating an alkaline extraction step prior to pretreatment and by efficiently utilizing H2O2 during the Cu-AHP process. Significantly, this study reports high sugar yields from woody biomass treated with an AHP pretreatment under mild reaction conditions. © 2016 Bhalla et al.

AB  - Aquifer contamination with diesel fuel is a worldwide environmental problem, and related available remediation technologies may not be adequately efficient, especially for the simultaneous treatment of both solid and water phases. In this paper, a lab-scale 2.45 GHz microwave (MW) treatment of an artificially diesel-contaminated aquifer was applied to investigate the effects of operating power (160, 350 and 500 W) and time on temperature profiles and contaminant removal from both solid and water phases. Results suggest that in diesel-contaminated aquifer MW remediation, power significantly influences the final reachable temperature and, consequently, contaminant removal kinetics. A maximum temperature of about 120 °C was reached at 500 W. Observed temperature values depended on the simultaneous irradiation of both aquifer grains and groundwater. In this case, solid phase heating is limited by the maximum temperature that interstitial water can reach before evaporation. A minimal residual diesel concentration of about 100 mg kg-1 or 100 mg L-1 was achieved by applying a power of 500 W for a time of 60 min for the solid or water phase, respectively. Measured residual TPH fractions showed that MW heating resulted in preferential effects of the removal of different TPH molecular weight fractions and that the evaporation-stripping phenomena plays a major role in final contaminant removal processes. The power low kinetic equation shows an excellent fit (r2 &gt; 0.993) with the solid phase residual concentration observed for all the powers investigated. A maximum diesel removal of 88 or 80% was observed for the MW treatment of the solid or water phase, respectively, highlighting the possibility to successfully and simultaneously remediate both the aquifer phases. Consequently, MW, compared to other biological or chemical-physical treatments, appears to be a better choice for the fast remediation of diesel-contaminated aquifers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Furan, an important product from catalytic pyrolysis of biomass, has the potential to be further converted into value-added chemicals or biofuels. This study investigated the conversion of furan into benzofuran over a Brønsted acid catalyst (Amberlyst 70) at 140-190°C in various solvents. With water as the solvent, furan could barely make its way to benzofuran as its polymerization dominated. With methanol as the solvent, the polymerization of furan was suppressed and benzofuran formation was enhanced substantially. This is because in methanol, the reactive intermediates (i.e., aldehydes) were stabilized and their involvement in polymerization reactions was suppressed. Other alcohols showed similar effects on suppressing polymerization. In dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the polymerization of furan was also effectively suppressed. However, furan was not converted to benzofuran but to levulinic acid via a distinct reaction route. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - This work describes in detail one potential conversion process for the production of high-octane gasoline blendstock via indirect liquefaction of biomass. The processing steps of this pathway include the conversion of biomass to synthesis gas via indirect gasification, gas clean-up via reforming of tars and other hydrocarbons, catalytic conversion of syngas to methanol, methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether (DME), and the homologation of DME over a zeolite catalyst to high-octane gasoline-range hydrocarbon products. The current process configuration has similarities to conventional methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) technologies, but there are key distinctions, specifically regarding the product slate, catalysts, and reactor conditions. A techno-economic analysis is performed to investigate the production of high-octane gasoline blendstock. The design features a processing daily capacity of 2000 tonnes (2205 short tons) of dry biomass. The process yields 271 liters of liquid fuel per dry tonne of biomass (65 gal/dry ton), for an annual fuel production rate of 178 million liters (47 MM gal) at 90% on-stream time. The estimated total capital investment for an nth-plant is $438 million. The resulting minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) is $0.86 per liter or $3.25 per gallon in 2011 US dollars. A rigorous sensitivity analysis captures uncertainties in costs and plant performance. Sustainability metrics for the conversion process are quantified and assessed. The potential premium value of the high-octane gasoline blendstock is examined and found to be at least as competitive as fossil-derived blendstocks. A simple blending strategy is proposed to demonstrate the potential for blending the biomass-derived blendstock with petroleum-derived intermediates. Published 2015.

AB  - Deactivation of bio-oil hydrotreating catalysts remains a significant challenge because of the poor quality of pyrolysis bio-oil input for hydrotreating and understanding their deactivation mode is critical to developing improved catalysts and processes. In this research, we developed an understanding of the deactivation of two-step bio-oil hydrotreating catalysts (sulfided Ru/C and sulfided CoMo/C) through detailed characterization of the catalysts using various analytical techniques. Severe fouling of both catalysts by carbonaceous species was the major form of deactivation, which is consistent with the significant loss of surface area and pore volume of both deactivated catalysts and the significant increase of the bulk density. Further analysis of the carbonaceous species by thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the carbonaceous species was formed by condensation reaction of active species such as sugars and sugar derivatives (aldehydes and ketones) in bio-oil feedstock during bio-oil hydrotreating under the conditions and catalysts used. Microscopy results did not show metal sintering of the Ru/C catalyst. However, X-ray diffraction indicated a probable transformation of the highly-active CoMoS phase in the sulfided CoMo/C catalyst to Co8S9 and MoS2 phase with low activity. Loss of the active site by transport of inorganic elements from the bio-oil and the reactor construction material onto the catalyst surface also might be a cause of deactivation as indicated by elemental analysis of spent catalysts. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Montmorillonite-hydrochar nanocomposite is of great significance in biofuel production, energy storage and conversion, catalysis, environmental protection, and biology and medicine. To understand how montmorillonite facilitates the conversion of cellulose into hydrochar, it is essential to accurately control the properties and structure of hydrochar and its nanocomposites for technological applications. In this work, hydrochar and montmorillonite-hydrochar nanocomposites were produced by hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose at 200 °C for 2-24 h in the absence and the presence of montmorillonite. The roles of montmorillonite in the formation of hydrochar were explored in detail. Results showed that montmorillonite acted as a catalyst, an adsorbent, and an inorganic template for hydrochar formation. The formation process of montmorillonite-hydrochar nanocomposite can be divided into two stages: first, the hydrolysis of cellulose yielding degraded liquid products (e.g. glucose, fructose, and organic acids); second, the formed liquid products were adsorbed by montmorillonite, which catalyzed condensation and aromatization to form hydrochar particles on the surface of montmorillonite. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Experiments with a process development unit for fast pyrolysis of biomass residues of 10kgh-1 have been performed to quantify the impact of two different product recovery options. Wheat straw, miscanthus and scrap wood have been used as feedstock. A separate recovery of char increases the organic oil yield as compared to a combined recovery of char and organic condensate (OC). Furthermore, it allows for an alternative use of the byproduct char which represents an important product fraction for the high ash biomass residues under consideration. The char produced shows little advantage over its biomass precursor when considered as energy carrier due to its high ash content. Significant value can be added by demineralizing and activating the char. The potential to increase the economic feasibility of fast pyrolysis is shown by an assessment of the bioliq® process chain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass waste is increasingly recognised as a good feedstock and a carbon source with different components and applications. One example of this type of feedstock is the agro-food waste from the external part of melon rind. Indeed, this material is fairly rich in carbohydrates, phenolic compounds and fatty acids. The carbohydrate fraction of melon rind is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin, with glucose, xylose and galactose being the major monosaccharides present. Typically, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is obtained by the dehydration of monosaccharides (hexoses such as glucose or fructose) at high temperature using an acid catalyst in aqueous solution. In this process levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid (FA) are formed as by-products. In the work described here, the application of microwave radiation and conventional heating in this process was studied along with the use of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and the clay Montmorillonite KSF (M-KSF) as catalysts. Improvements were observed when the reactions were carried out in a biphasic system (water/THF) as this provides a more effective product extraction than the monophasic systems studied. The highest 5-HMF and LA recoveries (6 and 2%, respectively) were obtained with a combination of the biphasic systems and microwave radiation with M-KSF as the catalyst. The results obtained highlight the opportunities for the transformation of the melon rind carbohydrate fraction into a source of biofuel precursors. This transformation can be achieved in a clean and efficient manner using environmentally friendly techniques. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conversion of plant oil to biodiesel was investigated using liquid lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus. Presence of 2–3% water was necessary to preserve the enzymatic activity under methanolysis (3 × 0.5 equivalents of MeOH added in steps). Several individual reaction blocks were investigated and became the individual segments of the full kinetic scheme. Additional reaction schemes were introduced to imitate changing solubility/surface area of the reactants in aqueous and organic phases. The relevant rate constants were evaluated and included into a mathematical model. The experimental results and computer modeling showed that conversion of oil to 92–97% of biodiesel is feasible at 1% enzyme load (24 h, 35 °C) using the feedstocks containing 2–20% of water, 0–10% of glycerol, 0–20% of free fatty acids (“F”). The enzyme can be collected in a narrow white layer settled between biodiesel and glycerol-water phases, containing also “F” and monoglycerides (“M”). The lipase can be then reused after compensation for 5–10% loss of the enzyme. The main contaminants in the produced biodiesel are “F” (2–6%) and “M” (1–3%). Monoglycerides decrease below 0.2% if methanolysis is continued after separation of glycerol, while the level of “F” slightly increases. Major amounts of “F” and “M” are removed after brief mixing of biodiesel with alkali (2–5% of 5 M NaOH) and centrifugation. The obtained product is within the specification limits, which makes application of liquid lipase a perspective method for a large scale production of biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ignition and combustion characteristics of single droplets of a crude glycerol were experimentally studied and compared with those of pure glycerol, a petroleum diesel, a biodiesel, and ethanol. A single fuel droplet was suspended at the tip of a silicon carbide fibre undergoing heating, ignition and combustion in an electrically heated horizontal tube furnace at an air temperature ranging from 948 K to 1048 K. The ignition and combustion behaviour of the droplet were recorded using a CCD camera. Ignition delay time, total combustion time, burning rate, and flame standoff ratio were estimated. At a same temperature, the ignition delay time and total combustion time followed the order of pure glycerol > crude glycerol > ethanol > biodiesel > diesel, while the burning rate followed the order of crude glycerol > diesel > biodiesel > ethanol > pure glycerol, suggesting that the impurities, mainly water and methanol, had a profound influence on the combustion characteristics of crude glycerol. The flame standoff ratio slightly decreased after ignition but continuously increased with time afterwards for the crude glycerol and remained almost unchanged for the pure glycerol, indicating the significant influence of impurities on the quasi-steadiness of the flame. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sorbents for CO2 capture have been prepared by wet impregnation of a commercial active carbon (Ketjen-black, Akzo Nobel) with two CO2-philic compounds, polyethylenimine (PEI) and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), respectively. The effects of amine amount (from 10 to 70 wt.%), CO2 concentration in the feed, sorption temperature and gas hourly space velocity on the CO2 capture performance have been investigated. The sorption capacity has been evaluated using the breakthrough method, with a fixed bed reactor equipped with on line gas chromatograph. The samples have been characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX). A promising CO2 sorption capacity of 6.90 mmol/gsorbent has been obtained with 70 wt.% of supported TEPA at 70°C under a stream containing 80 vol% of CO2. Sorption tests, carried out with simulated biogas compositions (CH4/CO2 mixtures), have revealed an appreciable CO2 separation selectivity; stable performance was maintained for 20 adsorption–desorption cycles. © 2016

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to investigate the direct hydrothermal liquefaction of oil mill wastewater (OMWW). Experiments were carried out at different temperatures (240-300 °C), water contents (58-88 wt.%) and reaction times (15-45 min). Results show that the highest bio-oil yield was about 58 wt.%, resulting in a higher heating value of 38 MJ/kg. This was conducted at the following optimal conditions: water content 88 wt.%, a temperature of 280 °C, and 30 min as reaction time. To put bio-oil into wide application, the various physical and chemical characteristics were determined. A detailed chemical composition analysis of bio-oil was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID). The dominant compounds were identified by using NIST library. Analyses show that the bio-oil contains mainly oleic acid, hexadecanoic acid, fatty acid methyl ester, fatty acid ethyl ester, amino acid derived compounds and phenolic compounds. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The pinewood was pyrolyzed in the first reactor at a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 from room temperature to 700 °C, and the vapor was allowed to be cracked through the second reactor in a temperature range of 450-750 °C without and with HZSM-5. Attempts were made to determine a wide spectrum of gaseous and liquid products, as well as the mass and element partitions to gas, water, bio-oil, coke and char. HZSM-5 showed a preferential deoxygenation effect via the facilitated decarbonylation and decarboxylation with the inhibited dehydration at 550-600 °C. This catalyst also displayed a high selectivity for the formations of aromatic hydrocarbons and olefins by the promoted hydrogen transfer to these products at 550-600 °C. The bio-oil produced with HZSM-5 at 500-600 °C had the yields of 14.5-16.8%, the high heat values of 39.1-42.4 MJ kg-1, and the energy recoveries of 33-35% (all dry biomass basis). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Heterotrophic microalgae, Aurantiochytrium sp. KRS101 had a large amount of lipid (56.8% total lipids). The cells in the culture medium were easily ruptured due to thin cell wall of Aurantiochytrium sp., which facilitated in-situ fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) production directly from biomass. The harvested biomass had a high content of free fatty acids (FFAs), which was advantageous for glycerol-free FAMEs production. FAMEs were directly produced from Aurantiochytrium sp. KRS101 biomass (48.4% saponifiable lipids) using Novozyme 435-catalyzed in-situ esterification in dimethyl carbonate (DMC). DMC was used as a lipid extraction reagent, acyl acceptor and reaction medium. A 433.09 mg FAMEs/g biomass was obtained with 89.5% conversion under the optimal condition: DMC to biomass ratio of 5:1 (v/w) and enzyme to biomass ratio of 30% (w/w) at 50 °C for 12 h. Glycerol could not be detected in the produced FAMEs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bionics (the imitation or abstraction of the “inventions of nature) and, to an even greater extent, synthetic biology, will be as relevant to engineering development and industry as the silicon chip was over the last 50 years. Chemical industries already use so-called “white biotechnology” for new processes, new raw materials, and more sustainable use of resources. Synthetic biology is also used for the development of second-generation biofuels and for harvesting the sun's energy with the help of tailor-made microorganisms or biometrically designed catalysts. The market potential for bionics in medicine, engineering processes, and DNA storage is huge. “Moonshot” projects are already aggressively focusing on diseases and new materials, and a US-led competition is currently underway with the aim of creating a thousand new molecules. This article describes a timeline that starts with current projects and then moves on to code engineering projects and their implications, artificial DNA, signaling molecules, and biological circuitry. Beyond these projects, one of the next frontiers in bionics is the design of synthetic metabolisms that include artificial food chains and foods, and the bioengineering of raw materials; all of which will lead to new insights into biological principles. Bioengineering will be an innovation motor just as digitalization is today. This article discusses pertinent examples of bioengineering, particularly the use of alternative carbon-based biofuels and the techniques and perils of cell modification. Big data, analytics, and massive storage are important factors in this next frontier. Although synthetic biology will be as pervasive and transformative in the next 50 years as digitization and the Internet are today, its applications and impacts are still in nascent stages. This article provides a general taxonomy in which the development of bioengineering is classified in five stages (DNA analysis, bio-circuits, minimal genomes, protocells, xenobiology) from the familiar to the unknown, with implications for safety and security, industrial development, and the development of bioengineering and biotechnology as an interdisciplinary field. Ethical issues and the importance of a public debate about the consequences of bionics and synthetic biology are discussed. © 2016 THE AUTHORS

AB  - d-Fructose dehydrogenase (FDH), a flavoprotein-cytochrome c complex, exhibits high activity in direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalysis. One of the three types of heme c in FDH is the electron-donating site to the electrodes, and another heme c is presumed to not be involved in the catalytic cycle. In order to confirm the electron transfer pathway, we constructed three mutants in which the sixth axial methionine ligand (M301, M450, or M578) of one of the hemes was replaced with glutamine, which was selected with the expectation that it would shift the formal potential of the hemes in the negative direction. An M450Q mutant successfully reduced the overpotential by approximately 0.2 V, giving a limiting current close to that of the native FDH. In contrast, an M301Q mutant remained almost unchanged and an M578Q mutant drastically decreased DET-type catalytic activity. The results indicate that the electron transfer in the native FDH occurs in sequence from the flavin, through the heme c with M578, to the heme c with M450 (as the electron-donating site to the electrodes), without going through the heme c with M301. The M450Q mutant will be useful for biofuel cells because of the decreased overpotential. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion processes such as supercritical fluid extraction are used for producing biofuels from biomass. Supercritical fluid extraction process is decomposition process of lignocellulose or other organic materials thermally under supercritical conditions at 250-400 °C temperature range under high pressure (4-5 MPa). In this study, the supercritical fluid extraction was used to produce bio-oils from algae. Supercritical fluid extraction trials were performed in a cylindrical reactor (75 mL) in organic solvents (acetone, ethanol and isopropanol) under supercritical conditions with (ferric chloride, potassium hydroxide) and without catalyst at the temperatures of 255, 275 and 295 °C. The effects of process variables including temperature and catalyst on product yields were investigated. The produced liquids at 295 °C in supercritical liquefaction were analyzed and characterized by elemental, GC-MS and FT-IR. 160, 122 and 108 different types of compounds were identified by GC-MS obtained in acetone, ethanol and isopropanol respectively. Bio-oils from supercritical liquefaction were composed of various organics including aromatics, nitrogenated and oxygenated compounds. Bio-oils obtained from supercritical liquefaction were found to have higher calorific values and superior fuel properties compared to feedstock. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The biodiesel production can be carried out by transesterification using either chemical or enzymatic process. The enzymatic transesterification is more promising as it offers an environmental friendly option compared to the chemical process, where the lipases with high catalytic efficiency and good stability play a key role. Hence, it is of great value to identify novel lipases which are suitable for biodiesel production. Results: A lipase gene (ReLipA) from Rhizomucor endophyticus was cloned and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. ReLipA shared the highest identity of 61 % with the lipases from Rhizopus delemar, Rhizopus oryzae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The recombinant lipase (ReLipA) was secreted as an active protein with the highest activity of 1961 U mL-1 in a 5-L fermentor by high cell-density fermentation. ReLipA was purified to homogeneity with a recovery yield of 75.7 %. The purified enzyme was most active at pH 6.0 and 40 °C, respectively, and it was stable up to 55 °C. ReLipA displayed 75 % of its maximal activity at 0 °C, indicating that it is a cold-adapted lipase. It exhibited broad substrate specificity toward various p-nitrophenyl esters and triglycerides. ReLipA hydrolyzed triolein to release mainly 1,2-diolein without the formation of 1,3-diolein, suggesting that it is a sn-1,3 regiospecific lipase. Furthermore, ReLipA synthesized different types of oleates by esterification using oleic acid and short chain alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and butanol) as the substrates with the highest conversion yield of 82.2 %. Therefore, the cold-adapted lipase may be a good biocatalyst in ester synthesis in biodiesel industry. Conclusions: A novel cold-adapted lipase was identified and characterized. The high yield and excellent properties may confer the enzyme with great potential for biodiesel production in bioenergy industry. This is the first report on a cold-adapted lipase from Rhizomucor species. © 2016 Yan et al.

AB  - An acid-base bifunctional catalyst was synthesized by treating a natural mixed-metal oxide, serpentine, with sulfuric acid. Catalyst characterization revealed that the number of acidic and basic sites increased after the acid treatment largely due to an increase in surface area. However, stronger acid sites were also introduced by the formation of bridged hydroxyl groups between a Si atom and a heteroatom, as inferred by H NMR and NH3-TPD analysis. Results from SEM-EDS and 1H NMR suggested that the acid and base sites were in close proximity. Catalytic conversions of carbohydrate-derived bio-oil model compounds were performed over different acid/base catalysts. Eight single bio-oil model compounds and two binary mixtures were used. The reactivity of the model compounds was found to be strongly correlated to the number of oxygen-containing functional groups in the reactant. The results from the binary mixtures showed that the acid-base bifunctional catalyst had the highest activity in aldol condensation reactions. The best deoxygenation performance was also observed with the bifunctional catalyst for the model compounds. Reaction pathways were proposed on the basis of an isotope labeling study. Deoxygenation reactions were found to be promoted by the cooperative catalysis between closely located acid and base sites. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Crude glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, has gained significant attention as a carbon source for biofuel production. This study evaluated the energy balance of biodiesel, hydrogen, biogas, and ethanol production from 3.48 million L of crude glycerol (80% w/v). The conversion efficiency (energy output divided by energy invested) was 1.16, 0.22, 0.27, and 0.40 for the production of biodiesel, hydrogen, biogas, and ethanol respectively. It was found that the use of crude glycerol for biodiesel production was an energy gain process, with a positive energy balance and conversion efficiency of greater than 1. The energy balance revealed a net energy gain of 5226 GJ per 1 million kg biodiesel produced. Production of hydrogen, biogas and ethanol from crude glycerol were energy loss processes. Therefore, the conversion of crude glycerol to lipids and subsequently to biodiesel is suggested to be a better option compared to hydrogen, biogas, or ethanol production with respect to energy balance. © 2016.

AB  - Co-digestion of swine manure and crude glycerine from biodiesel production has been successfully attempted by many authors reporting substantial increments in biogas production. However, the effectiveness of this approach has been questioned recently. The addition of glycerol may cause an improvement in biogas production but at the expense of disturbing the degradation of manure. In the present paper, the organic transformations undergone in the anaerobic digestion of pig manure at increasing amounts of glycerine (2-8 % (v/v)) were analysed using spectroscopy techniques (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)). An increase in biogas production was observed with the addition of glycerine up to 8 %, resulting in a volumetric production of methane per litre of reactor (Lr) of 1.4 L CH4/Lr d. However, the subsequent failure of the system was observed at this glycerine content due to the inhibitory effect caused by high H2S concentration and foam formation. FTIR and 1H NMR analysis performed on digestate samples showed that the addition of the co-substrate also caused the preferential degradation of glycerine and accumulation of proteins and aliphatic compounds. A post-stabilisation stage was necessary to complete the degradation process. Modifications in organic matter continued under this last stage although in the previous digestion period, a competition for substrate between sulphate reducing bacteria and methanogens was observed. © 2016 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is employed in the construction of biosensors and biofuel cells. The flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) containing, catalytic dehydrogenase domain (DH) of the enzyme oxidizes carbohydrates, while the cytochrome b containing domain (CYT) acts as an electron mediator and shuttles the electrons to the electrode. Here we demonstrate for the first time in an unequivocal manner direct electron transfer (DET) between the FAD and electrodes by showing clear nonturnover voltammetric waves in the absence and turnover waves in the presence of substrate by using cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry. Results were obtained by entrapping CDH under a dialysis membrane on alkanethiol-modified, polycrystalline gold electrodes. DET from the FAD cofactor occurs at potentials 130 mV more negative than those previously reported and established DET from the electron-mediating CYT domain. However, direct electrochemistry was only observed for two types of basidiomycete class I CDHs from Trametes villosa and Phanerochaete sordida at pH values below 5 and not for ascomycete class II CDHs investigated under the same experimental conditions. The present findings are of high interest for the development of biosensors and biofuel cells featuring a lower substrate oxidation potential, which decreases the occurrence of interfering reactions and increases the cell voltage in biofuel cells. Furthermore, these findings may also be transferrable to structurally related enzymes such as glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenase. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, a combined process of citric acid-catalyzed pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis was applied for production of total reducing sugar (TRS) from marine macro red-algae Gracilaria verrucosa as a potential resource. By citric acid-catalyzed pretreatment under the 1:10 solid-to-liquid ratio, 0.1 M citric acid, 150 °C, 60 min condition, a 50.9% TRS yield was obtained. By subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis using enzyme mixture (20 FBG/g-biomass and 28 FPU/g-biomass), a 57.8% TRS yield was obtained. Because citric acid-catalyzed pretreatment is simple, cheap, and environmentally friendly (do not use hazardous chemicals), these results served to demonstrate the significant potential of citric acid-catalyzed pretreatment to produce TRS for biofuels and biochemicals refinement purposes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Individually, sunflower oil produced from inedible sunflower seeds with hulls and sunflower meats without hulls were catalytically cracked over the ZSM-5 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor at three reaction temperatures (450 °C, 500 °C, and 550 °C). Characterizations of hydrocarbon biofuel, distillation residual, and non-condensable gas were carried out. The reaction temperature on the hydrocarbon biofuel yield and quality from sunflower seed oil and sunflower meat oil were discussed and compared. In addition, a preliminary cost analysis of the sunflower seed dehulling was carried out. The results showed that the highest hydrocarbon biofuel yield was obtained from upgrading sunflower meat oil at 500 °C. The highest meat hydrocarbon biofuel yield was 8.5% higher than the highest seed hydrocarbon biofuel yield. The reaction temperature had a significant effect on the distribution of non-condensable gas components. Furthermore, the reaction temperature affected the yield and properties of hydrocarbon biofuel. The unit cost of producing sunflower meat oil was lower than that of producing sunflower seed oil. Comprehensively, sunflower meat could be a more economical feedstock than sunflower seed to produce hydrocarbon biofuel. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - Sewage sludge generated in municipal wastewater treatment plants was used as a feedstock for biodiesel production via esterification/transesterification in a two-step process. In the first esterification step, greasy and secondary sludge were tested using acid and enzymatic catalysts. The results indicate that both catalysts performed the esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) simultaneously with the transesterification of triacylglycerols (TAG). Acid catalyst demonstrated better performance in FFA esterification compared to TAG transesterification, while enzymatic catalyst showed the ability to first hydrolyze TAG in FFA, which were esterified to methyl esters. In addition, FAME concentration using greasy sludge were higher (63.9% and 58.7%), compared with those of secondary sludge (11% and 16%), using acid and enzymatic catalysts, respectively. Therefore, only greasy sludge was used in the second step of alkaline transesterification. The alkaline transesterification of the previously esterified greasy sludge reached a maximum FAME concentration of 65.4% when using acid catalyst. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic supercritical water gasification of heavy (dewatered) bio-oil has been investigated in a batch reactor in the presence of ruthenium catalysts in the form of RuO2 on γ-Al2O3 support. The reactions were carried out at temperatures of 400°C, 450°C and 500°C and reaction times of up to 60min using 15wt% of bio-oil feed. Increased ruthenium oxide loading led to increased carbon gasification efficiencies (CGE) and bio-methane production. Hence, using the 20wt% RuO2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, CGE was 97.4wt% at 500°C and methane yield reached nearly 30wt% of the bio-oil feed, which gave a CH4/CO2 molar ratio of 1.28. There was evidence that the RuO2 was involved in the initial conversion of the bio-oil to carbon oxides and hydrogen as well as the reduction of the CO2 to methane via CO methanation. However, competition for CO consumption via the water-gas shift reaction was also possible due to the large presence of water as the reaction medium. This work therefore demonstrates that high concentrations of heavy fraction of bio-oil can be catalytically converted to a methane-rich gas product under hydrothermal conditions at moderate temperatures. The calorific values of the gas product reached up to 54MJkg-1, which is nearly 3 times the HHV of the bio-oil feed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ionic liquids (ILs) have shown superior performance in the conversion of biomass to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) as reaction medium and/or catalyst, which is a green platform compound with a wide range of applications in manufacturing fine chemicals and biofuels. Nevertheless, the separation of 5-HMF from ILs is very difficult and becomes a technical bottleneck for IL application in the preparation of 5-HMF. To resolve this problem, understanding the interactions between ILs and 5-HMF is essential. In this work, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared,1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and quantum chemistry calculations were combined to investigate the interaction between 5-HMF and each of the eight ILs over the whole composition range. The studied ILs have the same 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation [C4mim]+ but different anions. It was found that interactions between the ILs and 5-HMF were mainly ascribed to the strong hydrogen bonds of 5-HMF with anions of the ILs, and the formation abilities of hydrogen bonds of the anions with O-H group of 5-HMF were found to decrease in the order [CH3COO]−, [C2H5COO]− &gt; [HSO4]− &gt; [CF3COO]− &gt; [N(CN)2]− &gt; [NO3]− &gt; [CH3OSO3]− &gt; [BF4]−. These results suggest that the anions with stronger hydrogen bond accepting ability have stronger interaction with 5-HMF and the separation of 5-HMF from the ILs is mainly governed by the hydrogen bonding interactions between anion of the ILs and 5-HMF. In addition, partition coefficients of 5-HMF between 1,4-dioxane and the ILs phases were determined experimentally to support the conclusion. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass synthesis of palm empty fruit bunch (PEFB) into sugars yield as raw material for bioethanol conversion has successfully been performed through organosolv pretreatment and acid hydrolysis processes. These synthesis processes were conducted to evaluate the effect of solvent concentration namely ethanol (C2H5OH) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), reactions time and temperature against total sugars yield. It is optimized through pretreatment and hydrolysis processes, respectively. The optimum total sugars for pretreatment optimization was obtained 98.89 mg/L which correspond to 55% vol of C2H5OH with reaction time of 60 min at 120 °C. Hydrolysis process for pretreatment optimization was conducted at 1% vol H2SO4, reaction time of 30 min and temperature of 90 °C. The optimum pretreatment conditions were selected for further hydrolysis process with H2SO4 to optimize sugars yield amount in the slurries. The results of acid hydrolysis showed that the optimum amount of total sugars obtained was 133.17 mg/L at concentration H2SO4 0.5% vol with reaction time 30 min and temperature 100 °C. Therefore, it is concluded that organosolv pretreatment and acid hydrolysis can be used as a novel integrated method to optimize the total sugars production synthesized from PEFB to bioethanol. © 2016

AB  - In this research, Daturametel Linn seed oil was investigated for the first time as a promising non-conventional feedstock for preparation of biodiesel fuel. The maximum extraction of oil was observed to be 38.57 (wt) % and the activation energy Ea (25.8 kJ mol-1) was calculated. Further the thermodynamic properties for oil extraction were determined as activation enthalpy = 25.051 kJ mol-1, activation entropy = -241.25 J mol-1, and the Gibb's energy = 105.39 kJ mol-1. This present study also reports the new single-step ultrasound production of biodiesel from high fatty acid D.metel Linn oil using sulfuryl chloride as catalysts in which 95.50% yield was achieved with 2 h. Different reaction parameters for oil extraction and biodiesel production were optimized. This analysis confirms that Daturametel Linn biodiesel is appropriate alternative to petroleum diesel with recommended fuel properties as per specified standards. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of triglycerides into hydrocarbons is a novel catalytic process for the production of green biofuels. In this work, the HDO reaction mechanism over Rh/ZrO2 catalyst was studied by selecting methyl palmitate as a model compound. HDO of methyl palmitate proceeded initially via the hydrogenolysis into palmitic acid intermediate, followed by sequential hydrogenation-decarbonylation reaction into pentadecane via aldehyde intermediate. Bifunctional mechanism of the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst is advocated for the HDO process, in which both Rh sites and oxygen vacancy sites on ZrO2 synergistically contribute to the catalysis. The interface between Rh nanoparticle and support was proposed to host the most active sites. Based on our earlier work, a surface reaction mechanism was proposed and slightly modified to develop a set of mechanistic kinetic models. The mechanistic model consisting of two distinct types of adsorption sites for oxygenated components and H2, gave a good fitting to the kinetic data over a broad range of reaction conditions and conversion levels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The estimation of emission factors (EFs) is the basis of accurate emission inventory. However, the EFs of air pollutants for motor vehicles vary under different operating conditions, which will cause uncertainty in developing emission inventory. Natural gas (NG), considered as a "cleaner" fuel than gasoline, is increasingly being used to reduce combustion emissions. However, information is scarce about how much emission reduction can be achieved by motor vehicles burning NG (NGVs) under real road driving conditions, which is necessary for evaluating the environmental benefits for NGVs. Here, online, in situ measurements of the emissions from nine bi-fuel vehicles were conducted under different operating conditions on the real road. A comparative study was performed for the EFs of black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for each operating condition when the vehicles using gasoline and compressed NG (CNG) as fuel. BC EFs were reported in part I. The part II in this paper series reports the influence of operating conditions and fuel types on the EFs of CO, HC and NOx. Fuel-based EFs of CO showed good correlations with speed when burning CNG and gasoline. The correlation between fuel-based HC EFs and speed was relatively weak whether burning CNG or gasoline. The fuel-based NOx EFs moderately correlated with speed when burning CNG, but weakly correlated with gasoline. As for HC, the mileage-based EFs of gasoline vehicles are 2.39-12.59 times higher than those of CNG vehicles. The mileage-based NOx EFs of CNG vehicles are slightly higher than those of gasoline vehicles. These results would facilitate a detailed analysis of the environmental benefits for replacing gasoline with CNG in light duty vehicles. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study has investigated kinetic features of bioconversion of biodiesel-derived crude glycerol to dihydroxyacetone with immobilized Gluconobacter oxydans cells using modified Haldane substrate-inhibition model. The results have been compared against free cells and pure glycerol. Relative variations in the kinetic parameters KS, KI, Vmax, n and X reveal that immobilized G. oxydans cells (on PU foam substrate) with crude glycerol as substrate give higher order of inhibition (n) and lower maximum reaction velocities (Vmax). These results are essentially implications of substrate transport restrictions across immobilization matrix, which causes retention of substrate in the matrix and reduction in fractional available substrate (X) for the cells. This causes reduction in both KS (substrate concentration at Vmax/2) and KI (inhibition constant) as compared to free cells. For immobilized cells, substrate concentration (Smax) corresponding to Vmax is practically same for both pure and crude glycerol as substrate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels produced from palm oil have shown great potential as a useful fossil fuel substitute and are environmental friendly. Utilization of palm oil as biofuel requires zeolite based catalytic technology that facilitates selective conversion of substrates to desired products, including biogasoline and biodiesel. However, the synthesis and integration of suitable zeolite based supported catalysts for the desired products are the key challenges in biofuel production. The alternative to overcome these problems is to use nano heterometallic materials supported on zeolite catalysts. In this study, Zeolite Socony Mobile-5 (ZSM-5) based catalysts loaded with heterometallic nano oxides were synthesized. Next, the catalysts used for the palm oil cracking to produce biogasoline were characterized by field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) analysis. Taguchi method was used to assess and optimize the catalytic cracking process. The catalytic cracking results illustrated that under optimized conditions, ZSM-5 (30), Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM-5 (31), Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM-5 (32) and Fe-Zn-ZSM-5 (33) yielded 14%, 59%, 49% and 56% biogasoline, respectively. Higher efficiency of Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM-5 (31) might be attributed to higher content of loaded metal oxides as compared to the other synthesized catalysts. The yield of biogasoline in this study, catalyzed by Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM-5 (31), was 8% more than the literature values. Therefore, the present study proved that the newly developed Fe-Zn-Cu-ZSM-5 (31) was an efficient and economical catalyst for producing biogasoline from cracking of palm oil. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gasification of biomass has strong potential for biofuels production. However, one challenge to its competitiveness is the efficient elimination of the tars present in the raw gas. The use of active bed materials in tar reforming is an appealing approach and can be employed as part of primary and/or secondary measures. Here, the activity of an alkali-feldspar [(K, Na)AlSi3O8] ore was assessed in relation to upgrading the producer gas from the Chalmers 2-4 MW indirect biomass gasifier. This material was tested in a single bubbling bed reactor previously developed for studies involving catalytic tar reforming. The bed of feldspar was fluidized with raw gas. The material was tested at three temperatures: 700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C. The results indicate that alkali-feldspar shows: (1) a high potential for the Water-Gas Shift reaction even at low temperature (H2/CO ~ 3); (2) no reduction of the methane content in the cleaned gas and net formation of methane at 900 °C; (3) the elimination of most C2H2 and C3H6 already at 800 °C; and (4) a striking tar selectivity, which resulted in the reformed gas having exclusively pure ring-compounds. In the same reactor set-up at 800 °C, fresh olivine was comparatively less efficient than feldspar in reducing tar levels. At 900 °C, the feldspar decomposed 47% excepting benzene. Moreover, it retained its mechanical integrity, withstood longer reducing periods (3 h), and displayed neither signs of agglomeration nor loss of activity, despite the formation of a carbon deposit. The deposits were readily removed by introducing an oxidizing atmosphere. Furthermore, the raw feldspar showed a low capacity for oxygen transport, advantageous in this application. Taken together, our results indicate that this material is clearly promising and warrants further investigations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work reports the use of an acid-activated Brazilian smectite natural clay-based catalyst in the esterification of fatty acids at atmospheric pressure and without a co-solvent. Conversion levels of 99%, 98%, 93% and 80% were reached for caprylic, lauric, stearic and oleic methyl esters, respectively, using 1:3 fatty acid/methanol molar ratio, heating bath at 100 °C after 4 h. A conversion level of 89% was achieved for methyl esters from a fatty acid residue of the palm oil refining industry in the same reaction condition. The acid-activated clay provided better performance than the commercial catalyst K-10. The effects of catalyst amount, temperature, fatty acid/alcohol molar ratio and time were investigated. The heating activation of the catalyst immediately before the catalytic test increased the conversion from 94% to 99% using 1:1.5 stearic acid/methanol molar ratio, heating bath at 100 °C after 4 h. The catalyst was reused five times. The conversion decreases less than 5% in the first three reuses. The smectite natural clay and the catalyst were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, n-butylamine thermodesorption, nitrogen adsorption analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production catalyzed by immobilized lipases offers the possibility of easy reuse of the catalyst, which is very important to minimize costs and to make this process economically feasible. In this study, the reuse of three commercial immobilized lipases (Novozym 435, Lipozyme RM IM, and Lipozyme TL IM) was investigated in ethanolysis of soybean oil. The effect of the use of solvents (ethanol, butanol, and hexane) to wash the immobilized lipases before the enzyme reuse was evaluated, as well as the lipase reuse without solvent washing. The washing with butanol and ethanol led to the lowest decrease in ester yield after the first batch and allowed the highest glycerol removal (>85 %) from biocatalysts. The biocatalysts were incubated at 50 °C for 2 h in these three solvents. Esterification activities of the enzyme preparations, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses of the beads, and protein content in organic phase were evaluated before and after incubation in the solvent. SEM analysis showed a significant change in beads morphology of Novozym 435 after contact with hexane. For Lipozyme TL IM lipase, this effect was visualized with ethanol. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Brazilian food industry employs several kinds of fruits in manufacturing food products, including the bocaiuva fruit (Acrocomiaaculeata). The two-dimensional gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detector (GC × GC/TOFMS) was employed to analyze bio-oils generated from the endorcap, bark and fiber of bocaiuva residues. The bio-oil generated from the endocarp proved to be of the highest complexity in the set with 151 tentatively identified compounds. On the other hand, the bio-oils generated from the bark and the fiber led to 111 and 78 tentatively identified compounds, respectively. Using standards, 24 compounds (59.91% of the total) were confirmed in the bio-oil of bark, while 28 compounds (42.23%) and 19 compounds (47.60%) were confirmed for fiber and endocarp bio-oils, respectively. In bio-oils of endocarp and bark the compounds were identified and classified as phenols, alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, anhydrides and hydrocarbons. There was a predominance of hydrocarbons in the bio-oils of fiber, with no identification of ethers, anhydrides and aldehydes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increase in energy demand across the world has put immense pressure on utilization of widely available lignocellulosic agricultural waste biomass and forest residues. Physico-chemical characteristics of leaf litter from largely grown tree species such as Mangifera indica, Populus deltoides and Polyalthia longifolia were evaluated for possible use in biorefinery. Physical and chemical properties of these leaf litter biomasses were examined using bomb calorimetry, SEM, XRD, TGA, CHNSO analysis, FTIR and solid state 13C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy. Low ash content (3.70wt%), high volatile matter (76.05wt%) and cellulose (37.75wt%) was observed from leaf litter biomass of P. deltoides. SEM of leaf litter biomass revealed compacted surface morphology of M. indica, however a fibrillar structure was observed in P. deltoides and P. longifolia. Maximum crystallinity index (CrI) was observed in leaf litter biomass of M. indica (23.13%) followed by P. longifolia (20.94%) and P. deltoides (20.93%). The calorific values of all biomasses were in the range of 18.37 to 19.32MJ/kg. Delineation of these physico-chemical characteristics together per se shows that leaf litter biomass can also act as a potential feedstock for biofuel production. © 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Pyrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose, egg white powder, palm-jojoba oils mixtures Thalassiosira weissflogii model compounds was performed with CeO2 at 500 °C, to evaluate its catalytic upgrading mechanism. Light organics, aromatics and aliphatics were originated from carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, respectively. Dehydration and decarboxylation were the main reactions involved in the algae and model compounds deoxygenation, while nitrogen was removed as NH3 and HCN. CeO2 increased decarbonylation reactions compared to in absence of catalyst, with production of ketones. The results showed that the catalysts had a significant effect on the pyrolysis products composition of T. weissflogii. CeO2, NiCeAl2O3 and MgCe/Al2O3 catalysts increased the aliphatics and decreased the oxygen content in bio-oils to 6-7 wt% of the algae starting O2 content. Ceria catalysts were also able to consistently reduce the N-content in the bio-oil to 20-38% of that in the parent material, with NiCe/Al2O3 being the most effective. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of biomass for bio-oil production is a direct route to renewable liquid fuels, but raw bio-oil must be upgraded in order to remove easily polymerized compounds (such as phenols and furfurals). Herein, a synthesis strategy for graphene encapsulated Ru nanoparticles (NPs) on carbon sheets (denoted as Ru@G-CS) and their excellent performance for the upgrading of raw bio-oil were reported. Ru@G-CS composites were prepared via the direct pyrolysis of mixed glucose, melamine and RuCl3 at varied temperatures (500-800 °C). Characterization indicated that very fine Ru NPs (2.5 ± 1.0 nm) that were encapsulated within 1-2 layered N-doped graphene were fabricated on N-doped carbon sheets (CS) in Ru@G-CS-700 (pyrolysis at 700 °C). And the Ru@G-CS-700 composite was highly active and stable for hydrogenation of unstable components in bio-oil (31 samples including phenols, furfurals and aromatics) even in aqueous media under mild conditions. This work provides a new protocol to the utilization of biomass, especially for the upgrading of bio-oil. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - The environmental impact from the use of fossil fuel cum depletion of the known fossil oil reserves has led to increasing interest in liquid biofuels made from renewable biomass. This study presents the first experimental report on the catalytic pyrolysis of Napier grass, an underutilized biomass source, using ZSM-5, 0.3HZSM-5 and zinc exchanged zeolite-A catalyst. Pyrolysis was conducted in fixed bed reactor at 600 °C, 30 °C/min and 7 L/min nitrogen flow rate. The effect of catalyst-biomass ratio was evaluated with respect to pyrolysis oil yield and composition. Increasing the catalyst loading from 0.5 to 1.0 wt % showed no significant decrease in the bio-oil yield, particularly, the organic phase and thereafter decreased at catalyst loadings of 2.0 and 3.0 wt %. Standard analytical methods were used to establish the composition of the pyrolysis oil, which was made up of various aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatics and other valuable chemicals and varied greatly with the surface acidity and pore characteristics of the individual catalysts. This study has demonstrated that pyrolysis oil with high fuel quality and value added chemicals can be produced from pyrolysis of Napier grass over acidic zeolite based catalysts. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - We present the preparation of a redox DNA hydrogel for mediated bioelectrocatalysis of oxidoreductase enzymes for biosensor and biofuel cell applications. The noncovalent functionalization of DNA with redox molecules is achieved by intercalation of aromatic redox probes into the DNA double helix or electrostatic binding of redox-active tetraalkylammonium ions to phosphate groups on DNA. Prepared DNA redox hydrogels demonstrate the capability of mediating bioelectrocatalytic glucose oxidation by oxidoreductase enzymes. This is the first evidence that redox DNA hydrogels can replace redox polymer hydrogels for self-exchange-based mediation for bioelectrocatalytic applications. This study contributes toward advances in the use of DNA, an emerging biomaterial, in enzymatic bioelectrocatalysis-based applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The vapors produced from pine wood using an intermediate auger pyrolysis process under various sweeping gas flow rates were condensed by three temperature-controlled condensers and analyzed. Increasing sweeping gas flow rate from 20 to 40 L/min did not change the yield of the pyrolysis products, however, noticeable changes were found in the bio-oil composition, such as a decrease in water content and an increase of amount of organic compounds. Increasing sweeping gas flow rate influenced the bio-oil fractionation in each temperature-controlled condenser with a reduction in bio-oil yield in the first condenser controlled between 85 and 90 °C and outgoing vapor temperature of 121 °C. There were no changes in the second condenser maintained at 45-50°C and outgoing vapor temperature of 107 °C, and an increase in the third condenser regulated at 10-15 °C and outgoing vapor temperature of 25 °C. Higher sweeping gas flow rates also resulted in changing the bio-oil composition in the first and second condensers including a reduction in water content and an increase in viscosity and density, suggesting that refining this fraction as an intermediate source would be a more efficiency way to produce fuels and chemicals than treating the whole bio-oil. The bio-oil from the third condenser contained elevated water content, acidity and light oxygenated compounds with increasing sweeping gas flow rate, suggesting that this fraction would be more suitable as an energy source for hydrogen production via microbial electrolysis processes. In summary, the sweeping gas flow rate used for pyrolysis with an intermediate auger reactor is an important factor to change bio-oil properties in temperature-controlled multistage condensation processes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The mesh generation is a crucial step for Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations and incorrect numerical descriptions of the geometry may strongly affect the reliability and the accuracy of the results. This is especially true in handling the contact points in random packed bed of spheres. In this respect, we provide a systematic investigation of the treatment of the contact points for reactive CFD simulations of gas-solid packed beds of spheres. In particular, building on previous literature results on radial heat transfer and pressure drop simulations, we extend and assess the bridge method to reaction at surfaces. At this scope, we first analyze a regular bed of spheres in laminar conditions (Re~80). This regular packed bed and the laminar flow regime allow for a direct and feasible meshing of the contact points, thus giving the possibility to perform explicit comparisons between meshes with and without bridges. In doing so, we identify guidelines that are then extended and tested to the meshing of a random packed bed reactor. In this way, we identify a meshing protocol, which can be adopted to properly describe surface reactivity in packed bed reactors along with a concomitant sound description of pressure drops and heat transfer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many LCA based viability studies have already been done for the production of green diesel from microalgae, still a comprehensive LCA, has not yet been undertaken. Current study aims to find out if the Net Energy Balance(NEB) can further be increased by using a combination of many available agronomical practices & the techniques of production of green diesel from microalgae. The results show that neither open raceway pond nor Photobioreactor routes (Wet and dry routes) yield positive energy balance. The production of green diesel via open raceway pond, both in dry as well as wet route, have less negative NEB and comparatively higher NER than the photobioreactors. Comparison says that open raceway pond dry route has slightly higher value for NER than the wet route. Even with the best possible route (open raceway pond dry route), the total energy use is almost 5 times more than the energy produced, with a negative NEB of 4.07 MJ & very low NER value of 0.20. Study concludes that R & D in the area of green diesel production from microalgae has yet to go a long way & has a huge scope to further lower its input energy demand for biofuel production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Efficient synthesis of renewable fuels that will enable cost competitiveness with petroleum-derived fuels remains a grand challenge. In this paper, we report on an integrated catalytic approach for producing transportation fuels from biomass-derived syngas. This novel process represents an alternative to conventional fuel synthesis routes (e.g., Fischer-Tropsch, Methanol-to-Gasoline) that have drawbacks, particularly at the scale of biomass. Composition of the resulting hydrocarbon fuel can be modulated to produce predominantly middle distillates, which is constantly increasing in demand compared to gasoline fraction. In this process biomass-derived syngas is first converted over an Rh-based catalyst into a complex aqueous mixture of condensable C2+ oxygenated compounds (predominantly ethanol, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate). This multi-component aqueous mixture then is fed to a second reactor loaded with a ZnxZryOz mixed oxide catalyst, which has tailored acid-base sites, to produce an olefin mixture rich in isobutene. The olefins then are oligomerized using a solid acid catalyst (e.g., Amberlyst-36) to form condensable olefins with molecular weights that can be targeted for gasoline, jet, and/or diesel fuel applications. The product rich in long-chain olefins (C7+) is finally sent to a fourth reactor required for hydrogenation of the olefins into paraffin fuels. Simulated distillation of the hydrotreated oligomerized liquid product indicates that ∼75% of the hydrocarbons (iso-paraffins and cyclic compounds) are in the jet-fuel range. Process optimization for the oligomerization step could further improve yield to the jet-fuel range. All of these catalytic steps have been demonstrated in sequence, thus providing proof-of-concept for a new integrated process for the production of drop-in biofuels. Overall, we demonstrate approximately 41% carbon efficiency for converting syngas into jet-range hydrocarbons. This unique and flexible process does not require external hydrogen and also could be applied to non-syngas derived feedstock, such as fermentation products (e.g., ethanol, acetic acid, etc.), other oxygenates, and mixtures thereof containing alcohols, acids, aldehydes and/or esters. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Bacterial lipids have relevant applications in the production of renewable fuels and biobased oleochemicals. The genus Rhodococcus is one of the most relevant lipid producers due to its capability to accumulate those compounds, mainly triacylglycerols (TAG), when cultivated on different defined substrates, namely sugars, organic acids and hydrocarbons but also on complex carbon sources present in industrial wastes. In this work, the production of storage lipids by Rhodococcus opacus B4 using glucose, acetate and hexadecane is reported for the first time and its productivity compared with Rhodococcus opacus PD630, the best TAG producer bacterium reported. Both strains accumulated mainly TAG from all carbon sources, being influenced by the carbon source itself and by the duration of the accumulation period. R. opacus B4 produced 0.09 and 0.14 g L−1 at 24 and 72 h, with hexadecane as carbon source, which was 2 and 3.3 fold higher than the volumetric production obtained by R. opacus PD630. Both strains presented similar fatty acids (FA) profiles in intact cells while in TAG produced fraction, R. opacus B4 revealed a higher variability in fatty acid composition than R. opacus PD630, when both strains were cultivated on hexadecane. The obtained results open new perspectives for the use of R. opacus B4 to produce TAG, in particular using oily (alkane-contaminated) waste and wastewater as cheap raw-materials. Combining TAG production with hydrocarbons degradation is a promising strategy to achieve environmental remediation while producing added value compounds. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of water tolerant Lewis acids (i.e., In(OTf)3, Yb(OTf)3 and InCl3) on bio-oil and solid residue yields. For this purpose, poplar wood was liquefied at 300 °C with a residence time of 10 min without and with water tolerant Lewis acids in various concentrations from 0.5 to 10 wt% under hydrothermal conditions. The use of water tolerant Lewis acids had negative effects on bio-oil yields. The bio-oil from the run without a catalyst had a value of 17.50 wt% at 300 °C, 10 min. The highest bio-oil yields under identical conditions were the following: 14.27 wt%, 13.37 wt% and 12.42 wt% for Yb(OTf)3 (with a concentration of 0.5 wt% of the raw material), In(OTf)3 and InCl3 (with concentrations of 1 wt% of the raw material). The concentrations of catalysts used in the experiments had significant effects on both bio-oil and solid residue yields. An increase of catalyst concentrations resulted in a decrease in bio-oil yields. The catalysts changed neither the molecular nor the elemental compositions of bio-oils and solid residues significantly. The prominent compounds in bio-oils from all runs including the run without a catalyst were phenol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and 2-methoxyphenol. © 2015 Energy Institute

AB  - The aims of this study were to simplify the fermentation medium and to optimize the conditions of dark fermentation of residual glycerin to produce biohydrogen. It was possible to remove all micronutrients of fermentation medium and improve biohydrogen production by applying residual glycerin as feedstock. After statistical analysis of the following parameters pH, glycerin concentration and volatile suspended solids, the values of 5.5; 0.5 g.L−1 and 8.7 g.L−1, respectively, were defined as optimum condition for this process. It generated 2.44 molH2/molglycerin, an expressive result when compared to previous results reported in literature and considering that theoretical yield of H2 from glycerol in dark fermentation process is 3 molH2/molglycerol. This study allowed the improvement of yield and productivity by 68% and 67%, respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present work we have performed a parameter study to maximize the yields of aviation bio-kerosene and renewable diesel range products obtained from the conversion of plant-oil triglycerides over Ni-W/SiO2-Al2O3, hydrocracking catalyst. Specific insights and changes in reaction mechanisms, with C-O bond breaking favoured at increased pressures (&gt; 60 bar) leading to depropanation/deoxygenation, as compared to C-C bond breaking becoming favoured at reduced pressures (&lt; 60 bar) leading to formation of lower range esters and short chain glycerides, are established for the first time using analytical techniques (GC, NMR and IR). The C-C cleavage and low hydrogen partial pressures (&lt; 60 bar) led to formation of unsaturated intermediates, which promoted cyclization, aromatization and coking reactions, which increased deactivation of catalyst. High space time yield with a maximum of 240 ml/(h Lcatalyst) for &lt; C9 products and 350 ml/(h Lcatalyst) for C9-C14 products was observed at 420 °C temperatures. Stable catalytic performance was observed until 450 h of continuous operation with 25-30% yield of aviation bio-kerosene which meets all ASTM D 7566 standards. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic upgrading of raw bio-oil and liquid-liquid extracted bio-oil (high concentrated phenolic with trace acid and acetaldehyde) with methanol over ZSM-5 catalyst had been studied in this work. Temperature played vital function and leaded to increasing gas yield but less catalyst coking. It also changed both chemical distribution and selectivity on both gas and liquid products, with aromatic concentration increasing by 34.42%. Temperature of 400°C was selected as the optimized reaction conditions with liquid yield of 10.47 wt.% and 75.00% aromatic hydrocarbon in liquid product from 100 g biomass, only with coke yield of 1.42 wt.%. Phenolic-rich extracted bio-oil obtained higher aromatic hydrocarbon yield (7.3 wt.% increased from 1.1 wt.%) and lower coke yield (1.42 wt.% decrease from 15.79 wt.%) than raw bio-oil. Catalyst regenerated from this type of feedstock also achieved higher activity and longer useable running times on aromatic yield compared to fresh catalyst. This result suggested that lignin derived phenolic and guaiacol compounds were not the only reason caused catalyst coking on ZSM-5 catalyst. Small high active molecules of acetic acid and acetaldehyde also acted as important precursors of catalyst coke formation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enhanced carbon yields of renewable alkanes for jet fuels were obtained through the catalytic microwave-induced co-pyrolysis and hydrogenation process. The well-promoted ZSM-5 catalyst had high selectivity toward C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons. The raw organics with improved carbon yield (~44%) were more principally lumped in the jet fuel range at the catalytic temperature of 375 °C with the LDPE to cellulose (representing waste plastics to lignocellulose) mass ratio of 0.75. It was also observed that the four species of raw organics from the catalytic microwave co-pyrolysis were almost completely converted into saturated hydrocarbons; the hydrogenation process was conducted in the n-heptane medium by using home-made Raney Ni catalyst under a low-severity condition. The overall carbon yield (with regards to co-reactants of cellulose and LDPE) of hydrogenated organics that mostly match jet fuels was sustainably enhanced to above 39%. Meanwhile, ~90% selectivity toward jet fuel range alkanes was attained. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emissions of organic compounds from biomass, biofuel, and fossil fuel combustion strongly influence the global atmospheric aerosol load. Some of the organics are directly released as primary organic aerosol (POA). Most are emitted in the gas phase and undergo chemical transformations (i.e., oxidation by hydroxyl radical) and form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). In this work we use the global chemistry climate model ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) with a computationally efficient module for the description of organic aerosol (OA) composition and evolution in the atmosphere (ORACLE). The tropospheric burden of open biomass and anthropogenic (fossil and biofuel) combustion particles is estimated to be 0.59 and 0.63 Tg, respectively, accounting for about 30 and 32% of the total tropospheric OA load. About 30% of the open biomass burning and 10% of the anthropogenic combustion aerosols originate from direct particle emissions, whereas the rest is formed in the atmosphere. A comprehensive data set of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements along with factoranalysis results from 84 field campaigns across the Northern Hemisphere are used to evaluate the model results. Both the AMS observations and the model results suggest that over urban areas both POA (25-40 %) and SOA (60-75 %) contribute substantially to the overall OA mass, whereas further downwind and in rural areas the POA concentrations decrease substantially and SOA dominates (80-85 %). EMAC does a reasonable job in reproducing POA and SOA levels during most of the year. However, it tends to underpredict POA and SOA concentrations during winter indicating that the model misses wintertime sources of OA (e.g., residential biofuel use) and SOA formation pathways (e.g., multiphase oxidation). © Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The development of an effective process to convert bio-oil into intermediate platforms that are compatible with the existing refinery infrastructure is highly needed. To overcome the high cost of hydrogen consumption in conventional bio-oil upgrading processes, this paper reports a novel process that converts three major biomass constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) directly into liquid fuels via pyrolysis in the presence of methane over molybdenum impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts. The carbon yield of total aromatics from lignin increased from 12.80 to 15.13% when pyrolysis atmosphere switched from helium to methane in the presence of HZSM-5 support. However, methane was not effective in improving the aromatics yield from cellulose and hemicellulose in the presence of Mo-modified HZSM-5 catalysts. The molybdenum impregnated catalyst was found to promote deoxygenation of lignin-derived phenols. The carbon yield of polyaromatics from lignin was 5.47% in the presence of HZSM-5 support under methane, compared to 2.61% that obtained in the presence of Mo2C/HZSM-5. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lipases resistant to inhibition and denaturation by methanol are valuable tools for biotechnological applications, in particular for biofuel production. Microbial lipases have attracted a great deal of interest because of their stability at high concentrations of organic solvents. Burkholderia cepacia lipase (BCL) is tested here for robustness towards methanol in terms of conformational stability and catalytic activity in transesterification assays. This lipase turns out to be even more tolerant than the homologous and better characterized enzyme from Burkholderia glumae. BCL unfolding transition, as monitored by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) and intrinsic fluorescence, displays a Tm above 60°C in the presence of 50% methanol. The protein unfolds at low pH, and the organic solvent affects the nature of the denatured state under acidic conditions. The protein performs well in transesterification assays upon prolonged incubations at high methanol concentrations. BCL is highly tolerant to methanol and displays particularly high conformational stability under conditions employed for transesterification reactions. These features depict BCL as a promising enzyme for biofuel industry. Copyright © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Solvolytic conversion of lignin from wood with formic acid as a hydrogen donor can provide a renewable source of aromatic compounds, especially phenols. In this paper, lignin or lignin-enriched fractions from Norway spruce and white birch are compared with regard to yields of bio-oil in solvolytic conversion. Water as a green solvent is also compared to ethanol as the reaction medium, and the yields and composition of the produced oils are presented. Maximum yields by weight are inversely connected to the oxygen content of the feedstock, showing that pure lignins give the highest yields while carbohydrate-containing feedstocks undergo more deoxygenation and thus give lower yields. The overall composition of the bio-oils produced is quite stable and independent of the feedstock type and pretreatment, though some difference in the quantitative distribution of the individual components is observed. The use of water or ethanol as reaction media has a significant impact on the bio-oil yields and composition due to the alkylation of the aromatic rings by the ethyl group from the solvent. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to "bio-oils" by thermochemical pyrolysis is a promising reactor technology for renewable chemicals and biofuels. Although the fundamental understanding of relevant catalysts within reacting biomass particles is only in its infancy, it is known that inorganic materials naturally present within biomass act as catalysts that limit the yield of bio-oil and alter the product distribution. In this work, the effect of alkaline earth metals on cellulose pyrolysis chemistry was investigated to determine the catalytic effect on primary (transport-free) and secondary (diffusion-limited) reaction pathways. The catalytic materials included homogeneous metal ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ from their inorganic salts, Ca(NO3)2 and Mg(NO3)2, and their corresponding heterogeneous metal oxides, CaO and MgO. Although the oxides had a limited impact on cellulose pyrolysis chemistry, the metal ions altered the secondary reaction pathways of cellulose significantly under diffusion-limited conditions common to lignocellulosic particles within industrial reactors. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Fructose presents a highly attractive substrate for future biorefineries for production of biofuels as well as bulk and fine chemicals. Starting from cellulose, fructose is available via hydrolysis to glucose followed by isomerization. Despite commercial production of high-fructose corn syrup, efficient strategies for a combined chemo-catalytic isomerization and fructose separation are missing. This contribution describes a three-step approach combining the isomerization of glucose into fructose with recovery of the product. The first step covers isomerization of glucose into fructose using water as a solvent and soluble Na2HPO4 + NaH2PO4 as a catalyst. Na2HPO4 + NaH2PO4 exhibits catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions at pH 7.5. The specific-base-catalyzed isomerization proceeds via the formation of an enediol anion. The yield of fructose obtained using phosphates under batch conditions reaches 30%. The second step relates to recovery of fructose by selective anionic extraction due to complexation with ortho-hydroxymethyl phenylboronic acid (HMPBA). Under optimized conditions, up to 72% of fructose can be extracted from a glucose-fructose mixture with 76% selectivity. Fructose is extracted as a mixture of complexes with HMPBA exhibiting 1-to-1 stoichiometry. Formulae of two complexes were proposed, namely β-fructofuranoside esterified at C2 and C3 positions and an ester of β-fructopyranoside at C1 and C2. After extraction, the aqueous phase containing phosphate and the remaining glucose can be recycled. In the third step, fructose can be back-extracted from the organic phase with an acidic solution. This extraction-assisted isomerization strategy significantly improves the yield of fructose reaching up to 51%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - A novel process to rapidly liquefy sawdust using reduced quantities of solvent, was successfully carried out via microwave-ultrasonic assisted technology (MUAT) in a sulphuric acid/polyethylene glycol 400-glycerol catalytic system. The influences of some key parameters on the liquefaction yield were investigated. The results showed that compared with traditional liquefaction, the introduction of MUAT allowed the solvent dosage to be halved and shortened the liquefaction time from 60 to 20 min. The liquefaction yield reached 91% under the optimal conditions. However, the influence on the yield of some parameters such as catalyst concentration, was similar to that of traditional liquefaction, indicating that the application of MUAT possibly only intensified heat and mass transfer rather than altering either the degradation mechanism or pathway. The introduction of MUAT as a process intensification technology has good industrial application potential for woody biomass liquefaction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dimethyl ether steam reforming (DME-SR) for hydrogen production has been studied over V[sbnd]Ni/Al2O3 catalysts as part of an investigation aimed at the development of effective technology based on second generation of biofuels. Methanol steam reforming (MeOH-SR) was investigated as a step of the DME-SR process. High activity in the MeOH-SR was observed and two different mechanism depending on temperature and influenced by the vanadium content (0.5, 1 and 3%) was evidenced: direct methanol decomposition to CO and H2 was observed at low temperature and low vanadium content and methanol steam reforming reaction occurs majorly to give an almost stoichiometric H2/CO2 ratio at moderate to high temperature (400 °C) over 3VNi. DME conversion is complete at 500 °C over VNi catalysts in DME-SR, as a two steps reaction: DME hydrolysis and MeOH-SR giving an H2 rich gas reformate generated with a H2 selectivity c.a. 60–70% over 0.5VNi and 3VNi, values maintained during 4.5 h of activity in the same reaction conditions with no signs of deactivation or significant coke formation over catalyst surface. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In present study, esterification of oleic acid with methanol using deep eutectic solvent (DES) assisted Amberlyst heterogeneous catalyst was investigated to produce biodiesel. Results showed that esterification efficiency was enhanced by the DES. The combined effect of DES on Amberlyst BD20 (BD20) is better than Amberlyst 15 (A-15) due to different structure. The optimal reaction conditions were 12:1 M ratio of methanol to oleic acid, 20% (wt/wt) catalyst (BD20-DES (2:8) and A-15-DES (8:2)) at 85 °C for 100 min with agitating at 200 rpm. The mechanism involved in catalysis and their capacity to reuse were studied. We proposed, Choline chloride-glycerol (Chcl-gly) DES could enhance the Amberlyst function due to the hydrogen bond effect on both DES and water. BD20 has fewer pores than A-15, have desirable performance in decreasing the inhibition the water during esterification of high FFA content and provide better performance in reuse. © 2016

AB  - Abstract: A new catalyst for hydrotreating process mainly including hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) was prepared by introducing Ni onto the surface of biochar obtained from microalgae biomass pyrolysis. The co-product bio-oil obtained from the pyrolysis was treated under H2 pressure on the as-synthesized Ni/biochar catalyst. The whole process was established in a close loop cycle illustrating its high efficiency in comparison to other HDO or HDN processes. The catalyst was prepared through two-step procedure including biochar production and impregnating of Ni precursor onto the biochar. The pyrolysis of microalgal biomass was established at 400 °C for 2 h producing mainly the biochar and the bio-oil. The biochar was then doped with Ni2+ by incipient wetness impregnation followed by drying and calcination at suitable temperature for a certain time. The upgrading process including hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) reactions of bio-oil obtained from microalgal pyrolysis was investigated at various parameters such as temperature, time, catalyst dosage and stirring speed for converting bio-oil obtained from microalgal pyrolysis to rich hydrocarbon product. The Ni/biochar catalyst synthesized from the biochar through impregnation was used in the upgrading process. The results showed that the Ni/biochar catalyst could be very effective in the upgrading process producing mainly n-heptadecane as a very important component of diesel fuel. Some techniques were applied for characterizing the catalyst, feedstock and product such as XRD, H2-TPR, GC-MS and some standard ASTM methods.

AB  - N-butanol, as a sustainable biofuel, is usually used as a blend with gasoline in spark ignition engines. In this study, the combustion characteristics were investigated on a four-cylinder spark ignition gasoline engine with independent port fuel injection and direct injection systems for n-butanol and gasoline in different operating conditions. The results show that in the case of port fuel injection of n-butanol with direct injection gasoline at a given total energy released in a cycle, indicated mean effective pressure is slightly affected by spark timing at stoichiometry while it changes much more with delayed spark timing in lean burn conditions and is much higher in lean burn conditions compared to stoichiometry at given spark timings. With the increase of n-butanol percentage in a fixed total energy released in a cycle at given spark timings, ignition timing advances, combustion duration shortens, indicated mean effective pressure and indicated thermal efficiency increase. For the cases of port fuel injection of n-butanol with direction injection gasoline and port fuel injection of gasoline with direction injection n-butanol at a fixed total energy released in a cycle, their indicated mean effective pressures are close. But their combustion processes are dependent on fuel injection approaches. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydro-pyrolysis of biomass was studied at 500 °C and atmospheric pressure, applying Al2O3 supported platinum and sodium carbonate catalysts. CO chemisorption has shown that platinum particles are well dispersed in Pt/Al2O3 catalyst while they get agglomerated in Pt-Na2CO3/Al2O3. The co-impregnated or sequentially impregnated Pt-Na/Al2O3 catalysts have not shown improvement compared to either Na2CO3/Al2O3 or Pt/Al2O3 catalysts when it comes to quality of bio-oil. A dual bed system in which Na2CO3/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 are packed in two consecutive beds has combined the advantages of all catalytic systems, resulting in high quality bio-oil with oxygen content 5.6 wt.% and HHV 42 MJ kg-1. N-butane shows equivalent performance as hydrogen in hydro-pyrolysis of biomass, opening new possibility for economical hydrogen sources. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An experimental study of the supercritical water reforming of model compounds (acetic acid, acetol, 1-butanol and glucose) of the aqueous phase of bio-oil was performed in a tubular reactor without using a catalyst, aimed at maximizing hydrogen yield. In addition, a systematic thermodynamic analysis was carried out using two thermodynamic approaches by simulation in AspenPlus™ (non-stoichiometric approach) and modelling in Matlab™ (stoichiometric approach), selecting first the thermodynamic method that describes the supercritical state more suitably. The effect of the main operating parameters (temperature, organic feed concentration and residence time) on the process performance was investigated thermodynamically and experimentally for each feedstock. Experimental and theoretical results were compared with each other, arising that experimental gas yields were far from equilibrium. However, a better agreement was achieved using an equilibrium approach temperature ranged from 125 to 225 °C. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wet microalgae hydrolysis-esterification route has the advantage to avoid the energy-intensive units (e.g. drying and lipid extraction) in the biodiesel production process. In this study, techno-economic evaluation of hydrolysis-esterification biodiesel production process was carried out and compared with conventional (usually including drying, lipid extraction, esterification and transesterification) biodiesel production process. Energy and material balance of the conventional and hydrolysis-esterification processes was evaluated by Aspen Plus. The simulation results indicated that drying (2.36 MJ/L biodiesel) and triolein transesterification (1.89 MJ/L biodiesel) are the dominant energy-intensive stages in the conventional route (5.42 MJ/L biodiesel). By contrast, the total energy consumption of hydrolysis-esterification route can be reduced to 1.81 MJ/L biodiesel, and approximately 3.61 MJ can be saved to produce per liter biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fluid flow and heat transfer in a randomly packed bed of sinter particles (RPBSP) is experimentally investigated. Based on the Chilton-Colburn analogy, heat transfer performance is obtained by the naphthalene sublimation technique. The sinter particles, which are coated with naphthalene, are sublimated to obtain the mass transfer characteristics. The results of pressure drop (Δp) in the RPBSP show that most experimental values are within the ±20% deviations of the modified Ergun's equation. The results of Nusselt number (Nu) indicate that, the heat transfer characteristics of the randomly packed bed of the irregular particles are different from that of regular surface particles. Slopes of heat transfer correlations of the RPBSP are larger than these with spheres. Based on the experimental investigations, we employ genetic algorithm (GA) to derive heat transfer correlations. It is found that the GA approach can correlate Nu quite well and two new correlations are obtained to describe convective heat transfer in the RPBSP. Comparisons between correlations developed in the present work and other correlations are also conducted. Lastly, effects of sphericity and porosity are included in a heat transfer correlation when considering physics and heat transfer characteristics. The investigation provides thoughts for dealing with the packed beds with irregular particles, as well as the newly obtained correlations for construction of the mathematical model in sinter cooling bed and design of new cooling equipment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Infrastructure compatible hydrocarbon biofuel proposed to qualify as renewable transportation fuel under the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) is evaluated. The process uses a hybrid poplar feedstock, which undergoes dilute acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Sugars are fermented to acetic acid, which undergoes conversion to ethyl acetate, ethanol, ethylene, and finally a saturated hydrocarbon end product. An unfermentable lignin stream may be burned for steam and electricity production, or gasified to produce hydrogen. During biofuel production, hydrogen gas is required and may be obtained by various methods including lignin gasification. Results: Both technical and economic aspects of the biorefinery are analyzed, with different hydrogen sources considered including steam reforming of natural gas and gasification of lignin. Cash operating costs for jet fuel production are estimated to range from 0.67 to 0.86 USD L-1 depending on facility capacity. Minimum fuel selling prices with a 15 % discount rate are estimated to range from 1.14 to 1.79 USD L-1. Capacities of 76, 190, and 380 million liters of jet fuel per year are investigated. Capital investments range from 356 to 1026 million USD. Conclusions: A unique biorefinery is explored to produce a hydrocarbon biofuel with a high yield from bone dry wood of 330 L t-1. This yield is achieved chiefly due to the use of acetogenic bacteria that do not produce carbon dioxide as a co-product during fermentation. Capital investment is significant in the biorefinery in part because hydrogen is required to produce a fully de-oxygenated fuel. Minimum selling price to achieve reasonable returns on investment is sensitive to capital financing options because of high capital costs. Various strategies, such as producing alternative, intermediate products, are investigated with the intent to reduce risk in building the proposed facility. It appears that producing and selling these intermediates may be more profitable than converting all the biomass into aviation fuel. With variability in historical petroleum prices and environmental subsidies, a high internal rate of return would be required to attract investors. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Successful incorporation of a suitable organic moiety in a porous inorganic metal phosphate network can not only make the corresponding organic-inorganic framework more flexible and robust, but it introduces more hydrophobicity at the surface of the resulting nanostructured material, which is highly desirable for their catalytic application in liquid-phase chemical transformations. Following the success of organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous silicas, a wide range of analogous hybrid metal phosphonates have been designed. This has opened up a wide diversity of open framework porous nanomaterials, which show excellent catalytic activities in many organic transformations that are not possible with their corresponding inorganic counterparts. Here, we have summarized the recent developments in designing organic-inorganic hybrid porous metal phosphonates in this brief review with a special emphasis on their catalytic potential in liquid-phase organic transformations. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Intrinsic kinetics, diffusivity, energy calculations and reaction mechanism studies for the conversion of plant-oil triglycerides over Ni-W/SiO2-Al2O3 hydrocracking catalyst is reported. Specific insights into reaction mechanisms, are established using kinetic modeling and validated with experimental results. Diffusion studies and effectiveness factor calculations established diffusion-free intrinsic kinetics, with an activation energy of 115 kJ/mole required for triglycerides conversion. Thermodynamic calculations further established that the heat released during propane removal step (1.15 MJ/kg) was 8-times higher than that for hydrodeoxygenation step (0.14 MJ/kg) and lowest for hydrocracking reactions (0.08 MJ/kg). Such high exothermicity resulted in high temperature gradient across the catalyst bed (370 °C above the reaction temperature). © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fuels derived from bio-feedstocks have received significant attention for their potential to reduce the consumption of petroleum-based liquid fuels, either through blending or direct use. Biofuels produced from heterotrophic microalgae are particularly attractive because of fast conversion of sustainable plant sugars into renewable oils of controllable quality and composition, but without the need for sunlight or carbon from the atmosphere for growth. This paper describes the results of a fundamental study of the combustion characteristics of hydroprocessed renewable diesel fuel (HRD) produced from this strain of algae, and the results are compared to #2 diesel fuel (DF2) and an equi-volume mixture of HRD and #2 diesel (R50) as representative of blending. A canonical combustion configuration is used for a liquid fuel consisting of an isolated droplet burning with spherical symmetry and with fuel transport being entirely the result of evaporation at the droplet surface. This fundamental liquid fuel burning configuration is conducive to articulating the evaporation and sooting dynamics involved. The results show that combustion rates and relative positions of the flame and soot aggregates to the droplet surface of HRD droplets are quite close to R50 and DF2 in spite of their significant chemical and sooting differences. These trends are explained based on similarities in the thermal properties of the fuels. Sooting propensity of #2 diesel is greater than that of HRD, with the mixture falling qualitatively in-between. The results suggest that HRD derived from heterotrophic microalgae can potentially be considered a drop-in replacement for DF2 or serve as an additive to DF2. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main aim of this study is to investigate integrated methanol production via co-gasification of black liquor (BL) and pyrolysis oil (PO), at Swedish pulp mills. The objectives are to evaluate techno-economically different blends ratios for different pulp mill capacities. Furthermore, the future methanol production potential in Sweden and overall system consequences of large-scale implementation of PO/BL co-gasification are also assessed. It is concluded that gasification of pure BL and PO/BL blends up to 50% results in significantly lower production costs than what can be achieved by gasification of unblended PO. Co-gasification with 20-50% oil addition would be the most advantageous solution based on IRR for integrated biofuel plants in small pulp mills (200 kADt/y), whilst pure black liquor gasification (BLG) will be the most advantageous alternative for larger pulp mills. For pulp mill sizes between 300 and 600 kADt/y, it is also concluded that a feasible methanol production can be achieved at a methanol market price below 100 €/MW h, for production capacities ranging between 0.9 and 1.6 TW h/y for pure BLG, and between 1.2 and 6.5 TW h/y for PO/BL co-gasification. This study also shows that by introducing PO/BL co-gasification, fewer pulp mills would need to be converted to biofuel plants than with pure BLG, to meet a certain biofuel demand for a region. Due to the technical as well as organizational complexity of the integration this may prove beneficial, and could also potentially lower the total investment requirement to meet the total biofuel demand in the system. The main conclusion is that PO/BL co-gasification is a technically and economically attractive production route for production biomethanol. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The enzymatic deconstruction of recalcitrant polysaccharide biomass is central to the conversion of these substrates for societal benefit, such as in biofuels. Traditional models for enzyme-catalysed polysaccharide degradation involved the synergistic action of endo-, exo- and processive glycoside hydrolases working in concert to hydrolyse the substrate. More recently this model has been succeeded by one featuring a newly discovered class of mononuclear copper enzymes: lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs; classified as Auxiliary Activity (AA) enzymes in the CAZy classification). In 2013, the structure of an LPMO from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, BaAA10, was solved with the Cu centre photoreduced to Cu(i) in the X-ray beam. Here we present the catalytic activity of BaAA10. We show that it is a chitin-active LPMO, active on both α and β chitin, with the Cu(ii) binding with low nM KD, and the substrate greatly increasing the thermal stability of the enzyme. A spiral data collection strategy has been used to facilitate access to the previously unobservable Cu(ii) state of the active centre, revealing a coordination geometry around the copper which is distorted from axial symmetry, consistent with the previous findings from EPR spectroscopy. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Subcritical water extraction (SWE) technology has been used for the extraction of active compounds from different biomass materials with low process cost, mild operating conditions, short process times, and environmental sustainability. With the limited application of the technology to microalgal biomass, this work investigates parametrically the potential of subcritical water for high-yield extraction of biochemicals such as carbohydrates and proteins from microalgal biomass. The SWE process was optimized using central composite design (CCD) under varying process conditions of temperature (180-374°C), extraction time (1-20 min), biomass particulate size (38-250 μm), and microalgal biomass loading (5-40 wt.%). Chlorella vulgaris used in this study shows high volatile matter (83.5 wt.%) and carbon content (47.11 wt.%), giving advantage as a feedstock for biofuel production. The results showed maximum total carbohydrate content and protein yields of 14.2 g/100 g and 31.2 g/100 g, respectively, achieved under the process conditions of 277°C, 5% of microalgal biomass loading, and 5 min extraction time. Statistical analysis revealed that, of all the parameters investigated, temperature is the most critical during SWE of microalgal biomass for protein and carbohydrate production. © 2016 S. A.

AB  - A "Spontaneous bubble-template" method is fascinating in that bubbles are formed in situ during material processing and employed as a template for fabricating unique structures, which has not been reported in material science. It is sustainable, green and efficient in that no extra additives or post-treatment are used. Herein, novel metal-polymeric framework derived hierarchically porous carbon/Fe3O4 nanohybrids are prepared using a "spontaneous bubble-template" method by one-step carbonization. During the carbonization process, N and Co are self-doped on porous carbon in which in situ grown nano Fe3O4 is embedded (Fe3O4@N/Co-C). The as-prepared Fe3O4@N/Co-C displays a three-dimensional interpenetrating morphology (electrochemical active area: 729.89 m2 g-1) with well-distributed Fe3O4 nanoparticles (20-50 nm) which are coated with a carbon layer (3-5 nm). Fe3O4@N/Co-C exhibits remarkable oxygen reduction activity in biofuel cells with a distinct output voltage (576 mV) and power density (918 mW m-2), which are 3.6% and 17.8% higher than those of Pt (0.5 mg cm-2), respectively. Besides biofuel cells, Fe3O4@N/Co-C may also have the potential for application in chemical fuel cells, since it demonstrates better oxygen reduction activity in electrochemical measurements. Thus, with the virtues of its low-cost, facile synthesis and large-scale preparation, Fe3O4@N/Co-C is a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction and application in biofuel cells. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - Rice husk is an abundant agricultural waste and the method commonly used for the disposal of rice husk could cause serious environmental and human health problems. Herein, an attempt is made to convert rice husk into value added bio-based products, such as bio-oil and biochar, using washing pretreatment with light bio-oil followed by fast pyrolysis. It can be found that the washing pretreatment with light bio-oil effectively removes a large amount of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs), and has higher removal efficiency than aqueous HCl at the same pH of 2.8 because the phenolic compounds in light bio-oil promote the removal of some AAEMs. Furthermore, the pyrolysis of washed rice husk with light bio-oil results in an increase in bio-oil yield and decrease in water and biochar yields. GC/MS analysis indicated that light bio-oil washing pretreatment prior to a fast pyrolysis process has an important effect on the quality of bio-oil, which results in a significant increase in the relative content of levoglucosan in bio-oil along with a reduction of low molecular weight compounds. Biochar, which is produced in higher yield, has a high silica content and high surface area, and has the potential to produce amorphous silica as well as adsorbent or catalyst support. This study reveals a promising process to convert biomass waste into quality bio-based products. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The main goal of this study was to compare the component and yield of biodiesel obtained by different methods from different sludge in a wastewater treatment plant. Biodiesel was produced by ex-situ and in-situ transesterification of scum, primary and secondary sludge respectively. Results showed that scum sludge had a higher calorific value and neutral lipid than that of primary and secondary sludge. The lipid yield accounted for one-third of the dried scum sludge and the maximum yield attained 22.7% under in-situ transesterification. Furthermore the gas chromatography analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) revealed that all sludge contained a significant amount of palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) regardless of extraction solvents and sludge types used. However, the difference lay in that oleic acid methyl ester was the dominant component in FAMEs produced from scum sludge while palmitic acid methyl ester was the dominant component in FAMEs from primary and secondary sludge. In addition, the percentage of unsaturated fatty acid ester in FAMEs from scum sludge accounted for 57.5-64.1% of the total esters, which was higher than the equivalent derived from primary and secondary sludge. In brief, scum sludge is a potential feedstock for the production of biodiesel and more work is needed in the future. © 2015.

AB  - This work reports bio-oil production by hydrothermal liquefaction of blackcurrant pomace (Ribes nigrum L.), a fruit residue obtained after berry pressing. The bio-oil has a higher heating value of 35.9 MJ kg−1 and low ash content, which makes it suitable for energy applications. We report the influence of process parameters on yields and carbon distribution between products: temperature (563–608 K), holding time (0–240 min), mass fraction of dry biomass in the slurry (0.05–0.29), and initial pH (3.1–12.8) by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Depending on the experiments, the bio-oil accounts for at least 24% mass fraction of the initial dry biomass, while char yields ranges from 24 to 40%. A temperature of 583 K enhances the bio-oil yield, up to 30%, while holding time does not have a significant influence on the results. Increasing biomass concentrations decreases bio-oil yields from 29% to 24%. Adding sodium hydroxide decreases the char yield from 35% at pH = 3.1 (without NaOH) to 24% at pH = 12.8. It also increases the bio-oil yield and carbon transfer to the aqueous phase. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that a 43% mass fraction of the bio-oil boils in the medium naphtha petroleum fraction range. The bio-oil is highly acidic and unsaturated, and its dynamic viscosity is high (1.7 Pa s at 298 K), underlining the need for further upgrading before any use for fuel applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the influence of catalyst content on the physical–chemical properties, yield, and chemical composition of organic liquid products (OLP) obtained by thermal catalytic cracking of palm oil (Elaeis guineensis, Jacq.) was studied at a pilot scale. The experiments were carried out in a reactor of 143 L, running in batch mode at 450 °C and 1 atm, using 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (w/w) Na2CO3 as the catalyst. Physical–chemical characterization of OLP was conducted for acid value, saponification value, specific gravity, refractive index, kinematic viscosity, copper strip corrosion, and flash point. The chemical composition of OLP was determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). As the catalyst content increased, the kinematic viscosity of OLP decreased from 6.59 to 3.63 mm2 s−1 and the acid value from 51.56 to 1.26 mg KOH/g. The GC–MS analysis showed that OLP comprise hydrocarbons (normal paraffin, olefin, and naphthenic) and oxygenated compounds (carboxylic acids, alcohols, ketones, and esters), with a high dependency on the catalyst level. As the catalyst content increased, the concentration of hydrocarbons increased, whereas the concentration of oxygenates decreased. The optimal sodium carbonate catalyst level was found to be 15% (w/w). This gave the highest rate of conversion into biofuel, of which around 60% was OLP, and produced biofuels with the lowest acid values. The physical–chemical properties were within the limits fixed by ANP No. 65 (Diesel S10 specification) due to their high hydrocarbon content (92.84%) and low oxygenate content (7.16%). The hydrocarbons produced had characteristics similar to those of petroleum diesel, offering the potential to replace petroleum fuels without requiring deacidification or deoxygenation pretreatment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The influences of solvent on hydro-liquefaction of cellulose, xylan, and lignin were investigated using micro-autoclave. The maximum conversion and bio-oil yield obtained from cellulose and xylan liquefaction were achieved in methanol, whereas similar liquefaction characteristics of lignin were observed in methanol and ethanol. The molecular simulation of interactions between solvents and subcomponents indicated that methanol and ethanol were highly miscible with raw materials. GC–MS and FT-ICR MS characterization revealed that the chemical compositions of liquid products highly depended on the utilized feedstocks. Esters, ketones, and aldehydes were mainly produced from cellulose and xylan conversion, whereas aromatic compounds were primarily derived from lignin conversion. EA results showed that methanol favored the hydrogenation and deoxygenation, resulting in the heating value increased. It could be concluded that the oil quality was highly improved in supercritical methanol. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Effective carbon-carbon coupling of acetic acid to form larger products while minimizing CO2 emissions is critical to achieving a step change in efficiency for the production of transportation fuels from sustainable biomass. We report the direct acylation of methylfuran with acetic acid in the presence of water, all of which can be readily produced from biomass. This direct coupling limits unwanted polymerization of furanics while producing acetyl methylfuran. Reaction kinetics and density functional theory calculations illustrate that the calculated apparent barrier for the dehydration of the acid to form surface acyl species is similar to the experimentally measured barrier, implying that this step plays a significant role in determining the net reaction rate. Water inhibits the overall rate, but selectivity to acylated products is not affected. We show that furanic species effectively stabilize the charge of the transition state, therefore lowering the overall activation barrier. These results demonstrate a promising new route to C–C bond–forming reactions for the production of higher-value products from biomass. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Carbon particulate matter formed in fuel-rich atmospheric pressure premixed flames of ethylene and ethylene doped with 2,5 dimethyl furan (DMF) (20%) was analyzed in order to investigate the effect of fuel-borne oxygen on soot nanostructure and chemical functionalities. Particles were thermophoretically sampled on quartz plates and analyzed by techniques sensitive to the particle internal structure, namely FTIR, Raman and UV-vis spectroscopy. In nearly identical temperature, equivalence ratio and residence time conditions, the concentration of particulate generated in the biofuel-doped flame was found to be far less of the concentration of ethylene flame particulate. The similarity of UV-vis and Raman spectra showed that DMF addition to ethylene did not significantly change the aromatization process of carbon particulate in the flame. Complementary information on the functional groups located at the edge of the polyaromatic system was probed by FTIR analysis. FTIR spectra showed to be very similar regarding the carbon network in particles produced in both flames. However, the infrared spectrum of the particles produced in the ethylene/DMF flame presented less intense peaks of aromatic hydrogen (900-700 cm-1) and a higher absorption in the 1300-1100 cm-1 wavenumber range. These changes in the infrared spectra were attributed to a higher amount of oxygen atoms that substitute hydrogen atoms at the edges of aromatic clusters of the ethylene/DMF soot particles. Oxygen content was estimated to be larger by few percentages in particles from ethylene/DMF with respect to particles from pure ethylene. This could be the cause for the enhanced reactivity of soot particles generally found for biofuel-derived soot. © 2016 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Oxidative potential (OP) is related to the organic phase, specifically to its oxygenated organic fraction (OOA). Furthermore, the oxygen content of fuel molecules has significant influence on particulate OP. Thus, this study aimed to explore the actual dependency of the OOA and ROS to the oxygen content of the fuel. In order to reach the goal, different biodiesels blends, with various ranges of oxygen content; have been employed. The compact time of flight aerosol mass spectrometer (c-ToF AMS) enabled better identification of OOA. ROS monitored by using two assays: DTT and BPEA-nit. Despite emitting lower mass, both assays agreed that oxygen content of a biodiesel is directly correlated with its OOA, and highly related to its OP. Hence, the more oxygen included in the considered biodiesels, the higher the OP of PM emissions. This highlights the importance of taking oxygen content into account while assessing emissions from new fuel types, which is relevant from a health effects standpoint. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Iso-butanol is a second generation biofuel that has the potential to improve energy security and mitigate harmful pollutants in reciprocating engines. The present study investigates the effect of iso-butanol addition to diesel fuel on performance and emissions of a single cylinder direct-injection diesel engine with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). For this objective, four iso-butanol/diesel blends containing 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% were prepared by volume basis and tested in the engine under three EGR rates: 10% to 30% (at increments of 10%) with the combination of two injection timings: 23° and 21° crank angle (CA) before top dead center (bTDC). Experimental results showed that the combination of 30% EGR rate, 40% iso-butanol addition (ISB40) and retarded injection timing by 2° CA bTDC simultaneously reduced NOx emissions from 1284 to 749 ppm and smoke opacity from 20.7% to 1.9% with a slight drop in performance. It was found that higher iso-butanol/diesel blends require higher EGR levels to attain optimum levels of smoke and NOx emissions. Both hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon-monoxide (CO) emissions presented an increasing trend at escalating EGR rates. At retarded injection timing, ISB40 blend presented decreased HC emissions, increased CO emissions with a slight drop in performance compared to its injection at original timing. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Yeast cells are often used as a model system in various experiments. Moreover, due to their high metabolic activity, yeast cells have a potential to be applied as elements in the design of biofuel cells and biosensors. However a wider application of yeast cells in electrochemical systems is limited due to high electric resistance of their cell wall. In order to reduce this problem we have polymerized conducting polymer polypyrrole (Ppy) directly in the cell wall and/or within periplasmic membrane. In this research the formation of Ppy was induced by [Fe(CN)6]3-ions, which were generated from K4[Fe(CN)6], which was initially added to polymerization solution. The redox process was catalyzed by oxido-reductases, which are present in the plasma membrane of yeast cells. The formation of Ppy was confirmed by spectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy. It was confirmed that the conducting polymer polypyrrole was formed within periplasmic space and/or within the cell wall of yeast cells, which were incubated in solution containing pyrrole, glucose and [Fe(CN)6]4-. After 24h drying at room temperature we have observed that Ppy-modified yeast cell walls retained their initial spherical form. In contrast to Ppy-modified cells, the walls of unmodified yeast have wrinkled after 24h drying. The viability of yeast cells in the presence of different pyrrole concentrations has been evaluated. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As a result of a recent ad hoc prospection of the Algerian territory, a collection of peanut (groundnut; Arachis hypogaea L.) landraces was established, covering a remarkable array of diversity in terms of morphological and physiological features, as well as of adaptation to local bioclimatic conditions. In the present work, the oils extracted from the seeds of these landraces were evaluated in terms of edible properties and suitability for biodiesel production. As for edible use, a low free acidity (ranging from 0.62 to 1.21%) and a high oleic acid content (44.61-50.94%) were common features, although a poor stability to oxidation [high peroxide values, high spectrophotometric indices, and low % of inhibition in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH)• test] was observed in a few cases. As for biodiesel production, low values of acidity [1.23-2.40 mg KOH (g oil)–1], low iodine values [90.70-101.54 g I2 (g oil)–1], high cetane numbers (56.95–58.88) and high calorific values (higher heating value 37.34–39.27 MJ kg–1) were measured. Edible properties and suitability for biodiesel production were discussed with respect to the German standard DIN 51605 for rapeseed oil and to the EN 14214 standard, respectively. One way ANOVA and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed significant differences among the oils from the Algerian peanut landraces. © 2016 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - The industrial conversion of cellulosic plant biomass into useful products such as biofuels is a major societal goal. These technologies harness diverse plant degrading enzymes, classical exo- and endo-acting cellulases and, increasingly, cellulose-active lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, to deconstruct the recalcitrant Β-d-linked polysaccharide. A major drawback with this process is that the exo-acting cellobiohydrolases suffer from severe inhibition from their cellobiose product. Β-d-Glucosidases are therefore important for liberating glucose from cellobiose and thereby relieving limiting product inhibition. Here, the three-dimensional structures of two industrially important family GH3 Β-d-glucosidases from Aspergillus fumigatus and A. oryzae, solved by molecular replacement and refined at 1.95 Å resolution, are reported. Both enzymes, which share 78% sequence identity, display a three-domain structure with the catalytic domain at the interface, as originally shown for barley Β-d-glucan exohydrolase, the first three-dimensional structure solved from glycoside hydrolase family GH3. Both enzymes show extensive N-glycosylation, with only a few external sites being truncated to a single GlcNAc molecule. Those glycans N-linked to the core of the structure are identified purely as highmannose trees, and establish multiple hydrogen bonds between their sugar components and adjacent protein side chains. The extensive glycans pose special problems for crystallographic refinement, and new techniques and protocols were developed especially for this work. These protocols ensured that all of the d-pyranosides in the glycosylation trees were modelled in the preferred minimum-energy4C1chair conformation and should be of general application to refinements of other crystal structures containing O- or N-glycosylation. The Aspergillus GH3 structures, in light of other recent three-dimensional structures, provide insight into fungal Β-d-glucosidases and provide a platform on which to inform and inspire new generations of variant enzymes for industrial application.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop zeolite catalysts to produce jet biofuel from palm oil. Different Ni-loaded zeolites were tested as catalysts in the conversion of palm oil into jet biofuels with high alkane and low arene content. Five zeolite catalyst, were tested: Ni/SAPO-34, Ni/MCM-41, Ni/HY, Ni/SAPO-11 and Ni/Hbeta. Characterization was performed by X-ray diffraction, NH3-temperature-programmed desorption. The Ni/SAPO-34 catalyst exhibited the highest alkane selectivity (65%) and lowest arene selectivity (11%). The jet biofuel yield under catalysis increased from 21.1 to 42.0% when the reaction temperature was increased from 370 to 390 °C. The alkane content of the jet biofuel increased from 71 to 80% and the arene content decreased from 29 to 20%, when the weight ratio of Si/Al in the Ni/HY catalyst was reduced from 11 to 5, but the levels were almost unchanged as the nickel content was increased from 5 to 20%. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Given the low price and abundance of alkali lignin from pulp and paper industry, the conversion of alkali lignin into valuable chemicals has been of great significance to address the world energy crisis. In principle, this process has long relied on the design of a functionalized catalyst to enable high reactivity and selectivity. Herein, we present a systematic study on the hydrogenation liquefaction of alkali lignin using a series of flower-like hierarchical MoS2–based catalysts, in which, the effect of various reaction parameters, such as temperature, H2 pressure, and reaction time, on product yield and distribution was evaluated. Catalysts were characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, surface area, pore size distributions and the average pore diameter of catalysts were also measured and calculated. It is worth noting that the incorporation of a secondary metal sulfide into MoS2 could significantly enhance the catalytic performance. Particularly, by using 5 wt% CoS2/MoS2 as catalyst and having H2 pressure, reaction temperature, and reaction time set to be 2.5 MPa, 310 °C, and 1 h, respectively, the highest conversion of alkali lignin could reach 91.26%, with a bio-oil yield of 86.24%. This work thus offers an effective approach to improve the conversion and selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of alkali lignin into bio-oil by using MoS2–based catalysts. © 2016

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a thermal conversion process that converts high-moisture biomass into hydrochar. HTC was applied to stabilize and process sludge collected from septic tanks into hydrochar for practical energy recovery. Experiments were conducted with a 1-L high-pressure reactor operating at different temperatures and reaction times in which the sludge was mixed with catalysts and biomass at different ratios. The effects of catalysts (i.e., acetic acid, lithium chloride, borax, and zeolite) and biomass (i.e., cassava pulp, dried leaves, pig manure, and rice husks) mixing with sludge for hydrochar production were investigated. The experimental data showed acetic acid and cassava pulp to be the most effective catalyst and biomass, respectively, increasing energy contents to the maximum value of 28.5 MJ/kg. The optimum HTC conditions were as follows: sludge/acetic acid/cassava pulp mixing ratio of 1/0.4/1 (by weight), at a temperature of 220 °C, and reaction time of 0.5 h. The relatively high energy contents of the produced hydrochar suggest its applicability as a solid fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of cotton straw was performed under different temperature ranges, particle sizes, holding times and acid concentrations in a fluidized bed reactor to maximize the yield of levoglucosan (LG). The maximum LG yield was obtained at the optimal pyrolytic conditions: temperature of 500 °C, holding time of 1.4 s, particle size of 600–650 μm and acid concentration of 8%. Furthermore, an improved method to quickly and easily extract LG from bio-oil was developed by utilizing precipitation and Soxhlet extraction to quantitatively remove organic colloid, pigments and aromatic compounds with less loss of LG during extraction. The process was optimized by using Box-Behnken design for three reaction parameters: the volume of water (A), the quality of activiaed carbon (B), and pH (C). The extraction presented required no prolonged high heating (thus protecting the LG from hydrolysis), used benign reagents, and realized a significant purity over other methods. The purity and structure of LG were determined by busing chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, such as HPLC, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. The optimal extraction yield of LG from the straw bio-oil was 78% with the purity of 95.56%. This research also applied a new method to quickly determine the quantitative and qualitative analysis test parameters of LG. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fossil fuels as the main energy source of every country now predicted will be ended no more than 40 years. Therefore, alternative fuel such as biofuel has been developed by many countries including Indonesia. Indonesia as one of the highest populated country and has wide areas of agriculture, forest and crop field is potential to be the highest biofuel production in the world. However, after one decade since the Government of Indonesia launched the energy Policy in 2006, appears to be interesting that the biofuels progress in Indonesia seen not well developed. One of the basic weaknesses is the program only applied to the specific area with a high biofuel resource by central government without support by local government. Furthermore, the target of biofuel programs seems to be very high or too ambitious, while the condition of the people still very traditional which can be seen from the lifestyle and their energy consumption. This paper provides in detail a review of several topics related to resource, energy consumption, policy and the research and development activities of biofuel in Indonesia. As a discussion, some recommendation provided to encourage the biofuel development in the near future. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Bio-oil was subjected to hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions with polar protic (ethanol), polar aprotic (acetone), and nonpolar (ether) solvents in the presence of Pt/C catalyst. Mass balances (gas, light oil, heavy oil and char) of products were influenced by the solvent used. Subjecting the oil to HDO yielded improvement in the following heavy oil properties: water content, heating value, viscosity, acidity, and oxygen level. Especially, the viscosity was reduced from 29.6 cSt of the bio-oil to 2.2–4.4 cSt when ethanol was used, to 3.0–4.2 cSt when acetone was used, and to 6.5–6.7 cSt when ether was used. The initially acidic bio-oil was neutralized by HDO. Furthermore, HDO decreased the water and oxygen content of heavy oil, thereby improving its higher heating value (HHV). Because the polar protic solvent was able to react with bio-oil as a co-reactant during HDO, acid-type components in the bio-oil were converted into acid or ester forms, which were found in the light oil. In terms of carbon recovery from bio-oil to the heavy oil fraction, acetone was the most effective solvent, yielding 72.8% recovery, followed by ether (64.7%) and ethanol (55.3%). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The efficiency of two white-rot fungi (WRF), Trametes versicolor and Ganoderma lucidum, to eliminate thirteen pharmaceutical pollutants with concomitant biodiesel production from the accumulating lipid content after treatment, was examined. The removal efficiency was studied using both individual and combined strains. The results of individual and combined strains showed a total removal (100%) of diclofenac (DCF), gemfibrozil (GFZ), ibuprofen (IBP), progesterone (PGT) and ranitidine (RNT). Lower removals were achieved for 4-acetamidoantipyrin (AAA), clofibric acid (ACF), atenolol (ATN), caffeine (CFN), carbamazepine (CZP), hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulpiride (SPD), although the combination of both strains enhanced the system's efficiency, with removals ranging from 15 to 41%. This increase of the removal efficiency when combining both strains was attributed to the interactions developed between them (i.e., competition). Results from enzymatic and cytochrome P450 examination suggested that both extracellular (laccase, MnP, LiP) and intracellular oxidation mechanisms participate in the biological removal of pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, the "green" potential of the fungal sludge generated during the biological removal process was assessed for biodiesel production by means of one-step direct (in-situ) transformation. This process consists of the simultaneous extraction and conversion of lipids contained in the sludge by catalytic esterification/transesterification using a robust acid heterogeneous Zr-SBA-15 catalyst. This catalytic system provided conversions close to 80% of the saponifiable fraction (including free fatty acids and glycerides) in the presence of high amount of impurities. The overall weight FAME yield, based on the initial dried mass, was close to 30% for both strains. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we developed a detailed process model to evaluate the potential of heat generation from biomass combustion in a CFB (circulating fluidized bed) combustor by coupling Aspen Plus simulator and dedicated FORTRAN subroutines. Mass yields of permanent syngas and solid char are simulated with respect to the pyrolysis temperature by a series of experimental correlations. Particular emphasis was placed on the influence of EOR (excess oxygen ration) upon released emissions and temperature. The parameter of biomass particle size was taken into account to evaluate its impact on combustion parameters and pollutants. To better understand the oxy-fuel combustion, the combustion efficiency (ηc) evaluated as a function of the equivalence ratio and EOR. In order to evaluate the influence of the metal catalysts on the reaction temperature and the concentration of air pollutants, an experimental study of catalytic combustion was also carried out. Model predictions were compared with available data from the literature, which showed fully good agreement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Syngas generated by thermal gasification of biomass or coal can be steam reformed and purified into methane, which could be used locally for energy needs, or re-injected in the natural gas grid. As an alternative to chemical catalysis, the main components of the syngas (CO, CO2, and H2) can be used as substrates by a wide range of microorganisms, to be converted into gas biofuels, including methane. This study evaluates the carboxydotrophic (CO-consuming) methanogenic potential present in an anaerobic sludge from an upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor treating waste water, and elucidates the CO conversion routes to methane at 35 ± 3°C. Kinetic activity tests under CO at partial pressures (pCO) varying from 0.1 to 1.5 atm (0.09-1.31 mmol/L in the liquid phase) showed a significant carboxydotrophic activity potential for growing conditions on CO alone. A maximum methanogenic activity of 1 mmol CH4 per g of volatile suspended solid and per day was achieved at 0.2 atm of CO (0.17 mmol/L), and then the rate decreased with the amount of CO supplied. The intermediary metabolites such as acetate, H2, and propionate started to accumulate at higher CO concentrations. Inhibition experiments with 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BES), fluoroacetate, and vancomycin showed that in a mixed culture CO was converted mainly to acetate by acetogenic bacteria, which was further transformed to methane by acetoclastic methanogens, while direct methanogenic CO conversion was negligible. Methanogenesis was totally blocked at high pCO in the bottles (≥ 1 atm). However it was possible to achieve higher methanogenic potential under a 100% CO atmosphere after acclimation of the sludge to CO. This adaptation to high CO concentrations led to a shift in the archaeal population, then dominated by hydrogen-utilizing methanogens, which were able to take over acetoclastic methanogens, while syntrophic acetate oxidizing (SAO) bacteria oxidized acetate into CO2 and H2. The disaggregation of the granular sludge showed a negative impact on their methanogenic activity, confirming that the acetoclastic methanogens were the most sensitive to CO, and a contrario, the advantage of using granular sludge for further development toward large-scale methane production from CO-rich syngas. © 2016 Sancho Navarro, Cimpoia, Bruant and Guiot.

AB  - In this work, we demonstrate the scale-up from an 80 L fed-batch scale to 40 m3 along with the design of a 4 m3continuous process for enzymatic biodiesel production catalyzed by NS-40116 (a liquid formulation of a modified Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase). Based on the analysis of actual pilot plant data for the transesterification of used cooking oil and brown grease, we propose a method applying first order integral analysis to fed-batch data based on either the bound glycerol or free fatty acid content in the oil. This method greatly simplifies the modeling process and gives an indication of the effect of mixing at the various scales (80 L to 40 m3) along with the prediction of the residence time needed to reach a desired conversion in a CSTR. Suitable process metrics reflecting commercial performance such as the reaction time, enzyme efficiency, and reactor productivity were evaluated for both the fed-batch and CSTR cases. Given similar operating conditions, the CSTR operation on average, has a reaction time which is 1.3 times greater than the fed-batch operation. We also showed how the process metrics can be used to quickly estimate the selling price of the enzyme. Assuming a biodiesel selling price of 0.6 USD/kg and a one-time use of the enzyme (0.1% (w/woil) enzyme dosage); the enzyme can then be sold for 30 USD/kg which ensures that that the enzyme cost is not more than 5% of the biodiesel revenue.

AB  - Although the hydrothermal liquefaction is considered a promising technology for converting microalgae into liquid biofuels, there are still some disadvantages. This paper demonstrated that the bio-oil yield can be significantly improved by adding alcohols as co-solvents and carrying out the conversion at mild conditions (<250 °C), but at the expense of a reduced bio-oil quality. By adding ethanol, the bio-oil yields obtained (up to ∼60%) were comparable to the yield obtained at severe operating conditions using only water as solvent (54 ± 2% on average), but the quality of the bio-oil was lower. However, the main advantages of the process here described lie in the utilisation of wet microalgae (∼75% moisture) and alcohol concentrations which avoid both drying the microalgae and decreasing the amount of microalgae loaded in the reactor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke (JA) is recognized as a suitable candidate biomass crop for bioethanol production because it has a rapid growth rate and high biomass productivity. In this study, hydrogen peroxide-acetic acid (HPAC) pretreatment was used to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis and to effectively remove the lignin of JA. With optimized enzyme doses, synergy was observed from the combination of three different enzymes (RUT-C30, pectinase, and xylanase) which provided a conversion rate was approximately 30% higher than the rate with from treatment with RUT-C30 alone. Fermentation of the JA hydrolyzates by Saccharomyces cerevisiae produced a fermentation yield of approximately 84%. Therefore, Jerusalem artichoke has potential as a bioenergy crop for bioethanol production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the effects of cooking conditions on the cold flow properties and kinematic viscosity of biodiesel produced from cooking oils were investigated. Sunflower, corn and canola oils were used as vegetable oils. Salt content, water content, cooking time and cooking temperature were selected as the experimental parameters. Some of the physical properties such as kinematic viscosity, density, cloud point and pour point were examined. In addition, total polar material contents, heating values and acid values of biodiesel produced from waste cooking oils were analysed. The results of the study revealed that increase in salt and water content, cooking time and temperature led to deterioration in the physical properties and cold flow properties of B100 biodiesel samples from waste cooking oils of sunflower, corn and canola oils. On the other hand, the heating values of all biodiesels were found to improve with the increasing salt content. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a pressing need to develop efficient and sustainable approaches to harvesting microalgae for biofuel production and water treatment. CO2-switchable crystalline nanocellulose (CNC) modified with 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole (APIm) is proposed as a reversible coagulant for harvesting microalgae. Compared to native CNC, the positively charged APIm-modified CNC, which dispersed well in carbonated water, showed appreciable electrostatic interaction with negatively charged Chlorella vulgaris upon CO2-treatment. The gelation between the modified CNC, triggered by subsequent air sparging, can also enmesh adjacent microalgae and/or microalgae-modified CNC aggregates, thereby further enhancing harvesting efficiencies. Moreover, the surface charges and dispersion/gelation of APIm-modified CNC could be reversibly adjusted by alternatively sparging CO2/air. This CO2-switchability would make the reusability of redispersed CNC for further harvesting possible. After harvesting, the supernatant following sedimentation can be reused for microalgal cultivation without detrimental effects on cell growth. The use of this approach for harvesting microalgae presents an advantage to other current methods available because all materials involved, including the cellulose, CO2, and air, are natural and biocompatible without adverse effects on the downstream processing for biofuel production. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - It is possible to produce hydrocarbons by hydrocracking of biomass, such as those produced by crude oil cracking. This product can be incorporated as raw material in petrochemical industry and used as petroleum fractions without any changes on engines. The hydrocracking process was performed over NaZSM5 and HZSM5, where the improvement of this acidity was carried out by ion exchange with ammonia followed by calcination. The reactions were performed on a stainless steel fixed bed reactor. The catalyst was evaluated at 723 K and 138 kPa, under flow of hydrogen gas, with weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4 h-1. Products are analysed by gas chromatography with mass spectra detector (GC-MS) and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 1H. For the fresh catalyst, all triglyceride was converted to hydrocarbon by the process. For NaZSM5, the catalyst activity is high but has a high decrease over the time of reaction. It was changed for HZSM5, where the catalyst maintained a high activity even after 90 min of reaction. This treatment improved also the product, where a high yield of gaseous hydrocarbon was changed to a high yield of liquid hydrocarbon, especially by the presence of aromatics molecules. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transforming renewable raw materials into biofuels has attracted growing attention due to economic and environmental reasons. The inevitable depletion of fossil fuels, and the increasing generation of greenhouse gas have motivated the development of environmentally friendly processes for biodiesel production. The conversion of acid non-edible vegetal oils using recyclable catalysts has been the goal pursued by research groups around the world. Heteropolyacids are attractive alternative because these are catalysts with acidic properties, which may be easily tunable by structural changes and can be supported on solid with high surface area. Heteropolyacids are oxygen cluster coordinates to addenda atom (i.e. W, Mo, V), which are coordinated to only central atom (i.e. P, Si, As). Biorefinery processes have intensively used this versatile class of catalysts to convert biomass derivative-platform molecules into chemicals and biofuels. Currently, solid supported heteropolyacids have been the catalysts used in various routes to produce biodiesel from vegetable oils and other lipidic feedstock. The combination of renewable and affordable raw materials with efficient solid catalysts (i.e. heteropolyacids) is doubtlessly an industrially strategic route for biodiesel production, and has been widely studied. In this review, the latest research and innovation towards developing processes for biodiesel production based on heteropolyacids will be highlighted. Particular attention was paid to the processes performed in liquid phase under heterogeneous catalysis conditions. Heterogeneous processes have been performed on solid supported heteropolyacids; carbon fibers, silica, zirconia, nanotubes, and niobium are examples of support discussed in this review. In this review, effort was made to describe the advances achieved in the heteropolyacid-catalyzed routes in converting triglycerides and fatty acids into biodiesel. The main synthesis methods and characterization of solid supported heteropolyacids were also addressed. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Cellulases are the enzymes which are responsible for the hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass. In this study thermal and pH stability of crude cellulase has been investigated in the presence of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. We synthesized ZnO nanoparticle by sol-gel method and characterized through various techniques including, X-ray Diffraction, ultraviolet-visible spectroscope, field emission scanning electron microscope and high resolution scanning electron microscope. The crude thermostable cellulase has been obtained from the Aspergillus fumigatus AA001 and treated with ZnO nanoparticle which shows thermal stability at 65°C up to 10 h whereas it showed pH stability in the alkaline pH range and retained its 53% of relative activity at pH 10.5. These findings may be promising in the area of biofuels production. © 2016 Srivastava, Srivastava, Mishra and Ramteke.

AB  - Sewage sludge is the major byproduct generated in wastewater treatment plants and a potential resource for biofuel production. This study investigated the catalytic pyrolysis (CP) of sewage sludge with HZSM-5 (CBV2314) in a microfurnace pyrolyzer for the production of hydrocarbons and ammonia. Pyrolysis temperature had a significant role in the production and selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons, olefins, and alkanes. Acid pretreatments including infusion and washing were employed to alleviate the catalytic effects of ash content in sewage sludge and improve the hydrocarbon production of CP. Both acid-infusion and acid-washing enhanced hydrocarbon production but acid-infusion yielded higher hydrocarbon production than acid-washing. At 650 °C the optimal acid infusion loading was 1 mmol·g-1 sewage sludge and hydrocarbon yields reached to 51.4%. CP of acid-pretreated sewage sludge enhanced the denitrogenation of volatiles by releasing nitrogen as ammonia which could be recycled as fertilizer. These findings demonstrated that CP with acid pretreatment is a promising approach to converting sewage sludge into valuable fuels and chemicals. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Bio-oil produced from conventional flash pyrolysis has poor quality and requires expensive upgrading before it can be used as a transportation fuel. In this work, a high quality bio-oil has been produced using a novel approach where flash pyrolysis, catalysis and fractionation of pyrolysis vapors using two stage condensation are combined in a single process unit. A bench scale unit of 1 kg/h feedstock capacity is used for catalytic pyrolysis in an entrained down-flow reactor system equipped with two-staged condensation of the pyrolysis vapor. Zeolite-based catalysts are investigated to study the effect of varying acidities of faujasite Y zeolites, zeolite structures (ZSM5), different catalyst to biomass ratios and different catalytic pyrolysis temperatures. Low catalyst/biomass ratios did not show any significant improvements in the bio-oil quality, while high catalyst/biomass ratios showed an effective deoxygenation of the bio-oil. The application of zeolites decreased the organic liquid yield due to the increased production of non-condensables, primarily hydrocarbons. The catalytically produced bio-oil was less viscous and zeolites were effective at cracking heavy molecular weight compounds in the bio-oil. Acidic zeolites, H-Y and H-ZSM5, increased the desirable chemical compounds in the bio-oil such as phenols, furans and hydrocarbon, and reduced the undesired compounds such as acids. On the other hand reducing the acidity of zeolites reduced some of the undesired compounds in the bio-oil such as ketones and aldehydes. The performance of H-Y was superior to that of the rest of zeolites studied: Bio-oil of high chemical and calorific value was produced with a high organic liquid yield and low oxygen content. H-ZSM5 was a close competitor to H-Y in performance but with a lower yield of bio-oil. Online fractionation of catalytic pyrolysis vapors was employed by controlling the condenser temperature and proved to be a successful process parameter to tailor the desired bio-oil properties. A high calorific value bio-oil having up to 90% organics was produced using two staged condensation of catalytic pyrolysis vapor. Zeolite-based acidic catalysts can be used for selective deoxygenation, and the catalytic bio-oil quality can be further improved with staged vapor condensation. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - A process development unit (PDU) with 10 kg/h biomass capacity was designed, built and operated for fast pyrolysis of biomass. A twin-screw type reactor, in earlier applications used for treatment of coal, oil shale, oil sand and oil refinery residues, was used. Test campaigns with a variety of biomass types were performed. The results with hard-wood, softwood, wheat straw and wheat bran are reported and discussed in this paper, verifying the suitability of the twin screw reactor along with a new product recovery procedure. Liquid pyrolysis condensate, termed bio-oil, is the main product of FP and the yields are about 65 ± 10 wt.% for wood but only about 50 ± 10 wt.% for cereal straw, which is a typical result for all fast growing types of biomass with higher ash content. These product yields and properties are similar to those found for other FP reactor types and recovery procedures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The enzyme-catalysed degradation of oligo and polysaccharides is of considerable interest in many fields ranging from the fundamental - understanding the intrinsic chemical beauty - through to the applied, including diverse practical applications in medicine and biotechnology. Carbohydrates are the most stereochemically-complex biopolymer, and myriad different natural polysaccharides have led to evolution of multifaceted enzyme consortia for their degradation. The glycosidic bonds that link sugar monomers are among the most chemically-stable, yet enzymatically-labile, bonds in the biosphere. That glycoside hydrolases can achieve a rate enhancement (kcat/kuncat) &gt;1017-fold provides testament to their remarkable proficiency and the sophistication of their catalysis reaction mechanisms. The last two decades have seen significant advances in the discovery of new glycosidase sequences, sequence-based classification into families and clans, 3D structures and reaction mechanisms, providing new insights into enzymatic catalysis. New impetus to these studies has been provided by the challenges inherent in plant and microbial polysaccharide degradation, both in the context of environmentally-sustainable routes to foods and biofuels, and increasingly in human nutrition. Study of the reaction mechanism of glycoside hydrolases has also inspired the development of enzyme inhibitors, both as mechanistic probes and increasingly as therapeutic agents. We are on the cusp of a new era where we are learning how to dovetail powerful computational techniques with structural and kinetic data to provide an unprecedented view of conformational details of enzyme action. © 2016 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.

AB  - Three novel alkaline guanidine ionic liquids as amphiphilic catalysts have been successfully synthesized for two-phase transesterification, which can efficiently improve the catalytic activity for the synthesis of biodiesel. They were characterized by a series of techniques including 1H NMR, thermal stability, electronegativity (DFT calculation), basicity and conductivity. It was demonstrated that 1,1,3,3-trimethyl-2-octyl-guanidine hydroxide(IL3) exhibited better catalytic activity compared with other base guanidine ionic liquid catalysts, which was related to the better basicity and electronegativity of the ILs. The experimental results indicated that catalytic performance was relative to both enough alkaline center and conductivity of ionic liquid catalysts, but the former was a main factor in the catalytic system. The catalytic performance also revealed that optimum catalyst dosage was about 6 wt.%, the appropriate reaction temperature was about 55 °C, the optimum n(Methanol)/n(Soybean Oil) for the biodiesel synthesis was about 15:1 and the suitable reaction time was 4 h on the basis of biodiesel yield of 97%. In addition, the reaction mechanism of the amphiphilic catalyst was illuminated by the interaction between the methoxyl group and the carbonyl group of the triglyceride after activating for two-phase transesterification. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A large number of alternative fuel molecules based on lignocellulosic biomass have been proposed recently, but a reliable evaluation of their economic potential is challenging due to the limited data available. A rapid screening methodology, Reaction Network Flux Analysis (RNFA), has been suggested to screen a large number of future reaction pathways. The RNFA is extended in this work by a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to account for inevitable uncertainty in the underlying data and hence in the ranking of biofuel candidates with respect to cost and environmental impact. The extended RNFA is then used to assess and rank candidate reaction pathways and associated processes for the production of a variety of proposed future pure-component biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Ethyllevulinate and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran have been identified as promising alternatives to bioethanol, while lignin-based biofuels can be excluded from further consideration. Methane is found to be attractive economically but shows significant environmental impact. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Nickel (Ni) and ruthenium (Ru) decorated nanosprings (Ni-NS and Ru-NS) were prepared for use as potential hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) catalysts. The nanocatalysts were characterized by BET surface area measurements, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and showed the NSs had a helical and mesoporous structure. The Ni and Ru decorated NSs showed good metal dispersity at the NS surface. Catalytic HDO conversion of phenol (model bio-oil compound) using NS were compared to conventional alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) gel catalyst supports. Ni-Al2O3 was easily deactivated in the presence of water while the Ni-NS catalysts performed very well irrespective of water being present. An increase in Ni loading (up to 50%) increased the Ni-NS activity while the high loading resulted in a detrimental effect on the activity of silica gel based catalysts. Ru based catalysts showed better activity and conversion on phenol HDO than Ni based catalysts, even in the presence of water. Ponderosa pine pyrolysis bio-oil was fractionated into water-soluble (WS) and water-insoluble (WI) fractions. The bio-oil WI fraction was first hydrocracked to lower its molar mass and then HDO treated with Ni-NS to successfully form cycloalkanes products. These NS based HDO catalysts show promise for upgrading pyrolysis bio-oils to biofuels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oil palm mesocarp fibre (OPMF) was pyrolysed on zeolite synthesised from oil palm ash (OPAZ) by using a slow heating fixed-bed reactor at 400 °C–600 °C. The maximum bio-oil yield of OPAZ-catalysed pyrolysis at 550 °C was 37.98 wt%, which was higher than that of non-catalytic pyrolysis (31.95 wt%) at the same temperature. GC–MS revealed the extensive variety of oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oils derived from the non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis. Catalytic pyrolysis increased the amount of light phenol relative to that of heavy phenols and remarkably reduced the amount of acids, alcohols, hydrocarbons and hydrocyclic compounds. The oxygen content of the bio-oil decreased, resulting in enhanced fuel potential of the bio-oil and other valuable chemicals. The morphology and textural characteristics of OPAZ sustained the propensity of the catalyst-driven pyrolysis by upgrading the OPMF pyrolysis oil into a fuel-grade bio-oil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydrogenation is considered as an efficient technique for upgrading pyrolysis bio-oil. High flammability of hydrogen gas in contact with air leads to difficult control of high pressurized hydrogen gas in large-scale systems. Meanwhile, molecular hydrogen production is a costly industrial process. Thus, hydrogenation study using hydrogen donor (H-donor) material as alternative for hydrogen gas could be useful in terms of cost and safety control. In this study, the potential of decalin and tetralin for use as hydrogen source was investigated in transfer hydrogenation of renewable lignin-derived phenolic compounds (phenol, o-cresol and guaiacol) and a simulated phenolic bio-oil over Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts. Reaction mechanisms of H-donor dehydrogenation and phenolics hydrogenation were studied. Catalytic activity of Pt/C for transfer hydrogenation of the phenolic compounds was higher than that of Pd/C at reaction temperature of 275 °C. Decalin as hydrogen source showed to be more efficient for hydrogenation of the phenolic compounds compared to tetralin. In addition, the influence of water content on transfer hydrogenation activity was studied by employing the water to donor ratios of 0/100, 25/75, 50/50 and 75/25 g/g. Maximum hydrogenation of phenol as bio-oil model compound was observed at water to donor ratio of 50/50 g/g. © 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Mixed and ground activated snail shell and kaolin catalysts impregnated with KBr were investigated. The snail shell and kaolin were calcined, mixed, and ground prior to immersion with KBr solution and subsequent activation at 500 °C for 3 h. The precursor and catalysts were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area. The catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts was evaluated by transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. The effects of various parameters on biodiesel yield were investigated. A biodiesel yield of 98.5% was achieved using the catalyst prepared by 40% KBr-immersed, mixed, and ground snail shell and kaolin, which were activated at 500 °C. The transesterification conditions were as follows: reaction temperature, 65 °C; reaction time, 2 h; methanol-to-soybean oil molar ratio, 6:1; and catalyst amount (relative to the weight of soybean oil), 2.0 wt%. The solid catalyst could be reused for four times, and biodiesel yield remained over 73.6% for the fourth time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The presence of phospholipid has been a challenge in liquid enzymatic biodiesel production. Among six lipases that were screened, lipase AY had the highest hydrolysis activity and a competitive transesterification activity. However, it yielded only 21.1% FAME from oil containing phospholipids. By replacing portions of these lipases with a more robust bioFAME lipase, CalT, the combination of lipase AY-CalT gave the highest FAME yield with the least amounts of free fatty acids and partial glycerides. A higher methanol addition rate reduced FAME yields for lipase DF-CalT and A10D-CalT combinations while that of lipase AY-CalT combination improved. Optimizing the methanol addition rate for lipase AY-CalT resulted in a FAME yield of 88.1% at 2 h and more than 95% at 6 h. This effective use of lipases could be applied for the rapid and economic conversion of unrefined oils to biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A series of Co-Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts was prepared using an impregnation method for the thermal conversion of prairie cordgrass (PCG). The catalysts were characterized by BET measurements, XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, and TEM. The Co-Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested in the thermal conversion of PCG to produce hydrocarbon biofuel in a two-stage catalytic pyrolysis system. The products were analyzed and included incondensable gas, bio-oil, and biochar. Compared to non-catalytically obtained bio-oil, the chemical composition, water content, higher heating value, viscosity, and density of the catalytic bio-oils were improved. The results indicated that 4 %Mo-2 %Co/HZSM-5 showed a robust ability in the catalytic cracking of PCG with the highest yield of hydrocarbons at 41.08 %. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Pyrolysis of Xanthium strumarium has been performed in a fixed-bed tubular reactor with boron minerals (ulexite, colemanite, and borax) and without catalyst at three different temperatures ranging from 350°C to 550°C with heating rate of 50°C/min. The amounts of bio-oil, bio-char, and gas generated, also the compositions of the resulting bio-oils were identified by GC-MS and FT-IR. The influences of pyrolysis parameters, such as temperature and catalyst on product yields were investigated. Temperature and catalyst were found to be the main factors affecting the conversion of Xanthium strumarium into solid, liquid, and gaseous products. The highest liquid yield (27.97%) including water was obtained with 10% colemanite (Ca2B6O11.5H2O) catalyst at 550°C temperature at a heating rate of 50°C/min when 0.224 &gt; Dp &gt; 0.150 mm particle size raw material and 100 cm3/min of sweeping gas flow rate were used. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Isobutanol is one of the next-generation biofuels that may potentially help to relieve the energy crisis and environmental problems. This study investigates the emissions of carbonyl compounds and regulated pollutants that are produced from diesel engine combustion in idle mode. Varied mixtures of diesel, biodiesel (up to 40 vol.%), and isobutanol (10 vol.%) components are compared with premium diesel fuels in terms of their combustion emissions. Experimental results indicate that major carbonyls in the exhaust, in order, are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein, and they account for 77.7% to 83.8% of the total carbonyl compound concentrations emitted from a diesel engine fueled with all test fuels including diesel. With the increase of the biodiesel proportion in the blends of diesel-biodiesel-isobutanol, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOX), and particulate matters (PMs) are decreased by an average of 3.45, 32.5, and 38.5 vol.%, respectively. The effect of the biodiesel proportion in the blends on carbonyl emissions is significant due to the fact that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are able to be reduced by 14.4 to 54.5 vol.% in average, respectively. Although the blended fuels benefit pollutant emissions, an increase of brake specific fuel consumption is observed with an elevated percentage of biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To efficiently utilize water-soluble compounds in bio-oil and evaluate the potential effects of these compounds on processes such as microbial electrolysis, this study investigated the physicochemical properties of bio-oil and the associated aqueous phase generated from switchgrass using a semi-pilot scale auger pyrolyzer. Combining separation and detection strategies with organic solvent extraction, an array of analytical instruments and methods were used to identify and quantify the chemical constituents. Separation of an aqueous phase from the crude bio-oil was achieved by adding water (water: crude bio-oil at 4:1 in weight), which resulted in a partition of 61 wt.% of the organic compounds into a bio-oil aqueous phase (BOAP). GC/MS analysis for BOAP identified over 40 compounds of which 16 were quantified. Acetic acid, propionic acid, and levoglucosan are the major components in BOAP. In addition, a significant portion of chemicals that have the potential to be upgraded to hydrocarbon fuels was extracted to BOAP (77 wt.% of the alcohols, 61 wt.% of the furans, and 52 wt.% of the phenolic compounds in crude bio-oil). Valorization of the BOAP may require conversion methods capable of accommodating a very broad substrate specificity. A better separation strategy is needed to selectively remove the acidic and polar components from crude bio-oil to improve economic feasibility of biorefinery operations.

AB  - The slow pyrolysis process of poultry litter was investigated using different experimental and analytical techniques. A fixed bed reactor was used for the simulation of the slow pyrolysis process up to a constant temperature (400-800 °C) under nitrogen flow. Yields of the different product fractions were determined. On-line FTIR techniques were used to detect the most significant compounds in the evolved gas (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane). GC-MS results allowed the identification of the more important categories of compounds in the liquid condensate (phenols, fatty acids, sterols, N-containing compounds). The fate of nitrogen and sulphur, present in relevant amounts in the original substrate, was investigated: sulphur remains mostly in char at any investigated temperature, while nitrogen is split among the different products, slightly increasing its transfer to the gas phase only at higher pyrolysis temperatures. The energy transfer from the original biomass substrate to the different product fractions was also investigated. The fraction of biomass energy transferred to non-condensable gases raises with pyrolysis temperature and was estimated to be able to thermally sustain the process at 550 °C. The results obtained shed some light on the potential use of the slow pyrolysis process for sanitation and waste-to-energy valorization of poultry litter. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is considered a marker for biomass burning emissions and is a component of vehicle exhaust. Despite its potential health impacts, vehicular HCN emissions estimates and their contribution to regional budgets are highly uncertain. In the current study, Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) was used to measure HCN emission factors from the exhaust of individual diesel, biodiesel and gasoline vehicles. Laboratory emissions data as a function of fuel type and driving mode were combined with ambient measurement data and model predictions. The results indicate that gasoline vehicles have the highest emissions of HCN (relative to diesel fuel) and that biodiesel fuel has the potential to significantly reduce HCN emissions even at realistic 5% blend levels. The data further demonstrate that gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines emit more HCN than their port fuel injection (PFI) counterparts, suggesting that the expected full transition of vehicle fleets to GDI will increase HCN emissions. Ambient measurements of HCN in a traffic dominated area of Toronto, Canada were strongly correlated to vehicle emission markers and consistent with regional air quality model predictions of ambient air HCN, indicating that vehicle emissions of HCN are the dominant source of exposure in urban areas. The results further indicate that additional work is required to quantify HCN emissions from the modern vehicle fleet, particularly in light of continuously changing engine, fuel and after-treatment technologies. © 2016.

AB  - This investigation deals with the production of Alexandrian laurel (Calophyllum inophyllum) biodiesel (ALB) and study of the effects of its fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) compositions and physicochemical properties on the engine performance, combustion, and emissions. The experiment had been conducted in a four cylinder turbocharged diesel engine under varying speeds and full loading condition. 10% (ALB10) and 20% (ALB20) blends of Alexandrian laurel biodiesel along with the Diesel and B5 fuel (95% diesel and 5% palm biodiesel) were used for this experiment. ALB consisted of 31.6% saturated and 68.4% unsaturated FAME. Longer chain fatty acids and 10.9% oxygen content of ALB greatly influenced the engine combustion and emission characteristics. Brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) was found on average 6%-20% higher for B5, ALB10, and ALB20 blends compared to diesel fuel. It was observed that ALB operation shortened the ignition delay period, increased the mass fraction burnt (MFB), and reduced the pick cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR) and combustion duration. CO and HC emissions were decreased significantly while operating on B5, ALB10, and ALB20 blends compared to diesel fuel. ALB blends produced on average, 2.5%-3% higher NOX emissions with respect to diesel fuel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Two-step hydrotreatment experiments were performed using three completely different bio-oil fractions namely: whole bio-oil, heavy bio-oil obtained after fractional condensation of pyrolysis vapours and pyrolytic lignin obtained by cold water precipitation of the bio-oil. The aim is to study the de-oxygenation and in addition SEC and UV-fluorescence analysis was used to identify the importance of cracking, polymerization and hydrogenation reactions of the three different bio-oil feedstocks. In the first step hydrotreatment, Ru/C was used at 250 or 300 °C with reaction time of 2 h. In the second step hydrotreatment, Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst was used at 375 or 400 °C, with reaction time of 2 or 4 h. During stabilization in the first step, pyrolytic lignin was hydrogenated to a large extent accompanied by cracking reactions. In the second step, unsulphided Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst was active enough to effectively crack pyrolytic lignin into smaller molecules. High molecular weight compounds including large aromatic ring structures were formed from the reactive sugar rich fraction in both first step stabilization and second step hydrotreatment. The newly formed polymerization products were difficult to crack even at extended reaction times of 4 h at 400 °C. Importantly, the presence of water (and light oxygenates) could significantly supress the polymerization reactions. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, biomass-based EL (ethyl levulinate) was evaluated as an additional fuel to biodiesel and diesel. Physical and chemical properties, including intersolubility, cold flow properties, spray evaporation, oxidation stability, anti-corrosive property, cleanliness, fire reliability and heating value of twelve different EL-biodiesel-diesel blends were analyzed. The results show that the fuel blends that were in line with China's national standard for biodiesel blend fuel (B5) have similar physical and chemical properties to pure diesel with improved cold flow properties. Optimized fuel blends based on grey relational analysis and analytic hierarchy process were selected to evaluate engine performance and emissions using an unmodified diesel engine test bench. The results show that engine power and torque with the fuel blends were in general similar to those with diesel (less than 3% differences). Both brake specific fuel and energy consumption were lower with the fuel blends than with diesel, suggesting higher fuel conversion efficiencies for the fuel blends. HC (Hydrocarbon) and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions and smoke opacity reduced significantly with the fuel blends compared with diesel while NOx (nitrogen oxides) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions increased. Our study suggests that EL produced from lignocellulosic biomass could be used as a blending component with biodiesel and diesel for use in unmodified diesel engines and could potentially be a promising environment-friendly fuel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The selective production of aromatic hydrocarbons from bio-oil derived from the fast pyrolysis of sunflower stalks over Cu or Fe-modified mesoporous rod-like alumina catalysts was investigated. Uniform mesoporous rod-like alumina with different pore sizes were successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method with the assistance of Pluronic P123 surfactant. A high relative total hydrocarbon amount of about 59% in the upgraded bio-oil was obtained when pure mesoporous Al2O3 with a uniform pore size of 5.81 nm was used. Mesoporous Al2O3 with a larger pore size resulted in more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as indenes and naphthalenes being generated. Cu or Fe loaded Al2O3 with a loading amount in the range of 1-2.5 wt% showed a high selectivity towards monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) such as benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTXs) over 80%. By using 2.5 wt% Cu/Al2O3-0.01, the highest relative total hydrocarbon amount reached 89%, which consisted of about 84% aromatic hydrocarbons and 4.9% aliphatic hydrocarbons. Both catalysts showed good catalytic stability and regeneration properties. A catalytic system with high effectiveness and long-term stability was expected to be obtained to convert the oxygenated compounds in bio-oil to high value-added hydrocarbons. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biomass liquefaction using ionic liquids (ILs) as catalysts has received appreciable attention, in renewable fuels and chemicals production, recently. However, issues associated with the production cost, long reaction time and use of volatile solvents are undeniably challenging. Thus, Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) emerged as promising and potential ILs substitutes. The hydrothermal liquefaction of de-oiled Jatropha curcas cake was catalyzed by four synthesized DESs as catalysts and co-solvents for selective extraction. Proximate and ultimate analyses including ash, moisture and carbon contents of bio-crude produced varied slightly. The higher heating values found ranges from 21.15 ± 0.82 MJ/kg to 24.30 ± 0.98 MJ/kg. The bio-crude yields obtained using ChCl-KOH DES was 43.53 wt% and ChCl-p-TsOH DES was 38.31 wt%. Bio-crude yield using ChCl-FeCl3 DES was 30.80 wt%. It is suggested that, the selectivity of bio-crude could be improved, by using DESs as catalyst and co-solvent in HTL of biomass such as de-oiled J. curcas cake. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae oil is an optimal feedstock for nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and biodiesel production, but its high levels of chlorophyll limit its large-scale application. To date, few effective approaches have been developed to remove chlorophyll from microalgae oil. The main purpose of this study was to present a preprocessing method of algae oil feedstock (Scenedesmus) to remove chlorophyll by saponification. The results showed that 96% of chlorophyll in biomass was removed. High quality orange transparent oil could be extracted from the chlorophyll reduced biomass. Specifically, the proportion of neutral lipids and saturation levels of fatty acids increased, and the pigments composition became carotenoids-based. The critical parameters of chlorophyll reduced biodiesel conformed to the standards of the USA, China and EU. Sodium copper chlorophyllin could be prepared from the bleaching effluent. The results presented herein offer a useful pathway to improve the quality of microalgae oil and reduce the cost of microalgae biodiesel.

AB  - In this perspective, we discuss the standardization of analytical techniques for pyrolysis bio-oils, including the current status of methods, and our opinions on future directions. First, the history of past standardization efforts is summarized, and both successful and unsuccessful validation of analytical techniques highlighted. The majority of analytical standardization studies to-date has tested only physical characterization techniques. Here, we present results from an international round robin on the validation of chemical characterization techniques for bio-oils. Techniques tested included acid number, carbonyl titrations using two different methods (one at room temperature and one at 80 °C), 31P NMR for determination of hydroxyl groups, and a quantitative gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Both carbonyl titration and acid number methods have yielded acceptable inter-laboratory variabilities. 31P NMR produced acceptable results for aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl groups, but not for carboxylic hydroxyl groups. As shown in previous round robins, GC-MS results were more variable. Reliable chemical characterization of bio-oils will enable upgrading research and allow for detailed comparisons of bio-oils produced at different facilities. Reliable analytics are also needed to enable an emerging bioenergy industry, as processing facilities often have different analytical needs and capabilities than research facilities. We feel that correlations in reliable characterizations of bio-oils will help strike a balance between research and industry, and will ultimately help to -determine metrics for bio-oil quality. Finally, the standardization of additional analytical methods is needed, particularly for upgraded bio-oils. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is one of the most promising biomass reforming processes for production of drop-in biofuels. The technique has been under development for a number of years, and yet, due to its complexity, it has always been difficult to generalize information about the optimal conditions. The main issue regards to the limited knowledge available from batch studies evaluating HTL by a finite number of process conditions in certain combinations. In this study, multivariate statistical methods were applied for investigation of HTL data available in the literature. The aim was to determine a set of generally valid rules for prediction of the output from the process (yields and the energy content) on the basis of relatively few process parameters. The results have shown that multivariate data analysis can be used to make predictions about HTL and increase our understanding of the process, despite the fact that the input data constituted a very broad spectrum of values. In general, biomass type and properties were the most significant parameters controlling both the obtained yields and the energy content in the produced biocrude. Regression models calculated for all groups of biomass were relatively poor, due to the lack of common trends. However, a number of statistically sound models were obtained for selected combinations of biomass and responses. The drawn conclusions not only supported the pre-understood axioms of HTL, but also indicated a number of new associations. It was shown that the overall conversion rates are governed by biomass properties and the applied heating velocities, while the amount of homogeneous catalyst and the reaction time control the distribution of the products between the water phase and the biocrude. The energy content in the biocrude produced from lignocellulose was dependent mostly on the biomass content and properties, and not the process conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a novel biomass pretreatment method that uses high pressured N2 and temperature to break the hemicellulose and lignin seal around the cellulose macro fibrils in the cell walls of the lignocellulosic biomass in order to open up the biomass structure for more efficient enzymatic hydrolysis. In this method the biomass is exposed to a high pressure using N2 gas, and temperature. Under pressure, cells of the lignocellulosic biomass are filled with a solution saturated with nitrogen. When the pressure is then suddenly released, the feedstock is exposed to an explosive decompression and the dissolved nitrogen is released from the solution. Sudden change in the volume breaks the cell walls and opens the biomass structure resulting in increased surface area of the substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis. No catalysts or chemicals were added in the process thereby, making it economically and environmentally attractive. In this research, a range of different pressures (1-60 bar) and temperatures (25-175 °C) were applied to barley straw to evaluate the efficiency of the pretreatment. The pretreatment was followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Resulting glucose and ethanol concentrations were measured and the yields were considered as an estimate for the most suitable set of pretreatment conditions. The results indicate that the highest glucose yield and hydrolysis efficiency were gained at 150 °C and 10-30 bars. The fermentation efficiency was lower at higher temperatures. Nonetheless, the highest ethanol yield was still gained at the same conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study investigates the enhancement of CO2 gasification reactivity of coals due to the presence of catalytic elements in biomass such as K2O, CaO, Na2O and MgO. Co-gasification of three Indian coal chars with two biomass chars has been studied using isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in CO2 environment at 900, 1000 and 1100 °C. The conversion profiles have been used to establish synergetic or inhibitory effect on coal char reactivity by the presence of catalytic elements in biomass char by comparing the 90% conversion time with and without biomass. It is concluded that both biomasses exhibit synergistic behavior when blended with the three coals with casuarina being more synergetic than empty fruit bunch. Some inhibitory effect has been noted for the high ash coal at the highest temperature with higher 90% conversion time for the blend over pure coal, presumably due to diffusional control of the conversion rate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Interest in developing renewable fuels is continuing to grow and biomass represents a viable source of renewable carbon with which to replace fossil-based components in transportation fuels. During our own work, we noticed that chemists think in terms of functional groups whereas fuel engineers think in terms of physical fuel properties. In this Concept article, we discuss the effect of carbon and oxygen functional groups on potential fuel properties. This serves as a way of informing our own thinking and provides us with a basis with which to design and synthesize molecules from biomass that could provide useful transportation fuels. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis (CP) of protein-rich biomass such as microalgae is a promising approach to biofuel production. CP of amino acids can help understand the cracking of protein-rich biomass in the presence of zeolite catalysts. In this study, as representatives of aliphatic amino acid and cyclic amino acid, respectively, leucine and proline were pyrolyzed with ZSM-5 catalyst in a Tandem micro-furnace reactor coupled with a MS/FID/TCD. At 650°C, leucine produced more hydrocarbons (aromatic hydrocarbons of 29.6%, olefins of 34.9% and alkanes of 8.1%) than proline (aromatic hydrocarbons of 25.3%, olefins of 14.0% and alkanes of 5.5%) because its relatively simpler amino structure readily detached as ammonia during CP. However, with an N-cyclic structure, proline produced large quantities of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds that favored coke formation in CP. Accordingly, 28.2% of the nitrogen in proline was retained in the solid residue while most of the nitrogen in leucine was converted into ammonia leaving only 4.3% in the solid residue. In addition, though decarboxylation to carbon dioxide was favored in non-catalytic pyrolysis of leucine and proline, decarbonylation to carbon monoxide became the primary deoxygenation pathway in CP. These results indicate that the chemical structures of amino acids have significant effects on product distributions during CP and N-cyclic amino acid is less favored in CP for production of hydrocarbons and ammonia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Carbonyl compounds present in bio-oils are known to be responsible for bio-oil property changes upon storage and during upgrading. As such, carbonyl content has previously been used as a method of tracking bio-oil aging and condensation reactions with less variability than viscosity measurements. Given the importance of carbonyls in bio-oils, accurate analytical methods for their quantification are very important for the bio-oil community. Potentiometric titration methods based on carbonyl oximation have long been used for the determination of carbonyl content in pyrolysis bio-oils. Here, we present a modification of the traditional carbonyl oximation procedures that results in less reaction time, smaller sample size, higher precision, and more accurate carbonyl determinations. Some compounds such as carbohydrates are not measured by the traditional method (modified Nicolaides method), resulting in low estimations of the carbonyl content. Furthermore, we have shown that reaction completion for the traditional method can take up to 300 h. The new method presented here (the modified Faix method) reduces the reaction time to 2 h, uses triethanolamine (TEA) in the place of pyridine, and requires a smaller sample size for the analysis. Carbonyl contents determined using this new method are consistently higher than when using the traditional titration methods. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The primary components of lignocellulosic biomass such as sorghum bagasse are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Each component can be utilized as a sustainable resource for producing biofuels and bio-based products. However, due to their complicated structures, fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass components is required. Organosolv pretreatment is an attractive method for this purpose. However, as organosolv pretreatment uses high concentrations of organic solvents (>50 %), decreasing the concentration necessary for fractionation would help reduce processing costs. In this study, we sought to identify organic solvents capable of efficiently fractionating sorghum bagasse components at low concentrations. Results: Five alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, and 1-pentanol) were used for organosolv pretreatment of sorghum bagasse at a concentration of 12.5 %. Sulfuric acid (1 %) was used as a catalyst. With 1-butanol and 1-pentanol, three fractions (black liquor, liquid fraction containing xylose, and cellulose-enriched solid fraction) were obtained after pretreatment. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that the lignin aromatic components of raw sorghum bagasse were concentrated in the black liquor fraction, although the major lignin side-chain (β-O-4 linkage) was lost. Pretreatment with 1-butanol or 1-pentanol effectively removed p-coumarate, some guaiacyl, and syringyl. Compared with using no solvent, pretreatment with 1-butanol or 1-pentanol resulted in two-fold greater ethanol production from the solid fraction by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Conclusions: Our results revealed that a low concentration (12.5 %) of a highly hydrophobic solvent such as 1-butanol or 1-pentanol can be used to separate the black liquor from the solid and liquid fractions. The efficient delignification and visible separation of the lignin-rich fraction possible with this method simplify the fractionation of sorghum bagasse. © 2016 Teramura et al.

AB  - In this work, the brown algae Macrocystis pyrifera were pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid, water and three different types of ionic liquids (ILs): 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]), 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene acetate ([DBNH][OAc]) and 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]–undec-7-ene–sulfurdioxide–monoethanolamine (DBU–MEA–SO2–SIL), to disassemble the complex polysaccharide structure. After each pretreatment procedure, enzymatic saccharification was performed to release the monosaccharides. The main building blocks of M. pyrifera were processed by derivatization via acid methanolysis and subjected to gas chromatographic analysis. It was found that the main constituents were alginate (60.6 wt.%) and cellulose (22.6 wt.%) of total carbohydrate content. The degradation of alginate requires the action of alginate lyase and oligoalginate lyase, which hydrolyze the main chain in a synergistic mechanism releasing uronic acid (unsaturated uronate). Upon saccharification of cellulose, cellulases and β-glucosidase were used allowing the release of glucose. It was found that the best pretreatment strategy for M. pyrifera consisted of a pretreatment with 2 vol.% sulfuric acid, followed by saccharification of cellulose with a mixture of cellulases at pH 5.2 for 4 h at 50 °C or by saccharification of alginate with the enzyme lyase/oligoalginate lyase at pH 7.5 for 2 h at 37 °C. The process resulted in a release of 68.4 wt.% of glucose (55.74 ± 0.05 mg glucose/g algae) whereas in the case of alginate 85.8 wt.% of uronic acid (193.7 ± 10.6 mg uronic acid/g algae) was released. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that saccharification of both cellulose and alginate from brown algae is reported. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Process simulation of sorption enhanced chemical-looping reforming for hydrogen production from biomass was investigated. Corn stover was converted to bio-oil via pyrolysis prior to sorption enhanced chemical-looping reforming (SE-CLR). NiO was used as a catalyst and oxidizing agent and CaO was used as a CO2 sorbent which are cycled between the reduction and oxidation reactors. Modification of the process to incorporate a step for catalyst and sorbent regeneration was examined and compared with conventional sorption enhanced chemical-looping reforming process. By modifying the SE-CLR process with the recirculating of solids from the air reactor directly to the reformer, a maximum bio-oil conversion rate of 92%, a maximum hydrogen production yield of 153.4 g H2/kg corn stover, and a maximum hydrogen purity of 77% v/v can be obtained with a circulated NiO to bio-oil molar ratio (CNB) of 12.3; a circulated CaO to bio-oil molar ratio (CCB) of 125.2; and where the ratio of solids recovered by the air reactor from the calcination reactor (α) was set as 1, and the ratio of solids flowing directly from the air reactor to the reformer (β) was set as 0.02. The split of a fraction of solids streams to feed directly back to the reformer offers a great impact process control as operating conditions can be broadened. © 2016

AB  - This article aims to describe an alternative and innovative methodology to transform waste, frying oil in a potential energy source, the biodiesel. The biodiesel was produced from fatty acids, using a waste product of the food industry as the raw material. The methodology to be described is the corona discharge plasma technology, which offers advantages such as acceleration of the esterification reaction, easy separation of the biodiesel and the elimination of waste generation. The best conditions were found to be an oil/methanol molar ratio of 6:1, ambient temperature (25 °C) and reaction time of 110 min and 30 mL of sample. The acid value indicates the content of free fatty acids in the biodiesel and the value obtained in this study was 0.43 mg KOH/g. Peaks corresponding to octadecadienoic acid methyl ester, octadecanoic acid methyl ester and octadecenoic acid methyl ester, from the biodiesel composition, were identified using GC-MS. A major advantage of this process is that the methyl ester can be obtained in the absence of chemical catalysts and without the formation of the co-product (glycerin). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microwave co-torrefaction of sewage sludge and leucaena can be a workable technique, because it not only produces biofuels but also solves the problems in waste treatment. When the sewage sludge blending ratio was 25–50 wt% and the microwave power level was 100 W, a synergistic effect was found to influence the mass and energy yields as well as product properties. The relatively small amount of sewage sludge could play a role as a catalyst, since the synergistic effect was hard to be identified at higher sewage sludge blending ratios. Besides, it was difficult to find out the synergistic effect at higher microwave power levels. This could be attributable to the effect of microwave heating which increases with its power level. The elemental compositions of biochar were close to those of anthracite and bituminous coal. The energy return on investment (EROI) of microwave co-torrefaction of the 25/75 (w/w) sewage sludge/leucaena blend at a microwave power level of 100 W in a processing time of 30 min can be approximately 10.1 or 4.7, when the gaseous and liquid products are utilized or not. Therefore, the technique should be energetically and economically feasible. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of deodar has been carried out at 350 and 400 °C at 0.1, 1, 2 and 3 MPa hydrogen pressure. Pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere has been carried out at 300, 350, 400 and 450 °C. The favourable process conditions under hydrogen environment were found to be 400 °C and 2 MPa pressure and in case of nitrogen environment was found to be 350 °C. The products have been characterised using GC–MS, 1H NMR, FT-IR and SEM. It has been observed that the bio-oil is rich in phenolic compounds under nitrogen and hydrogen atmospheres. Selectivity towards certain compounds such as catechol, vanillin and its derivatives etc. are high under hydrogen atmosphere. Deodar has undergone decomposition significantly which is evident by the absence of most functionality in bio-char and loss of crystallinity. The products formed under hydrogen and nitrogen environments are different from each other owing to the differences in reaction mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report a preliminary assessment of the heat transfer properties of innovative structured tubular reactors based on the conductive “packed foams” concept. In such reactors the catalyst is loaded in the form of small pellets packed in the voids of a highly conductive open-cell foam. This enables a catalyst inventory which is significantly higher than that of reactors loaded with the same structured substrate washcoated with catalytic material, while still exploiting the potential of enhanced heat removal through a highly conductive structured skeleton. By comparing the heat transfer performances of the packed foams with those of conventional packed beds of pellets and with those of bare (naked) open cell-foams, we show that the presence of the conductive foam within the packed bed of pellets grants optimal heat transfer performances as a result of a synergy between the enhanced conductive heat transfer in the solid structure of the foam and the effective heat transfer at the wall-bed boundary typical of packed beds. The former mechanism, which is flow independent, controls the effective radial conductivity. The latter one enhances the wall heat transfer coefficient and contributes to increase the overall heat transfer coefficient, particularly at high flow rates. This opens new perspectives for the intensification of highly exothermic/endothermic catalytic processes which require greater catalyst inventories in the reactor than those achievable with washcoated open-cell foams. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel has emerged as a prominent source to replace petroleum diesel. The cost incurred in the production of biodiesel is higher than that for refining of crude oil to obtain mineral diesel. The heterogeneous catalyst was prepared from crab shells by calcining the crushed mass at 800 °C. The solid waste catalyst was characterized with XRD, XPS, BET, SEM-EDS, and FT-IR. Millettia pinnata (karanja) oil extracted from its seeds was used as a feedstock for the synthesis of biodiesel. Biodiesel was synthesized through esterification followed by transesterification in a two-step process. Characterization of biodiesel was done using proton NMR spectroscopy. Reaction parameters such as reaction time, reaction temperature, concentration of catalyst and stirrer speed were optimized. Reusability of catalyst was checked and found that there was no loss of catalytic activity up to five times. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: β-Glucosidase is an important member of the biomass-degrading enzyme system, and plays vital roles in enzymatic saccharification for biofuels production. Candidates with high activity and great stability over high temperature and varied pHs are always preferred in industrial practice. To achieve cost-effective biomass conversion, exploring natural enzymes, developing high level expression systems and engineering superior mutants are effective approaches commonly used. Results: A newly identified β-glucosidase of GH3, Bgl3A, from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802, was overexpressed in yeast strain Pichia pastoris GS115, yielding a crude enzyme activity of 6000 U/ml in a 3 L fermentation tank. The purified enzyme exhibited outstanding enzymatic properties, including favorable temperature and pH optima (75 °C and pH 4.5), good thermostability (maintaining stable at 60 °C), and high catalytic performance (with a specific activity and catalytic efficiency of 905 U/mg and 9096/s/mM on pNPG, respectively). However, the narrow stability of Bgl3A at pH 4.0-5.0 would limit its industrial applications. Further site-directed mutagenesis indicated the role of excessive O-glycosylation in pH liability. By removing the potential O-glycosylation sites, two mutants showed improved pH stability over a broader pH range (3.0-10.0). Besides, with better stability under pH 5.0 and 50 °C compared with wild type Bgl3A, saccharification efficiency of mutant M1 was improved substantially cooperating with cellulase Celluclast 1.5L. And mutant M1 reached approximately equivalent saccharification performance to commercial β-glucosidase Novozyme 188 with identical β-glucosidase activity, suggesting its great prospect in biofuels production. Conclusions: In this study, we overexpressed a novel β-glucosidase Bgl3A with high specific activity and high catalytic efficiency in P. pastoris. We further proved the negative effect of excessive O-glycosylation on the pH stability of Bgl3A, and enhanced the pH stability by reducing the O-glycosylation. And the enhanced mutants showed much better application prospect with substantially improved saccharification efficiency on cellulosic materials. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - LaCo1-xCuxO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) perovskite-type catalysts were prepared, characterized and tested for hydrogen-rich syngas production from steam gasification of bio-oil/biochar slurry (bioslurry). The effects of the Cu-substitution, temperature, water to carbon molar ratio (WCMR) and bioslurry weight based hourly space velocity (WbHSV) on the hydrogen (H2) yield were investigated. The results showed that the activity of LaCoO3 was improved by Cu-substitution. LaCo0.9Cu0.1O3 exhibited the best performance and gave higher H2 yield and higher carbon conversion than that of non-catalytic process and also that of commercial 14 wt% Ni/ZrO2. Coke deposition could be depressed by higher temperature, higher WCMR or lower WbHSV, while higher temperature and lower WbHSV made for higher H2 yield. 2 was deemed to be the optimum WCMR. A maximum H2 yield of 75.33% and a maximum carbon conversion of 80.42% were obtained at 800 °C with a combination of WCMR = 2 and WbHSV = 15.36 h-1. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The production of biofuel has increased considerably over the last years. Glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel synthesis, accounts for about 10 wt% of the total mass balance in the transesterification process and has a limited range of applications. The acid-catalyzed etherification of glycerol with alcohols could be an attractive solution to address the excess of glycerol. This study is focused on the etherification of glycerol with ethanol over solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites, clays and sulfonic resins. All the catalysts produced mono, di and tri-glycerol-ethers that can be used as biodiesel fuel components. Higher conversion and selectivity to ethyl glyceryl ethers were obtained at 180 °C, ethanol/glycerol molar ratio of 3:1 and 4 h of reaction time, with Amberlyst-15 acid resin as catalyst. Under these reaction conditions, 96% of glycerol conversion and 80% selectivity to the ethyl ethers were observed. Laboratory tests using a blend containing 0.5-1.0 vol% of the ethyl glyceryl ethers in biodiesel showed reduction of pour and cloud points, indicating the potential of these ethers as bioadditives to fuels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A scheme of the DME-diesel dual-fuel PCCI (premixed charge compression ignition) combustion is an attractive option of relatively high thermal efficiency, low emission and operating costs as well as availability of wide DME (dimethyl ether) resource. However, one of the main problems in the DME-diesel dual-fuel PCCI operation is that an early start of combustion easily leads to detonation due to high cetane number and better auto-ignition property of DME, and above-mentioned phenomenon is especially pronounced with a large DME energy ratio or at higher loads. Thus, LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), as a kind of ignition inhibitor, is added into DME for changing the property of port premixed fuel, and the effects of LPG quantity on the combustion and exhaust performance of a DME-diesel dual-fuel PCCI engine is investigated in this paper. Experimental results show that the appearing positions of the maximum cylinder pressure and mass-averaged temperature shift towards later crank angles and their peak values decline slightly when LPG mass fraction in DME/LPG mixture (fL) increases. The start of combustion postpones, and the combustion duration shortens with a rise of fL. Simultaneously, brake thermal efficiency and NOx emission reduce slightly; whereas the number concentration of particles firstly increases but then decreases with a rise of fL. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In-situ transesterification (simultaneous extraction and transesterification) of Chinese tallow tree seeds into methyl esters using a batch microwave system was investigated in this study. A high degree of oil extraction and efficient conversion of oil to biodiesel were found in the proposed range. The process was further optimized in terms of product yields and conversion rates using Doehlert optimization methodology. Based on the experimental results and statistical analysis, the optimal production yield conditions for this process were determined as: catalyst concentration of 1.74wt.%, solvent ratio about 3 (v/w), reaction time of 20min and temperature of 58.1°C. H+NMR was used to calculate reaction conversion. All methyl esters produced using this method met ASTM biodiesel quality specifications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In situ catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil by natural gas at atmospheric pressure was achieved over a low cost Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst. Compared with other low cost metal species including Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, Zr and Ce, ZSM-5 supported Zn obtained the highest oil yield along with high oil H/C atomic ratio and low oil O/C atomic ratio. XRD result and TEM image of the 5 % Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst showed that small ZnO particles with different sizes of &lt;10 nm were highly dispersed on/in ZSM-5 zeolite support. Further investigation indicated that during the reaction ZSM-5 framework mainly promotes the deoxygenation and improves the quality of bio-oil, while the highly dispersed Zn species mostly facilitate CH4 activation and allow it to be incorporated into the carbon chain of the bio-oil and enhances the quantity of bio-oil. The synergistic effects between ZSM-5 framework and Zn species made this process be able to not only upgrade the quality of bio-oil, but also produce more oil product. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Biodiesel is an important renewable fuel that can be used as a substitute of petro diesel. Downstream processes represent a major concern in biodiesel production due to cost and because it is time consuming. The application of dry purification processes emerges as a promising alternative for biodiesel purification, but the applied adsorbent material should ensure biodiesel quality and process efficiency. Here we propose the application of sugarcane bagasse as a low cost adsorbent material for biodiesel treatment. Sugarcane bagasse was used in three different forms: raw sugarcane bagasse (as received), steam explosion pre-treated bagasse and bagasse ash. Equilibrium adsorption data showed that the addition of only 0.5 wt% of sugarcane bagasse removed 40% of the glycerine of the crude biodiesel and produced a purified biodiesel with less than 0.02 wt% of glycerine. The adjustment of equilibrium data to isotherm models showed that glycerine adsorption on sugarcane bagasse is not fully Langmuirian due to the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent and the non-uniform distribution of heat of adsorption. Sugarcane bagasse proves to be a promising adsorbent for glycerine, with the maximum predicted glycerine adsorption of 88.86 mg g-1. The kinetic data of glycerine adsorption in raw sugarcane bagasse could be adjusted to the pseudo-second order model, which indicates that the rate-limiting step may be chemisorption. Kinetic data highlighted the fast nature of the process, since the glycerine removal was greater than 70% after only 10 min of adsorption process. Sugarcane bagasse presented results for biodiesel purification similar to those for the wet washing process or with Magnesol®. Thus, dry purification with sugarcane bagasse is a suitable alternative for biodiesel treatment in a low cost and efficient process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Municipal wastewater sludge is a promising lipid feedstock for biodiesel production, but the need to eliminate the high water content before lipid extraction is the main limitation for scaling up. This study evaluates the economic feasibility of biodiesel production directly from liquid primary sludge based on experimental data at laboratory scale. Computational tools were used for the modelling of the process scale-up and the different configurations of lipid extraction to optimise this step, as it is the most expensive. The operational variables with a major influence in the cost were the extraction time and the amount of solvent. The optimised extraction process had a break-even price of biodiesel of 1232 $/t, being economically competitive with the current cost of fossil diesel. The proposed biodiesel production process from waste sludge eliminates the expensive step of sludge drying, lowering the biodiesel price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolysis or liquefaction processes can be applied to lignocellulosic biomass to produce a bio-oil which allows the access of green chemicals or sustainable energy. Among the different existing resources, this raw material has the advantage to come from nonfood feedstocks such as agricultural wastes (wood, grass,...) or dedicated plantations. Whatever the considered bio-oil, the development of high performance analytical techniques is needed to achieve an exhaustive characterization. The use of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) has the potential to chemically identify the components of bio-oil at the level of the molecular formula. In this work, we investigated the influence of the sample preparation (use and nature of dopant and ion detection mode) on the development of a robust methodology for lignocellulosic based bio-oil characterization. Commonly used ESI dopants have been studied to increase the ionization yield and the measurement repeatability. We highlighted the dramatic effect of the sample preparation on the global chemical description of the bio-oil, especially the disproportional contribution of the CxHyN1-5Oz species. Moreover, we demonstrated the ability of well-controlled ESI ionization conditions to attain, on the one hand, specific chemical information on the origin (cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin) of the bio-oil constituents and, on the other hand, the simultaneous description of both its oily and aqueous compounds without a fractionation step. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The catalytic pyrolysis of Tetraselmis sp. and Isochrysis sp. was carried out over ceria based catalysts in a fixed bed reactor. There was a clear effect of the catalysts on the product yields and quality, with the catalysts able to recover a large fraction of the starting microalgae energy (67–77%) in the bio-oils. Bio-oil yield was found to be higher in presence of Ni–Ce/Al2O3 and Ni–Ce/ZrO2 (26 wt.%). The produced bio-oils had HHVs (higher heating values) of 34–35 MJ/kg and suffered strong deoxygenation, with O level decreased from 40–41% in the starting microalgae to 9–15%. Also, 15–20% N removal was obtained using the ceria based catalysts. The oxygen contents in the bio-oils were remarkably lower than those previously obtained using ZSM-5 (25%) and other species without catalyst (17–24%). 1H NMR and GC–MS analysis showed that the bio-oils were enriched in aliphatics and depleted in N-compounds and water using the ceria based catalysts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A three-step supercritical CO2 extraction was used for selective fractionation of fast pyrolysis bio-oil. Oxygen-containing compounds in bio-oil and its fractions were characterized using infrared spectroscopy (IR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and negative-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). With appropriate optimization of extraction parameters, lipids, hemicellulose, lignin and condensed aromatics were found enriched in three different fractions. The molecular composition and compound classes were identified by combined analytical techniques, and the selectivity of the fractionation was proved. The compound-type-specific fractionation also facilitated the following characterization and provided insights into the chemical composition of bio-oil. Results indicated that CO2 supercritical fluid extraction was potential for bio-oil preprocessing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis bio-oils have the potential to replace a part of transportation fuels obtained from fossil. Bio-oil can be successfully upgraded into stable hydrocarbons (gasoline, jet fuel and diesel) through a two-stage hydrodeoxygenation process. Consumption large amount of expensive hydrogen during this process is the major hurdle for commercialization of this technology. Applying syngas in the hydrotreating step can significantly reduce the cost of the whole process and make it competitive. In this study, four different models of syngas with different H2 concentrations (H2/CO molar ratios = 2:8, 4:6, 6:4 and 8:2) were used for the 1st-stage hydrotreating step of oxidized fractionated bio-oil (OFB). The 2nd-stage hydrocracking step was performed on the produced organic liquid products (OLPs) by using pure H2 gas. The effect of syngas H2 concentrations on the yields and properties of OLPs and the 2nd-stage hydrocarbons (HCs) was investigated. Physical and chemical properties of the 2nd-stage hydrocarbons were similar regardless syngas H2 content, with the exception of the viscosity. Syngas with H2/CO molar ratio of 4:6 gave significantly highest HCs yield (24.8 wt.%) based on the OFB. Simulated distillation analysis proved that all 2nd-stage hydrocarbons were mixture from a wide range boiling point fuels. These results also indicated that the successful 1st-stage syngas hydrotreating step was having the potential to produce different hydrocarbons. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The techno-economic analysis of a BG-FT (biomass gasification and Fischer-Tropsch) integrated process with different configurations, once-through and with recirculation concepts, for green fuel production is presented. Rice straw is considered a feedstock for the gasification process operated under the thermal self-sufficiency condition. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed by using Aspen Custom Modeler program. Regarding one technical aspect, the influence of changing an off-gas recycle fraction at different values of the FT reactor volume on the performance of the syngas processor, the FT synthesis and the energy efficiency is discussed. The production rate of syngas, diesel product and FT off-gas, as well as electricity from the BG-FT process, can be maximized via suitable adjustment of the recycle fraction and selection of the FT reactor volume. The economic analysis using an incremental NPV (net present value) as an economic indicator implies that the use of the recycle concept in the BG-FT process without the installation of any secondary equipment is less feasible than the once-through. Although the maximum diesel production rate is found when the FT reactor volume of 190 m3 and the FT off-gas recycle fraction of 0.4 are chosen, the incremental NPV shows a negative value. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The reduction of oxygen-containing compounds, which is employed to produce biofuels from plant feedstock, requires a great amount of reductant that is commonly represented by molecular hydrogen obtained from non-renewable fossils. Formic acid can also serve as the reductant or hydrogen source in the production of such fuels. It is shown that formic acid can be obtained from mechanically activated microcrystalline cellulose with high yields (66%) by the one-pot catalytic process of hydrolytic oxidation in the presence of Mo-V-P heteropoly acids (HPA) possessing bifunctional (acidic and oxidizing) catalytic properties. Mechanical activation has a crucial influence on the cellulose reactivity and formic acid yields. The highest yield of formic acid was obtained by using the cellulose activated in a planetary mill, when its crystal structure was mainly crushed. The temperature of 150–160 °C and the oxidizing atmosphere (20% O2 and 80% N2) are found to be the optimal reaction conditions. Pressure was shown to exert no effect on the observable kinetics of the process. A search for the optimal HPA composition demonstrates that a maximum reaction rate is observed in the presence of HPA that provides the most acidic reaction medium. A linear dependence of the reaction rate on the concentration of H+ ions and a more complicated dependence on vanadium content were revealed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A mechanistic study of the hydrogenation reaction of levulinic acid (LA) to 2-methyltetrahydrofuyran (MTHF) was performed using three different solvents under reactive H2 and inert N2 atmospheres. Under the applied reaction conditions, catalytic transfer hydrogenation and hydrogenation with molecular H2 were effective at producing high yields of γ-valerolactone. However, the conversion of this stable intermediate to MTHF required the combination of both hydrogen sources (the solvent and the H2 atmosphere) to achieve good yields. The reaction system with 2-propanol as solvent and Ni–Cu/Al2O3 as catalyst allowed full conversion of LA and a MTHF yield of 80 % after 20 h reaction time at 250 °C and 40 bar of H2 (at room temperature). The system showed the same catalytic activity at LA feed concentrations of 5 and up to 30 wt%, and also when high acetone concentration at the beginning of the reaction were added, which confirmed the potential industrial applications of this solvent/catalyst system. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The effect of the tube wall on the fluid flow and heat transfer would be important in the packed bed with low tube to particle diameter ratio, which may lead to flow and temperature maldistributions inside, and the heat transfer performance may be lowered. In the present paper, the flow and heat transfer performances in both the composite and uniform packed beds of spheres with low tube to particle diameter were numerically investigated, where the composite packing means randomly packing with non-uniform spheres and the uniform packing means randomly packing with uniform spheres, including radially layered composite packing (RLM), axially layered composite packing (ALM), randomly composite packing (RCM) and randomly uniform packing (RPM). Both the composite and uniform packings were generated with discrete element method (DEM), and the influence of the wall effect on the flow and heat transfer in the packed beds were carefully studied and compared with each other. Firstly, it is found that, the wall effect on the velocity and temperature distributions in the randomly packed bed of uniform spheres (RPM) with low tube to particle diameter ratio were obvious. The average velocity of the near-tube-wall region is higher than that of the inner-tube region in the bed. When the tube wall is adiabatic, the average temperature of the near-tube-wall region is lower. With radially layered composite packing method (RLM), smaller pores would be formed close to the tube wall and big flow channels would be formed in the inner-tube region of the bed, which would be benefit to restrain the wall effect and improve heat transfer in the bed with low tube to particle diameter ratio. Furthermore, it is also found that, with composite packing method (RLM, ALM and RCM), both the pressure drop and heat flux are higher than those in the uniform packing (RPM). And with radially layered packing method (RLM), the flow resistance would be reduced, and both the heat flux and overall heat transfer efficiency would be further improved for the composite packing with low tube to particle diameter ratio. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The pyrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose in contact with MCM-41 and Fe-, Al- and Cu- substituted samples was carried out at 400 °C in a fixed-bed glass reactor in order to obtain high bio-oils yields. The acid properties of the catalysts were determined by potentiometric titration with n-butylamine, while the redox properties were studied by TPR. BET surface area, pore volume and pore size were measured by means of N2 sorptometry. The effect of the different catalysts on the composition of the bio-oils was analyzed in the light of the characterization results. Mainly the concentration of levoglucosan (LG), levoglucosenone (LGO), 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-β-d-glucopyranose (DGP) and (1S,5R)-5-hydroxy-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-4-one (LAC) were measured. The presence of the solid catalysts increased the liquid formation and strongly modified the chemical composition of the bio-oils compared to the non-catalytic pyrolysis. All the catalysts decreased the production of LG and increased that of LGO, LAC and DPG. The mild acidity of the catalysts promoted dehydration reactions, while redox properties led to a higher production of isomerization products. A much higher LGO yield was obtained over Al-MCM-41 (53 wt% of cellulose is converted to LGO over this catalyst) than by non-catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose previously washed with phosphoric acid (7 wt% of washed cellulose is converted to LGO). In order to evaluate the reuse of the catalyst, the spent sample was submitted to calcination at 400 °C. The physicochemical properties were not modified after the calcination treatment and the pyrolysis employing the spent sample led to a similar bio-oil composition (though with a smaller yield) as in the case of the fresh catalyst. A second regeneration of the catalyst diminished the specific surface area and the surface acidity. Concomitantly a notable decrease of the yield of LGO was observed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is considered an abundant and renewable source to produce bio-oils with an objective of its value addition for fuels and chemicals. Upgrading strategies have immensely evolved as a result of ever progressing research in this field. Development of complete analytical protocol for bio-oil characterization at different stages of its production, storage, upgrading and during its use is essential for the purpose of its quality assurance and understanding. This report is aimed at developing a sample preparation procedure for bio-oils involving an extensive liquid-liquid extraction approach. Bio-oil obtained after slow pyrolysis of Jatropha Curcas seed cake was phase separated and subjected to solvent extraction. Various solvents were screened for their extraction capabilities towards available organic compounds of all functional group in the bio-oil. Ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, diethyl ether, benzene, cyclohexane and hexane were employed for extraction of aqueous phase under similar conditions. Recoveries of compounds containing varying functional groups indicated ethyl acetate and dichloromethane as optimum among all other solvents. During the extraction, partitioning of compounds between bio-oil phase and solvent occurred largely on the basis of polarity. Acidic and basic organic compounds present in the aqueous phase were determined after adjusting the pH of samples followed by dichloromethane extraction. A comprehensive detail of the extracted chemicals and their classification has been provided. The identification was carried out qualitatively with GC-MS and derivatization of polar chemicals was also carried out before analysis. These experiments compare the efficacy of various organic solvents for extracting diverse bio-oil pyrolytic products. The findings are important in ascertaining usefulness of organic solvents towards enrichment of available bio-oil chemical groups. The information may be either utilized for characterization purposes or their monitoring during upgrading process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cesium exchanged tungstophosphoric acid (CsTPA) supported on tin oxide catalysts were prepared and their physio-chemical properties were derived from X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, laser Raman spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption of NH3. The catalysts activity was evaluated for etherification of glycerol with tert-butanol. The characterization results of the catalysts revealed that the primary Keggin structure remained intact during the exchange of TPA protons with Cs+ ions. The activity results showed that etherification activity depended on the amount of the CsTPA over SnO2 and the catalyst with 20 wt% CsTPA supported on SnO2 showed high catalytic activity with 90% glycerol conversion with 44% selectivity toward higher ethers. The activity of the catalyst depends on amount of surface acidic sites and dispersion amount of CsTPA over SnO2. The etherification reaction was carried at different reaction parameters and optimum reaction conditions were established. The catalysts were recyclable and showed constant activity up on reuse. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hydro-/solvothermolysis of kraft lignin using water and ethanol as a solvent were investigated in this study. The effect of the water-to-ethanol ratio on the yields of monomeric aromatic chemicals (MACs) and the kinetic behavior of MACs was studied in a series of batch experiments. The yields of MACs other than catechol increased as the ratio of ethanol increased, and the content of the total MACs in bio-crude oil (BCO) reached 35% when the ratio of ethanol was 100% at a reaction temperature of 300 °C. The formation of phenol, guaiacol, and alkylguaiacols was enhanced in ethanol, while the formation of catechol was dominant in water. The formation of more substituted MACs such as vanillin, acetoguaiacone, and homovanillic acid was not affected by the solvent. The role of reaction parameters on the yields of MACs was elucidated, and the main reaction pathways in water and in ethanol were proposed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cu loaded MCM-41 and KIT-6 are prepared by β-cyclodextrin (CD) assisted coimpregnation method (Cu/MCM-41-CD and Cu/KIT-6-CD) for in situ catalytic upgrading of bio-oil derived from the fast pyrolysis of biomass. It is found that Cu/MCM-41-CD and Cu/KIT-6-CD exhibit higher catalytic activity for promoting the deoxygenation from the bio-oil when compared with those prepared by conventional impregnation method. 20 wt % of Cu loaded MCM-41-CD and KIT-6-CD shows the highest catalytic activity, by which the upgraded bio-oil is rich in monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylene with the total relative maximum hydrocarbon amounts of 73.2% and 86.1%. After reuse of the regenerated catalyst for four cycles, no serious reduction of total relative hydrocarbon amount is found. The possible upgrading mechanism is proposed. It is expected to provide a new direction with a green method for development of the catalyst for the upgrading of bio-oil. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Alkyl levulinate (AL) is an important biofuel additive and precursor for the synthesis of valuable γ-valerolactone. Conventionally, it is produced by furfural hydrogenation with pressured H2, followed by alcoholysis of the formed furfuryl alcohol (FAL). This work provides a novel strategy for the high-yield synthesis of AL via one-pot conversion of furfural with an alcohol over a metal-acid bi-functional catalyst without an external source of hydrogen. Furfural proceeded to transfer hydrogenation reaction using the alcohol as a H-donor over metal species, and then the formed FAL underwent acid-catalyzed alcoholysis to yield AL. The yield of AL reached 80.2% in the conversion of furfural with 2-propanol over Au-H4SiW12O40/ZrO2 under mild conditions. Additionally, the catalyst characterization, reaction pathway, and reusability were well presented. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The cleavage of inter- and intramolecular linkages is a crucial but complicated issue for isolation and depolymerization of lignin in lignocellulosic biomass to produce biofuel. Herein, a Na2CO3-H2O-tetrahydrofuran system was adopted for studying the cleavage of these linkages in corncob residue. Almost all ether, ester and hydrogen bonds between lignin and cellulose were broken by Na2CO3 at 140 °C, resulting in 94.6% dissolution of lignin, meanwhile the C-O bond in the β-O-4 linkage and the Cα-Cβ bond in the aliphatic side-chain of lignin could be broken to obtain aryl aldehydes. At 300 °C, the CAr-Cα bond could be broken down, bringing about high selectivity to monophenols without substituted alkyl groups, and the total yield of monophenols reached up to 26.9 wt% without additional hydrogen. Na2CO3 could also inhibit the formation of a Cα-oxidized side-chain product and the elimination reaction of an -OH group on Cα forming p-coumaric acid. G and H units in the corncob residue were mostly connected by a β-O-4 linkage, whereas S units were possibly linked by an α-O-4 linkage. The hydrogen bonds at -OCH3 groups in S and G units in lignin could be disrupted by Na2CO3 to facilitate the dissolution and degradation of lignin. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Pyrolysis of glycerol, a by-product of the biodiesel industry, is an important potential source of hydrogen. The obtained high calorific value gas can be used either as a fuel for combined heat and power (CHP) generation or as a transportation fuel (for example hydrogen to be used in fuel cells). Optimal process conditions can improve glycerol pyrolysis by increasing gas yield and hydrogen concentration. A detailed kinetic mechanism of glycerol pyrolysis, which involves 137 species and more than 4500 reactions, was drastically simplified and reduced to a new skeletal kinetic scheme of 44 species, involved in 452 reactions. An experimental campaign with a batch pyrolysis reactor was properly designed to further validate the original and the skeletal mechanisms. The comparisons between model predictions and experimental data strongly suggest the presence of a catalytic process promoting steam reforming of methane. High pyrolysis temperatures (750–800 °C) improve process performances and non-condensable gas yields of 70%w can be achieved. Hydrogen mole fraction in pyrolysis gas is about 44–48%v. The skeletal mechanism developed can be easily used in Computational Fluid Dynamic software, reducing the simulation time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microwave heating offers a number of advantages over conventional heating methods, such as, rapid and volumetric heating, precise temperature control, energy efficiency and lower temperature gradient. In this article we demonstrate the use of 2450 MHz microwave traveling wave reactor to heat the catalyst bed for thermo-catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapors. HZSM-5 catalyst was tested at three different temperatures (290°, 330° and 370 °C) at a catalyst to biomass ratio of 2. Results were compared with conventional heating and induction heating method of catalyst bed. The yields of aromatic compounds and coke deposition were dependent on temperature and method of heating. Microwave heating yielded higher aromatic compounds and lower coke deposition. Microwave heating was also energy efficient compared to conventional reactors. The rate of catalyst deterioration was lower for catalyst heated in microwave system. © 2016

AB  - Triglyceride transesterification for biodiesel production is a model reaction which is used to compare the conversion efficiency, yield, reaction time, energy consumption, scalability and cost estimation of different reactor technology and energy source. This work describes an efficient, fast and cost-effective procedure for biodiesel preparation using a rotating generator of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC). The base-catalyzed transesterification (methanol/sodium hydroxide) has been carried out using refined and bleached palm oil and waste vegetable cooking oil. The novel HC unit is a continuous rotor-stator type reactor in which reagents are directly fed into the controlled cavitation chamber. The high-speed rotation of the reactor creates micron-sized droplets of the immiscible reacting mixture leading to outstanding mass and heat transfer and enhancing the kinetics of the transesterification reaction which completes much more quickly than traditional methods. All the biodiesel samples obtained respect the ASTM standard and present fatty acid methyl ester contents of >99% m/m in both feedstocks. The electrical energy consumption of the HC reactor is 0.030 kW h per L of produced crude biodiesel, making this innovative technology really quite competitive. The reactor can be easily scaled-up, from producing a few hundred to thousands of liters of biodiesel per hour while avoiding the risk of orifices clogging with oil impurities, which may occur in conventional HC reactors. Furthermore it requires minimal installation space due to its compact design, which enhances overall security. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) diesel produced from biomass through gasification is a promising alternative fuel. In this study, a biomass-to-liquid (BTL) system involving a dual fluidized bed gasifier (DFBG), a methanol absorption tower, and an F-T synthesis process was investigated for producing clean biodiesel as an automotive fuel. A DFBG, which is an efficient indirect gasifier, can produce syngas with high caloric value while minimizing the amount of nitrogen in the product gas. In order to meet the strict requirements of syngas for F-T synthesis, any contaminants in the syngas must be minimized and its composition must be carefully controlled. In this work, the syngas mainly comprised 35 vol% of H2 and 21.3 vol% of CO. The concentrations of H2S and COS in the syngas were less than 1 ppmV owing to the use of chilled methanol cleaning process. Furthermore, long-term operation of a fully integrated BTL system was successfully conducted for over 500 h. The results showed that the BTL diesel can be used as an alternative automotive diesel fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Blends of cottonseed and sunflower oils with vacuum gasoil were catalytically cracked in fixed bed microreactor using commercial high alumina zeolite FCC catalyst and halloysite nanotubes as a catalyst. Halloysite occurs in nature as clay nanotube with large 5-20 nm inner lumen that provides cost-effective way to produce mesoporous cracking catalysts with low environmental footprint. Performance of the cracking catalyst was significantly improved in terms of gasoline yield and coke formation upon addition of halloysite. Hydrocarbon content of the gasoline fraction was analyzed in detail and efficiency of the skeletal isomerization within halloysite pores was observed to be significantly higher than with the FCC catalyst alone, increasing the yield of the branched hydrocarbons in produced gasoline and hence octane rating. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examined a two-stage (noncatalytic pretreatment followed by catalytic upgrading) hydrothermal processing of crude bio-oil produced from the hydrothermal liquefaction of duckweed. The activities of six activated carbons (ACs)-pine wood AC, coconut shell AC, bamboo stem AC, apricot pit AC, peach pit AC, and coal AC-toward the deoxygenation and denitrogenation of the pretreated duckweed bio-oil were determined in supercritical water at 400 °C for 1 h with the addition of 6 MPa of H2 and 10 wt% AC. All of the ACs exhibited activity similar to Ru/C toward the denitrogenation and deoxygenation of the pretreated duckweed bio-oil. Of the ACs tested, bamboo stem AC produced an upgraded bio-oil with the highest yield (76.3 wt%), the highest fraction (90.13%) of material boiling below 350 °C, and the highest energy density (44.1 MJ/kg). Decreased ash and acidic groups in the pre-treated AC disfavored the production of upgraded bio-oil but aided denitrogenation and desulfurization. The ACs are suspected to leach ions and weak acids into the reaction solution, which would catalyze denitrogenation and desulfurization. The gases mainly consisted of unreacted H2, CO2 and CH4 together with small amounts of CxHy (x ≤ 5, y ≤ 12) hydrocarbon gases produced from the cracking of the upgraded bio-oil. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The conversion of cellulose into products with higher added value often includes a depolymerization step to obtain glucose, its fundamental unity. The depolymerization reaction is carried out via hydrolysis of the β-1,4-glycosidic bond. The search for a solid acid catalyst capable of breaking these bonds is gaining increasing prominence in the literature. In this regard, sulfonated carbons have shown promising results. This work evaluated the use of a residue from the extraction of palm oil as raw material for the production of sulfonated carbons. The raw material was carbonized and sulfonated. The obtained solid acids were tested in the hydrolysis of cellobiose, a dimer of glucose often used as a model compound for cellulose. The hydrolysis reaction is the first step in converting renewable carbon sources into chemical products and biofuels. Some aspects were investigated, as the effect of carbonization temperature on the concentration of sulfonic groups, the results showing that the content thereof reached a maximum value at 300 °C. Regarding the hydrolysis of cellobiose, it has been identified that there is a relationship between the concentration of sulfonic acid groups and the activity of these catalysts. However, there is a drop in the turnover number as the amount of sulfonic acid sites increases. This was related to a preferred position sulfonation mechanism. Furthermore, sulfonated carbons showed higher activity than the commercial acid resins, indicating that this material may be a good option for the generation of solid acid catalysts. © 2016

AB  - Industry of table olives is widely distributed over the Mediterranean countries and generates large volumes of processing wastewaters (TOPWs). TOPWs contain high levels of organic matter, salt, and phenolic compounds that are recalcitrant to microbial degradation. This work aims to evaluate the potential of bioelectrochemical systems to simultaneously treat real TOPWs and recover energy. The experiments were performed in potentiostatically-controlled single-chamber systems fed with real TOPW and using a moderate halophilic consortium as biocatalyst. In conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) treatment, ie. where no potential was applied, no CH 4 was produced. In comparison, Bio-Electrochemical Systems (BES) showed a maximum CH 4 yield of 701 ± 13 NmL CH 4 ·L TOPW -1 under a current density of 7.1 ± 0.4 A m -2 and with a coulombic efficiency of 30%. Interestingly, up to 80% of the phenolic compounds found in the raw TOPW (i.e. hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) were removed. A new theoretical degradation pathway was proposed after identification of the metabolic by-products. Consistently, microbial community analysis at the anode revealed a clear and specific enrichment in anode-respiring bacteria (ARB) from the genera Desulfuromonas and Geoalkalibacter, supporting the key role of these electroactive microorganisms. As a conclusion, bioelectrochemical systems represent a promising bioprocess alternative for the treatment and energy recovery of recalcitrant TOPWs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Integration of Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass with concentrated solar power thermal processing (CSP) for bio-oil production is a potential processing pathway for energy efficient generation of renewable biofuels. Solar HTL infrastructure avoids additional bolt-on components of conventional solar parabolic trough systems used for electricity production including heat transfer fluids, counter current heat exchangers, fluid transfer interconnectivity and electrical power control systems. The absence of such capital intensive additional equipment considerably reduces the production costs of solar HTL biofuels compared to electricity generation from conventional CSP power systems. An economic and market appraisal of variance and system economic resilience is presented. It is hypothesised that the combination of nutrient recycling with HTL/CSP unification has the potential for economically sustainable microalgae bio-oil production. A microalgae biofuel minimum fuel sales price of $1.23/kg has been modelled. Further experimental work would be able to validate this integrated model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fatty esters provide new building-blocks for sustainable chemical and biochemical processes or can be used as biofuels. For a greener and more economic production of these esters waste cooking oils are a promising feedstock, but a pre-treatment step is required. In this step the high content of free fatty acids is reduced by an acid catalysed esterification. To further enhance the overall process efficiency, reactive distillation is favourable for the pre-treatment. In order to enable a comprehensive analysis of an industrial production process, a step-by-step procedure considering lab-scale experiments and determination of important model parameters is provided. In this study the reaction kinetics of the esterification of oleic acid with ethanol forming the ester ethyl oleate is determined. Prior, a suitable catalyst matching the operating window of a reactive distillation process is identified in an experimental screening. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The effect of two types of nanoparticles on the enhancement of bioethanol production in syngas fermentation by Clostridium ljungdahlii was examined. Methyl-functionalized silica and methyl-functionalized cobalt ferrite-silica (CoFe2O4@SiO2-CH3) nanoparticles were used to improve syngas-water mass transfer. Of these, CoFe2O4@SiO2-CH3 nanoparticles showed better enhancement of syngas mass transfer. The nanoparticles were recovered using a magnet and reused five times to evaluate reusability, and it was confirmed that their capability for mass transfer enhancement was maintained. Both types of nanoparticles were applied to syngas fermentation, and production of biomass, ethanol, and acetic acid was enhanced. CoFe2O4@SiO2-CH3 nanoparticles were more efficient for the productivity of syngas fermentation due to improved syngas mass transfer. The biomass, ethanol, and acetic acid production compared to a control were increased by 227.6%, 213.5%, and 59.6%, respectively by addition of CoFe2O4@SiO2-CH3 nanoparticles. The reusability of the nanoparticles was confirmed by reuse of recovered nanoparticles for fermentation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pinus pinaster wood was fractionated by aqueous treatments to yield a solution containing hemicellulose-derived saccharides (mainly of polymeric or oligomeric nature) and a solid phase enriched in cellulose and lignin. The solution containing polymeric or oligomeric hemicellulosic saccharides was acidified with sulfuric acid (up to 4 wt%) and heated (up to 130 °C) to assess the conversion of substrates into sugars. The interpretation of the experimental data was done on the basis of a mechanism involving 10 first-order, kinetic parameters. Almost total saccharification was achieved under a range of operational conditions, and the hydrolyzates presented compositions favorable for their further utilization as fermentation media. The solid phase coming from aqueous processing was mixed with HCl solutions and reacted under microwave irradiation to yield the target products levulinic acid (precursor of valeric biofuels) and formic acid (suitable for fuel cell devices). The effects of the most influential parameters (temperature, reaction time and acid concentration) were assessed by empirical modeling. The highest cellulose conversion into levulinic acid (61.9% of the stoichiometric value as an average) was achieved at 190 °C operating for 15 min in a medium containing 1 wt% HCl. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Black liquor is an attractive option for the generation of biofuel and fine chemical intermediates. In this work, kraft lignin was extracted from black liquor and its potential was evaluated in the production of high quality bio-oil via catalytic pyrolysis under two different reaction regimes (N2 and 10% H2 in N2). The 2D HSQC NMR result showed that the lignin obtained directly through acidic precipitation with CO2 mainly consisted of syringyl lignin units and cross-linked C-C bond substructures. The thermal decomposition of the sample mainly occurred at 200-500 °C and the char yield was 44.46% at 700 °C. The catalytic pyrolysis experiment indicated that the addition of catalysts (NiO, MoO2, and Co3O4) could inhibit char formation and enhance the properties of bio-oil by removing oxygenated compounds via releasing CO and CO2 under a N2 atmosphere. The addition of the catalysts could prompt lignin degradation and increase the yield of bio-oil in the presence of H2. The yield of bio-oil increased by 26.38% with Co3O4 catalytic pyrolysis under a H2/N2 atmosphere. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The industrial scale production of biodiesel, the most common biofuel, requires innovative solutions to become more and more competitive with a reduced environmental impact. Microalgae are the most promising feedstock for biodiesel production since they are grown on non-arable areas and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions as well. The oil extraction is the competitiveness bottleneck, largely impacting the overall process cost. Oil extraction using ionic liquids is considered a promising technique, which has the chance to become a benchmark for large scale applications. In this paper a novel process simulation of ionic liquid operation is developed, implemented by Aspen Hysys V7.3®. The chosen ionic liquid is Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, a green solvent; since it is a non-conventional compound, a method to compute its properties through a thermodynamic model is provided. Moreover, a process scheme has been set up and simulated, composed of a lysis reactor, in which the ionic liquid is added for oil extraction, and a three phase separator, with recycle lines and several heat exchangers for heat recovery. Mass and energy balances have been carried out. The main results allowed to calculate the recovered oil as a function of the ionic liquid to dry biomass weight ratio (with assuming a bio-oil extraction yield of 100) and as expected, the bio-oil recovery yield increased at decreasing temperature. However, a complete recovery is not feasible, due to the physical constraints in the thermodynamic model hypotheses. Albeit some simplifying hypotheses for the thermodynamic properties, the novelty of this work is that it reports results of a process simulation, providing indication for industrial technological implementation coming from a professional tool for process simulation and control. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A series of mixed oxide nanoparticles were prepared by a coprecipitation method and characterized by many techniques. Nickel-zirconium oxide catalysts and their partially reduced magnetic counterparts were highly efficient in the direct transformation of biomass derivatives, including ethyl levulinate, fructose, glucose, cellobiose, and carboxymethyl cellulose, into γ-valerolactone (GVL) without the use of an external hydrogen source, producing a maximum GVL yield of 95.2 % at 200 °C for 3 h with hydrogen-reduced magnetic Zr5Ni5 nanoparticles (&lt;20 nm). The acid-base bifunctionality of these nanocatalysts plays a synergic role in the synthesis of GVL in alcohols, whereas appropriate control of the nickel/zirconium molar ratio is able to improve the selectivity towards GVL (≈98 %), along with high formation rates (up to 54.9 mmol g-1 h-1). Moreover, the magnetic Zr5Ni5 nanoparticles were conveniently recovered by means of a magnet for five cycles with almost constant activity. Attractive separation: Acid-base bifunctional NiZr nanocatalysts with strong magnetism show high activity and reusability in the transformation of biomass derivatives, including EL, fructose, glucose, cellobiose, and carboxymethyl cellulose, into γ-valerolactone (GVL) with 95.2 % yield and 98 % selectivity (see figure). © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Chlorella represents a group of eukaryotic green microalgae that has been receiving increasing scientific and commercial interest. It possesses high photosynthetic ability and is capable of growing robustly under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions as well. Chlorella has long been considered as a source of protein and is now industrially produced for human food and animal feed. Chlorella is also rich in oil, an ideal feedstock for biofuels. The exploration of biofuel production by Chlorella is underway. Chlorella has the ability to fix carbon dioxide efficiently and to remove nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorous, making it a good candidate for greenhouse gas biomitigation and wastewater bioremediation. In addition, Chlorella shows potential as an alternative expression host for recombinant protein production, though challenges remain to be addressed. Currently, omics analyses of certain Chlorella strains are being performed, which will help to unravel the biological implications of Chlorella and facilitate the future exploration of industrial applications. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Characterizing the pyrolysis of inorganic matter-rich biomass is important for the preparation of bio-fuel precursors. Here, thermogravimetric and pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS) were employed to elucidate the specific pyrolysis mechanisms of demineralized wood dust (AWD) impregnated with varying amounts of the inorganic compounds, copper and potassium. During the pyrolysis process, there was a dramatic decomposition of hemicellulose (at 200–320°C) and of cellulose (at 320–420 °C), along with slow lignin degradation. The decomposition of hemicellulose was substantially promoted with an increasing amount of copper. In addition, a decreased amount of aldehydes and phenols was observed, indicating a lower level of cellulose and lignin degradation, which led to more generation of bio-fuel precursors (C5–C16). In contrast to copper, potassium substantially promoted the decomposition of cellulose and lignin, but had negligible effect on hemicellulose. In the presence of both copper and potassium, the latter had a more dominant role causing an increased amount of small molecular compounds (C2–C4, i.e., from 10.91% to 22.12%), and decreased amounts of bio-fuel precursors (i.e., from 62.19% to 52.49%). The various decomposition pathways that might be involved in the catalytic pyrolysis of wood using copper and potassium are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioconversion technologies of biomass to bioethanol require intensive energy process due to several pretreatment steps to break down the biomass in order to obtain fermentable sugar for subsequent fermentation. Hence, a feasible approach to the production of bioethanol from lipid-extracted biomass of Scenedesmus dimorphus will be presented in this study in a biorefinery concept. The lipid-extracted biomass was directly subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation thereby avoiding the costly pretreatment, lowering the contamination risk and reducing the complication of high sugar content. The technological challenges for this fermentation process were investigated to identify optimum conditions for amyloglucosidase enzyme activity and Sacchromyces cerevisiae yeast ethanolic fermentation. As a result, the optimum key parameters for the fermentation were identified at an enzyme concentration of 60 units/ml, pH 5, temperature at 36 °C and yeast loading of 3 g/L. At the optimum condition, an overall conversion of more than 90% of the theoretical yield was achieved with maximum bioethanol yield of 0.26 g bioethanol/g lipid-extracted biomass. The direct usage of lipid-extracted biomass into simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with single enzyme ensures the feasibility of the biofuel produced. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrogen production by sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of bio-oil model compounds was thermodynamically and experimentally studied by mixing acetic acid (AcH) and acetone (AcCO), in a fluidized bed reactor. In the SESR process the catalytic reforming reaction and CO2 removal by sorption were carried out simultaneously in a single reactor. The SESR of the model compounds and their blends was performed under atmospheric pressure over a Pd/Ni-Co hydrotalcite-like material (HT) catalyst using dolomite as CO2 sorbent. The effects of the reaction temperature (475-725 °C), steam/C molar ratio and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) were studied. For the SESR of acetic acid, acetone and their blends it was observed that the H2 yield and H2 concentration increase as the temperature increases, reaching a maximum value, and then they decrease with the temperature. It was also found that the CH4 concentration decreases as the temperature increases, while the CO and CO2 concentrations increase with the rise in temperature. High steam/C molar ratio values and low WHSV values favor the H2 yield and H2 concentration, while they lead to a decrease in the CH4 concentration. Hydrogen purities as high as 99.2-99.4% with small amounts of methane, CO and CO2 were obtained for the SESR of the model compounds of bio-oil and their blends at a temperature of 575 °C at atmospheric pressure. The effect of temperature on the SESR of the blends of model compounds of bio-oil is similar to that of the individual model compounds studied, except in the fact that lower H2 yield values are obtained by the SESR of the blends (83.3-88.6%) compared to the individual model compounds (90.2-95.9%), a decrease which becomes more noticeable as the proportion of acetone in the blend is increased. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper, for the first time, reports integrated conceptual MBCT/biorefinery systems for unlocking the value of organics in municipal solid waste (MSW) through the production of levulinic acid (LA by 5 wt%) that increases the economic margin by 110-150%. After mechanical separation recovering recyclables, metals (iron, aluminium, copper) and refuse derived fuel (RDF), lignocelluloses from remaining MSW are extracted by supercritical-water for chemical valorisation, comprising hydrolysis in 2 wt% dilute H2SO4 catalyst producing LA, furfural, formic acid (FA), via C5/C6 sugar extraction, in plug flow (210-230 °C, 25 bar, 12 s) and continuous stirred tank (195-215 °C, 14 bar, 20 min) reactors; char separation and LA extraction/purification by methyl isobutyl ketone solvent; acid/solvent and by-product recovery. The by-product and pulping effluents are anaerobically digested into biogas and fertiliser. Produced biogas (6.4 MWh/t), RDF (5.4 MWh/t), char (4.5 MWh/t) are combusted, heat recovered into steam generation in boiler (efficiency: 80%); on-site heat/steam demand is met; balance of steam is expanded into electricity in steam turbines (efficiency: 35%). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To maintain the stability of the catalyst, sufficient co-feeding of a sulfur source was necessary to avoid oxidation of the sulfide phase by oxygen replacement of the edge sulfur atoms in the MoS2 structure. However, the addition of sulfur to the feed gas resulted in the formation of sulfur containing compounds, mainly thiols, in the oil product if the residence time was too low. At a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.9 h−1 the sulfur content in the liquid product was 980 ppm by weight, but this could be decreased to 5 ppm at a WHSV of 1.4 h−1. A high co-feed of sulfur was needed when water was present in the feed and the H2O/H2S molar ratio should be below ca. 10 to maintain a decent stability of the catalyst. Chlorine containing compounds caused a reversible deactivation of the catalyst when co-fed to the reactor, where the catalytic activity could be completely regained when removing it from the feed. Commonly, chlorine, H2O, and H2S all inhibited the activity of the catalyst by competing for the active sites, with chlorine being by far the strongest inhibitor and H2S and H2O of roughly the same strength. Dissimilar, potassium was a severe poison and irreversibly deactivated the catalyst to &lt;5% degree of deoxygenation when impregnated on the catalyst in a stoichiometric ratio relative to the active metal. This deactivation was a result of adsorption of potassium on the edge vacancy sites of the MoS2 slabs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Effects of in-house prepared CoMo catalysts supported on various nano-structured materials (activated carbon, γ-alumina, HZSM-5, MCM-41 and SBA-15) and a commercial catalyst of Ru/C were compared for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of fast pyrolysis oil (PO) in supercritical ethanol at 300 and 350 °C. All catalysts proved to be effective for significantly reducing the molecular weight of the PO by HDO treatment at 350 °C. Although Ru/C catalyst produced the highest oil yield at both temperatures (66.6 wt% at 300 °C and 61.0 wt% at 350 °C) with the lowest and negligible coke formation (&lt;1 wt%), the catalyst is very expensive and difficult for regeneration, so it is not a viable catalyst for bio-oil upgrading on a large scale. Among all the supported CoMo catalysts, CoMo/MCM-41 produced the highest yield of oil products (light oil (OL) + heavy oil (HO)) of the highest H/C molar ratio. With this catalyst, the oil yield attained 61.9 wt% at 300 °C and 57.8 wt% at 350 °C, and the spent catalyst after regeneration produced almost the same oil yields as the fresh one. In addition, CoMo catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA showed better resistance to coke/carbon deposition in the HDO process, compared with CoMo catalysts supported on HZSM-5 and Al2O3. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-oil can be upgraded through hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Low-cost and effective catalysts are crucial for the HDO process. In this study, four inexpensive combinations of Ni based activated carbon synergistic catalysts including Ni/AC, Ni-Fe/AC, Ni-Mo/AC and Ni-Cu/AC were evaluated for HDO of prairie cordgrass (PCG) bio-oil. The tests were carried out in the autoclave under mild operating conditions with 500 psig of H2 pressure and 350°C temperature. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results show that all synergistic catalysts had significant improvements on the physicochemical properties (water content, pH, oxygen content, higher heating value and chemical compositions) of the upgraded PCG bio-oil. The higher heating value of the upgraded bio-oil (ranging from 29.65 MJ/kg to 31.61 MJ/kg) improved significantly in comparison with the raw bio-oil (11.33 MJ/kg), while the oxygen content reduced to only 21.70-25.88% from 68.81% of the raw bio-oil. Compared to raw bio-oil (8.78% hydrocarbons and no alkyl-phenols), the Ni/AC catalysts produced the highest content of gasoline range hydrocarbons (C6-C12) at 32.63% in the upgraded bio-oil, while Ni-Mo/AC generated the upgraded bio-oil with the highest content of gasoline blending alkyl-phenols at 38.41%. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pyrolysis of Anchusa azurea, a lignocellulosic gramineous plant, was carried out in a tubular, fixed-bed reactor in the presence of four catalysts (Ca(OH)2, Na2CO3, ZnCl2, Al2O3). The influences of pyrolysis parameters such as catalyst and temperature on the yields of products were studied. It was found that higher temperature resulted in lower liquid (bio-oil) and solid (bio-char) yields and higher gas yields. Catalysts effected the yields of products differently and the composition of bio-oils. Liquid yields were increased in the presence of Na2CO3, ZnCl2 and Al2O3 and decreased with Ca(OH)2. The highest bio-oil yield (34.05%) by weight including aqueous phase was produced with Na2CO3 catalyst at 450 °C. The yields of products (bio-char, bio-oil and gas) and the compositions of the resulting bio-oils were determined by GC-MS, FT-IR and elemental analysis. GC-MS identified 124 and 164 different compounds in the bio-oils obtained at 350 and 550 °C respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy in fuels into electrical energy through an electrochemical oxidation process. This technology is attractive since SOFCs can in principle utilize a range of combustible fuels including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons offering higher efficiencies than conventional electricity generators with limited emission of a number of common air pollutants such as NO. x and SO. x. The environmental efficiency of SOFC devices can further be improved by utilizing fuels that are more carbon-neutral (e.g., biofuels such as ethanol) than conventional fossil fuels. One of the problems with employing oxygenated liquid biofuels is that conventional Ni anode electro-catalysts deactivate due to carbon deposition on the surface of the anode during the process of electocatalytic fuel oxidation. We show that the stability of Ni SOFC anode electrocatalysts during electrochemical oxidation of ethanol is significantly improved when a small amount of Sn is introduced in the electrocatalyst design. The improvement in the stability is manifested in a more stable operation and higher kinetic currents of Sn/Ni compared to Ni electrodes under identical conditions with ethanol fuel. We discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the enhanced stability of the anodes and propose a number of guiding principles for the design of carbon-tolerant anodes for oxidation of oxygenated hydrocarbons. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - γ-Valerolactone (GVL) is a biomass-derived solvent which completely solubilizes all fractions of lignocellulosic biomass, leading to the recovery of polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) as soluble carbohydrates at high yields (&gt;70%) without the use of expensive reagents, like enzymes and ionic liquids. Biological upgrading of carbohydrates to biofuels or bio-based chemicals requires that the carbohydrates are separated from GVL. We demonstrate that an engineered solvent system consisting of GVL, water and an organic co-solvent is mono-phasic at the temperatures used for biomass fractionation (e.g., 160 °C) and is bi-phasic at lower temperatures (e.g., room temperature). The advantage of using this engineered solvent system is that the carbohydrates are spontaneously separated from organic solvent components into an aqueous hydrolysate stream, thereby avoiding the need for expensive and potentially hazardous separation processes, such as operation at elevated pressures required for separation using liquid CO2. We also show that the organic co-solvent can be selected from an array of organic components, leading to a trade-off between the efficacy of carbohydrate separation and the 'greenness' of the solvent. We show further that toluene is a promising co-solvent component, and techno-economic analyses of the process, wherein toluene is used as a co-solvent, lead to a minimum selling price of ethanol of $3.10 per gallon of gasoline equivalent. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - We present a facile synthesis protocol for atomically thin platinum (Pt) shells on top of gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) (Au@PtNPs) in one pot under mild conditions. The Au@PtNPs exhibited remarkable stability (&gt; 2 years) at room temperature. The synthesis, bimetallic nanostructures and catalytic properties were thoroughly characterized by ultraviolet-visible light spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and electrochemistry. The 8 ± 2 nm Au@PtNPs contained 24 ± 1 mol% Pt and 76 ± 1 mol% Au corresponding to an atomically thin Pt shell. Electrochemical data clearly show that the active surface is dominated by Pt with a specific surface area above 45 m2 per gram of Pt. Interactions with the Au core increase the activity of the Pt shell by up to 55% and improve catalytic selectivity compared to pure Pt. The Au@Pt NPs show exciting catalytic activity in electrooxidation of sustainable fuels (i.e. formic acid, methanol and ethanol), and selective hydrogenation of benzene derivatives. Especially high activity was achieved for formic acid oxidation, 549 mA (mgPt)-1 (at 0.6 V vs. SCE), which is 3.5 fold higher than a commercial &lt; 5 nm PtNP catalyst. Excellent activity for the direct production of γ-valerolactone, an alternative biofuel/fuel additive, from levulinic acid and methyl levulinate was finally demonstrated. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this work a multilevel analysis approach have been used for characterization of LignoBoost™ kraft lignin and bio-oil produced from LignoBoost™ kraft lignin using a process based on subcritical water (350 °C, 25 MPa). LignoBoost™ kraft lignin and the different fractions of the bio-oil (light oil, heavy oil and suspended solids) was characterized with high field NMR (18.8 T, 2D13C, 1H-HSQC NMR and 13C-NMR), GPC, GC-MS and elemental composition to improve understanding of the subcritical process. By using high resolution 2D HSQC NMR it was possible determine the chemical structures both on low and high molecular weight fractions of the bio-oil. It was confirmed that the signals from the aliphatic lignin inter-unit linkages, i.e. β-O-4′, β-β′, β-1′ and β-5′, had disappeared from all of the bio-oil fractions studied. This means that both the aliphatic carbon-oxygen (C[sbnd]O) and to some extent carbon-carbon (C[sbnd]C) bonds in LignoBoost™ kraft lignin have been cleaved and an effective depolymerization has occurred. However, re-polymerization into higher molecular weight (Mw) fractions takes place simultaneously. These higher Mw fractions (heavy oil and suspended solids) were found to be re-polymerized macromolecules, with new structural networks based on guaiacol/disubstituted aromatic ethers and polyaromatic hydrocarbon structures bound tightly together. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examined the effect of glycerol used as a co-solvent on yields of bio-oil derived from rice straw through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The reaction was conducted in a high-pressure batch reactor with different volume ratios of glycerol to water. The quality of the derived bio-oil was analyzed in terms of its elemental composition, heating value, water content, ash content, and acid number. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were conducted to analyze the chemical composition of the derived bio-oils. The following optimal conditions were obtained: 1:1 vol ratio of glycerol to water with 5 wt% of Na2CO3 at 260 °C for 1 h. Under these conditions, 50.31 wt% of bio-oil and 26.65 wt% of solid residue were produced. Therefore, glycerol can be used as a co-solvent in HTL of rice straw at moderate temperatures to obtain bio-oil with high yield and quality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oleaginous microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. was selected as potential strain for CO2 mitigation into lipids and pigments. The synergistic effects of light intensity and photoperiod were evaluated to provide the adequate light energy for this strain. The saturation light intensity was 60 μmol·photon·m−2 s−1. With full illumination, the biomass obtained was 0.850 ± 0.16 g·L−1 with a lipid content of 44.7 ± 1.2%. The pigments content increased with increasing light energy supply. Three main operating factors including initial cell concentration, CO2 content and gas flow rate were optimized through Response Surface Methodology. The feedings with low CO2 content at high gas flow rate gave the maximum biomass but with low lipid content. After optimization, the biomass and lipid production were increased up to 1.30 ± 0.103 g·L−1 and 0.515 ± 0.010 g·L−1, respectively. The CO2 fixation rate was as high as 0.729 ± 0.04 g·L−1 d−1. The fatty acids of Nannochloropsis sp. lipids were mainly C16-C18 indicating its potential use as biodiesel feedstocks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid industrialisation and excessive use of fossil fuel resources has led to growing concern for development of next generation fuel sources. So, the exaggerated to be fulfilled and to curb the problem of increasing fuel prices; researchers are putting their efforts to produce an alternative fuel from replenish-able resources on large scale. Biodiesel is one of the promising biofuels as a replacement to petroleum diesel in future. Transesterification is most adopted technique to produce biodiesel and generally methanol is used as reactant in transesterification. Biodiesel produced by using methanol as alcohols cannot be termed as completely renewable as methanol is derived from fossil resources. To make it completely renewable, alcohol derived from bio-based resources should be adopted. In this paper, an attempt has been made to make use of higher alcohol propanol, butanol and pentanol is used for biodiesel production process and reaction parameter catalyst, time, temperature, molar ratio are optimised with application of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) by using Design Expert software. The result of experimental investigation shows that optimised biodiesel yield was obtained maximum for 1-butanol (76.4%), for 1-pentanol (73.13%) and minimum for 2-propanol (56.86%). The comparative analysis of biodiesel obtained from different alcohols shows that all the resultant biodiesel properties meets the Indian Standard 15607 standard, while the result also indicates that Karanja Oil Pentyl Ester (KOPnE) had superior cold flow properties with viscosity marginally higher among all biodiesels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pinyon juniper biomass feedstocks, which cover a large acreage of rangeland in the western United States, are being eradicated and, therefore, considered as a convenient biomass feedstock for biofuel production. Pinyon juniper whole biomass (wood, bark, and leaves) were pyrolyzed in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized-bed reactor at 450 °C, and the non-condensable gases were recycled to fluidize the reactor. Red mud was used as the in situ catalyst for the pyrolysis of the pinyon juniper biomass. The pyrolysis products were condensed in three stages, and products were analyzed for physicochemical properties. The condenser oil formed two phases with the aqueous fraction, whereas the electrostatic precipitator oils formed a single phase. The oil pH was 3.3; the higher heating value (HHV) was 28 MJ/kg; and the viscosity was less than 100 cP. There was a direct correlation between the viscosity of the oils and the alcohol/ether content of the oils, and this was also related to the aging rate of the oils. The catalytic pyrolysis oils were hydrotreated in a continuous single-stage benchtop hydrotreater to produce hydrocarbon fuels with a density of 0.80-0.82 cm3/g. The hydrotreater ran continuously for over 300 h with no significant catalyst deactivation or coke formation. This is the first time that such a long single-stage hydrotreatment has been demonstrated on biomass catalytic pyrolysis oils. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) and gas fermentation are bioenergy technologies in which a microbial catalyst reduces CO2 into organic carbon molecules with electrons from the cathode of a bioelectrochemical system or from gases such as H2. The acetogen Sporomusa ovata has the capacity of reducing CO2 into commodity chemicals by both gas fermentation and MES. Acetate is often the only product generated by S. ovata during autotrophic growth. Results: In this study, trace elements in S. ovata growth medium were optimized to improve MES and gas fermentation productivity. Augmenting tungstate concentration resulted in a 2.9-fold increase in ethanol production by S. ovata during H2:CO2-dependent growth. It also promoted electrosynthesis of ethanol in a S. ovata-driven MES reactor and increased acetate production 4.4-fold compared to unmodified medium. Furthermore, fatty acids propionate and butyrate were successfully converted to their corresponding alcohols 1-propanol and 1-butanol by S. ovata during gas fermentation. Increasing tungstate concentration enhanced conversion efficiency for both propionate and butyrate. Gene expression analysis suggested that tungsten-containing aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases (AORs) and a tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (FDH) were involved in the improved biosynthesis of acetate, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol. AORs and FDH contribute to the fatty acids re-assimilation pathway and the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, respectively. Conclusions: This study presented here shows that optimization of microbial catalyst growth medium can improve productivity and lead to the biosynthesis of different products by gas fermentation and MES. It also provides insights on the metabolism of biofuels production in acetogens and demonstrates that S. ovata has an important untapped metabolic potential for the production of other chemicals than acetate via CO2-converting bioprocesses including MES. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The main challenges associated with a growing production of renewable electricity are intermittency and dispersion. Intermittency generates spikes in production, which need to be curtailed when exceeding consumption. Dispersion means electricity has to be transported over long distances between production and consumption sites. In the Directive 2009/28/EC, the European Commission recommends sustainable and effective measures to prevent curtailments and facilitate transportation of renewable electricity. This article explores the material constraints of storing and transporting surplus renewable electricity by conversion into synthetic methane. Europe is considered for its mix of energy technologies, data availability and multiple energy pathways to 2050. Results show that the requirements for key materials and land remain relatively low, respecting the recommendations of the EU Commission. By 2050, more than 6 million tons of carbon dioxide might be transformed into methane annually within the EU. The efficiency of renewable power methane production is also compared to the natural process of converting solar into chemical energy (i.e. photosynthesis), both capturing and reenergizing carbon dioxide. Overall, the production of renewable methane (including carbon dioxide capture) is more efficient and less material intensive than the production of biofuels derived from photosynthesis and biomass conversion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, a series of MIL-101-SO3H(x) polymeric materials were prepared and further used for the first time as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of fructose-based carbohydrates into 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) in a renewable mixed solvent system consisting of ethanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The influence of -SO3H content on the acidity as well as on the catalytic activity of the porous coordination polymers in EMF production was also studied. High EMF yields of 67.7% and 54.2% could be successively obtained from fructose and inulin in the presence of MIL-101-SO3H (100) at 130 °C for 15 h. The catalyst could be reused for five times without significant loss of its activity and the recovery process was facile and simple. This work provides a new platform by application of porous coordination polymers (PCPs) for the production of the potential liquid fuel molecule EMF from biomass in a sustainable solvent system. © 2016 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from Chinese tallow kernel oil catalyzed by Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) in ionic liquid was investigated. Biodiesel was prepared from Chinese tallow kernel oil. Nineteen kinds of ionic liquids were screened for CRL to enhance its catalysis ability for biodiesel synthesis. Interestingly, [Hmim][PF6], not only help to simplify the downstream processing, but also boost the efficiency of CRL from about 35% to 95.4%. In addition, the biodiesel mixed with various blending ratios of fossil diesel was used to fuel the conventional diesel engine to examine fuel and emission properties. Most of fuel characteristics of the biodiesel met the standards set by EN and ASTM. Its output power was found to be close to pure diesel. The emission products, including hydrocarbons (HC, 52.7% lower) and carbon monoxide (CO, 48.6% lower), decreased substantially with the exception of oxynitride (NOx) emission, which displayed a 12.8% increase. The results suggest that biodiesel production from woody oil catalyzed by CRL in [Hmim][PF6], is feasible in future application with a promising prospect. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A combination of light bio-oil washing and torrefaction pretreatment of rice husk samples was proposed in this study, to investigate the impact on physicochemical characteristics and fast pyrolysis behavior. The results indicated that pretreatment removed a significant percentage of metallic species and significantly improved the fuel characteristics of rice husk samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated that some organic groups decomposed by dehydration and decarboxylation reactions during the process of torrefaction pretreatment. The results of fast pyrolysis indicated that the yield and quality of pyrolysis products significantly changed with combined light bio-oil washing and torrefaction pretreatment. Pretreatment resulted in a significant increase of pH and higher heating values (HHVs) along with a reduction of the water content. Meanwhile, it can be obtained from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of bio-oil that pretreatment enhanced selective pyrolysis toward production of sugars, especially levoglucosan. In view of the developed pore structure and high silica content of char obtained from fast pyrolysis of rice husk with a combination of light bio-oil washing and torrefaction pretreatment, this char can be used as the resource to produce activated carbons and amorphous silica. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the present study, hydrothermal liquefaction of waste furniture sawdust was examined. The effects of various reaction conditions such as reaction temperature (180-300 °C), residence time (0-60 min), water to sawdust ratio (2-10) and initial N2 pressure (0-2 MPa) on the product yields were studied using a high pressure batch reactor in order to determine the optimal liquefaction parameters for the production of maximum bio-oil yield. The solid residue was characterized to investigate the mechanism of hydrothermal liquefaction process by FT-IR. The highest sawdust conversion (61.6 wt%) and bio-oil yield (12.7 wt%) were obtained at 280 °C, 15 min and ratio of the water to sawdust of 6 with initial N2 pressure of 1.0 MPa. The higher heating values (HHVs) of the bio-oils were found to be within the range of 17-30 MJ kg-1. The GC-MS analysis revealed that sawdust liquefaction bio-oils comprised a complex mixture of organic compounds, which include alcohols, acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters, phenols and their derivatives. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In order to reduce the coke formation and improve catalyst activation in the catalytic cracking of bio-oil, ethanol addition and mild hydrogenation pretreatment were introduced to improve the cracking stability. According to the analysis on the bio-oil molecular distillation, several typical compounds were selected as the representative of bio-oil distillation. Based on the two-stage fixed-bed reactor, the effect of mild hydrogenation on the cracking behavior of bio-oil model compound mixture was studied in detail. In a single-stage cracking process, the selectivity of oil phase was only 28–23 wt%, with the formation of abundant oxygenated byproducts. When mild hydrogenation was introduced before the cracking, the selectivity of oil phase increased up to 40wt% at 8 h, with an aromatic hydrocarbon content of over 90%. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In this study, grape seed oil was transesterified with methanol using sodium hydroxide as a catalyst to obtain grape seed oil methyl ester (GSOME). It was basically identified through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum. The blends such as B10, B15, B20, and D100 were tested in a compression ignition diesel engine. The fuel properties were determined using American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the engine emission parameters were analyzed for those test fuels for different load at constant engine speed of 1,500 rpm. The experimental results show that all the blends provided significant reductions in NOx than D100. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, conversion of wastes from poultry farming and industry into biochar and bio-oil via thermochemical processes was investigated. Fuel characteristics and chemical structure of biochars and bio-oils have been investigated using standard fuel analysis and spectroscopic methods. Biochars were produced from poultry litter through both hydrothermal carbonization (sub-critical water, 175–250 °C) and pyrolysis over a temperature range between 250 and 500 °C. In comparison to hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis at lower temperatures produced biochar with greater energy yield due to the higher mass yield. Biochars obtained by both processes were comparable to coal. Hydrothermal liquefaction of poultry meal at different temperatures (200–325 °C) was conducted and compared to optimize its process conditions. Higher temperatures favored the formation of bio-crude oil, with a maximum yield of 35 wt.% at 300 °C. The higher heating values of bio-oils showed that bio-oil could be a potential source of synthetic fuels. However, elemental analysis demonstrated the high nitrogen content of bio-oils. Therefore, bio-oils obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction of poultry meal should be upgraded for utilization as a transport and heating fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alkanes of defined carbon chain lengths can serve as alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. Recently, microbial pathways of alkane biosynthesis have been identified and enabled the production of alkanes in non-native producing microorganisms using metabolic engineering strategies. The chemoautotrophic bacterium Cupriavidus necator has great potential for producing chemicals from CO2: it is known to have one of the highest growth rate among natural autotrophic bacteria and under nutrient imbalance it directs most of its carbon flux to the synthesis of the acetyl-CoA derived polymer, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), (up to 80% of intracellular content). Alkane synthesis pathway from Synechococcus elongatus (2 genes coding an acyl-ACP reductase and an aldehyde deformylating oxygenase) was heterologously expressed in a C. necator mutant strain deficient in the PHB synthesis pathway. Under heterotrophic condition on fructose we showed that under nitrogen limitation, in presence of an organic phase (decane), the strain produced up to 670 mg/L total hydrocarbons containing 435 mg/l of alkanes consisting of 286 mg/l of pentadecane, 131 mg/l of heptadecene, 18 mg/l of heptadecane, and 236 mg/l of hexadecanal. We report here the highest level of alka(e)nes production by an engineered C. necator to date. We also demonstrated the first reported alka(e)nes production by a non-native alkane producer from CO2 as the sole carbon source. © 2016 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of biodiesel production by transesterification of Jatropha oil with methanol, catalyzed by non-commercial sn-1,3-regioselective lipases. Using these lipases, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and monoacylglycerols are produced, avoiding the formation of glycerol as byproduct. Heterologous Rhizopus oryzae lipase (rROL) immobilized on different synthetic resins and Carica papaya lipase (rCPL) immobilized on Lewatit VP OC 1600 were tested. Reactions were performed at 30 °C, with seven stepwise methanol additions. For all biocatalysts, 51–65% FAME (theoretical maximum = 67%, w/w) was obtained after 4 h transesterification. Stability tests were performed in 8 or 10 successive 4 h-batches, either with or without rehydration of the biocatalyst between each two consecutive batches. Activity loss was much faster when biocatalysts were rehydrated. For rROL, half-life times varied from 16 to 579 h. rROL on Lewatit VPOC 1600 was more stable than for rCPL on the same support. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, a great attention has been paid to advanced microwave technology that can be used to markedly enhance the biodiesel production process. Ceiba pentandra Seed Oil containing high free fatty acids (FFA) was utilized as a non-edible feedstock for biodiesel production. Microwave-assisted esterification pretreatment was conducted to reduce the FFA content for promoting a high-quality product in the next step. At optimum condition, the conversion was achieved 94.43% using 2 wt% of sulfuric acid as catalyst where as 20.83% conversion was attained without catalyst. The kinetics of this esterification reaction was also studied to determine the influence of factors on the rate of reaction and reaction mechanisms. The results indicated that microwave-assisted esterification was of endothermic second-order reaction with the activation energy of 53.717 kJ/mol. © 2016.

AB  - Research is focused on the utilisation of waste or residue biomass for bioenergy conversion. A promising conversion technology for the production of liquid biofuels from residue biomass is a process called Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR®​) which is a combination of prior thermal treatment of the biomass at mild temperatures (intermediate pyrolysis) followed by a second catalytic treatment step at elevated temperatures (reforming). This article focuses on the conversion of TCR®liquids from digestate as a feedstock for subsequent hydrocarbon production. The generated bio-oil showed a lower heating value of 34.0 MJ kg− 1with an oxygen content of 7.0% and a water content of 2.2%. The bio-oil was hydrodeoxygenated using an industrial NiMo–Al2O3catalyst at temperatures of 503 K–643 K and a pressure of 14 MPa. The hydrodeoxygenated bio-oil reached a lower heating value of 42.3 MJ kg−1with an oxygen content below 0.8 mg kg−1and water content of 30 ppm. Product yields and catalyst life give confidence that upgrading of the TCR®​bio-oil offers a suitable option to meet the high standards of common fuels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Methanolysis of sunflower oil catalyzed by a synthesized immobilized lipase (denoted as celite-alkyl-lipase) was carried out in a packed-bed reactor (PBR) (= 167 cm, I.D = 1.5 cm) to produce biodiesel. Although complete conversion of the triglyceride can be achieved in a long-single column PBR with prolonged reaction time, the biodiesel production still reached a plateau of 67% conversion due to glycerol accumulation, which led to an increase in the mass transfer resistance. The biodiesel conversion was enhanced to 85% by carrying out the transesterification in a series of three packed-bed reactors integrated with glycerol removal devices. In the first column (= 67 cm, I.D = 1.5 cm), triglyceride was converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), glycerol, as well as a considerable amount of intermediate products, while the second (= 67 cm, I.D = 2.0 cm) and third columns (= 67 cm, I.D = 2.5 cm) continuously converted intermediate products to FAME with the supply of methanol and without the accumulation of glycerol. The PBR series system was able to continuously produce biodiesel at the yield of 4413 kg kg-1 celite-alkyl-lipase, without deactivation of the biocatalyst. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel emulsions are considered one of the most promising alternatives to petrol fuels. The purpose of the present investigation is to study the performance characteristics and the exhaust emission characteristics of a diesel engine run on nanoparticle blended biodiesel emulsion fuel. The engine performance under biodiesel blended diesel fuel was similar to that of the diesel fuel but with higher fuel consumption mainly due to the reduced calorific value that ensued from mixing with biofuel. The biodiesel emulsion fuel was prepared by emulsification technique comprising 83% canola biodiesel, 15% water, and 2% surfactants (Span80 and Tween80) with the help of a mechanical agitator. The prepared biodiesel emulsion fuel was mixed with the cerium nanoparticles in a mass fraction of 50 parts per million (ppm) with the help of an ultrasonicator. The investigation was carried out in a constant-speed diesel engine. The cerium oxide acts as an oxygen-donating medium and also provides oxygen for the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) or absorbs oxygen for the decrease of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The establishment force of cerium oxide burns off carbon deposits within the engine cylinder and prevents the deposition of nonpolar compounds on the cylinder wall, resulting in the reduction of hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. The experimental results showed considerable improvements in the performance and a reduction in harmful emissions with the biodiesel emulsion fuels compared with that of neat biodiesel. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Present work deals with the ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production from low cost, substantial acid value kusum (Schleichera triguga) oil using a two-step method of esterification in presence of acid (H2SO4) catalyst followed by transesterification using a basic heterogeneous barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) catalyst. The initial acid value of kusum oil was reduced from 21.65 to 0.84 mg of KOH/g of oil, by acid catalyzed esterification with 4:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration 1% (v/v), ultrasonic irradiation time 20 min at 40°C. Then, Ba(OH)2 concentration of 3% (w/w), methanol to oil molar ratio of 9:1, ultrasonic irradiation time of 80 min, and temperature of 50°C was found to be the optimum conditions for transesterification step and triglyceride conversion of 96.8% (wt) was achieved. This paper also examined the kinetics as well as the evaluation of thermodynamic parameters for both esterification and transesterification reactions. The lower value of activation energy and higher values of kinetic constants indicated a fast rate of reaction, which could be attributed to the physical effect of emulsification, in which the microturbulence generated due to radial motion of bubbles, creates an intimate mixing of the immiscible reactants causing the increase in the interfacial area, giving faster reaction kinetics. The positive values of Gibbs-free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and negative value of entropy (ΔS) revealed that both the esterification and transesterification were non-spontaneous, endothermic and endergonic reactions. Therefore, the present work has not only established the escalation obtained due to ultrasonication but also exemplified the two-step approach for synthesis of biodiesel from non-edible kusum oil based on the use of heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification step. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algae biocrude was treated with hydrogen using metal catalysts supported on activated carbon for the production of biofuel. The biocrude was produced using hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae (Scenedesmus-dominated polyculture) grown in municipal wastewater. Four metal catalysts (platinum, ruthenium, nickel and cobalt) were tested at 350 °C under the presence of high pressure hydrogen, and all the experiments were conducted at a weight hourly space velocity of 0.51 g/gcat·h. Hydrotreating with all the catalysts increased higher heating value, while reducing viscosity and total acid number (TAN) of the biocrude. For example, biocrude upgraded using platinum catalyst increased the heating value from 45.9 to 47.0 MJ/kg and reduced the TAN from 11.56 to 0.1 mg KOH/g. In addition, the liquid produced was colorless. Furthermore, the use of ruthenium and platinum catalysts greatly enhanced the yield of hexadecane and octadecane in the hydrogen-treated liquids whereas heptadecane was less favored. Overall, hydrogen treatment of biocrude was effective in improving the quality of biocrude produced from algae grown in wastewater. The BET surface area was reduced for all the spent catalysts. An SEM-EDS analysis revealed that some liquid products and sulfur were deposited in the spent catalysts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a novel method based on Extreme Learning Machine with wavelet transform algorithm (ELM-WT) was designed and adapted to estimate the exergetic performance of a DI diesel engine. The exergetic information was obtained by calculating mass, energy, and exergy balance equations for the experimental trials conducted at various engine speeds and loads as well as different biodiesel and expanded polystyrene contents. Furthermore, estimation capability of the ELM-WT model was compared with that of the ELM, GP (genetic programming) and ANN (artificial neural network) models. The experimental results showed that an improvement in the exergetic performance modelling of the DI diesel engine could be achieved by the ELM-WT approach in comparison with the ELM, GP, and ANN methods. Furthermore, the results showed that the applied algorithm could learn thousands of times faster than the conventional popular learning algorithms. Obviously, the developed ELM-WT model could be used with a high degree of confidence for further work on formulating novel model predictive strategy for investigating exergetic performance of DI diesel engines running on various renewable and non-renewable fuels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (ECH) of furfural (FF) on a copper electrocatalyst has been investigated to produce biofuels and fine chemicals in an H-type batch reactor at room temperature. We report a systematic study of ECH of FF to gain a better understanding of the relationships between products and reaction conditions: current density, electrolyte, and cosolvent ratio in acidic solutions. The acidity of electrolytes had the most significant impact on the product distribution. Mildly acidic electrolytes mainly produced furfuryl alcohol (FA), while strongly acidic electrolytes produced both 2-methyl furan (MF) and FA. Also, the yield of products depended on the current density and reaction time when equivalent charge was transferred to the reaction. However, the mole balance accounting for FF, MF, and FA was not higher than 70% in any reaction condition when the theoretical amount of electrons for complete MF production from FF (e-/FF = 4) was transferred to the system. The investigation of nonelectrochemical homogeneous side reactions suggested that the low mole balance in a mildly acidic electrolyte may be from the charge transfer promoted side reactions on the copper electrode. On the other hand, it was shown that the low mole balance in strongly acidic electrolytes was due to homogeneous side reactions. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising cleaner burning, less toxic and renewable energy carrier. It is made primarily by transesterification of refined vegetable oils, but biodiesel from these sources are becoming more expensive. Therefore, alternative raw materials are being evaluated, but a major difficulty in the production of biodiesel from these alternative feedstocks is the high concentrations of free fatty acids. This is mainly due to the saponification reaction which occurs with the most commonly used alkali catalysts. Therefore in this work a parameter screening of the esterification of oleic acid, a free fatty acid, with ethanol in the presence of the heterogeneous acid catalyst Amberlyst 15 wet ion exchange was conducted with the intent to produce biodiesel. The parameters screened were reaction temperature, catalyst amount and the ratio between moles of alcohol and moles of fatty acid while the reaction time was set to 6 h. It was found that higher temperature and catalyst amounts increased conversion; however, the ratio between moles of alcohol and moles of fatty acid that gave the highest final conversion was 1:1. The highest Biodiesel yield obtained was 53%. In addition a reuse test of the catalyst was in order to test its recyclability; however, the catalyst presented a reduction in its activity after a single use. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic ethanol is a promising alternative to fossil-derived fuels because lignocellulosic biomass is abundant, cheap and its use is environmentally friendly. However, the high costs of feedstock supply and the expensive processing requirements of lignocellulosic biomass hinder the development of the lignocellulosic biorefinery. Lignocellulosic ethanol production so far, has been based mainly on single feedstocks while the use of mixed feedstocks has been poorly explored. Previous studies from alternative applications of mixed lignocellulosic biomass (MLB) have shown that their use can bring about significant cost savings when compared to single feedstocks. Although laboratory-scale evaluations have demonstrated that mixed feedstocks give comparable or even higher ethanol yields compared to single feedstocks, more empirical studies are needed to establish the possibility of achieving significant cost savings in terms of pre-biorefinery logistics. In this review, some potential benefits of the use of MLB for ethanol production are highlighted. Some anticipated limitations of this approach have been identified and ways to surmount them have been suggested. The outlook for ethanol production from MLB is promising provided that revolutionary measures are taken to ensure the sustainability of the industry. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Hydroprocessing of carinata oil over an Al2O3 supported Mo-Zn catalyst in a batch reactor at 350 °C with an initial H2 pressure of 300 psi was carried out to produce hydrocarbon biofuel. A series of Mo-Zn/Al2O3 catalysts with different Zn/Mo molar ratios (0, 1, 2, 3, ∞) were prepared and characterized using XRD, FT-IR, BET and TEM. The effects on the physicochemical properties and yield of products from using no catalyst and Al2O3 based catalysts were discussed. The introduction of Mo and/or Zn did not change the crystalline structure of Al2O3. The combining of Mo and Zn on Al2O3 improved catalytic performance and was helpful to improve some of the physicochemical properties of hydrocarbon biofuel including hydrocarbon content, moisture content, density, total acid number and higher heating value (HHV). The catalyst which exhibited the best catalytic performance had a Zn/Mo molar ratio of 2:1. At the 2:1 ratio of Zn/Mo, the hydrocarbon biofuel produced displayed the highest hydrocarbon content (81.05%) and the lowest moisture content, and the highest sum content of CO and CO2 in the gas produced. The introduction of Mo and Zn on Al2O3 was helpful for the hydroprocessing of carinata oil for hydrocarbon biofuel production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Poor oxidation stability of biodiesel is now a major concern all over the world, especially due to its extensive utilisation in transport and industrialisation. Therefore, biodiesel needs better stability, in order to be sustainably utilised in the long term. The oxygen inhibitor antioxidant can counter the poor oxidation. In this experiment, 20% of Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel (CIB20) was used as biodiesel feedstock. Three most effective antioxidants N, N'-diphenyl-1, 4-phenylenediamine (DPPD), N-phenyl-1, 4-phenylenediamine (NPPD) and 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) were used at a 1000 ppm concentration with CIB20. The oxidation stability, exhaust emission and performance of a single cylinder diesel engine were analysed and compared to those of diesel. From the results, it was concluded that there was no significant negative impact on biodiesel physiochemical properties, while the stability of biodiesel (CIB20) with the addition of antioxidants with tested blends increased. Among these three antioxidants, DPPD exhibits a better stability in biodiesel. The results shows that CIB20 produced an average of 5.23% lower brake power (BP), 7.84% less brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and 11.2% higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), compared to pure diesel. However, by mixing the antioxidant with CIB20, the BP and BTE, increased while the BSFC slightly decreased. For exhaust emission, antioxidants reduced NOx by about 5.92%-8.83%, with an increment of hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon-monoxide (CO) for all blends. For this reason, CIB20 blends with aromatic amine antioxidants can be used in diesel engine without any engine modifications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pretreating biomass prior to pyrolysis was investigated. Three undesirable catalysts naturally present in biomass were identified: inorganics, acids, and water. A pretreatment sequence incorporating acid leaching and torrefaction was developed to reduce/remove these catalysts. Acid leaching targeted reducing the biomass's inorganic content. The acidic liquor produced during torrefaction was rich in acetic and formic acid; this solution was recycled as the acid leaching reagent. The optimal leaching conditions were at 30 °C with 1% acetic acid for 4 h, which decreased the inorganic content from 0.41 wt% to 0.16 wt% for leached biomass. Torrefaction targeted reducing the biomass's moisture and acetyl content and was optimal at 270 °C for 20 min. Bio-oil from pyrolysis of demineralisation and torrefied biomass was depleted in organic acids, pyrolytic lignin, and water but was rich in levoglucosan and aromatics. Decreasing the biomass's acetyl and inorganic content reduced organic acid formation. The water content in the bio-oil was lower because less water entered the system, and water plays an auto-catalytic role during pyrolysis, promoting the production of pyrolytic water. The high levoglucosan yield confirmed that secondary reactions were limited to a much higher degree when both pretreatments were implemented compared to demineralisation or torrefaction alone. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermal acid hydrolysis is often used to deal with lignocellulosic biomasses, but 5-hydroxy-methylfurfural (5-HMF) formed during hydrolysis deeply influences downstream fermentation. 2,5-Furan-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), which is in the list of future important biomass platform molecules can be obtained using 5-HMF biotransformation. Based on the connection between 5-HMF removal in acid hydrolysate and FDCA production, the optimum thermal acid hydrolysis condition for macroalgae Chaetomorpha linum was established. Potential microbes capable of transforming 5-HMF into FDCA were isolated and characterized under various parameters and inoculated into algal hydrolysate to perform 5-HMF biotransformation. The optimum hydrolysis condition was to apply 0.5 M HCl to treat 3% algal biomass under 121 °C for 15 min. Isolated Burkholderia cepacia H-2 could transform 2000 mg/L 5-HMF at the initial pH of 7 at 28 °C and 1276 mg/L FDCA was received. Strain B. cepacia H-2 was suitable for treating the algal hydrolysate without dilution, receiving 989.5 mg/L FDCA. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using calcined Mg/Al HT (hydrotalcite) as heterogeneous catalyst was investigated. This study describes the calcined Mg/Al HT prepared under optimal conditions to catalyse waste cooking oil for biodiesel preparation and proposes a plausible catalysis mechanism. The catalysts were characterised by Fourier Transform-Infrared, X-ray diffraction, Thermal Gravity Analysis-Differential thermal gravity and Brunner-Emmet-Teller measurements. Hydrotalcite with Mg/Al ratio of 3:1 showed a uniform mesoporous structure, excellent crystallinity, high surface area (270.5 m2/g) and good catalytic activity (at 500 °C calcination). The highest biodiesel yield obtained was 95.2% under optimised conditions of alcohol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, methanol/ethanol molar ratio of 4:2, catalyst content of 1.5%, reaction time of 2.5 h, reaction temperature of 80 °C. Mixed methanol/ethanol showed good synergistic effects as an ester exchange agent, and the catalyst was easily separated and recycled. Therefore, Mg/Al hydrotalcite can effectively catalyse waste cooking oil for biodiesel preparation with mixed methanol/ethanol. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the recent scenario, consumption of petroleum fuels has increased to greater height which has led to deforestation and decline in fossil fuels. In order to tackle the perilous situation, alternative fuel has to be generated. Biofuels play a vital role in substituting the diesel fuels as they are renewable and ecofriendly. Biodiesel, often referred to as green fuel, could be a potential replacement as it could be synthesized from varied substrates, advantageous being the microalgae in several ways. The present investigation was dealt with the interesterification of waste cooking oil using immobilised lipase from mixed cultures for biodiesel production. In order to standardize the production for a scale up process, the parameters necessary for interesterification had been optimized using the statistical tool, Central Composite Design - Response Surface Methodology. The optimal conditions required to generate biodiesel were 2 g enzyme load, 1:12 oil to methyl acetate ratio, 60 h reaction time and 35 °C temperature, yielding a maximum of 93.61% biodiesel. The immobilised lipase beads remain stable without any changes in their function and structure even after 20 cycles which made this study, less cost intensive. In conclusion, the study revealed that the cooking oil, a residue of many dining centers, left as waste product, can be used as a potential raw material for the production of ecofriendly and cost effective biofuel, the biodiesel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Two biocatalysts, namely carbohydrases and proteases, were assessed for organic matter solubilisation and methane yield enhancement of microalgae biomass. This study evidenced Chlorella vulgaris carbohydrate accumulation (40% on VSS basis) when grown in urban wastewater. Despite of the carbohydrate prevailing fraction, protease pretreatment showed higher organic matter hydrolysis efficiency (54%). Microscopic observation revealed that carbohydrases affected slightly the cell wall while protease was not selective to wall constituents. Raw and pretreated biomass was digested at 1.5 kg tCOD m-3 day-1 organic loading rate (OLR1) and 20 days hydraulic retention time (HRT). The highest methane yield (137 mL CH4 g COD in-1) was achieved in the reactor fed with protease pretreated C. vulgaris. Additionally, anaerobic digestion was conducted at OLR2 (3 kg tCOD m-3 day-1) and HRT (15 days). When compared to raw biomass, methane yield increased 5- and 6.3-fold at OLR1 and OLR2, respectively. No inhibitors were detected during the anaerobic digestion. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microwave-enhanced pyrolysis (MEP) of natural algae under different reaction conditions was carried out. The optimal conditions for bio-oil production were the following: algae particle size of 20-5 mesh, microwave power of 600 W, and 10% of activated carbon as microwave absorber and catalyst. The maximum liquid yield obtained under N2, 10% H2/Ar, and CO2 atmosphere was 49.1%, 51.7%, and 54.3% respectively. The energy yield of bio-products was 216.7%, 236.9% and 208.7% respectively. More long chain fatty acids were converted into hydrocarbons by hydrodeoxygenation under 10% H2/Ar atmosphere assisted by microwave over activated carbon containing small amounts of metals. Under CO2 atmosphere, carboxylic acids (66.6%) were the main products in bio-oil because the existence of CO2 vastly inhibited the decarboxylation. The MEP of algae was quick and efficient for bio-oil production, which provided a way to not only ameliorate the environment but also obtain fuel or chemicals at the same time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A sulfated zirconia catalyst has been prepared by a novel one-pot vapor-controlled synthesis route using ammonium persulphate as sulfate agent. A possible formation mechanism of the catalyst is proposed. The effect of calcination temperature and S/Zr molar ratio on the structural, textural and catalytic properties of the prepared catalyst were investigated in detail using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) which was equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). The results indicated that the samples calcined at 500 °C possessed zirconia of pure tetragonal structure, more content of sulfur and better distribution of acid sites on the surface of zirconia compared with the samples calcined at 600 °C at fixed S/Zr molar ratio. Moreover, they showed excellent catalytic activity with 100% yields of biodiesel for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A series of Cs exchanged silicotungstic acid (STA) catalysts were prepared and their physico-chemical properties were derived from FT-Infrared, X-ray diffraction, Laser Raman, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and BET surface area. The characterization results revealed that the Keggin structure of STA remained intact even after Cs ions replaced its protons. The catalysts activity was evaluated for the selective etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with ethanol for the synthesis of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF). The partial exchange of Cs ions with protons of STA resulted an increase in acidity and the catalysts with two Cs ions in STA showed highest acidity. The activity was explained based on the acidity, surface and structural properties of the catalysts. A detailed study was made on the effect of various reaction parameters such as influence of reaction temperature, reaction time, Cs content on STA to unveil the optimize reaction conditions. The catalyst was recovered easily from the reaction mixture and reused at least four times with constant activity. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A SO3H-MCM-41 catalyst was synthesized and investigated as a highly efficient catalyst for furfural production. The effects of hydrophobicity surface and porous structure on catalytic performance in xylose dehydration were evaluated. The methyl group of the methyl propyl sulfonic acid-functionalized MCM-41 (MPrSO3H-MCM-41) catalyst enhanced the product repellent to obtain a high turn-over frequency. Moreover, the acid density of the catalyst had a significant effect on xylose conversion. Meanwhile, furfural selectivity was affected by the pore architecture. The wormhole-like structure with a bottle neck and a pore diameter in the range of 3-6 nm could provide a furfural selectivity greater than 93%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrogen-rich syngas production from the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of pinewood sawdust was investigated by using La1-xKxMnO3 perovskite-type catalysts. The effects of the K substitution, temperature, water to carbon molar ratio (WCMR) and bio-oil weight hourly space velocity (WbHSV) on H2 yield, carbon conversion and the product distribution were studied in a fixed-bed reactor. The results showed that La1-xKxMnO3 perovskite-type catalysts with a K substitution of 0.2 gave the best performance and had a higher catalytic activity than the commercial Ni/ZrO2. Both high temperature and low WbHSV led to higher H2 yield. However, excessive steam reduced hydrogen yield. For the La0.8K0.2MnO3 catalyst, a hydrogen yield of 72.5% was obtained under the optimum operating condition (T = 800 °C, WCMR = 3 and WbHSV = 12 h-1). The deactivation of the catalysts mainly was caused by coke deposition. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study characterizes the pyrolytic sugars in three bio-oils (with a total sugar content range of 55.6-69.2 mg g-1 bio-oil) produced from biomass fast pyrolysis by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and two-dimensional 1H-13C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation-nuclear magnetic resonance (HSQC-NMR). Depending on bio-oil sample, glucose (mainly derived from cellulose) contributes ∼67-79 wt % of total pyrolytic sugars in the bio-oil, and the rest of the sugars are derived from hemicellulose. The majority (&gt;96%) of pyrolytic sugars are present in the water-soluble fraction of bio-oil, mainly in the form of cellulose-derived anhydrosugars such as levoglucosan and cellobiosan. A small portion of hemicellulose-derived sugar structures are also found in the water-soluble fraction of bio-oil. Unlike six-carbon sugars (glucose, galactose, and mannose) which are mainly present as anhydrosugars (i.e., ∼ 79-86% on a carbon basis for glucose), a large portion of five-carbon sugars (xylose and arabinose) in the water-soluble fraction of bio-oil are present as monomer sugars (i.e., ∼ 24-39% on a carbon basis for arabinose and ∼32-42% on a carbon basis for xylose). The results suggest that the formation of anhydrosugars from hemicellulose pyrolysis is difficult for five-carbon sugars and the hydrolysis of hemicellulose can be catalyzed by the organic acids produced during pyrolysis. A minor portion (&lt;4%) of sugar structures also exists in the water-insoluble fraction of bio-oil, possibly formed via thermal ejection mechanism from hemicellulose components connected to lignin structures. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ever growing world energy demands, depletion and price of petroleum reserves, and environmental concerns are enormous challenges in today's scenario. For meeting the demand, alternate fuels are considered as an obvious choice owing to their renewability and environmental friendliness. Among the possible alternatives, processing of vegetable oil for biofuel production has gained considerable attention due to its ease of operation and integration with existing oil refining processes. Typically, transesterification based processes have been developed for production of biodiesel whereas hydroprocessing routes are developed to convert vegetable oil to green diesel and Bio-aviation turbine fuel (Bio-ATF) fraction using non-edible/edible vegetable oils as a feedstock. Accordingly, the present review is aimed at understanding of process aspects of various available processes. Based on the reviewed processing options, the merits and demerits of the developed routes have been highlighted and possible approaches for development of glycerin free biodiesel routes are envisaged. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - The growing demand for energy and the increasing opposition to fossil fuels has given rise to the need for alternative fuels. The pyrolysis process is one viable option that converts lignocellulosic biomass into liquid fuel. This study focuses, for the first time, on the use of an induction heating mechanism to pyrolyze biomass from energy cane (Saccharum complex) bagasse and invasive Chinese tallow trees (Triadica sebifera L.). Energy cane and tallow wood were pyrolyzed at 500, 550, 600, 650, and 700°C at atmospheric pressure in a laboratory scale batch process with an initial loading of 15 g and 30 g for energy cane bagasse and CTT respectively. The results indicate that the highest liquid yield was obtained at 500°C for both biomasses. The yields of char declined and the gas yields increased as the reaction temperature increased, as the biomass was more thoroughly decomposed at the higher reaction temperatures. GC-MS results show that the liquid product was rich in oxygenated compounds such as phenols, ketones and alcohols for biomasses at all temperatures. Bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis of Chinese tallow tree showed small concentration of fatty alcohols. Concentration of smaller compounds in the liquid product increased as the reaction temperature increased. Highest energy content and liquid yields (34 MJ/kg and 35.4%) amongst the tested temperatures was obtained at 500°C for both energy cane and tallow wood pyrolysis. Higher heating values were obtained for bio-oil from energy cane compared to tallow tree biomass.

AB  - This paper evaluates the potential production of non-food biofuels in China. The evaluation is conducted for ethanol and biodiesel. The ethanol production is predicted based on the available amounts of energy crops, agricultural and forest residues and waste molasses, while the biodiesel is predicted to be produced from wood energy plants and waste cooking oil. The results indicate that China's potential capacity on non-food biofuels from 2015 to 2030 will be in the range between 75.60 and 152.13 million metric tons. In order to exploit this potential capacity, there is a long way to march. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - γ-Valerolactone (GVL) is considered a very interesting green, bio-based platform chemical with high application potential for the production of both biofuels and biobased chemicals. In this contribution, we report a kinetic study on the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) to 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (4-HPA) and the subsequent intramolecular esterification to GVL in water using Ru/C (3 wt.% Ru) as the catalyst in a batch set-up. A large number of experiments was performed in a temperature range of 343–403 K, a hydrogen pressure range from 30 to 60 bar and initial LA concentrations between 300 and 2500 mol m−3. Experimental data, supported by calculation, indicate that intra-particle diffusion of LA and hydrogen affect the overall reaction rate and as such a heterogeneous model with both reaction and diffusion was used to model the data. The hydrogenation reaction of LA to 4-HPA was modelled using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type expression whereas the reaction of 4-HPA to GVL was modelled as an equilibrium reaction occurring in the bulk of the liquid, catalyzed by a Brönsted acid, in this case LA and 4-HPA. A good fit between experiments and model was observed. The results were compared to a kinetic model without considering mass transfer and diffusion limitations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - HRJ (Hydro-processed Renewable Jet) conversion technology has been recently used to produce renewable jet fuel for commercial or military flights. In this study, a techno-economic analysis is carried out for evaluating the production of jatropha-derived HRJ fuel through a bio-refinery process. Each component of the chosen feedstock jatropha can be converted into valuable products. The bio-refinery process is split into 6 parts: (1) Fruit Dehulling; (2) Shell Combustion; (3) Oil Extraction; (4) Press Cake Pyrolysis; (5) Oil Upgrading; (6) Product Separation. The minimum jet fuel selling price (MJSP) from this fruit scenario is calculated to be $5.42/gal based on the plant capacity of 2400 metric tonne of feedstock per day. The co-products obtained from the process not only significantly deduct the production cost but make the entire process energy self-sustainable. We also discuss the oil scenario, which oil is the starting material and the process begins from Oil Upgrading section. The oil scenario offers the MJSP of $5.74/gal with lower capital but higher operating costs. The differences of MJSPs for fruit and oil scenarios are due to feedstock cost, refinery capital cost, co-product credits and energy cost. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the feedstock price, oil content, plant capacity, reactor construction and catalyst usage are important parameters that control the price of the produced fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass processing to value-added chemicals and biofuels received considerable attention due to the renewable nature of the precursors. Here, we report the development of Ru-containing magnetically recoverable catalysts for cellulose hydrogenolysis to low alcohols, ethylene glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG). The catalysts are synthesized by incorporation of magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) in mesoporous silica pores followed by formation of 2 nm Ru NPs. The latter are obtained by thermal decomposition of ruthenium acetylacetonate in the pores. The catalysts showed excellent activities and selectivities at 100% cellulose conversion, exceeding those for the commercial Ru/C. High selectivities as well as activities are attributed to the influence of Fe3O4 on the Ru0/Ru4+ NPs. A facile synthetic protocol, easy magnetic separation, and stability of the catalyst performance after magnetic recovery make these catalysts promising for industrial applications. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of co-digesting food waste (FW) and de-oiled grease trap waste (GTW) to improve the biogas production. A lab-scale mesophilic digester (MD), a temperature-phased anaerobic digester (TPAD) and a TPAD with recycling (TPAD-R) were synchronously operated under mono-digestion (FW) and co-digestion (FW. +. de-oiled GTW). Co-digestion increased the biogas yield by 19% in the MD and TPAD-R, with a biogas yield of 0.60. L/g VS added. Specific methanogenic activity in the TPAD-R was much higher than that in the MD. In addition to methane, hydrogen at a yield of approximately 1. mol/mol hexose was produced in the TPAD-R. Alkalinity was consumed more in the co-digestion than in mono-digestion. Co-digestion resulted in more lipid accumulation in each digester. The MD favored the degradation of lipid and conversion of long-chain fatty acids more than the TPAD and TPAD-R. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A model explaining the π-conjugated electron pathway effect induced by a novel cross-linker adopted enzyme catalyst is suggested and the performance and stability of an enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) adopting the new catalyst are evaluated. For this purpose, new terephthalaldehyde (TPA) and conventional glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linkers are adopted on a glucose oxidase (GOx), polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotube (CNT)(GOx/PEI/CNT) structure. GOx/PEI/CNT cross-linked by TPA (TPA/[GOx/PEI/CNT]) results in a superior EBC performance and stability to other catalysts. It is attributed to the π bonds conjugated between the aldehyde of TPA and amine of the GOx/PEI molecules. By π conjugation, electrons bonded with carbon and nitrogen are delocalized, promoting the electron transfer and catalytic activity with an excellent EBC performance. The maximum power density (MPD) of an EBC adopting TPA/[GOx/PEI/CNT] (0.66 mW cm-2) is far better than that of the other EBCs (the MPD of EBC adopting GOx/PEI/CNT is 0.40 mW cm-2). Regarding stability, the covalent bonding formed between TPA and GOx/PEI plays a critical role in preventing the denaturation of GOx molecules, leading to an excellent stability. By repeated measurements of the catalytic activity, TPA/[GOx/PEI/CNT] maintains its activity to 92% of its initial value even after five weeks. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - An NAD+-dependent enzymatic sensor with biofuel cell power source system for non-invasive monitoring of lactate in sweat was designed, developed, and tested. The sensor component, based on lactate dehydrogenase, showed linear current response with increasing lactate concentrations with limits of detection from 5 to 100 mM lactate and sensitivity of 0.2 μA.mM-1 in the presence of target analyte. In addition to the sensor patch a power source was also designed, developed and tested. The power source was a biofuel cell designed to oxidize glucose via glucose oxidase. The biofuel cell showed excellent performance, achieving over 80 mA at 0.4 V (16 mW) in a footprint of 3.5 × 3.5 × 0.7 cm. Furthermore, in order to couple the sensor to the power source, system electronic components were designed and fabricated. These consisted of an energy harvester (EH) and a micropotentiostat (MP). The EH was employed for harvesting power provided by the biofuel cell as well as up-converting the voltage to 3.0 V needed for the operation of the MP. The sensor was attached to MP for chronoamperometric detection of lactate. The Sensor Patch System was demonstrated under laboratory conditions. © 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - H2/O2 biofuel cells utilizing hydrogenases and multicopper oxidases as bioelectrocatalysts are clean, sustainable, and environmentally friendly power devices. In this study, we constructed a novel gas diffusion bioelectrode with a sheet of waterproof carbon cloth as the electrode base and optimized the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the electrode for both high gas permeability and high direct electron transfer bioelectrocatalytic activity. The electrode exhibited a large current density of about 10 mA cm-2 in the steady-state for both H2 oxidation and O2 reduction. The biocathode and the bioanode were coupled to construct a gas diffusion H2/O2 biofuel cell. The dual gas diffusion system allowed the separate supply of gaseous substrates (H2 and O2) to the bioanode and biocathode, with consequent suppression of the oxidative inhibition of the hydrogenases. The cell exhibited a maximum power density of 8.4 mW cm-2 at a cell voltage of 0.7 V under quiescent conditions. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of fatty acids has been investigated using different feedstocks for renewable diesel production. Two types of catalysts were studied: Sulfur-free nickel supported on H-Y zeolites, γ-Al2O3 and SiO2, and palladium supported on active carbon as a noble metal catalyst. Preliminary HDO experiments were carried out on these catalysts in a semi-batch reactor at 300 °C in H2 under a total pressure of 30 bar for 6 h with stearic acid as a model for fatty acids. An in-depth comparative study of Ni/H-Y and Pd/C was performed in HDO of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) obtained from the Chlorella microalga, tall oil fatty acids (TOFA) and animal fat. HDO experiments revealed that Ni/H-Y was a better catalyst for this process providing higher activity for different fatty acids. Ni supported on γ-Al2O3 and SiO2 provided complete conversion upon testing in HDO of stearic acid while total HDO over Pd/C was not reached. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A two-step catalytic process for the production of biodiesel from waste frying oil (WFO) at low cost, utilizing waste animal-bone as catalyst and solar radiation as heat source is reported in this work. In the first step, the free fatty acids (FFA) in WFO were esterified with methanol by a catalytic process using calcined waste animal-bone as catalyst, which remains active even after 10 esterification runs. The trans-esterification step was catalyzed by NaOH through thermal activation process. Produced biodiesel fulfills all the international requirements for its utilization as a fuel. A probable reaction mechanism for the esterification process is proposed considering the presence of hydroxyapatite at the surface of calcined animal bones. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A noble-metal free FeCu based bimetallic catalyst system prepared by facile co-impregnation method was found to be highly admirable for vapour phase selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol at ambient pressure. Monometallic Cu/γ-Al2O3, Fe/γ-Al2O3 and bimetallic FeCu/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different Fe loadings were prepared. Structural and morphological features of the catalysts were thoroughly investigated by several physico-chemical characterization techniques. The influence of various reaction parameters, such as Fe loading, reaction temperature and flow of reactants was examined with respect to furfural conversion and furfuryl alcohol yield. The results clearly showed that an optimum amount of Fe is necessary to enhance the catalytic activity of monometallic Cu/γ-Al2O3 for the selective hydrogenation of furfural. The catalyst FC-10 with 10 wt% Fe exhibited excellent activity which led to high furfural conversion (&gt;93%) and furfuryl alcohol selectivity (&gt;98%) under mild reaction conditions. The higher activity of bimetallic FeCu/γ-Al2O3 compared to monometallic Cu/γ-Al2O3 is ascribed to the formation of FeCu bimetallic particles and the existence of oxygen vacancies in the Fe oxide system. The superior activity after Fe loading on the Cu-based catalyst was attributed to the synergy between Cu and Fe. A plausible mechanism is proposed to explain the promoting effect of Fe, which involves synergism between Fe sites with strong oxophilic nature and Cu sites with a high ability for hydrogen activation. Based on the activity results, prolonged catalytic activity and spent catalyst analysis, the developed FeCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is inexpensive, eco-benign and robust, which makes it a promising candidate for the efficient conversion of biomass-derived substrates to fine chemicals and drop-in biofuels. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Zn, Ce or Ni metal was doped on mesoporous rod-like Al2O3 prepared by using cationic surfactant cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) assisted hydrothermal method for in-situ catalytic upgrading of bio-oil derived from the fast pyrolysis of sunflower stalk. The morphology, crystal structure, surface area, reduction behaviour and acidity of the as-prepared catalyst were characterized. Uniform rod-like γ-Al2O3 particles with a surface area as high as 412 m2/g and an average mesopore diameter of 3.51 nm were obtained at a CTAB/Al molar ratio of 0.5 and Zn, Ce or Ni metal was found to be able to homogeneously disperse on it. The catalysts with 2.5 wt.% metal (Zn, Ce or Ni) loading amount exhibited the high catalytic activity and selectivity for upgrading of bio-oil with high content of oxygenated components to aromatic hydrocarbons, especially benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). The total relative maximum hydrocarbon amount of 92% in the upgraded bio-oil was obtained by using 2.5 wt.% Ni/Al2O3. Four-cycle reusability test indicated that the metal-doped microporous rod-like γ-Al2O3 alumina catalysts had long-term stability in their performance. Moreover, the regeneration of spent catalysts (4th reuse) by calcination at 650 °C in air for 30 min recovered their activity perfectly. It is expected that such metal-doped rod-like alumina catalysts can be applied as bio-oil upgrading catalysts in a practical process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Heteroxylans are abundant components of plant cell walls and provide important raw materials for the food, pharmaceutical, and biofuel industries. A number of studies in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have suggested that the IRREGULAR XYLEM9 (IRX9), IRX10, and IRX14 proteins, as well as their homologs, are involved in xylan synthesis via a Golgi-localized complex termed the xylan synthase complex (XSC). However, both the biochemical and cell biological research lags the genetic and molecular evidence. In this study, we characterized garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) stem xylan biosynthesis genes (AoIRX9, AoIRX9L, AoIRX10, AoIRX14A, and AoIRX14B) by heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. We reconstituted and partially purified an active XSC and showed that three proteins, AoIRX9, AoIRX10, and AoIRX14A, are necessary for xylan xylosyltranferase activity in planta. To better understand the XSC structure and its composition, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis to show the molecular interactions between these three IRX proteins. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we showed that the DxD motifs of AoIRX10 and AoIRX14A are crucial for the catalytic activity. These data provide, to our knowledge, the first lines of biochemical and cell biological evidence that AoIRX9, AoIRX10, and AoIRX14A are core components of a Golgi-localized XSC, each with distinct roles for effective heteroxylan biosynthesis. © 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - Bioelectrocatalysis is an expanding research area due to the use of this type of electrocatalysis in electrochemical biosensors, biofuel cells, bioelectrochemical cells, and biosolar cells. This feature article discusses recent advancements in tailoring the biointerface between electrodes and biocatalysts for facile electrocatalysis. This includes the design of pyrene moieties for directing the orientation of biocatalysts on electrode surfaces and mediation as well as the rational design of redox polymers for self-exchange-based electron transport to/from biocatalysts and the electrode and the use of bioscaffolding techniques for designing the bioelectrode structure. However, recent advances in the past decade have shown the importance of hybrid bioelectrocatalytic systems, and future work will be needed to use these same pyrene, redox polymer, and bioscaffolding techniques for hybrid bioelectrocatalysis.

AB  - Oxygenates derived through the selective catalytic refunctionalization of carbohydrates of lignocellulosic biomass can be tailored to exhibit desired physicochemical fuel properties that unlock the full potential of advanced internal combustion engines. Considering the fuel'™s molecular structure to be a design degree of freedom, we present a framework for model-based fuel design that is envisioned to guide experimental investigation toward the most promising molecular entities. Following a generate-and-test approach to computer-aided molecular design, a novel rule-based generator of molecular structures is introduced to refunctionalize and join molecular graphs of predefined biobased intermediates in an attempt to resemble carbon-and energy-efficient biofuel synthesis. Computational property prediction is employed to virtually screen the generated structures with regard to key physicochemical fuel properties, e.g., the derived cetane number or fuel volatility. Two case studies are dedicated to the identification of biofuel components for use in (i) spark-ignition and (ii) compression-ignition engines. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study reports on the use of oil obtained from waste plum stones as a low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production. Because of high free fatty acid (FFA) level (15.8%), the oil was processed through the two-step process including esterification of FFA and methanolysis of the esterified oil catalyzed by H2SO4 and CaO, respectively. Esterification was optimized by response surface methodology combined with a central composite design. The second-order polynomial equation predicted the lowest acid value of 0.53mgKOH/g under the following optimal reaction conditions: the methanol:oil molar ratio of 8.5:1, the catalyst amount of 2% and the reaction temperature of 45°C. The predicted acid value agreed with the experimental acid value (0.47mgKOH/g). The kinetics of FFA esterification was described by the irreversible pseudo first-order reaction rate law. The apparent kinetic constant was correlated with the initial methanol and catalyst concentrations and reaction temperature. The activation energy of the esterification reaction slightly decreased from 13.23 to 11.55kJ/mol with increasing the catalyst concentration from 0.049 to 0.172mol/dm3. In the second step, the esterified oil reacted with methanol (methanol:oil molar ratio of 9:1) in the presence of CaO (5% to the oil mass) at 60°C. The properties of the obtained biodiesel were within the EN 14214 standard limits. Hence, waste plum stones might be valuable raw material for obtaining fatty oil for the use as alternative feedstock in biodiesel production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crude glycerol (byproduct of biodiesel preparation) was utilised as the carbon source to produce lipid using oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides 32489. Under the same conditions, lipid production with crude glycerol was higher than those produced with glucose and pure glycerol. The effects of 4 main impurities in crude glycerol (methyl oleate, sodium oleate, NaCl and methanol) on lipid production were investigated. Compared with utilising pure glycerol, addition of methyl oleate, sodium oleate, and NaCl impurities increased lipid production by 47.0%, 68.0% and 64.0%, respectively, while methanol decreased lipid production by 17.7%. However, when methanol was mixed with other impurities, its inhibition effect was alleviated due to the promoting effect of other impurities. Hence, crude glycerol could be used as a renewable and low-cost carbon source to replace pure glucose or glycerol for lipid preparation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The human dependency on finite fossil fuel has led to its drastic depletion. Along with its detrimental effects on the environment, such practice is now deemed unsustainable. This phenomenon has led to the growth for utilisation of biomass in the production of biofuels, biochemical and other related bioproducts. This waste-to-wealth strategy is no doubt highly beneficial to the society. However, the major challenge in the commercialisation of bioproducts production includes the complex conversion processes and the uncertainty in the supply and sources of biomass. Therefore, efficient supply chain management and optimisation is essential to overcome these barriers and variables that may constrain the development of a competitive and sustainable bioproducts market. This overview provides an extensional definition of biomass-to-bioproducts supply chain and systematically describes the problems and decisions along this chain. It also identifies the characteristics of a sustainable integrated biomass supply chain, and finally presents an overview of biomass supply chain synthesis and optimisation methods. Based on the existing research gap, the key challenges and potential future works are highlighted. This paper will provide readers with an initial point to understand the concept of sustainable biomass supply chain management and the synthesis and optimisation of sustainable biomass supply chain models. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This work investigates the capabilities of the dual-mode reactivity controlled compression ignition/conventional diesel combustion engine operation to cover the full operating range of a EURO VI medium-duty diesel engine with compression ratio of 17.5:1. This concept is based on covering all the engine map switching between the reactivity controlled compression ignition and the conventional diesel combustion operating modes. Specifically, the benefits of reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion are exploited whenever possible according to certain restrictions, while the conventional diesel combustion operation is used to cover the zones of the engine map in which the reactivity controlled compression ignition operation is limited. The experiments were conducted using a single-cylinder research diesel engine derived from the multi-cylinder production engine. In addition, considering the mandatory presence of biofuels in the future context of road transport and the ability of ethanol to be blended with gasoline, the low reactivity fuel used in the study is a blend of 20% ethanol by volume with 80% of 95 octane number gasoline. Moreover, a diesel containing 7% of biodiesel has been used as high reactivity fuel. Firstly, a reactivity controlled compression ignition mapping is performed to check the operational limits of the concept in this engine platform. Later, based on the results, the potential of the dual-mode concept is discussed. Results suggest that, under the constraints imposed, reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion can be utilized between 25% and 35% load. In this region of the map, reactivity controlled compression ignition can provide up to 2% increased gross indicated efficiency than conventional diesel combustion, but led to lower efficiency at low engine speeds. In addition, it was demonstrated that the regeneration periods of the diesel particulate filter during dual-mode operation can be reduced more than twice, which entails a great reduction of the diesel fuel amount injected in the exhaust line. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oils are typically produced by pyrolysis processes. Bio-oils can be used directly in a generator to produce electricity or upgraded to produce transportation fuels. Nowadays the interest is that they come out in a biorefinery context. This paper compares bio-oil production within three possible procedures. Targeting the bio-oil product, in virtual biorefinery #1, microalgae is processed by solvent ultrasound-assisted extraction, and lipids follow transesterification; in virtual biorefinery #2, bio-oil comes out from fresh microalgae pyrolysis, and, finally, in virtual biorefinery #3, lipid extraction leftovers proceed for slow pyrolysis. Solvent ultrasound-assisted extraction and slow pyrolysis are tested and measured experimentally using three microalgae as feedstock: Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis oculata, and Scenedesmus obliquus. These stand-alone processes are analyzed aiming to provide the best option in a virtual biorefinery context. Although very fast/slow pyrolysis produces markedly different products, previous thermogravimetry analysis allowed choosing an adequate pyrolysis temperature. Nevertheless, the influence of temperature, catalyst and nitrogen flow is depicted. The comparison indicators for final remarks relate to final energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Conditions that favor bio-oil production may not be favorable in terms of energy required per mass or energy output. If mass allocation criterion is used lipid extraction followed by slow pyrolysis of the leftovers is advantageous over slow pyrolysis of fresh dry microalgae. Still the fossil energy input largely surpasses the bio-oil energy content. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mediatorless and membraneless enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs) employing new catalytic structure are fabricated. Regarding anodic catalyst, structure consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx), poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and carbon nanotube (CNT) is considered, while three cathodic catalysts consist of glutaraldehyde (GA), laccase (Lac), PEI and CNT that are stacked together in different ways. Catalytic activities of the catalysts for glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions (GOR and ORR) are evaluated. As a result, it is confirmed that the catalysts work well for promotion of GOR and ORR. In EBC tests, performances of EBCs including 150 μm-thick membrane are measured as references, while those of membraneless EBCs are measured depending on parameters like glucose flow rate, glucose concentration, distance between two electrodes and electrolyte pH. With the measurements, how the parameters affect EBC performance and their optimal conditions are determined. Based on that, best maximum power density (MPD) of membraneless EBC is 102 ± 5.1 μW · cm-2 with values of 0.5 cc · min-1 (glucose flow rate), 40 mM (glucose concentration), 1 mm (distance between electrodes) and pH 3. When membrane and membraneless EBCs are compared, MPD of the membraneless EBC that is run at the similar operating condition to EBC including membrane is speculated as about 134 μW · cm-2.

AB  - In this work, Chlorella pyrenoidosa was converted into bio-oil via solvolysis liquefaction in sub/supercritical ethanol-water system. The influence of reaction temperature (220-300 °C), retention time (0-120 min), solid/liquid ratio (6.3/75-50.0/75 g/mL) and ethanol content (0-100%) on bio-oil yield and property was investigated. The increase of reaction temperature and retention time both improved the bio-oil yield. The bio-oil yield increased firstly and then decreased when the solid/liquid ratio and ethanol content exceeded 18.8/75 g/mL and 80%, respectively. As the reaction temperature &lt;260 °C and retention time &lt;30 min, a soft and unsticky product was insoluble in dichloromethane (DCM) during the extraction process. The chemical composition of the DCM-insoluble product was analyzed by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry). The change tendency of O/C and H/C atomic ratio of bio-oil indicated that the addition of ethanol contributed to deoxygenation and hydrogen-donating for bio-oil, due to the dehydration and decarboxylation reaction. 1H NMR (hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance) analysis indicated that the main chemical compositions of bio-oil were aliphatic functional groups and heteroatomic functionalities (80.00-83.58%). The addition of ethanol enhanced the transesterification to form more ester. The NER (net energy ratio, the ratio of energy output to energy consumption) of solvolysis liquefaction in ethanol-water system (NER &lt; 1) was less than that of hydrothermal liquefaction in sole water system (NER = 1.29), but the NERs of 20% and 40% ethanol content (NER = 0.91, 0.70 for 20% and 40% ethanol content) were larger than pyrolysis technology (NER = 0.66). The high bio-oil yield, better bio-oil property and high NER were achieved at reaction temperature of 300 °C, with retention time of 60 min, solid/liquid ratio of 18.8/75 g/mL and ethanol content of 40% (bio-oil yield = 39.75%, HHV (higher heating value) = 39.31 MJ/kg and NER = 0.70). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algal biomass is a promising route to viable second generation biofuels. In this investigation HTL was assessed for the valorisation of algae used in the remediation of acid mine drainage (AMD). Initially the HTL process was evaluated using Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina) with additional metal sulphates to simulate metal remediation. Optimised conditions were then used to process a natural algal community (predominantly Chlamydomonas sp.) cultivated under two scenarios: high uptake and low uptake of metals from AMD. High metal concentrations appear to catalyse the conversion to bio-oil, and do not significantly affect the heteroatom content or higher heating value of the bio-oil produced. The associated metals were found to partition almost exclusively into the solid residue, favourable for potential metal recovery. High metal loadings also caused partitioning of phosphates from the aqueous phase to the solid phase, potentially compromising attempts to recycle process water as a growth supplement. HTL was therefore found to be a suitable method of processing algae used in AMD remediation, producing a crude oil suitable for upgrading into hydrocarbon fuels, an aqueous and gas stream suitable for supplementing the algal growth and the partitioning of most contaminant metals to the solid residue where they would be readily amenable for recovery and/or disposal. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel, as a product of the transesterification reaction of fatty material, is gaining appreciation all over the world and confirms its beneficial effect on the reduction of exhaust gases when (even partly) used to power compression-ignition engines. Although many researchers have focused on biofuel production and its application in combustion engines, continuous development of injection systems, providing new control strategies, encourages the seeking for new ways of optimizing biofuel combustion. In particular, very little attention has been given to the possibility of using biofuels in modern CRDI (Common Rail Direct Injection) engines with divided injection technology. There is also limited information available on engines operating on biodiesel of animal origin and their performance and emissions for such fuels. Because of this gap of knowledge, in the present study, the authors focused on analysing the phenomena of combustion of animal-origin biodiesel mixtures in a CRDI engine. Swine lard methyl esters, obtained in the laboratory by a single-step alkali transesterification process as a biocomponent, and mineral diesel were used to obtain B25, B50, B75 mixtures (25%, 50% and 75% of biocomponent concentration by volume). The physicochemical parameters of B25, B50, B75, pure esters and mineral diesel were examined to determine whether the fuels met quality standards. The mixtures were used to fuel a 2.6 L Andoria CRDI engine placed on a dynamometer test stand. Tests were carried out in steady state operation, at rotational speeds when two different injection strategies occur (single injection and two subsequent injections), also different load conditions were introduced during tests. During the tests, engine performance and exhaust gas emissions were measured and analysed in detail. The study has confirmed the capability of using diesel-biodiesel mixtures containing up to 75% biocomponents in a modern CRDI engine without any operational issues. A minor deterioration of fuel performance parameters with an increasing biodiesel share has been observed. Brake-specific fuel consumption increased on average by 3.2%, 8.5% and 13.8% for B25, B50 and B75, respectively. An average reduction of brake fuel conversion efficiency was observed, amounting to 1.6%, 4.8% and 7.8% for B25, B50 and B75, respectively. Significant reduction of exhaust gas emissions (excluding NOx) and opacity was also observed in all examined operation conditions. Total hydrocarbon concentration was reduced by a maximum of 72% for the B75 mixture for a speed of 1500 RPM and 100 Nm load. The best emission performance was observed for operation conditions when a short pre-injection occurred early in the compression phase, before the main fuel injection. This has proven that advanced injection strategies can be applied to fuel mixtures with high biodiesel share, especially for low engine load conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Demetalization of sewage sludge (SS) by sequential extraction before liquefaction was implemented to produce cleaner bio-char and bio-oil. Demetalization steps 1 and 2 did not cause much organic matter loss on SS, and thus the bio-oil and bio-char yields and the compositions of bio-oils were also not affected significantly. However, the demetalization procedures resulted in the production of cleaner bio-chars and bio-oils. The total concentrations and the acid soluble/exchangeable fraction (F1 fraction, the most toxic heavy metal fraction) of heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, and Cd) in these products were significantly reduced and the environmental risks of these products were also relived considerably compared with those produced from raw SS, respectively. Additionally, these bio-oils had less heavy fractions. Demetalization processes with removal of F1 and F2 fractions of heavy metals would benefit the production of cleaner bio-char and bio-oil by liquefaction of heavy metal abundant biomass like SS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biochar derived from orchid tree leaves is utilised as the fuel of a direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC), with yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as electrolyte and cermet of silver and gadolinium doped ceria (Ag-GDC) as the material of both cathode and anode, operating without any liquid medium or feeding gas. The performance of the DC-SOFC operated on the leaf char is higher than that operated on the best reported carbon fuel for DC-SOFCs, Fe-loaded activated carbon. XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM and EDX are applied to characterize the leaf char. It turns out that the leaf char is with porous structure and there is much Ca along with some K and Mg uniformly distributing in the leaf char. The effects of the naturally existing alkaline earth metal and alkaline metal and their distribution on the performance of the DC-SOFCs operated on the leaf char are analyzed in detail. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - (Chemical Equation Presented) A catalytic-pyrolysis-derived bio-oil, which was characterized by higher H/Ceff ratio and lower oxygen content in comparison to fast-pyrolysis-derived bio-oil, was coprocessed with VGO in a pilot-scale FCC riser. The addition of the bio-oil up to 10 wt % gave nearly equivalent oxygenate content and also similar selectivities of gasoline, bottom oil, and coke compared to those in VGO catalytic cracking alone, suggesting the catalytic-pyrolysis-derived bio-oil was a suitable feedstock for FCC coprocessing. However, the dry gas, including hydrogen and light alkane, was significantly decreased in the coprocessing experiment mainly because of the hydrogen transfer between bio-oil and VGO. Radiocarbon analysis of the product showed that 7% carbon of gasoline was derived from the bio-oil when 10 wt % bio-oil was added to VGO. The coprocessing of biomass catalytic pyrolysis and FCC was highly promising for biomass conversion into biofuel. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A membraneless direct electron transfer (DET)-type dihydrogen (H2)/air-breathing biofuel cell without any mediator was constructed wherein bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria (BOD) and membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F (MBH) were used as biocatalysts for the cathode and the anode, respectively, and Ketjen black-modified water proof carbon paper (KB/WPCC) was used as an electrode material. The KB/WPCC surface was modified with 2-aminobenzoic acid and p-phenylenediamine, respectively, to face the positively charged electron-accepting site of BOD and the negatively charged electron-donating site of MBH to the electrode surface. A gas-diffusion system was employed for the electrodes to realize high-speed substrate supply. As result, great improvement in the current density of O2 reduction with BOD and H2 reduction with MBH were realized at negatively and postively charged surfaces, respectively. Gas diffusion system also suppressed the oxidative inactivation of MBH at high electrode potentials. Finally, based on the improved bioanode and biocathode, a dual gas-diffusion membrane- and mediatorless H2/air-breathing biofuel cell was constructed. The maximum power density reached 6.1 mW cm−2 (at 0.72 V), and the open circuit voltage was 1.12 V using 1 atm of H2 gas as a fuel at room temperature and under passive and quiescent conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study evaluated anaerobic co-digestion of poultry dropping and pawpaw peels and the optimization of important process parameters. The physic-chemical analyses of the substrates were done using standard methods after application of mechanical, thermal and chemical pre-treatments methods. Gas chromatography analysis revealed the gas composition to be within the range of 66-68% methane and 18-23% carbon dioxide. The study equally revealed that combination of the different pre-treatment methods enhanced enormous biogas yield from the digestion. Optimization of the generated biogas data were carried out using the Response Surface Methodology and the Artificial Neural Networks. The coefficient of determination (R2) for RSM (0.9181) was lower compare to that of ANN (0.9828). This shows that ANN model gives higher accuracy than RSM model for the current. Further usage of Carica papaya peels for biogas generation is advocated. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - We recently introduced catalytic upstream biorefining, a fractionation process performed on whole lignocellulosic materials, based on the early-stage conversion of lignin by hydrogen-transfer reactions (using Raney Ni as the catalyst and 2-PrOH as a hydrogen-donor). The process fractionates lignocellulose, isolating lignin as an extensively depolymerised oil, opening up new avenues in the catalytic upgrading of bio-derived phenolic streams to chemicals and fuels. In addition, highly delignified holocellulose pulps are obtained, holding potential as a feedstock for the production of paper, chemicals, and biofuels. Herein, we report our first results on the chemistry underlying this process under nearly neutral to slightly alkaline conditions achieved by the addition of inorganic bases. This report sheds light on the influence of hemicellulose sugars on the product distribution obtained from the early-stage catalytic conversion of lignin oligomers released from lignocellulose. The increase in the pH value of the medium suppressed the hydrolysis of xylans. As a result, a dramatic increase in the xylans retention from 10 % (at pH 4.5) up to 60 % (at pH>7.5) was achieved. Interestingly, the pH value of the liquor did not affect the delignification extent of lignocellulose or the absolute content of glucans retained in the holocellulose. By enhancing xylans retention, we provide evidence that hemicellulose sugars decrease the activity of Raney Ni towards full hydrogenation of the aromatic species composing the lignin stream. In fact, the yield of selected cyclohexanols increases from 0.8 % (no added bases) to 4.4 % (added NaOH), whereas the yield of selected phenols decreases from 12.9 % (no added bases) to 7.2 % (added NaOH). © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This study investigates the design of mild base catalysts for the deoxygenation of bio-oil via aldol condensation paths. The first part rationalizes the active, selective, and stable performance of supported MgO catalysts in the vapor phase condensation of propanal, which is maximized upon the mechanochemical activation of a siliceous USY zeolite (Si/Al=405) with 1wt.% Mg(OH)2. Infrared spectroscopic studies of the interaction with CO and CO2, reveal that the presence of 4-coordinate Mg likely localized in framework defects on the zeolite surface, and the avoidance of MgO formation are key to moderating the basicity with respect to the bulk oxide. The second part compares the best-performing MgO/USY catalyst with the most promising previously reported catalysts: K-grafted USY and Ca-hydroxyapatite. A detailed kinetic analysis of the conversion of individual bio-oil constituents (propanal or acetic acid) and binary mixtures thereof (propanal with acetic acid, methanol, or water) provides insights into the reaction network, rate-limiting steps, and relative surface coverage of reactants and products over each catalyst. This enables the anticipation of the aldol-condensation performance in simulated and real bio-oil mixtures. A significant inhibitory effect is observed in the presence of acetic acid, but the K-grafted USY zeolite is found to preserve its stability and retain the highest activity due to the weaker adsorption of acidic compounds. The presence of water has no pronounced effect on the observed reaction rates, while methanol is found to selectively poison Ca-hydroxyapatite due to the competitive adsorption on the active sites. The attained results under real bio-oil conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of this simplified approach to bridge the complexity gap between the study of model compounds and real bio-oil. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The influence of the extraction solvents on the yields of the product fractions and on the composition of the bio-oils obtained from the hydrothermal processing of duckweed at 350 °C for 30 min was investigated. Ten solvents were employed including polar solvents (isopropanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, dichloroethane, benzene, carbon disulfide) and nonpolar solvents (cyclohexane, n-hexane and petroleum ether). The extraction solvents with high relative polarity values tended to produce higher yields of the bio-oils. The highest bio-oil yield of 26 ± 1 wt.% was obtained using isopropanol, followed by dichloromethane (24 ± 1 wt.%). Nonpolar solvents including cyclohexane, n-hexane, and petroleum ether produced the yields of the bio-oils ranging from 3 ± 0.2 to 9 ± 0.4 wt.%. The bio-oils always had a significantly higher C and H contents and a substantially lower O and S contents than those of the biomass material. The C and H contents of the bio-oil from nonpolar solvents, which averaged 78 ± 0.8 wt.% and 10 ± 0.5 wt.%, respectively, were slightly higher than the values from the polar solvents, which averaged 75 wt.% and 9 wt.%, respectively. In contrast, the N and O contents of the bio-oils from nonpolar solvents was lower than that from the polar solvents. The energy recovery (ER) obtained from the polar solvents varied from 42 ± 2 to 60 ± 3%, which is much higher than the ER obtained from the nonpolar solvent (24 ± 1% for cyclohexane) and lowest (10 ± 0.5% for n-hexane). Significant differences in molecular composition were observed in the bio-oils when varying the solvent, and these differences were attributed to the combined effects of the polarity and the molecular structure of each solvent. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nanosized TiO2 catalyst was successfully prepared by a simple green procedure and used in liquid phase aldol condensation of furfural with acetone, a key step in bio-fuel processing. In order to determine the effect of calcination temperature on catalytic properties of TiO2, the as-prepared TiO2 and calcined TiO2 (150–900 °C) were studied by XRD, BET, TPD-CO2/NH3, TGA/DTG and FTIR evaluation. The catalytic performance of TiO2 samples in aldol condensation of furfural with acetone was evaluated and compared with that of Mg–Al hydrotalcites and a BEA zeolite. These experiments showed that uncalcined TiO2 possessed reasonable activity in aldol condensation of furfural to acetone and resulted in commonly produced condensation products. The observed catalytic behavior of TiO2 could be competitive with that reported for other inorganic solids. The calcination of TiO2 resulted, however, in a decrease in its catalytic activity due to extensive dehydration and surface dehydroxylation as well as due to changes of textural properties resulting in a decrease in the amount of accessible active sites. Thanks to its advanced properties, nanosized TiO2 is a promising catalyst for aldol condensation of furfural with acetone and could broaden possibilities for optimizing conditions for bio-fuel production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nickel oxide-decorated graphene nanosheet (NiO/GNS), as a novel non-enzymatic electrocatalyst for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal route followed by the heat treatment. The successful synthesis of NiO/GNS was characterized by a series of techniques including XRD, BET, SEM and TEM. Significantly, the NiO/GNS catalyst show excellent catalytic activity toward GOR, and was employed to develop a sensitive non-enzymatic glucose sensor. The developed glucose sensor could response to glucose in a wide range from 5 μM-4.2 mM with a low detection limit (LOD) of 5.0 μM (S/N = 3). Importantly, compared with bare NiO, the catalytic activity of NiO/GNS was much higher. The reason might be that the 2D structure of graphene could prevent the aggregation of NiO and facilitate the electron transfer at electrode interface. Moreover, the outstanding catalytic activity of NiO/GNS was further demonstrated by applying it to construct a biofuel cell using glucose as fuel, which exhibited high stability and current density. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The conversion of biomass for the production of liquid fuels can help reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are predominantly generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. Oxymethylene ethers (OMEs) are a series of liquid fuel additives that can be obtained from syngas, which is produced from the gasification of biomass. The blending of OMEs in conventional diesel fuel can reduce soot formation during combustion in a diesel engine. In this research, a process for the production of OMEs from woody biomass has been simulated. The process consists of several unit operations including biomass gasification, syngas cleanup, methanol production, and conversion of methanol to OMEs. The methodology involved the development of process models, the identification of the key process parameters affecting OME production based on the process model, and the development of an optimal process design for high OME yields. It was found that up to 9.02 tonnes day-1 of OME3, OME4, and OME5 (which are suitable as diesel additives) can be produced from 277.3 tonnes day-1 of wet woody biomass. Furthermore, an optimal combination of the parameters, which was generated from the developed model, can greatly enhance OME production and thermodynamic efficiency. This model can further be used in a techno-economic assessment of the whole biomass conversion chain to produce OMEs. The results of this study can be helpful for petroleum-based fuel producers and policy makers in determining the most attractive pathways of converting bio-resources into liquid fuels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel was synthesized from waste frying oil (WFO) using β-potassium dizirconate (β-K2Zr2O5) as a novel heterogeneous catalyst. Synthesized catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), particle size analyser, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET surface area and basicity. Various reaction conditions such as molar ratio of methanol: oil, catalyst amount (wt%), reaction temperature, time and reusability of catalyst were studied for transesterification reaction with the catalyst, β-K2Zr2O5. High biodiesel conversion of 96.85% was observed at a 10:1 M ratio (alcohol: oil), 4 wt% catalyst at 65 °C for 2 h. WFO was characterized by GCMS and biodiesel conversion was ascertained by Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C FTNMR) spectroscopy. It was first time that β-potassium dizirconate was used as a catalyst for biodiesel synthesis. The catalyst was reused up to five times without significant loss in its activity. Physical and chemical properties of FAME such as flash point, fire point, cloud point, density, and kinematic viscosity were deliberated. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - New enzymatic catalysts prepared using physical entrapment and chemical bonding were used as anodic catalysts to enhance the performance of enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs). For estimating the physical entrapment effect, the best glucose oxidase (GOx) concentration immobilized on polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotube (CNT) (GOx/PEI/CNT) was determined, while for inspecting the chemical bonding effect, terephthalaldehyde (TPA) and glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinkers were employed. According to the enzyme activity and XPS measurements, when the GOx concentration is 4 mg mL-1, they are most effectively immobilized (via the physical entrapment effect) and TPA-crosslinked GOx/PEI/CNT(TPA/[GOx/PEI/CNT]) forms π conjugated bonds via chemical bonding, inducing the promotion of electron transfer by delocalization of electrons. Due to the optimized GOx concentration and π conjugated bonds, TPA/[GOx/PEI/CNT], including 4 mg mL-1 GOx displays a high electron transfer rate, followed by excellent catalytic activity and EBC performance. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This article showcases a proof-of-concept in the production of high quality renewable biofuel from algae. Here, we introduce a path combining a number of approaches that, when integrated as a whole, create a process that takes algae grown in waste-water through to a liquid fuel containing fractions ready for blending with regular gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. With the overarching goal of reducing the nitrogen content invariably associated with whole algal biomass, we apply a number of approaches including (i) nutrient starvation to reduce the internal nitrogen of the freshwater alga Oedogonium (ii) continuous co-solvent (10 wt% n-heptane) hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to produce a non-polar biocrude containing &lt;1 wt% N; (iii) blending the biocrude with green feed produced from the hydrogenation of CO2 to obtain &lt;0.5 wt% N; (iv) hydrogenation and hydro-isomerization of the blend in two stages over nanodisperse silica-supported Ni2P (achieving 630 ppm N) and acidic zeolite-supported Pt catalysts respectively to produce a synthetic paraffinic mixture (SPM) containing 277 ppm N and 0.12% O. With the incorporation of renewable H2 (which can be from gasification of polar organics produced in the solvent HTL, or other renewable sources) and captured CO2 the process demonstrates a new and technically cohesive approach to the production of renewable, high-quality biofuels for demanding transport applications. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The present work focuses on the pathways through which catalytic pyrolysis of biomass into bio-oil proceeds and the effect of the operation conditions on parameters like bio-oil oxygen composition and mass yield, and also additional indicators, such as the distribution of both the oxygen and the chemical energy contained in the initial biomass among the different products. Acid washed wheat straw was used as biomass feedstock. The pyrolysis tests were performed in a lab-scale downdraft fixed-bed reactor working at atmospheric pressure, employing a nanocrystalline H-ZSM-5 zeolite as catalyst. A systematic study was carried out by decoupling both the thermal and catalytic reactions in order to evaluate the influence of three key variables: temperature of the thermal zone; temperature of the subsequent catalytic step and catalyst/biomass ratio. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature in the thermal zone resulted in more bio-oil∗ (bio-oil in water-free basis) production to the detriment of char and water fractions. In contrast, a significant reduction in bio-oil∗ fraction, due to decarbonylation and decarboxylation, occurred when increasing the catalytic bed temperature from 400 up to 500 °C. A similar effect was observed by varying the catalyst/biomass ratio since it increased the production of CO, CO2, light olefins and coke at the expense of a decline in the bio-oil∗ yield. Nevertheless, this bio-oil contains oxygen amounting to as low as 10 wt%, while retaining about 38% of the energy yield. Char, coke and gaseous hydrocarbons contain a great part of the biomass chemical energy, hence their formation should be suppressed or minimized to further improve the bio-oil∗ energy yield. At high catalyst/biomass ratios, the bio-oil becomes rich in aromatic compounds, both oxygenated and hydrocarbons, while the amount of sugars, furans, carboxylic acids, and other oxygenated products is strongly reduced. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - A novel magnesia-stabilized carbide slag (MSCS) was synthesized with carbide slag, magnesium nitrate hydrate and by-product of biodiesel by combustion, which was used as a CO2 sorbent during the calcium looping process. The effects of preparation condition (combustion temperature, combustion duration, by-product of biodiesel addition and magnesia addition) and CO2 capture condition (carbonation and calcination atmosphere) on CO2 capture capacity of MSCS were investigated during the calcium looping cycles. The main compositions of MSCS are CaO and MgO. The addition of by-product of biodiesel in the preparation of the sorbent leads to the uniform mix of MgO and CaO grains in MSCS, which shows an obviously positive effect on its CO2 capture capacity. Only on the condition of the addition of by-product of biodiesel, MgO derived from magnesium nitrate hydrate improves the cyclic CO2 capture capacity and durability of MSCS during the multiple cycles. MSCS with a mass ratio of CaO to MgO of 80:20 combusted at 850 °C for 60 min exhibits higher CO2 capture capacity and greater durability. The CO2 capture capacity of MSCS can retain 0.42 g/g after 20 cycles, which is 60% higher than that of carbide slag. MSCS calcined under the high concentration of steam displays much higher CO2 capture capacity and better sintering resistance during the cycles, compared to MSCS calcined under the high concentration of CO2. The addition of steam in the carbonation enhances CO2 capture capacities of MSCS and carbide slag. MSCS consists of CaO-MgO grain groups and the support of MgO sustains the high sintering resistance of the sorbent. MSCS remains much larger surface area and pore volume than carbide slag during the cycles, compared to carbide slag. MSCS appears promising as an effective and low-cost CO2 sorbent during the calcium looping. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Microbial consortia represent promising candidates for aiding in the development of plant biomass conversion strategies for biofuel production. However, the interaction between different community members and the dynamics of enzyme complements during the lignocellulose deconstruction process remain poorly understood. We present here a comprehensive study on the community structure and enzyme systems of a lignocellulolytic microbial consortium EMSD5 during growth on corn stover, using metagenome sequencing in combination with quantitative metaproteomics. Results: The taxonomic affiliation of the metagenomic data showed that EMSD5 was primarily composed of members from the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) annotation revealed that representatives of Firmicutes encoded a broad array of enzymes responsible for hemicellulose and cellulose deconstruction. Extracellular metaproteome analysis further pinpointed the specific role and synergistic interaction of Firmicutes populations in plant polysaccharide breakdown. In particular, a wide range of xylan degradation-related enzymes, including xylanases, β-xylosidases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases, α-glucuronidases and acetyl xylan esterases, were secreted by diverse members from Firmicutes during growth on corn stover. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we identified the differential secretion pattern of a core subset of enzymes, including xylanases and cellulases with multiple carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). In addition, analysis of the coordinate expression patterns indicated that transport proteins and hypothetical proteins may play a role in bacteria processing lignocellulose. Moreover, enzyme preparation from EMSD5 demonstrated synergistic activities in the hydrolysis of pretreated corn stover by commercial cellulases from Trichoderma reesei. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the corn stover-adapted microbial consortium EMSD5 harbors a variety of lignocellulolytic anaerobic bacteria and degradative enzymes, especially those implicated in hemicellulose decomposition. The data in this study highlight the pivotal role and cooperative relationship of Firmicutes members in the biodegradation of plant lignocellulose by EMSD5. The differential expression patterns of enzymes reveal the strategy of sequential lignocellulose deconstruction by EMSD5. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism by which consortium members orchestrate their array of enzymes to degrade complex lignocellulosic biomass. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Catalpa sawdust, a promising biofuel production biomass, was pretreated by microwave-water, -NaOH, and -Ca(OH)2 to enhance enzymatic digestibility. After 48 h enzymatic hydrolysis, microwave-Ca(OH)2 pretreated sample showed the highest reducing sugar yield. The content of hemicellulose and lignin in catalpa sawdust decreased after microwave-alkali pretreatment. SEM observation showed that the catalpa sawdust surface with microwave-Ca(OH)2 pretreatment suffered the most serious erosion. Crystallinity index of catalpa sawdust increased after all three kinds of pretreatment. The optimum conditions of microwave-Ca(OH)2 pretreatment were particle size of 40 mesh, Ca(OH)2 dosage of 2.25% (w/v), microwave power of 400 W, pretreatment time of 6 min, enzyme loading of 175 FPU/g, and hydrolysis time of 96 h, and the reducing sugar yield of microwave-Ca(OH)2 pretreated catalpa sawdust reached 402.73 mg/g, which increased by 682.15% compared with that of raw catalpa sawdust. The catalpa sawdust with microwave-Ca(OH)2 pretreatment is promising for biofuel production with great potential. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, feasibility of biodiesel production from freeze dried sewage sludge was studied and its yield was enhanced by optimization of the in situ transesterification conditions (temperature, catalyst and concentration of sludge solids). Optimized conditions (45 °C, 5% catalyst and 0.16 g/mL sludge solids) resulted in a 20.76 ± 0.04% biodiesel yield. The purity of biodiesel was ascertained by GC-MS, FT-IR and NMR (1H and 13C) spectroscopy. The biodiesel profile obtained revealed the predominance of methyl esters of fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, myristic, stearic, lauric, palmitoleic and linoleic acids indicating potential use of sludge as a biodiesel feedstock. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The synthesis of biodiesel from crude castor oil in a catalyst-free process using supercritical methanol in a batch reactor was investigated, studying the evolution of intermediate products as well as the conversion of triglycerides and the yield of FAMEs (fatty acid methyl esters) (biodiesel). Experiments were carried out in a temperature range of 250-350 °C (10-43 MPa) at reaction times of 15-90 min for a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 43:1. Maintaining thermal stability of biodiesel is one of the most important concerns in high-yield supercritical biodiesel production. Hence, thermal decomposition degree of FAMEs was also investigated in different reaction conditions. The maximum yield of FAMEs (96.5%) was obtained at 300 °C (21 MPa) and 90 min. Under these conditions, the conversion of triglycerides was complete, the yield of intermediate products was low (3.29 and 1.41% for monoglycerides and diglycerides, respectively), and thermal decomposition of FAMEs did not occur. The maximum degree of thermal decomposition (80.9%) was produced at 350 °C (43 MPa) and 90 min. Methyl ricinoleate, whose fatty acid chain was the most abundant (88.09 mol%) in castor oil, was very unstable above 300 °C and 60 min, leading to low yields of FAMEs under these conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Valerate esters as a new class of cellulosic transportation fuels showed great industrial prospect. Here we developed a non-noble Ni/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst with excellent stability for the cascade transformation of levulinic acid to valerate esters. The acidity-regulation of Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst by potassium addition decreased the strong acidity, meanwhile tuned the proportion of Brönsted acidity/Lewis acidity. Coke analysis indicated that acidity-regulation by potassium addition changed the heavier coke component (alkylated poly-aromatics) to the lighter one (alkylated mono-aromatics), thus effectively prolonged the lifetime of Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst in fixed-bed reactor. The relationship of the nature of coke deposits and the acidity-regulation of catalysts could contribute to intensively understand the catalyst deactivation and the choice of stable catalyst for upgrading of biomass and its platform molecules. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Upgrading pyrolysis oil by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a promising route for the production of advanced biofuels. The proper reaction conditions and catalysts are important for the success of this process. Previously our research group investigated the ratio of Zn and Pd on the synergistic effect for HDO bio-oil upgrading. This present research focuses on determining the optimal reaction conditions for HDO conversion of pyrolysis oil produced from pine sawdust. Temperatures of 150, 200 and 250 °C and hydrogen pressures of 1.38, 2.76 and 4.14 MPa were evaluated. Syngas, liquids and coke were the primary products evaluated. Syngas was characterized using a Gas chromatography (GC). The liquids were characterized using a Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Increasing reaction temperature resulted in increased coke yields. Treatment at 250 °C and 1.38 MPa resulted in the highest hydrocarbon content (6.06%). The treatment at 200 °C and 1.38 MPa produced the largest amounts of hydrocarbons in C6-C12 range (5.07%). The physicochemical characterizations further support the GCMS results. Syngas analysis revealed that higher hydrogen pressure leads to increased hydrogen consumption and results in more oxy-compounds conversion to hydrocarbons. The syngas analysis also supports the liquid analysis result. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Drop-in fuels have attracted great interest for automotive and aeronautical use. In this work, bio-hydrocarbons were obtained from palm kernel oil (palmist oil) within the distillation range of diesel and jet fuel. Green fuels were produced through the hydrodeoxygenation of palmist fat and its hydrolyzed product by using Pd/C as a catalyst. The process is efficient for hydrodeoxygenation with conversions of up to 96% after 5 h of reaction, at 10 bar of H2 pressure and 300°C, which are mild conditions compared with the majority of the processes described in the literature. The hydroprocessing products were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The freezing temperatures of the biofuels were determined by DSC. Up to 5% deoxygenation products can be used in commercial jet fuel without compromising the cold fuel properties. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing consumption of fossil fuels has led to the development of alternative fuels for the future. Domestic biofuel production and the utilization of alternative fuels can decrease dependency on petroleum oil, reduce trade deficits, reduce air pollution and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Bioethanol is a renewable fuel produced by the fermentation of sugar which is derived from plants such as sugarcane or beet, maize, or cassava etc. However, bioethanol consumption in an engine is approximately 51% higher than gasoline since the energy per unit volume of ethanol is 34% lower than for gasoline. Bioethanol is an oxygenated fuel that contains 35% oxygen, which can reduce particulate matter and NOx emissions caused by combustion of the fuel. Therefore, bioethanol-gasoline blends can significantly reduce petroleum use and GHG emission. In addition, utilization of lignocellulosic materials in bioethanol production is the most viable pathway from an environmental point of view. This paper reviews the current status and technologies involved in bioethanol production and the properties and engine performance from various biomass feedstocks which are the recommended sustainable alternative fuel in the future. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - This study was aimed at hybrid nanocatalysts to reduce emissions of a diesel engine fueled with nanocatalyst biodiesel blends. Biodiesel was produced from Prosopis juliflora oil by the transesterification process. The nanocatalyst having cerium oxide on multiwall carbon a nanotube was investigated using biodiesel blends at two concentrations (50 and 100 ppm).The results revealed that the high surface area of the nanoparticles and their proper distribution along with catalytic oxidation reaction resulted in significant overall reductions in the emission. More specifically, all pollutants, i.e., CO, HC, and NOx, and smoke opacity were reduced when compared to B20. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Diesel engine emissions consist of several harmful gaseous species, some of which are regulated by stringent emission norms, while many others are not. These unregulated emission species are responsible for adverse environmental impact and serious health hazards upon prolonged exposure. In this study, a four-cylinder, 1.4 l, compression ignition (CI) engine was used for characterization of unregulated gaseous exhaust emissions measured at 2500 rpm at varying engine loads (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%). The test fuels investigated were Karanja biodiesel blended with diesel (KB5, KB20), methanol blended with diesel (M5) and baseline mineral diesel. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) emission analyzer was used to measure unregulated emission species and raw exhaust gas emission analyzer was used to measure regulated emission species in exhaust. Results show an increasing trend for some of the unregulated species from blends of biodiesel such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, ethanol, n-butane however methane reduced upon using these oxygenated fuel blends except methanol, compared to baseline mineral diesel. Nevertheless, no significant changes were observed for sulfur dioxide, iso-butane, n-octane, n-pentane, formic acid, benzene, acetylene and ethylene upon using biodiesel and methanol blends. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diesel engines do not have the luxury of a thoroughly premixed charge like gasoline engines. Fossil-diesel auto-ignites quickly after its injection, resulting in high smoke and NOx emissions due to heterogeneous fuel/air distribution and high combustion temperatures. Injection timing modification and exhaust gas re-circulation can provide ample duration for air and fuel to pre-mix 'inside' the cylinder and burn under low temperatures which reduces harmful NOx/smoke in a diesel engine simultaneously. This study proposes the use of three advanced biofuels with a low cetane number, viz. dimethyl carbonate (DMC), iso-butanol and n-pentanol with blend-ratios of 15, 38 and 45 vol% in diesel, respectively (that corresponds to a uniform oxygen-content of 8%) in a single-cylinder DI diesel engine. The engine characteristics were investigated under high loads@1500 rpm by controlling the charge dilution and combustion phasing using moderate EGR rates and start of injection (SOI) modification. The blends presented large amounts of premixed combustion that resulted in high in-cylinder pressures and heat release rates. Results indicated that NOx and smoke could be simultaneously reduced using the combination of the proposed advanced biofuel/diesel blends, late injection and moderate EGR rates. However, there is an increase in HC and CO emissions at all test conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study explores the integrated approach for the sustainable production of biodiesel from Chlorella vulgaris microalgae. The microalgae were cultivated in 10 m2 open raceway pond at semi-continuous mode with optimum volumetric and areal production of 28.105 kg/L/y and 71.51 t/h/y, respectively. Alum was used as flocculent for harvesting the microalgae and optimized at different pH. Lipid was extracted using chloroform: methanol (2:1) and having 12.39% of FFA. Effect of various reaction conditions such as effect of catalyst, methanol:lipid ratio, reaction temperature and time on biodiesel yields were studied under microwave irradiation; and 84.01% of biodiesel yield was obtained under optimized reaction conditions. A comparison was also made between the biodiesel productions under conventional heating and microwave irradiation. The synthesized biodiesel was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FTIR and GC; however, fuel properties of biodiesel were also studied using specified test methods as per ASTM and EN standards. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The catalytic cracking of a blend of raw bio-oil (20 wt %) from black poplar sawdust fast pyrolysis and vacuum gasoil (VGO, 80 wt %) has been studied. The runs have been performed in a riser simulator reactor (RSR) under fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) conditions; that is, 500-560 °C, catalyst to feed mass ratio of 6 gcat (gfeed)-1 on a dry basis, reaction times of 3-10 s and a equilibrated commercial FCC catalyst. The cofeeding effect has been quantified by comparing the yields of product lumps and individual components in the gaseous fraction and gasoline lump in the cracking of VGO, raw bio-oil, and their blend (20% bio-oil/80% VGO), at the same conversion values (60-70 wt %). The cofeeding has a favorable synergy because it promotes the formation of C3-C4 and gasoline (C5-C12) hydrocarbon lumps, attenuating the formation of CO2, CO, and also coke formation. In the cracking of the blend (80% VGO/20% bio-oil) at 70 wt % conversion, a deoxygenation degree of 95 wt % has been obtained, with a total liquid fuel yield of 52.8 wt % and a gasoline yield of 31.6 wt %, with a low oxygenate fraction (&lt;4 wt %) containing carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, and phenols. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Gasoline and diesel as fossil fuels are widely used in industry and agricultural field, and have different performance, combustion and vibration characteristics in the internal-combustion engines. Added biofuels to fossil fuels effect on the mentioned characteristics. Ethanol is considered as a renewable fuel in different countries, which is produced from plant, sugary and starchy biomass. Ethanol as an important additive to gasoline and diesel fuel can improve the engine performance and reduce emissions. In this study, the ethanol was added to pure diesel fuel with concentrations of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12%. The produced torque and power, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), combustion, and vibration levels were evaluated. For this, a six cylinders CI engine in the five rotational speeds of 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, and 2000 rpm was used under full load mode. The results showed that the torque and power increase on average by 3.8% at fuel blend with concentration of 6% ethanol (D94E6) as compared with those of pure diesel fuel. For this fuel, the RMS and kurtosis of vibration on the engine block enhance 4.75% and 7.75% as compared with pure diesel, respectively, that shows the more shocks is created. The RMS value is more dependent on engine speed, while kurtosis value is more sensitive to the fuel blend. Despite the increase in power for the D94E6 fuel blend, some irregularity is observed in engine performance, and engine works more non-uniform. It seems that with increasing the ethanol concentration more than 8% in diesel fuel, ignition delay rises and engine operates irregularity. In other words, the pressure changes are increased inside the cylinders and knocking is occurred. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Efficient pretreatment is essential for economic conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into monosaccharides for biofuel production. To realize high sugar yields with low inhibitor concentrations, hot water or dilute acid pretreatment followed by disk milling is proposed. Corn stover at 20% solids was pretreated with hot water at 160-200 °C for 4-8 min with and without subsequent milling. Hot water pretreatment and disk milling acted synergistically to improve glucose and xylose yields by 89% and 134%, respectively, compared to hot water pretreatment alone. Hot water pretreated (180 °C for 4 min) and milled samples had the highest glucose and xylose yields among all hot water pretreated and milled samples, which were comparable to samples pretreated with 0.55% dilute acid at 160 °C for 4 min. However, samples pretreated with 1% dilute acid at 150 °C for 4 min and disk milled had the highest observed glucose (87.3%) and xylose yields (83.4%). © 2016 .

AB  - Treatment of sewage sludge is a major environmental concern for society. One treatment option that converts wastes into valuable biofuels is pyrolysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of heating rates (10, 40, 70, and 100 °C/min) on the thermal behavior and biofuel properties of sewage sludge pyrolysis from room temperature to 1000 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated three main reaction zones in respective temperature ranges of &lt;180, 180-600, and &gt;600 °C for the sewage sludge pyrolysis. The most intense mass loss rate took place at 210-600 °C, with a maximum value of 0.2 wt %/°C at around 330 °C. Increasing the heating rate resulted in shifting of the mass loss peaks to higher temperatures. Computer-aided thermal analysis was applied to identify the specific heat and reaction heats of sludge during heating. The endothermic reaction peaks at 150-300 °C and exothermic peaks at 500-600 °C shifted to higher temperatures when increasing the heating rate. Gas chromatography results showed that CO2 was the primary biogas species evolved in the low-temperature range (&lt;600-700 °C), while CO dominated in the high range (700-1000 °C). Generally, the peak values of evolution rates of CO2 and CO increased at higher heating rates. Fourier transform infrared results showed that functional groups in the raw sewage sludge with wavenumbers above 1200 cm-1 disappeared or reduced after the sludge was subjected to pyrolysis. The investigated heating rate did not have obvious effects on the functional groups in the pyrolysis biochars. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was also conducted to identify the changing trend of compound contents of produced bio-oils obtained at investigated heating rates. Understanding the thermochemical behavior and biofuel properties of sewage sludge pyrolysis at different heating rates in this work will facilitate more elaborate control of sewage sludge pyrolysis to produce biofuels. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Branched C5 alcohols are promising biofuels with favorable combustion properties. A mevalonate (MVA)-based isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway for C5 alcohols was constructed in Escherichia coli using genes from several organisms, and the pathway was optimized to achieve over 50% theoretical yield. Although the MVA pathway is energetically less efficient than the native methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, implementing the MVA pathway in bacterial hosts such as E. coli is advantageous due to its lack of endogenous regulation. The MVA and MEP pathways intersect at isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), the direct precursor to isoprenoid-derived C5 alcohols and initial precursor to longer chain terpenes, which makes independent regulation of the pathways difficult. In pursuit of the complete "decoupling" of the MVA pathway from native cellular regulation, we designed novel IPP-bypass MVA pathways for C5 alcohol production by utilizing promiscuous activities of two enzymes, phosphomevalonate decarboxylase (PMD) and an E. coli-endogenous phosphatase (AphA). These bypass pathways have reduced energetic requirements, are further decoupled from intrinsic regulation, and are free from IPP-related toxicity. In addition to these benefits, we demonstrate that reduced aeration rate has less impact on the bypass pathway than the original MVA pathway. Finally, we showed that performance of the bypass pathway was primarily determined by the activity of PMD. We designed PMD mutants with improved activity and demonstrated titer increases in the mutant strains. These modified pathways would be a good platform for industrial production of isopentenol and related chemicals such as isoprene. © 2015 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

AB  - The pyrolysis of three representative sources of biomass, namely, white ash, switchgrass and corn stover were investigated using a fixed-bed reactor to observe and compare the characterizations of three energy carriers, biochar, syngas and bio-oil. The characteristics of biochar were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).The results showed that the carbon content of biochar increased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. More than 52 wt.% of the carbon was captured in the biochar. The infrared spectra of char samples illustrated that various bands in the spectra were identified, corresponding to stretches -NH-, aliphatic stretches -CH-, stretches conjugate -C=C-, -CH3 and stretches -C-O-. The surface morphology of biomass sample changed after pyrolysis and carbon fiber can be formed at the temperature of 500°C. The content of combustible gas CH4, H2 and CO was changed from 50% to 70%. The GC-MS analysis of bio-oil showed that most of the chemical compounds detected were phenolic ones. This study provides a useful reference for energy carriers from the pyrolysis of biomass. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two-phasic anaerobic digestion processes (hydrolysis/acidogenesis separated from acetogenesis/methanogenesis) can be used for biogas production on demand or a combined chemicals/bioenergy production. For an effective process control, detailed knowledge about the microbial catalysts and their correlation to process conditions is crucial. In this study, maize silage was digested in a two-phase process and interrelationships between process parameters and microbial communities were revealed. In the first-phase reactor, alternating metabolic periods were observed which emerged independently from the feeding frequency. During the L-period, up to 11.8 g L-1 lactic acid was produced which significantly correlated to lactic acid bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus as the most abundant community members. During the alternating G-period, the production of volatile fatty acids (up to 5.3, 4.0 and 3.1 g L−1 for propionic, n-butyric and n-caproic acid, respectively) dominated accompanied by a high gas production containing up to 28 % hydrogen. The relative abundance of various Clostridiales increased during this metabolic period. In the second-phase reactor, the metabolic fluctuations of the first phase were smoothed out resulting in a stable biogas production as well as stable bacterial and methanogenic communities. However, the biogas composition followed the metabolic dynamics of the first phase: the hydrogen content increased during the L-period whereas highest CH4/CO2 ratios (up to 2.8) were reached during the G-period. Aceticlastic Methanosaeta as well as hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus and Methanobacteriaceae were identified as dominant methanogens. Consequently, a directed control of the first-phase stabilizing desired metabolic states can lead to an enhanced productivity regarding chemicals and bioenergy. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Concern in relation to creating environmental protection policies is increasing, particularly with regard to the reuse of waste for power generation. In this context, biodiesel production from waste cooking oils could play an important role. Biodiesel is a biofuel that can be produced from saturated fatty raw material discarded by restaurants, such as oils and fats used for cooking processes. This paper describes a biodiesel production plant installed at Pinheira Beach in the State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil and aims to discuss the environmental, social and economic impacts by analyzing the biodiesel production by life cycle assessment (LCA), relationship with the emission of greenhouse gases. The plant is run by an association and is aimed at promoting the recycling of waste cooking oil from restaurants and residences in the area and, at the same time, enables the continuity of artisanal fisheries in the region. The transesterification production process was used to convert waste cooking oils into biodiesel using basic catalysis in the presence of methanol. A batch system with the capacity to produce 200 L of biodiesel per day was adopted. The data obtained for the biodiesel produced at the plant were 879.2 kg m−3 density, 495.74 mg kg−1 water content, 94.38% ester content, and 1.5 mg.kg−1 sodium plus potassium. Related to the Life Cycle Assessment the results demonstrate that the category that most contributes to the emissions generated in biodiesel production process is the collection stage with 92.10% contribution, presenting a significant difference to the productions stage which contributed 7.9%. The plant provides environmental, social and economic gains for the community, for instance, increased income for the associates and fishermen, environmental education in schools, and cooking oil recycling opportunities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aqueous fraction generated from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae contains approximately 20–35% of the total carbon present in the algal feed. Hence, this aqueous fraction can be utilized to produce liquid fuels and/or specialty chemicals for economic sustainability of HTL on an industrial scale. In this study, aqueous fractions produced from HTL of freshwater and saline-water algal cultures were analyzed using a wide variety of analytical instruments to determine their compositional characteristics. Organic chemical compounds present in eight aqueous fractions were identified using two-dimensional gas chromatography equipped with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Identified compounds include organic acids, nitrogen compounds and aldehydes/ketones. Conventional gas chromatography and liquid chromatography methods were utilized to quantify the identified compounds. Inorganic species in the aqueous stream from HTL of algae also were quantified using ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The concentrations of organic chemical compounds and inorganic species are reported. The amount quantified carbon ranged from 45 to 72% of the total carbon in the aqueous fractions. © 2016

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature on the hydrotreatment behaviour of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of mallee wood with a special focus on coke formation. The experiments were carried out in a continuous hydrotreatment reactor with pre-sulphided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 as the main catalyst over a nominal temperature range from 375 to 450°C while the outlet pressure was set at 70 bar. GC-MS, TGA, UV-Fluorescence spectroscopy, elemental analysis and FT-Raman spectroscopy were used to characterise the reaction products and spent catalyst. While an upstream Pd/C catalyst bed had some effects of stabilising bio-oil, it was insufficient to ensure long-term operation under all conditions. Aromatic ring growth and polymerisation could take place continuously even under the overall dominating hydrotreatment/hydrocracking conditions. Temperature drastically affected the hydrotreatment product quality and coke formation. Increasing temperature favours the polymerisation for the formation of coke. At high temperature (e.g. 450°C), the coke formation could be so severe that the reactor was blocked before the heavy liquid could reach the end of the reactor. The coke formed mainly from heavy liquid showed very different properties (different aromatic ring systems) from the coke formed mainly from the light species. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 2,5-Hexanedione (HD), which can be produced by reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), one of the most important biomass intermediates, can serve as a precursor to produce various biofuels and key building block chemicals. The conversion of HMF to HD requires reduction of both the alcohol and aldehyde groups to alkane groups as well as opening of the furan ring. In this study, a direct electrochemical conversion of HMF to HD at ambient pressure and temperature was demonstrated without using H2 or precious metal catalysts. Water was used as the hydrogen source and zinc was used as the catalytic electrode, which enabled hydrogenolysis and Clemmensen reduction coupled with furan ring opening. Optimum conditions to achieve high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and selectivity for HD production were investigated and plausible mechanisms were proposed. The environmentally benign one-step procedure to produce HD reported in this study will serve as a new route to valorize biomass intermediates. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - With the growing awareness of environmental issues, production of biofuel has a potential to provide an alternative source of renewable energy sources. In the present work, the effect of pyrolysis temperature, particle size and sweep gas flow rate (N2) was investigated for production of bio-oil from pyrolysis of babool seeds (Acacia nilotica). Optimum conditions obtained for the maximum liquid and bio-oil yield (~49% &amp; 38.3%, respectively) were 500 °C, 100 cm3/min sweep gas flow rate (N2) and particle size range upto 0.4 mm. Bio-oil with a calorific value of 36.45 MJ/kg was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, GC/MS. The characterization of bio-oil indicates that it can be an alternative fuel for transportation sector. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The seaweed Ulva prolifera, distributed in inter-tidal zones worldwide, contains a large percentage of cellulosic materials. The technical feasibility of using U. prolifera residue (UPR) obtained after extraction of polysaccharides as a renewable energy resource was investigated. An environment-friendly and economical pretreatment process was conducted using hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide pretreatment improved the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. The resulting yield of reducing sugar reached a maximum of 0.42 g/g UPR under the optimal pretreatment condition (hydrogen peroxide 0.2%, 50 °C, pH 4.0, 12 h). The rate of conversion of reducing sugar in the concentrated hydrolysates to bioethanol reached 31.4% by Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation, which corresponds to 61.7% of the theoretical maximum yield. Compared with other reported traditional processes on Ulva biomass, the reducing sugar and bioethanol yield are substantially higher. Thus, hydrogen peroxide pretreatment is an effective enhancement of the process of bioethanol production from the seaweed U. prolifera. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of the crude bio-oil derived from hydrothermal liquefaction of cornstalk using bimetallic ammonium nickel molybdate as a dispersed catalyst precursor at different temperatures (280-370 °C) was conducted under supercritical ethanol with initial 4 MPa H2, 60 min reaction time. Results showed that the yield of upgraded bio-oil was decreased from 26.7 to 16.3 wt.% with an increase in temperature. The water content and viscosity of upgraded bio-oil were decreased from 25.6 wt.% and 37.3 mm2/s to 1.6 wt.% and 8.8 mm2/s, respectively, and the heating value was increased from 32.1 to 38.3 MJ/kg. Compared with crude bio-oil, the upgraded bio-oil at 370 °C has minimum molar ratio of O/C (0.05) and the highest degree of deoxygenation (74.24%). FT-IR and GC-MS analysis found that the acids were almost removed via esterification; the phenols and esters decreased gradually, whereas hydrocarbons significantly increased and the functional groups and compositions were retuned. In addition, the esters produced at lower temperature were cracked into intermediates for further reactions to obtain the valuable hydrocarbons at higher temperature, for obtaining a potential transportation fuel after further refining. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Deoxygenation of waste cooking vegetable oil and Jatropha curcas oil under nitrogen atmosphere was performed in batch and semi-batch experiments using CaO and treated hydrotalcite (MG70) as catalysts at 400 °C. In batch conditions a single liquid fraction (with yields greater than 80 wt.%) was produced containing a high proportion of hydrocarbons (83%). In semi-batch conditions two liquid fractions (separated by a distillation step) were obtained: a light fraction and an intermediate fraction containing amounts of hydrocarbons between 72-80% and 85-88% respectively. In order to assess the possible use of the liquid products as alternative fuels a complete chemical characterization and measurement of their properties were carried out. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study focuses on the pyrolysis characteristics of OPF (oil palm fiber) and OPFP (oil palm fiber pellet) in N2 and CO2 to evaluate the impacts of biomass pattern and carrier gas on the three-phase products. Three different reaction temperatures of 400, 450, and 500 °C along with 30 min pyrolysis are considered. The results indicate that OPFP pyrolysis gives a higher liquid yield when compared to OPF pyrolysis, and the liquid yield using CO2 as a carrier gas is higher than that using N2. The influences of carrier gas and biomass pattern on the components in bio-oils are not profound. The deoxygenation and dehydrogenation mechanisms on solid biomass are obviously exhibited, and the latter is more pronounced than the former. The higher heating values of OPF and OPFP from pyrolysis are intensified up to 39 and 24%, respectively. The CO2 and CO concentration distributions suggest that the most drastic pyrolysis reaction develops at 7-9 min. On account of more energy required for breaking methoxyl groups, CH4 formation is later than CO and CO2 formations. In summary, OPFP pyrolyzed in a CO2 environment is a feasible operation for producing bio-oils, thereby saving facility space and achieving CO2 utilization. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The hydrogenolysis of C-O and CO in 5-hydroxymethylfurfural for the production of furan biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is of great importance for biomass refining. However, development of non-noble metal-based catalysts which perform stably for this process is still challenging. Here, perovskite-supported Ni catalysts were used for the hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural at 230 °C, with 98.3% yield of DMF being obtained. The effects of reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure were investigated and discussed, and the catalyst could maintain good activity after being used at least 5 times. In order to further explore the reaction mechanism, dynamic experiments at different times were carried out and a possible reaction pathway was proposed. The development of efficient perovskite-supported Ni catalysts verified their great potential in biomass conversion. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis bio oil is a liquid biofuel produced by fast pyrolysis of biomass materials. Even though pyrolysis oil consists primarily of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, contaminations in the form of inorganic elements can be transferred from the original biomass feedstock to the pyrolysis oil during its production. These inorganic elements might limit the potential for utilization in high value applications, for example by poisoning the catalysts used in any subsequent processing steps. In this work, the transfer of inorganic elements from biomass to pyrolysis oil has been investigated. First a literature review was performed in order to determine the possible pathways inorganic elements can follow in the pyrolysis process. An important mechanism in the release of inorganic elements from the solid to the vapor phase was found in reactions between the organic volatiles produced and the inorganic elements present in the solid material. Organic volatiles form bonds with inorganic elements on the solid (pore) surface, after which the composed molecule can be released to the vapor phase. Experimental work on the transfer of inorganic elements during pyrolysis of 16 biomass materials has been carried out. Results show that alkali earth metals (Ca, Mg), transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, Cd, Cr, Co, Mn, Zn) and post transition metals (Al, Pb) remain largely on the solid char by-product. Incomplete solid separation from the gaseous stream prior to condensation is then the main route for their transfer to the pyrolysis oil. For the non-metals (S, P) sulfur is transferred primarily due to reactions with organic volatiles, while phosphorus is transferred primarily by physical entrainment of solid char particles. For the alkali metals (Na, K) the entrainment of solid char particles to pyrolysis oil is also the primary pathway, although Na and K are also transferred notably by reactions with volatiles. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature in the normal operating range (400-600 °C) appears to be small. > 95 wt.% of all inorganic elements present in the biomass are typically separated from the pyrolysis oil product. Options are available to increase the separation efficiency even further, showing that the presence of inorganic elements should not be a limiting factor for the application of pyrolysis oil. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We describe an integrated process that can be applied to biomass of the green seaweed, Ulva fasciata, to allow the sequential recovery of four economically important fractions; mineral rich liquid extract (MRLE), lipid, ulvan, and cellulose. The main benefits of our process are: a) its simplicity and b) the consistent yields obtained from the residual biomass after each successive extraction step. For example, dry Ulva biomass yields ∼26% of its starting mass as MRLE, ∼3% as lipid, ∼25% as ulvan, and ∼11% as cellulose, with the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of the final cellulose fraction under optimized conditions producing ethanol at a competitive 0.45 g/g reducing sugar. These yields are comparable to those obtained by direct processing of the individual components from primary biomass. We propose that this integration of ethanol production and chemical feedstock recovery from macroalgal biomass could substantially enhance the sustainability of marine biomass use. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - This paper reviews the literature on upgrading of biocrude oil obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae. It analyses the influence of several parameters (e.g., temperature, operation mode, reaction time, catalyst) on the yields and properties of the upgraded product. Some own experiments are performed based on the review outcomes, comparing for the first time the application of heterogeneous catalysis to biocrude oil obtained from two different algae species: Scenedesmus almeriensis (freshwater) and Nannochloropsis gaditana (marine). The conditions applied were 4 to 8 MPa hydrogen atmosphere in 10 mL microautoclaves at 400 °C and 4 h. The influence of two catalysts (Pt/Al2O3 and HZSM-5) and the effect of water addition to the reaction medium were investigated. Many of the effects were found to be caused by the temperature applied, rather than by the catalyst. The conditions applied improved the quality of the algal biocrude oil, viz. by reducing its amount of heteroatoms, saturating and cracking its molecules, and increasing its volatility. The degree of upgrading to a transportation biofuel in the experiments herewith reported, as well as in the literature studies, is however still insufficient and demands further developments of the upgrading techniques. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conventional diesel combustion produces harmful exhaust emissions which adversely affect the air quality if not controlled by in-cylinder measures and exhaust aftertreatment systems. Dual-fuel combustion can potentially reduce the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot which are characteristic of diesel diffusion flame. The in-cylinder blending of different fuels to control the charge reactivity allows for lower local equivalence ratios and temperatures. The use of ethanol, an oxygenated biofuel with high knock resistance and high latent heat of vaporisation, increases the reactivity gradient. In addition, renewable biofuels can provide a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based fuels as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, ethanol-diesel dual-fuel combustion suffers from poor engine efficiency at low load due to incomplete combustion. Therefore, experimental studies were carried out at 1200. rpm and 0.615. MPa indicated mean effective pressure on a heavy-duty diesel engine. Fuel delivery was in the form of port fuel injection of ethanol and common rail direct injection of diesel. The objective was to improve combustion efficiency, maximise ethanol substitution, and minimise NOx and soot emissions. Ethanol energy fractions up to 69% were explored in conjunction with the effect of different diesel injection strategies on combustion, emissions, and efficiency. Optimisation tests were performed for the optimum fuelling and diesel injection strategy. The resulting effects of exhaust gas recirculation, intake air pressure, and rail pressure were investigated. The optimised combustion of ethanol ignited by split diesel injections resulted in higher net indicated efficiency when compared to diesel-only operation. For the best emissions case, NOx and soot emissions were reduced by 65% and 29%, respectively. Aftertreatment requirements that are generally associated with cost and fuel economy penalties can be minimised. Combustion efficiency of 98% was achieved at the expense of higher NOx emissions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cu/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized by different methods, which greatly influenced their texture and the catalytic performance. The AE-Cu/SiO2 catalyst was prepared via the ammonia evaporation method and showed a 95.5% yield for 2-methylfuran (a promising fuel additive) because of the cooperative effects of surface Cu0, Cu+ species and acid sites, which respectively stemmed from the reduction of highly dispersed CuO species, copper species that fiercely interacted with the support SiO2, and the special structure. The ammonia evaporation method favored the formation of a copper phyllosilicate phase with a lamellar structure, which could provide a large number of Cu nanoparticles and acid sites and further improve the activity and selectivity. Crucially, the stability of the AE-Cu/SiO2 catalyst (&gt;210 h) was also significantly improved due to the enhanced copper-silicon interactions, which could immobilize copper particles and resist the fast transmigration (aggregation and loss) of copper particles in the thermal treatment process. In contrast, the CP-Cu/SiO2 catalyst was synthesized via the conventional precipitation method and presented poor activity and stability toward 2-methylfuran because of large copper particles, severe aggregation and a loss of copper species during reaction. Compared with the conventional CP-Cu/SiO2 catalyst, the use of the AE-Cu/SiO2 catalyst in the synthesis of the biofuel 2-methylfuran could not only improve the yield of the desired product, but also decrease by at least 20 °C the reaction temperature which is propitious for prolonging the lifetime of the Cu/SiO2 catalyst. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - In the present work, zeolite based catalyst was prepared from zeolite tuft by impregnation methods. The zeolite tuft was initially treated with hydrochloric acid (16%) and then several KOH/zeolite catalysts were prepared by impregnation in KOH solutions. Various solutions of KOH with different molarities (1-6 M) were used. Further modification for the catalyst was performed by a 2nd step impregnation treatment by heating and stirring the KOH/zeolite to 80 °C for 4 h. The zeolite tuft and the prepared catalysts were characterized by several analytical techniques in order to explore their physicochemical properties. These tests include: X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Zero point of Charge (PHzpc), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), Energy-dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The catalysts were then used for transesterification of waste sunflower vegetable oil in order to produce biodiesel. Among the different catalysts prepared, the 1-4M KOH/TZT catalyst provided the maximum biodiesel yield of 96.7% at 50 °C reaction temperature, methanol to oil molar ratio of 11.5:1, agitation speed of 800 rpm, 335 μm catalyst particle size and 2 h reaction time. The physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel comply with the EN and ASTM standard specifications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic hydrocracking of kraft lignin was carried out in isopropanol system and an orthogonal array design (OAD) was employed to optimize the experimental conditions. GC-MS/FID, elemental analysis, GPC and 1H-13C HSQC NMR were carried out for entire investigation of the liquid products. The results indicated that the hydrocracking process was thermally controlled and catalysts showed significant influences on the product distributions. Comparing with Pd/C, Pt/C and Ru/C, Rh/C inhibited the self-condensation of isopropanol and reduced the formation of oxygenic-chain compounds. The excellent catalytic activity for phenols conversion was obtained over Rh/C. The routes of oxygenic-chain compounds formation and phenol conversion were proposed in detail. The least oxygenic-chain compounds formation, the highest phenols conversion (93.4%), the lowest O/C ratio (0.094) and the highest HHV (37.969 MJ/kg) provided the possibility of the high quality bio-oil obtained over Rh/C in isopropanol medium. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The grand challenge facing the chemical and allied industries in the twentyfirst century is the transition to greener, more sustainable manufacturing processes that efficiently use raw materials, eliminate waste and avoid the use of toxic and hazardous materials. It requires a paradigm shift from traditional concepts of process efficiency, focusing on chemical yield, to one that assigns economic value to replacing fossil resources with renewable raw materials, eliminating waste and avoiding the use of toxic and/or hazardous substances. The need for a greening of chemicals manufacture is readily apparent from a consideration of the amounts of waste generated per kilogram of product (the E factors) in various segments of the chemical industry. A primary source of this waste is the use of antiquated 'stoichiometric' technologies and a major challenge is to develop green, catalytic alternatives. Another grand challenge for the twenty-first century, driven by the pressing need for climate change mitigation, is the transition from an unsustainable economy based on fossil resources - oil, coal and natural gas - to a sustainable one based on renewable biomass. In this context, the valorization of waste biomass, which is currently incinerated or goes to landfill, is particularly attractive. The bio-based economy involves crossdisciplinary research at the interface of biotechnology and chemical engineering, focusing on the development of green, chemo- and biocatalytic technologies for waste biomass conversion to biofuels, chemicals and bio-based materials. Biocatalysis has many benefits to offer in this respect. The catalyst is derived from renewable biomass and is biodegradable. Processes are performed under mild conditions and generally produce less waste and are more energy efficient than conventional ones. Thanks to modern advances in biotechnology 'tailor-made' enzymes can be economically produced on a large scale. However, for economic viability it is generally necessary to recover and re-use the enzyme and this can be achieved by immobilization, e.g. as solid cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs), enabling separation by filtration or centrifugation. A recent advance is the use of 'smart', magnetic CLEAs, which can be separated magnetically from reaction mixtures containing suspensions of solids; truly an example of cross-disciplinary research at the interface of physical and life sciences, which is particularly relevant to biomass conversion processes. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) is a promising route for producing fungible biofuels; however, this process requires bifunctional catalysts that favor C-O bond cleavage, activate hydrogen at near atmospheric pressure and high temperature (350-500 °C), and are stable under high-steam, low hydrogen-to-carbon environments. Recently, early transition-metal carbides have been reported to selectively cleave C-O bonds of alcohols, aldehydes, and oxygenated aromatics, yet there is limited understanding of the metal carbide surface chemistry under reaction conditions and the identity of the active sites for deoxygenation. In this paper, we evaluated molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) for the deoxygenation of acetic acid, an abundant component of biomass pyrolysis vapors, under ex situ CFP conditions, and we probed the Mo2C surface chemistry, identity of the active sites, and deoxygenation pathways using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Mo2C catalyst favored the production of acetaldehyde and ethylene from acetic acid over the temperature range of 250-400 °C, with decarbonylation pathways favored at temperatures greater than 400 °C. Little to no ethanol was observed due to the high activity of the carbide surface for alcohol dehydration. The Mo2C surface, which was at least partially oxidized following pretreatment and exposure to reaction conditions (possibly existing as an oxycarbide), possessed both metallic-like H-adsorption sites (i.e., exposed Mo and C) and Brønsted acidic surface hydroxyl sites, in a ratio of 1:8 metallic:acidic sites following pretreatment. The strength of the acidic sites was similar to that for H-Beta, H-Y, and H-X zeolites. Oxygen vacancy sites (exposed Mo sites) were also present under reaction conditions, inferred from DRIFTS results and calculated surface phase diagrams. It is proposed that C-O bond cleavage steps proceeded over the acidic sites or over the oxygen vacancy sites and that the deoxygenation rate may be limited by the availability of adsorbed hydrogen, due to the high surface coverage of oxygen under reaction conditions. Importantly, the reaction conditions (temperature and partial pressures of H2 and H2O) had a strong effect on oxygen surface coverage, and accordingly, the relative concentrations of the different types of active sites, and could ultimately result in completely different reaction pathways under different reaction conditions. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The catalytic steam reforming of the major biomass tar component, toluene, was studied over two commercial Ni-based catalysts and two prepared Ru-Mn-promoted Ni-base catalysts, in the temperatures range 673-1073 K. Generally, the conversion of toluene and the H2 content in the product gas increased with temperature. A H2-rich gas was generated by the steam reforming of toluene, and the CO and CO2 contents in the product gas were reduced by the reverse Boudouard reaction. A naphtha-reforming catalyst (46-5Q) exhibited better performance in the steam reforming of toluene at temperatures over 873 K than a methane-reforming catalyst (Reformax 330). Ni/Ru-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts showed high toluene reforming performance at temperatures over 873 K. The results indicate that the observed high stability and coking resistance may be attributed to the promotional effects of Mn on the Ni/Ru-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is as an alternative petro-diesel fuel produced from the renewable resources. The use of novel technologies such as ultrasound technology for biodiesel production intensifies the reaction and reduces the process cost. The present study is aimed to evaluate and compare the prediction and simulating efficiency of the response surface methodology (RSM) and adaptive Neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approaches for modeling the transesterification yield achieved in ultrasonic reactor. The influence of independent variables (reactor diameter, liquid height and ultrasound intensity) on the conversion of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was investigated by Box-Behnken design of RSM and two ANFIS approaches (hybrid and back-propagation optimization methods). All models were compared statistically based on the training and validation data set by the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squares error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative percent deviation (MRPD). The calculated R2 for RSM and two ANFIS models were 0.9669, 0.9812 and 0.9808, respectively. All models indicated good predictions, however, the ANFIS models were more precise compared to the RSM model, which proves that the ANFIS is a powerful tool for modeling and optimizing FAME production in ultrasound reactor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Emulsification characteristics of bio-oils and diesel at various operating conditions are analyzed. Three different commercial emulsifiers (i.e., Span 80, Tween 80, and Atlox 4914) and four bio-oils from fast pyrolysis of wood wastes are studied. When the three emulsifiers are individually employed, the performance of the emulsifiers is characterized by the order of Atlox 4914 > Span 80 > Tween 80. Atlox 4914, consisting of the hydrophilic portion of PEG and the hydrophobic portion of poly alkyd resin, has a better performance. The HLB value of an emulsifier can be obtained by blending Span 80 and Tween 80 or Span 80 and Atlox 4914. The optimum HLB for the emulsification of bio-oils and diesel linearly increases with increasing the atomic O/C or H/C ratio, water content, and decreasing higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil. The correlation of the optimum HLB and HHV provides the best result, which can be employed for practical emulsification operation between bio-oils and diesel and is conduce to reducing operation cost. The functional groups in the emulsifiers, bio-oils, and diesel are analyzed by a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to recognize the characteristics of emulsions. It is found that FTIR is a fast and effective tool to examine the stability and homogeneity of emulsified fuels, even though no stratification is observed. Accordingly, this developed method can be used to rapidly and precisely identify the performance of emulsification in industry. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of rice husk with or without catalyst was investigated in a fixed bed reactor to determine the effect of sodium chloride (NaCl) catalyst on the yields of three products, the properties of the bio-oils and the gas composition. At the optimum pyrolysis conditions, the bio-oil yield obtained in non-catalytic pyrolysis process was 53.81 wt.%, while that of catalytic pyrolysis maximumly increased to 57.61 wt.% with 3 wt.% NaCl catalyst. The composition of bio-oils was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and the results indicated that the catalyst would pierce through the rice husk textures to act on cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin and change the pyrolysis reaction pathways, which decreased the percentage of organic acids, esters, ketones, guaiacols and aldehydes, but increased the percentage of alcohols, phenols, furans and anhydrosugars, along with getting more small molecular compounds. Quality of the bio-oils from catalytic pyrolysis was improved, which carried higher heating value and lower acid value. The maximum heating value and the minimum acid value of bio-oils were 27.09 MJ/kg and 68.33 mg KOH g−1, obtained with 3 wt.% and 4 wt.% NaCl catalyst, respectively, which were 5.12% higher and 14.83% lower than that of non-catalytic pyrolysis. The gas chromatography (GC) analysis of non-condensable gas showed that CO content decreased and CO2 and H2 increased with NaCl catalyst addition, obviously. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The formation and evolution of surface species during the hydrodeoxygenation of various bio-oil model compounds (anisole, m-cresol, and guaiacol) over Pt/HBEA and HBEA is investigated. Anisole and m-cresol form phenate and cresolate species on Lewis acid sites, while guaiacol can chemisorb more strongly forming bidentate surface species. The position of functional groups within these molecules has a strong influence on the degree of hydrodeoxygenation over Pt/HBEA, due to steric hindrance of the C-O scission step. Consequently, the highest yield of deoxygenated products is formed over anisole, followed by m-cresol and guaiacol. No deoxygenation products are produced from HBEA. On the basis of operando transmission FTIR spectroscopy experiments at 400°C and 1 atm of hydrogen pressure, a timeline for the formation of polynuclear aromatics and graphitic coke from aromatics with different substituents is established for Pt/HBEA. The early formation of relatively small amounts of graphitic coke and polynuclear aromatics results in pronounced catalyst deactivation. In addition, the formation of strongly adsorbed monomeric species appears to restrict transport processes within the zeolite pores and contribute to deactivation. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - n-Butanol is a very competitive alternative biofuel for spark ignition (SI) engines given its many advantages. Current researches are mainly concentrated on the overall combustion and emissions performance concerning the feasibility of n-butanol gasoline blends in SI engines. In this work, focus was given on the knocking combustion characteristics of operation with pure n-butanol as well as a blend fuel with 20% volume content of n-butanol (Bu20), which was investigated experimentally in a direct-injection spark ignition (DISI) single cylinder engine. Operation condition is fixed at a constant engine speed of 1500 r/min, using three throttle openings with stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. Spark timing was swept to achieve different knocking levels. The results of n-butanol and Bu20 were benchmarked against those obtained by the research octane number (RON) 92 commercial gasoline. Compared with the baseline fuel gasoline, neat n-butanol shows better anti-knock ability with more advanced knock limited spark timing, whereas slightly deteriorative knock resistance can be found for Bu20. It is hypothesized Bu20 has higher end gas temperature due to its higher brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and faster burning rate compared with gasoline, which indicates the knock tendency depends not only on the fuel octane number, but also on the factors that affect the end gas thermodynamic state. The heavier knock propensity of Bu20 is furthermore confirmed by its more advanced knock onset and higher peak oscillation pressure. Results of fast fourier transform (FFT) indicate the knocking oscillation frequencies are mainly determined by the combustion chamber resonance modes. Statistics probability distribution and cumulative distribution are applied to evaluate the knock intensity variation for each fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study assessed the potential for biochemical conversion of energy stored in agricultural waste and residue in Iran. The current status of agricultural residue as a source of bioenergy globally and in Iran was investigated. The total number of publications in this field from 2000 to 2014 was about 4294. Iran ranked 21st with approximately 54 published studies. A total of 87 projects have been devised globally to produce second-generation biofuel through biochemical pathways. There are currently no second-generation biorefineries in Iran and agricultural residue has no significant application. The present study determined the amount and types of sustainable agricultural residue and oil-rich crops and their provincial distribution. Wheat, barley, rice, corn, potatoes, alfalfa, sugarcane, sugar beets, apples, grapes, dates, cotton, soybeans, rapeseed, sesame seeds, olives, sunflowers, safflowers, almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts have the greatest potential as agronomic and horticultural crops to produce bioenergy in Iran. A total of 11.33 million tonnes (Mt) of agricultural biomass could be collected for production of bioethanol (3.84 gigaliters (Gl)), biobutanol (1.07 Gl), biogas (3.15 billion cubic meters (BCM)), and biohydrogen (0.90 BCM). Additionally, about 0.35 Gl of biodiesel could be obtained using only 35% of total Iranian oilseed. The potential production capacity of conventional biofuel blends in Iran, environmental and socio-economic impacts including well-to-wheel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the social cost of carbon dioxide reduction are discussed. The cost of emissions could decrease up to 55.83% by utilizing E85 instead of gasoline. The possible application of gaseous biofuel in Iran to produce valuable chemicals and provide required energy for crop cultivation is also studied. The energy recovered from biogas produced by wheat residue could provide energy input for 115.62 and 393.12 thousand hectares of irrigated and rain-fed wheat cultivation in Iran, respectively. The nitrogen requirement for 33.6% of the total wheat cultivation area could be supplied by the ammonia acquired from biohydrogen. A discussion of the logistics of collection and transportation of the biomass and sensitivity analysis are carried out to evaluate the effect of field cover factor, crop yield, and well-to-wheel GHG emission on collectable residue, biofuel production, and GHG emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To improve nutrients removal from wastewater and enhance lipid production, cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris in wastewater with waste glycerol generated from biodiesel production using scum derived oil as feedstock was studied. The results showed that nutrients removal was improved and lipid production of C. vulgaris was enhanced with the addition of waste glycerol into wastewater to balance its C/N ratio. The optimal concentration of the pretreated glycerol for C. vulgaris was 10 g L-1 with biomass concentration of 2.92 g L-1, lipid productivity of 163 mg L-1 d-1, and the removal of 100% ammonia and 95% of total nitrogen. Alkaline conditions prompted cell growth and lipid accumulation of C. vulgaris while stimulating nutrients removal. The application of the integration process can lower both wastewater treatment and biofuel feedstock costs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work aimed to develop an in-situ upgrading process for production of refined bio-oil from primary biomass pyrolysis vapors. The phosphorus, zinc and titanium modified HZSM-5 were developed and first employed in the process. The yield of refined bio-oil was in the range of 17.85-19.97% along with low oxygen content (18.06-20.04%), high pH value (4.96-5.02), low dynamic viscosity (5.85-6.02 mm2/s), high HHV (higher heating value) (32.70-33.98 MJ/kg) and high hydrocarbon content. However, the composition of hydrocarbon varied with modified elements, so the catalytic mechanism of modified HZSM-5 was discussed. Simultaneously, anti-coking performance of modified catalyst was investigated to evaluate sustainability of the process. This work demonstrated that the refined bio-oil produced in this study basically met the technical requirements of combustion in power machinery, which provided a useful way to utilize renewable lignocellulose biomass. Though anti-coking capability of modified HZSM-5 was enhanced, coke deposition still hindered the continuous production of refined bio-oil to a certain extent. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A self-powered glucose biosensor (SPGS) system is fabricated and in vitro characterization of the power generation and charging frequency characteristics in glucose analyte are described. The bioelectrodes consist of compressed network of three-dimensional multi-walled carbon nanotubes with redox enzymes, pyroquinoline quinone glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) and laccase functioning as the anodic and cathodic catalyst, respectively. When operated in 45mM glucose, the biofuel cell exhibited an open circuit voltage and power density of 681.8mV and 67.86μW/cm2 at 335mV, respectively, with a current density of 202.2μA/cm2. Moreover, at physiological glucose concentration (5mM), the biofuel cell exhibits open circuit voltage and power density of 302.1mV and 15.98μW/cm2 at 166.3mV, respectively, with a current density of 100μA/cm2. The biofuel cell assembly produced a linear dynamic range of 0.5-45mM glucose. These findings show that glucose biofuel cells can be further investigated in the development of a self-powered glucose biosensor by using a capacitor as the transducer element. By monitoring the capacitor charging frequencies, which are influenced by the concentration of the glucose analyte, a linear dynamic range of 0.5-35mM glucose is observed. The operational stability of SPGS is monitored over a period of 63 days and is found to be stable with 15.38% and 11.76% drop in power density under continuous discharge in 10mM and 20mM glucose, respectively. These results demonstrate that SPGSs can simultaneously generate bioelectricity to power ultra-low powered devices and sense glucose. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Producing energy from biomass and other organic waste residues is essential for sustainable development. Fraunhofer UMSICHT has developed a novel reactor which introduces the Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR®) process. The TCR® is a process which can convert any type of biomass and organic feedstocks into a variety of energy products (char, bio-oil and permanent gases). The aim of this work was to demonstrate this technology using digestate as the feedstock and to quantify the results from the post reforming step. The temperature of a post reformer was varied to achieve optimised fuel products. The hydrogen rich permanent gases produced were maximised at a post reforming temperature of 1023 K. The highly de-oxygenated liquid bio-oil produced contained a calorific value of 35.2 MJ/kg, with significantly improved fuel physical properties, low viscosity and acid number. Overall digestate showed a high potential as feedstock in the Thermo-Catalytic Reforming to produce pyrolysis fuel products of superior quality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Heterogeneous catalysis applied to esterification and transesterification of non-edible oil offers a strategy to the clean synthesis of the biodiesel and is driving research interested into the development of acid catalysts for efficient conversion of low quality vegetable oils into fuels to meet future societal demands. Thus, sulfated niobium oxide catalyst was synthesized by the impregnation method and used as a heterogeneous catalyst aimed at biodiesel production via macaw palm oil through high free fatty acid content transesterification with ethanol. The effect of two reaction parameters, molar ratio of ethanol to macaw palm oil and reaction temperature, on ester content and viscosity was studied by the response surface methodology (RSM). The ester content was determined by GC. The catalyst shows excellent activity (99.2% ester content and 4.5 mm2/s viscosity) towards biodiesel production. Its optimum reaction conditions were: 120:1 molar ratio of ethanol to macaw palm oil at 250 °C reaction temperature. The catalysts characterization was carried out by using the X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and N2 Adsorption-desorption and Surface Acidity Analyses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the emissions of a modern (Tier 4) 4-cylinder direct injection (DI) diesel engine at idling with no load conditions. Three idling speeds: low (800 rpm), medium (1000 rpm) and high (1200 rpm), respectively are considered. Two additives (5% and 15% by volume), ethanol and diethyl ether (DEE) were mixed with biodiesel-diesel blends B20, B50 and B100. B100 was produced from canola oil. Engine was tested from cold start to warm up in real world conditions. Emissions analysis was conducted for carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). Investigation results show that, CO and NOx emissions decrease, but HC emissions increase after warm-up than cold start. Diesel-biodiesel blends with additives produce lower CO emissions then neat diesel; ethanol and DEE additives can reduce NOx emissions in diesel-biodiesel blends, and increasing biodiesel content reduced HC emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cesium modified sodium zirconate (Cs-Na2ZrO3) was prepared by ionic exchange from sodium zirconate (Na2ZrO3), which was synthesized via a solid state reaction. Both ceramics, i.e., pristine Na2ZrO3 and the Cs-Na2ZrO3, were used as basic heterogeneous catalysts in biodiesel production. Soybean and Jatropha oils were used as triglyceride sources for transesterification reactions. Parameters, such as catalyst concentration (between 0.5 and 3 wt%), reaction time, different methanol/vegetable oil molar ratios, and temperature of the reaction, were evaluated. The cesium cation influence was evaluated from the basic transesterification reactivity. The results showed that the introduction of cesium significantly modified the catalytic activity in biodiesel production. Cs enhanced the reaction kinetics in obtaining biodiesel and reduced the reaction time in comparison with pristine Na2ZrO3. The results showed that Cs-Na2ZrO3 as a basic heterogeneous catalyst exhibited the best fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) conversion for soybean oil (98.8%) at 1 wt%, 30:1 methanol/oil ratio, 65 °C, and 15 min. The best conditions for Jatropha oil (90.8%) were 3 wt%, 15:1 methanol/oil ratio, 65 °C, and 1 h. The impregnation of Na2ZrO3 with cesium represents a very exciting alternative heterogeneous base catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this report, Ni/ZrO2, Ni/Al2O3, Ni/Al2O3-KF, Ni/SBA-15, and Ni/Al-SBA-15 were examined as catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of diphenyl ether. Adopting the degree of deoxygenation and yield of monocyclic products as the criteria for the catalyst selection, Ni/Al-SBA-15 was identified as the best catalyst for HDO of diphenyl ether. In fact, in the presence of Ni/Al-SBA-15, full conversion of the model compound into cyclohexane was achieved with high selectivity (98%). Most strikingly, Ni/Al-SBA-15 is capable of hydrodeoxygenating Organosolv lignin with selectivity to cycloalkanes higher than 99%. Owing to the similarities to hydrocarbons derived from petroleum, the lignin-derived alkanes could well be refined into drop-in fuels by conventional oil refinery processes. Moreover, in a broader perspective, the current results also highlight the importance of Al-SBA-15, as an acidic support alternative to zeolites or other acidic materials, for the HDO of phenolic streams. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We develop tar removal technologies by using byproducts (bio-oil and char) in order to achieve low-cost and highly effective tar removal using only secondary removal methods in a pilot-scale gasification facility. The tar removal performance of a 100-L bio-oil scrubber and a 13-kg char filter is investigated with an up-draft gasifier. The tar removal rate of the bio-oil scrubber at 40, 50, and 60 °C is measured; the highest removal rate is 64.5% at 50 °C. Furthermore, even though the tar removal performance of water/oily scrubber generally degrades, that of the bio-oil scrubber does not decrease even after use for 22.5 h. The char can also be used as a tar adsorbent, like activated carbon, because of its high porosity. The char bed filter removes 81.5% of the tar from the producer gas at the beginning of the operation. The entire tar removal system, including the bio-oil scrubber and the char bed filter, exhibits a 98% tar removal rate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Feedstock recalcitrance is the most important barrier impeding cost-effective production of cellulosic biofuels. Pioneer commercial cellulosic ethanol facilities employ thermochemical pretreatment and addition of fungal cellulase, reflecting the main research emphasis in the field. However, it has been suggested that it may be possible to process cellulosic biomass without thermochemical pretreatment using thermophilic, cellulolytic bacteria. To further explore this idea, we examine the ability of various biocatalysts to solubilize autoclaved but otherwise unpretreated cellulosic biomass under controlled but not industrial conditions. Results: Carbohydrate solubilization of mid-season harvested switchgrass after 5 days ranged from 24 % for Caldicellulosiruptor bescii to 65 % for Clostridium thermocellum, with intermediate values for a thermophilic horse manure enrichment, Clostridium clariflavum, Clostridium cellulolyticum, and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) featuring a fungal cellulase cocktail and yeast. Under a variety of conditions, solubilization yields were about twice as high for C. thermocellum compared to fungal cellulase. Solubilization of mid-season harvested switchgrass was about twice that of senescent switchgrass. Lower yields and greater dependence on particle size were observed for Populus as compared to switchgrass. Trends observed from data drawn from six conversion systems and three substrates, including both time course and end-point data, were (1) equal fractional solubilization of glucan and xylan, (2) no biological solubilization of the non-carbohydrate fraction of biomass, and (3) higher solubilization for three of the four bacterial cultures tested as compared to the fungal cellulase system. Brief (5 min) ball milling of solids remaining after fermentation of senescent switchgrass by C. thermocellum nearly doubled carbohydrate solubilization upon reinnoculation as compared to a control without milling. Greater particle size reduction and solubilization were observed for milling of partially fermented solids than for unfermented solids. Physical disruption of cellulosic feedstocks after initiation of fermentation, termed cotreatment, warrants further study. Conclusions: While the ability to achieve significant solubilization of minimally pretreated switchgrass is widespread, a fivefold difference between the most and least effective biocatalyst - feedstock combinations was observed. Starting with nature's best biomass-solubilizing systems may enable a reduction in the amount of non-biological processing required, and in particular substitution of cotreatment for pretreatment. © 2016 Paye et al.

AB  - Lignocellulose biorefineries are distinguished by an explicitly integrative, multi-functional concept that transforms biomass into multiple products, using a variety of conversion and separation processes. This study focuses on the technical design and economic evaluation of a lignocellulose biorefinery, that converts 400,000 t DM/a (≙250 MW) of beech wood into chemicals and fuel. A model was simulated with Aspen Plus® including the process steps pre-treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, alcoholic fermentation, dehydration and biogas generation and upgrading. Mass and energy balances showed that 61,600 t/a polymer-grade ethylene, 58,520 t DM/a organosolv lignin, 38,400 t/a biomethane and 90,800 t DM/a hydrolysis lignin can be produced with a total energy efficiency of 87.1%. A discounted cash flow analysis indicated that the heat integrated biorefinery concept is not yet profitable. However, the economic results are greatly sensitive regarding various assumptions, in particular in terms of the prices for beech wood, ethylene and organosolv lignin. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the potential use of dimethyl carbonate (DMC), a green, non-toxic and low-reactive biofuel to enable partially premixed low temperature combustion (PPLTC) mode in a DI diesel engine. PPLTC is an intermediate combustion strategy between conventional diesel combustion and homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion which provides sufficiently long ignition delay for fuel/air to pre-mix inside the cylinder and to eventually restrain harmful smoke and NOx emissions. The engine was fueled with 15% by vol. of DMC/diesel blend (DMC15) and the combustion, performance and emission characteristics were examined under high loads with charge-dilution and combustion-phasing controlled by employing EGR (0-30%) and adjusting the injection timing (25-21°CA bTDC). Experimental results revealed that DMC15 exhibited better performance when the injection timing is advanced from 21°to 25°CA bTDC at the expense of emissions. Nevertheless DMC15 injected at 21°CA bTDC under 30% EGR experienced longest ignition delay and lowest peaks in pressure and heat release rate (HRR) to achieve a maximum simultaneous reduction of NOx emissions (▾46.1%) and smoke opacity (▾64.7%) respectively with a small drop in performance (▾11.8%). Both total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon-monoxide (CO) emissions increased at intensified EGR rates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary Alcohols extensively used in internal combustion engines are important renewable and sustainable energy resources from environmental and economical perspectives. Besides, bio production of alcohols decreases consumption of fossil-based fuels. Although there are many studies with regards to the use of lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol in internal combustion engines, there are a limited number of investigations with higher alcohols. Higher alcohols such as propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol are part of the next generation of biofuels, given they provide better fuel properties than lower alcohols. Biodiesel-higher alcohol blends can be used in diesel engines without any engine modification but need to be tested under various engine conditions with long periods in order to evaluate their impacts on engine performance and environmental pollutants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of using propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol in waste oil methyl ester (B100) on engine performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine running at different loads (0, 3, 6, and 9 kW) with a fixed engine speed (1800 rpm). Test fuel blends were prepared by adding propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol (10 vol.%) into waste oil methyl ester to achieve blends of B90Pr10, B90nB10, and B90Pn10, respectively. According to engine performance and exhaust emissions results, the addition of propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol to B100 had the effect of increasing brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperatures. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) decreased for B90Pr10 and B90nB10, while B90Pn10 showed a slight increase in BTE as compared with B100. When compared with B100, B90Pr10, B90nB10, and B90Pn10 decreased carbon monoxide emissions at lower loads while it increased slightly at 9 kW load. The decrement in oxides of nitrogen emission was observed at whole loads for B90Pr10, B90nB10, and B90Pn10 compared with B100. When considering all loads, B90Pn10 presented the best mean hydrocarbon emission with a reduction of 45.41%. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A fluidized bed two-stage gasification process, consisting of a fluidized-bed (FB) pyrolyzer and a transport fluidized bed (TFB) gasifier, has been proposed to gasify biomass for fuel gas production with low tar content. On the basis of our previous fundamental study, an autothermal two-stage gasifier has been designed and built for gasify a kind of Chinese herb residue with a treating capacity of 600 kg/h. The testing data in the operational stable stage of the industrial demonstration plant showed that when keeping the reaction temperatures of pyrolyzer and gasifier respectively at about 700 °C and 850 °C, the heating value of fuel gas can reach 1200 kcal/Nm3, and the tar content in the produced fuel gas was about 0.4 g/Nm3. The results from this pilot industrial demonstration plant fully verified the feasibility and technical features of the proposed FB two-stage gasification process. © 2016.

AB  - Strategies to maximize direct electron transfer (DET) between redox enzymes and electrodes include the oriented immobilization of enzymes onto an electroactive surface. Here, we present a strategy for achieving a controlled orientation of a fungal laccase on carbon nanotube-based electrodes. A homogeneous population of pyrene-modified laccase is obtained via the reductive amination of a unique surface accessible lysine residue engineered near the T1 copper center of the enzyme. Immobilization of the site-specific functionalized enzyme is achieved either via π-stacking of pyrene on pristine CNT electrodes or through pyrene/β-cyclodextrin host guest interactions on β-cyclodextrin-modified gold nanoparticles (β-CD-AuNPs). Contrasting with unmodified and nonspecifically modified (pyrene-NHS) laccase-electrodes, an efficient DET is obtained at these nanostructured assemblies. Modeling the direct bioelectrocatalysis of dioxygen reduction reveals a heterogeneity in ET rates on MWCNT electrodes wheras β-CD-AuNPs act as efficient electronic bridges, lowering ET rate dispersion and achieving a highly efficient reduction of O2 at low overpotential (≈80 mV) accompanied by high catalytic current densities of almost 3 mA cm-2. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pretreatment of the high free fatty acid rubber seed oil (RSO) via esterification reaction has been investigated by using a pilot scale hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) reactor. Four newly designed orifice plate geometries are studied. Cavities are induced by assisted double diaphragm pump in the range of 1-3.5 bar inlet pressure. An optimised plate with 21 holes of 1 mm diameter and inlet pressure of 3 bar resulted in RSO acid value reduction from 72.36 to 2.64 mg KOH/g within 30 min of reaction time. Reaction parameters have been optimised by using response surface methodology and found as methanol to oil ratio of 6:1, catalyst concentration of 8 wt%, reaction time of 30 min and reaction temperature of 55 °C. The reaction time and esterified efficiency of HC was three fold shorter and four fold higher than mechanical stirring. This makes the HC process more environmental friendly. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass is a promising route for the production of fungible liquid biofuels. There is significant ongoing research on the design and development of catalysts for this process. However, there are a limited number of studies investigating process configurations and their effects on biorefinery economics. Herein we present a conceptual process design with techno-economic assessment; it includes the production of upgraded bio-oil via fixed bed ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis followed by final hydroprocessing to hydrocarbon fuel blendstocks. This study builds upon previous work using fluidized bed systems, as detailed in a recent design report led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL/TP-5100-62455); overall yields are assumed to be similar, and are based on enabling future feasibility. Assuming similar yields provides a basis for easy comparison and for studying the impacts of areas of focus in this study, namely, fixed bed reactor configurations and their catalyst development requirements, and the impacts of an inline hot gas filter. A comparison with the fluidized bed system shows that there is potential for higher capital costs and lower catalyst costs in the fixed bed system, leading to comparable overall costs. The key catalyst requirement is to enable the effective transformation of highly oxygenated biomass into hydrocarbons products with properties suitable for blending into current fuels. Potential catalyst materials are discussed, along with their suitability for deoxygenation, hydrogenation and C-C coupling chemistry. This chemistry is necessary during pyrolysis vapor upgrading for improved bio-oil quality, which enables efficient downstream hydroprocessing; C-C coupling helps increase the proportion of diesel/jet fuel range product. One potential benefit of fixed bed upgrading over fluidized bed upgrading is catalyst flexibility, providing greater control over chemistry and product composition. Since this study is based on future projections, the impacts of uncertainties in the underlying assumptions are quantified via sensitivity analysis. This analysis indicates that catalyst researchers should prioritize by: carbon efficiency > catalyst cost > catalyst lifetime, after initially testing for basic operational feasibility. © 2015 The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an emerging and promising technology for the conversion of wet biomass into bio-crude, however, little attention has been paid to the utilization of hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater (HTLWW) with high concentration of organics. The present study investigated biogas production from wastewater obtained from HTL of straw for bio-crude production, with focuses on the analysis of the microbial communities and characterization of the organics. Batch experiments showed the methane yield of HTLWW (R-HTLWW) was 184 mL/g COD, while HTLWW after petroleum ether extraction (PE-HTLWW), to extract additional bio-crude, had higher methane yield (235 mL/g COD) due to the extraction of recalcitrant organic compounds. Sequential batch experiments further demonstrated the higher methane yield of PE-HTLWW. LC-TOF-MS, HPLC and gel filtration chromatography showed organics with molecular weight (MW) < 1000 were well degraded. Results from the high-throughput sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA genes analysis showed similar microbial community compositions were obtained for the reactors fed with either R-HTLWW or PE-HTLWW. The degradation of fatty acids were related with Mesotoga infera, Syntrophomonas wolfei et al. by species level identification. However, the species related to the degradation of other compounds (e.g. phenols) were not found, which could be due to the presence of uncharacterized microorganisms. It was also found previously proposed criteria (97% and 98.65% similarity) for species identification of 16S rRNA genes were not suitable for a fraction of 16S rRNA genes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metal-support interfaces play a very important role in heterogeneous catalysis. The interfacial interactions not only are responsible for stabilizing the necessary oxidation state to facilitate the reaction but also enhance the stability of the catalyst system. Nano dispersion of Ni on mesoporous nitrogen-rich carbon material has been achieved using two different synthesis methods. It was observed that nickel (0) gets stabilized by strong interfacial interaction with the nitrogen atoms of the support material, and the material was found to be very economic and efficient for the conversion of HMF to DMF in aqueous medium. The material shows ≥99% conversion to 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) within 6 h of reaction with 98.7% DMF selectivity. A unique correlation between synthesis methods and particle sizes with catalytic performance has been observed for these newly developed materials. Furthermore, a DFT calculation has been performed to predict the reaction mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The novel magnetic Ca/Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocatalysts were prepared via combination of sol-gel and incipient wetness impregnation methods for biodiesel production. This research investigates the effect of different Ca/(Fe3O4@SiO2) weight percentage on the catalytic performance. The best operational conditions were the CH3OH/oil = 15/1 at 65 °C with mechanical stirring for 5 h. Furthermore, the optimal nano catalyst showed high catalytic activity for biodiesel production and the biodiesel yield reached 97% under the optimal conditions. From the TPD results, the high basicity of catalysts enabled high yield of biodiesel was obtained. The catalyst could be recovered simply by using an external magnetic field and reused several times without appreciable loss of its catalytic activity. From the kinetic and thermodynamic studes, Ea = 47.03 kJ, A = 1.9 × 10 5 min-1, δH = 112.56 kJ mol-1 and δS = 298.63 J mol-1 K-1 were obtained. Characterization of catalysts was carried out by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTA), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and N2 adsorption-desorption measurement methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Since the EU demands the use of renewable energy sources, also in the transport sector, the usage of biodiesel fuels increases continuously. As the physicochemical properties of soot are important for the oxidation behavior during the regeneration of diesel particle filters (DPF) and literature provides contradictory information about the reactivity and the structure of biodiesel soot, the aim of this work was to investigate the reactivity of soot produced by a diesel engine operated with fuels of different biodiesel content at varying engine operating parameters.By temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) an increasing reactivity with increasing biofuel ratio, except for the conditions with lowest injection pressure was determined. This implies that soot generated with 100% biofuel (consisting of rapeseed oil methyl ester) is more reactive than soot generated with commercial gasoline station fuel containing up to 7% biodiesel, while soot from fossil fuel is even less reactive. In addition, reactivity increases with increasing injection and boost pressure. Raman microspectroscopy (RM) analysis gave very similar spectra for the received soot samples, i.e. all generated soot samples possess a similar graphitic nanostructure. Additionally, a trend in reactivity with the particle size as well as the content of Fe, Zn, and Cu in the soot, which was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), could be revealed. The soot reactivity is therefore not only determined by one parameter but a product of many soot properties like nanostructure, particle size and/or inorganic components as impurities.When following the structural change in the DPF during regeneration, a decreased structural order was observed in the beginning. After a certain time (ca. 40 s) a homogeneous oxidation of the soot takes place, which does not change the structure of the soot inside the DPF. This coincides with findings of a constant oxidation rate after a certain time. Overall, it can be ascertained that no graphitization of the soot takes place inside the DPF during regeneration. © 2015.

AB  - Bio-oils of pine wood and sugarcane bagasse were obtained in different conditions of thermal and catalytic pyrolysis. They were analyzed by hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS), and negative-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI(-)-FT-ICR MS) to provide a complementary and comprehensive characterization of the bio-oils. The elucidation of bio-oils composition is essential to assign the best application of bio-oils and the type of process required for upgrading methods. In general, the results obtained by 1H NMR and GC × GC-TOFMS showed a decrease of oxygen compounds (especially acids) and an increase of aromatic compounds when catalytic pyrolysis was used. The compound classes identified in each sample by GC × GC-TOFMS were acids, ketones, cyclic ketones, phenols, O-heterocyclic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. ESI(-)-FT-ICR MS provides relative signals and the bio-oil compounds containing hydroxyl or carboxylic acid groups, such as carboxylic acids and phenols, are selectively ionized. Via ESI(-)-FT-ICR MS, the oxygen-containing compounds determined in bio-oil samples were from O2-O12 classes, with the O4 being the major class. ESI(-)-FT-ICR MS results suggest that use of the ZSM-5 catalyst provides a decrease in the class abundance of higher oxygen atom number (&gt;O5 classes), and consequently, the increase of lower oxygen atom number classes (O2-O4). The integrated results from these three high-resolution techniques were important to comprehensively assess the molecular composition of bio-oils. The 1H NMR provided the whole bio-oils composition profile assessment; GC × GC-TOFMS and ESI(-)-FT-ICR MS results allowed a detailed speciation of the chemical composition of bio-oils. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of fast pyrolysis oil as a potential renewable liquid transportation fuel alternative to crude oil depends on successful catalytic upgrading to produce a refinery-ready product with oxygen content and qualities (i.e., specific functional group or compound content) compatible with the product's proposed refinery insertion point. Similar to crude oil hydrotreating, catalytic upgrading of bio-oil requires high temperature and pressure. However, processing thermally unstable pyrolysis oil is not straightforward. For years, a two-temperature, downflow trickle bed reactor using sulfided catalysts was the state-of-the art for continuous operation. However, pressure excursion due to plug formation still occurred, typically at the high-temperature transition zone, and led to a process shutdown within 140 h. A plug typically consists of polymerized bio-oil and inorganic constituents that bind catalysts at specific portions preventing liquid and gas flow through the bed, resulting to a potential pressure incursion. Recently, two factors were found to enable continuous operation by preventing reactor shutdown due to plug formation: (1) a bio-oil pretreatment process prior to the two-temperature reactor, and (2) a robust commercial catalyst for the high temperature zone reactor. Here, we report the use and characterization of bio-oil that was pre-treated at 413 K and 8.4 MPa under flowing H2 (500 L H2/L bio-oil, 0.5 L bio-oil/L catalyst bed) to enable the long-term (cumulative 1440-h) bio-oil hydroprocessing. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was examined over well-defined and uniform, Pt-Ni, Pt-Zn and Pt-Cu alloyed nanocrystals (NCs) supported on carbon, at 33 bar and between 160 and 200 °C. Pt-Ni alloy catalysts were prepared in three different Pt:Ni ratios, Pt6Ni, Pt3Ni, and PtNi. While all of the Pt-Ni alloys were more selective for producing 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) than were Pt or Ni monometallic catalysts, the Pt3Ni catalyst was superior to the other compositions, exhibiting a yield of 98% due to its optimum surface composition. Similarly high yields were obtained on catalysts prepared from Pt2Zn and PtCu NCs. Possible reasons are given for why each of the Pt-alloy catalysts is highly selective. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to produce biodiesel from lipids in wet microalgae with graphene oxide (GO) as solid acid catalyst, the effects on lipids conversion efficiencies of catalyst dosage, transesterification temperature, reaction time, methanol dosage and chloroform dosage were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and elemental analysis revealed that GO contained 0.997 mmol SO3H groups per gram and high amounts of OH groups. Scanning electron microscopy showed that wet microalgae cells were adsorbed on hydrophilic GO surfaces covered with many OH groups. Lipids extracted by chloroform from microalgal cells were transformed into fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) through transesterification catalyzed by the acid centers (SO3H groups) in GO catalysts. The lipids conversion efficiency into FAMEs was 95.1% in microwave-assisted transesterification reactions of 5 wt.% GO catalyst at 90 °C for 40 min. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The thermal and chemical instability of biomass fast pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) presents significant problems when it is being converted to hydrocarbon transportation fuels. Development of effective approaches for stabilizing bio-oils is critical to the success of the biomass fast pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading technology. Catalytic hydrogenation to remove reactive species in bio-oil has been considered as one of the most efficient ways to stabilize bio-oil. This paper provides a fundamental understanding of hydrogenation of actual bio-oils over a Ru/TiO2 catalyst under conditions relevant to practical bio-oil hydrotreating processes. The results indicated hydrogenation of various components of the bio-oil, including sugars, aldehydes, ketones, alkenes, aromatics, and carboxylic acids, over the Ru/TiO2 catalyst and 120 to 160 °C. Hydrogenation of these species significantly changed the chemical and physical properties of the bio-oil and overall improved its thermal stability, especially by reducing the carbonyl content, which represented the content of the most reactive species (i.e., sugar, aldehydes, and ketones). The change of content of each component in response to increasing hydrogen additions suggests the following bio-oil hydrogenation reaction sequence: sugar conversion to sugar alcohols, followed by ketone and aldehyde conversion to alcohols, followed by alkene and aromatic hydrogenation, and then followed by carboxylic acid hydrogenation to alcohols. Sulfur poisoning of the reduced Ru metal catalysts was significant during hydrogenation; however, the inorganics at low concentrations had minimal impact at short times on stream, indicating that sulfur poisoning was the primary deactivation mode for the bio-oil hydrogenation catalyst. The knowledge gained during this work will allow rational design of more effective catalysts and processes for stabilizing and upgrading bio-oils. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Macauba is a palm tree with good oil productivity (6.2 ton/ha), is native to Central and South America and is not exploited for food purposes. Its oils have been noted as an important alternative for the production of biofuels, especially for aviation. This study investigated deoxygenation catalysed by 5% w/w of palladium on charcoal (Pd/C) reduced in situ using crude and previously hydrolysed macauba pulp and almond oils with different compositions and acidity values. The effect of the fatty composition and nature of the feedstock, reaction pressure, atmosphere, presence of stirring and use of the Pd/C catalyst were studied. The results indicated high selectivity, with a predominance of saturated linear hydrocarbons that correspond to green diesel, followed by biojet fuel hydrocarbons. Oxygen removal was favoured for free fatty acids with long carbon chains, for which decarbonylation and/or decarboxylation predominates. The highest content of hydrocarbons (85% w/w) was obtained in the reaction of hydrolysed macauba almond oil at 10 bar of H2, 300 °C, 5 h of reaction and stirring at 700 rpm. This green product has potential applications as a drop-in substitute for fossil fuels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The organic wastes such as lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, sewage sludge and livestock manure have attracted attention as alternative sources of energy. Cattle manure, a waste generated in surplus amounts from the feedlot, has always been a chief environmental concern. This study is focused on identifying the candidacy of horse manure as a next generation feedstock for biofuel production through supercritical water gasification. The horse manure was gasified in supercritical water to examine the effects of temperature (400-600 °C), biomass-to-water ratio (1:5 and 1:10) and reaction time (15-45 min) at a pressure range of 23-25 MPa. The horse manure and resulting biochar were characterized through carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of alkali catalysts such as NaOH, Na2CO3 and K2CO3 at variable concentrations (1-2 wt%) were investigated to maximize the hydrogen yields. Supercritical water gasification of horse manure with 2 wt% Na2CO3 at 600 °C and 1:10 biomass-to-water ratio for 45 min revealed maximum hydrogen yields (5.31 mmol/g), total gas yields (20.8 mmol/g) with greater carbon conversion efficiency (43.1%) and enhanced lower heating value of gas products (2920 kJ/Nm3). The manure-derived biochars generated at temperatures higher than 500 °C also demonstrated higher thermal stability (weight loss &lt;34%) and larger carbon content (&gt;70 wt%) suggesting their application in enhancing soil fertility and carbon sequestration. The results propose that supercritical water gasification could be a proficient remediation technology for horse manure to generate hydrogen-rich gas products. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a sustainable industrial substrate. Copper-dependent lytic polysaccharidemonooxygenases (LPMOs) contribute to the degradation of lignocellulose and increase the efficiency of biofuel production. LPMOs can contain non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs), but their role in the activity of these enzymes is poorly understood. Here we explored the importance of CBMs in LPMO function. The family 2a CBMs of two monooxygenases, CfLPMO10 and TbLPMO10 from Cellulomonas fimi and Thermobispora bispora, respectively, were deleted and/or replaced with CBMs from other proteins. The data showed that the CBMs could potentiate and, surprisingly, inhibit LPMO activity, and that these effects were both enzyme-specific and substrate-specific. Removing the natural CBM or introducing CtCBM3a, from the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome scaffoldin CipA, almost abolished the catalytic activity of the LPMOs against the cellulosic substrates. The deleterious effect of CBM removal likely reflects the importance of prolonged presentation of the enzyme on the surface of the substrate for efficient catalytic activity, as only LPMOs appended to CBMs bound tightly to cellulose. The negative impact of CtCBM3a is in sharp contrast with the capacity of this binding module to potentiate the activity of a range of glycoside hydrolases including cellulases. The deletion of the endogenous CBM from CfLPMO10 or the introduction of a family 10 CBM from Cellvibrio japonicus LPMO10B into TbLPMO10 influenced the quantity of non-oxidized products generated, demonstrating that CBMs can modulate the mode of action of LPMOs. This study demonstrates that engineered LPMO-CBM hybrids can display enhanced industrially relevant oxygenations. © 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Electrochemical biosensors have played active roles at the forefront of bioanalysis because they have the potential to achieve sensitive, specific and low-cost detection of biomolecules and many others. Engineering the electrochemical sensing interface with functional nanomaterials leads to novel electrochemical biosensors with improved performances in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, stability and simplicity. Functional nanomaterials possess good conductivity, catalytic activity, biocompatibility and high surface area. Coupled with bio-recognition elements, these features can amplify signal transduction and biorecognition events, resulting in highly sensitive biosensing. Additionally, microfluidic electrochemical biosensors have attracted considerable attention on account of their miniature, portable and low-cost systems as well as high fabrication throughput and ease of scaleup. For example, electrochemical enzymetic biosensors and aptamer biosensors (aptasensors) based on the integrated microchip can be used for portable point-of-care diagnostics and environmental monitoring. This review is a summary of our recent progress in the field of electrochemical biosensors, including aptasensors, cytosensors, enzymatic biosensors and self-powered biosensors based on biofuel cells. We presented the advantages that functional nanomaterials and microfluidic chip technology bring to the electrochemical biosensors, together with future prospects and possible challenges. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An investigation on the feasibility of producing bio-oil and bio-char fuels from wood chips (White-Pine), a Mediterranean seaweed (Posidonia Oceanica) and a local freshwater alga (Lacustrine Alga) by pyrolysis was carried out. Experiments were performed in a fixed bed reactor at different temperatures (400, 500 and 600 °C). Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG) were used in order to investigate the pyrolytic behavior. Product yields and composition from algal pyrolysis were compared with those obtained from terrestrial biomass. Yields of char were in the range 22-48 wt% for algae and 20-27 wt% for lignocellulosic biomass. Due to the higher ash content (17-38%), the char obtained from algal biomasses had a lower heating value than that from White-Pine chips. By contrast, the oil yields from algae varied between 34 and 55 wt%, whereas yields from lignocellulosic biomass were in the range of 41.4-47.2%. The oil from Posidonia Oceanica showed a high heating value (HHV = 26.1 MJ/kg) close to the value of the oil obtained from White-Pine (30.1 MJ/kg). Chemical composition of liquid samples obtained at 500 °C was analyzed by GC-MS to identify organic functional groups. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Whole cell lipase catalysis and microalgal feedstocks make overall biodiesel synthesis greener and sustainable. In this study, a novel approach of whole cell lipase-catalyzed conversion of Scenedesmus obliquus lipids was investigated for biodiesel synthesis. Microalgal biodiesel was characterized for its fuel properties. Optimization of process parameters for immobilized Aspergillus niger whole cell lipase-catalyzed biodiesel synthesis was carried out. Highest biodiesel conversion of 53.76% was achieved from S. obliquus lipids at 35 °C, methanol to oil ratio of 5:1 and 2.5% water content based on oil weight with 6 BSPs (Biomass support particles). Step-wise methanol addition was applied to account for methanol tolerance, which improved biodiesel conversion upto 80.97% and gave 90.82 ± 1.43% yield. Immobilized A. niger lipase can be used for 2 batches without significant loss in conversion efficiency. Most of the fuel properties of biodiesel met the specifications set by international standards. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, a method based on process synthesis, simulation and evaluation has been used to setup and study the industrial scale lignocellulosic bioethanol productions processes. Scenarios for pretreatment processes of diluted acid, liquid hot water and ammonia fiber explosion were studied. Pretreatment reactor temperature, catalyst loading and water content as well as solids loading in the hydrolysis reactor were evaluated regarding its effects on the process energy consumption and bioethanol concentration. The best scenarios for maximizing ethanol concentration and minimizing total annual costs (TAC) were selected and their minimum ethanol selling price was calculated. Ethanol concentration in the range of 2–8% (wt.) was investigated after the pretreatment. The best scenarios maximizing the ethanol concentration and minimizing TAC obtained a reduction of 19.6% and 30.2% respectively in the final ethanol selling price with respect to the initial base case. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Even though hydropyrolysis of biomass has been studied for many years, it was characterized by long residence times and low heating rates. On the other hand, fast hydropyrolysis, the rapid decomposition of an organic material under a hydrogen atmosphere, has been primarily reported only over the last five years. There is growing interest in the topic, and this brief article reviews fast hydropyrolysis of biomass, describing previous findings, current challenges, and research opportunities for the future. The current literature shows that catalytic fast hydropyrolysis produces primarily aromatic hydrocarbons, but alkanes and naphthenes can also be produced under appropriate conditions if a secondary unit is added for hydrotreating (ex-situ upgrading). Compared to catalytic fast pyrolysis, the higher yields of hydrocarbons and much slower catalyst deactivation due to coking promising. Yields in the range of 80-95 gal/t can be obtained, and the process economics is equivalent to those of other biofuel processes, such as fast pyrolysis followed by hydrotreating/hydrocracking. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study is aimed at investigating the effect of operating factors of engine load and speed as well as blended levels of biodiesel and ethanol in diesel fuel on the emission characteristics of DI diesel engine. The experiments were designed using a statistical tool known as Design of Experiments (DoE) based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The resultant quadratic models of the response surface methodology were helpful to predict the response parameters such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and total hydrocarbon (THC) and smoke opacity and further to identify the significant interactions between the input factors on the responses. The results depicted that biodiesel and ethanol could reduce CO and HC emissions as well as smoke opacity and enhance CO2 which indicated a more quality in fuel combustion. However over adding these biofuels in diesel led their detrimental impacts to be dominant over advantages of biodiesel and ethanol and as result emissions tended to increase. Optimization of independent variables was performed using the desirability approach of the response surface methodology with the goal of minimizing CO, THC, NOx and smoke opacity and maximizing CO2. An engine load of 80% of full load bar, speed of 2800 rpm and a blend of 26% biodiesel, 11% ethanol and 63% diesel were found to be optimal values with a high desirability of 74% for the test engine having 0. 013% of CO, 41 ppm of HC, 643 ppm of NOx, 12% of smoke opacity and 7.3% of CO2. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrogen production via steam reforming of the bio-oil from corn cob by fast pyrolysis with in situ CO2 sorption was investigated. The CaO obtained by calcining Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O showed the best CO2 adsorption efficiency among the three kinds of CaO from different precursors, and thus was selected as CO2 sorbent used in the sorption-enhanced steam reforming process. For the bio-oil steam reforming, when the liquid hourly space velocity was lower than 0.15 h-1, the yield and concentration of H2 tended to the maximum. With the comparison to the case without CO2 sorption, the yield and concentration of H2 with CO2 sorption were obviously improved with the carbon deposition effectively inhibited during the temperature range between 650 °C and 850 °C and the S/C range between 9 and 15. Through the sorption-enhanced steam reforming process, the highest hydrogen yield and concentration were obtained between 750 °C and 800 °C at S/C ratio of 12, and they were over 85% and 90%, respectively. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - River snail shells-derived CaO was used as a heterogeneous catalyst to synthesize biodiesel via transesterification of palm oil with methanol. The shell materials were calcined in air at 600-1000 °C for 3 h. Physicochemical properties of the resulting catalysts were characterized by TGA-DTG, XRD, SEM, BET, XRF, FT-IR and TPD. CaO catalyzed transesterification mechanism of palm oil into biodiesel was verified. The effects of adding a co-solvent on kinetic of the reaction and %FAME yield were investigated. %FAME yield of 98.5% ± 1.5 was achieved under the optimal conditions of catalyst/oil ratio of 5 wt.%; methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1; reaction temperature of 65 °C; 10% v/v of THF in methanol and reaction time of 90 min. The results ascertained that river snail shells is a novel raw material for preparation of CaO catalyst and the co-solvent method successfully decreases the reaction time and biodiesel production cost. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Acid-base bifunctional superparamagnetic FeZrOx nanoparticles were synthesized via a two-step process of solvothermal treatment and hydrolysis-condensation, and were further employed to catalyze the conversion of ethyl levulinate (EL) to γ-valerolactone (GVL) using ethanol as both H-donor and solvent. ZrFeO(1:3)-300 nanoparticles (12.7 nm) with Fe3O4 core covered by ZrO2 layer (0.65 nm thickness) having well-distributed acid-base sites (0.39 vs 0.28 mmol/g), moderate surface area (181 m2/g), pore size (9.8 nm), and strong magnetism (35.4 Am2 kg-1) exhibited superior catalytic performance, giving a high GVL yield of 87.2% at 230 °C in 3 h. The combination of the nanoparticles with solid acid HY2.6 promoted the direct transformation of sugars to produce GVL in moderate yield (around 45%). Moreover, the nanocatalyst was easily recovered by a magnet for six cycles with an average GVL yield of 83.9% from EL. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Increasing numbers of materials have been extensively used as platforms for enzyme immobilization to improve catalytic performance. However, activity of the most of the enzymes was declined after immobilization. Here, we develop a surfactant-activated lipase-inorganic flowerlike hybrid nanomaterials with rational design based on interfacial activation and self-assembly. The resulting surfactant-activated lipase-inorganic hybird nanoflower (activated hNF-lipase) exhibited 460% and 200% higher activity than native lipase and conventional lipase-inorganic hybird nanoflower (hNF-lipase). Furthermore, the activated hNF-lipase displayed good reusability due to its monodispersity and mechanical properties, and had excellent long-time stability. The superior catalytic performances were attributed to both the conformational modulation of surfactants and hierarchical structure of nanoflowers, which not only anchored lipases in an active form, but also decreased the enzyme-support negative interaction and mass-transfer limitations. This new biocatalytic system is promising to find widespread use in applications related to biomedicine, biosensor, and biodiesel.

AB  - Fuel-cell grade H2 has been produced by the sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of acetic acid, a model compound of the bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of biomass. A Pd/Ni-Co catalyst derived from a hydrotalcite-like material (HT) with dolomite as CO2 sorbent was used in the process. A fixed-bed reactor with three temperature zones was employed to favor the catalytic steam reforming reaction in the high-temperature segment, the SESR reaction in the intermediate-temperature part, as well as the water-gas shift (WGS) and CO2 capture reactions in the low-temperature segment. Different conditions of pressure, temperature, steam/C molar ratio and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the feed were evaluated. Higher steam/C molar ratios and lower WHSV values facilitated the production of H2 and reduced the concentrations of CH4, CO and CO2 in the produced gas. A fuel-cell grade H2 stream with a H2 purity of 99.8vol.% and H2 yield of 86.7% was produced at atmospheric pressure, with a steam/C ratio of 3, a WHSV of 0.893h-1 and a temperature of 575°C in the intermediate part of the reactor (675°C in the upper segment and 425°C in the bottom part). At high pressure conditions (15atm) a maximum H2 concentration of 98.31vol.% with a H2 yield of 79.81% was obtained at 725°C in the intermediate segment of the reactor (825°C in the upper segment and 575°C in the bottom part). Under these conditions an effluent stream with a CO concentration below 10ppm (detection limit) was obtained at both low and high pressure, making it suitable for direct use in fuel cell applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Hermetia illucens larvae by nature are a decomposer which fed on organic wastes. This study explores the potential of producing biodiesel using lipids from H. illucens larvae. Three types of organic wastes (sewage sludge, fruit waste and palm decanter cake from oil palm mill) were selected based on considerable generation and disposal concern in the area of study as well as lack of investigations as feed for Hermetia illucens larvae in current literatures. Growth rate of the larvae was determined with studying the changes in the biomass per day. H. illucens larvae fed with fruit waste and palm decanter cake have shown growth rates of 0.52 ± 0.02 and 0.23 ± 0.09 g d-1, respectively. No positive sign of growth were observed in the larvae fed with treated sewage sludge (-0.04 ± 0.01 g d-1). Biodiesel as fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was synthesized by transesterification of the larvae lipid using sulphuric acid as catalyst in methanol. FAME produced was ascertained using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and GC-MS. The main compositions of fatty acid were found to be C12:0, C16:0 and C18:1n9c. Fatty acid composition of C12:0 fed with fruit waste, sewage sludge and palm decanter was found to be most abundant in the larvae lipid. The amount of C12:0 obtained was 76.13%, 58.31% and 48.06%, respectively. In addition, fatty acid of C16:0 was attained at 16.48% and 25.48% fed with sewage sludge and palm decanter, respectively. Based on the findings, FAME derived from larvae lipids is feasible to be used for biodiesel production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A tubular batch micro-reactor system was used for hydrothermal gasification (HTG) of Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) as green macroalgae found in the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, Iran. Non-catalytic tests were performed to determine the optimum condition for hydrogen production. Hydrochar, as a solid residue of non-catalytic HTG was characterized by BET, FESEM, and ICP-OES methods to determine its physiochemical properties. Surface area and pore volume of C. glomerata increased drastically after HTG. Also, the aqueous products were identified and quantified by GC–MS and GC-FID methods. Hydrochar was loaded to the reactor to determine its catalytic effect on HTG. HTG was promoted by inorganic compounds in the hydrochar and its porosity. The maximum hydrogen yield of 9.63 mmol/g was observed in the presence of algal hydrochar with the weight ratio of 0.4 to feedstock. Also, acids production was inhibited while phenol production was promoted in the presence of hydrochar. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Torrefaction of pine wood was performed in a tube furnace at three temperatures (220, 250, and 280 °C) for 30 min. Then catalytic pyrolysis of raw and torrefied pine wood was performed using HZSM-5 catalyst in a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor at 550 °C for 15 min. Torrefaction pretreatment and catalytic pyrolysis have an very important effect on the yield, property, and energy distribution of pyrolysis products. The results showed that the yield of biochar rapidly increased, while that of bio-oil decreased with increasing torrefaction temperature. The oxy-compound content of bio-oil, such as acids and aldehydes, sharply decreased. However, the aromatic hydrocarbon content not only increased but also further promoted by HZSM-5 catalyst. With highest mass yields and energy yields, biochar was also the very important product of pyrolysis. The oxygen content in biomass was mainly removed in the form of CO2 and H2O, leading to increasing CO2 content in non-condensable gas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel from non-edible seeds has attracted the attention of the authors to investigate Hevea brasiliensis (HB) and Ricinus communis (RC) as potential feedstocks. Biodiesel production was carried out using esterification-neutralization-transesterification (ENT) process. The transesterification process was carried out under variation methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, reaction time and speed agitation. On top of that, optimization was evaluated using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and a quadratic polynomial model for ENT method. The optimization results show that production biodiesel from HBME and RCME with ENT method were 99.32% and 99.07% respectively. All the properties measured for produced methyl ester met in ASTMD 6751. Moreover, the presence of ricinoleic (α-elaeostearic) in RCME can improve the cold point, pour point and cold filter plugging point, which resulted in -40.4 °C, -27.8 °C and -35.0 °C respectively. The results of the cold flow properties are better due to higher unsaturated fatty acid concentration. It is indicates that RCME has good performance during cold weather engine operation. It short, biodiesel production using ENT method can produce high methyl ester yield and good biodiesel properties. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work presents the comparison between CFD and experimental results obtained on a sensible thermal energy storage system based on alumina beads freely poured into a carbon steel tank. Experimental investigations of charging and discharging phases were carried out at a constant mass flow rate using air as heat transfer fluid. The experimental set-up was instrumented with several thermocouples to detect axial and radial temperature distribution as well as reservoir wall temperature. The experimental results were compared with those obtained from CFD simulations carried out with the FLUENT software. The computational domain consists of an axisymmetric tank of cylindrical shape filled with a porous bed coupled with the wall. The governing equations are solved for incompressible turbulent flow and fully developed forced convection, based on the two-phase transient model equation (LTNE-local thermal non-equilibrium) to calculate the temperature of fluid and solid phases. The porosity of the bed is considered variable in the radial direction, while the thermodynamic properties of both phases are temperature-dependent. The influence of the thermal dispersion within the porous bed, as well as the effective conductivity between the beads was considered. The heat transfer coefficient was calculated according to correlation for forced convection within porous media. Numerical results show a good agreement with experimental ones if thermal properties are considered temperature-dependent and the experimental temperature profile at the inlet of the bed is applied as a boundary condition in the simulations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study evaluated the steam gasification potential of three residues from Brazilian agro-industry by assessing their reaction kinetics and syngas production at temperatures from 650 to 850 °C and a steam partial pressure range of 0.05 to 0.3 bar. The transition temperature between kinetic control and diffusion control regimes was identified. Prior to the gasification tests, the raw biomasses, namely apple pomace, spent coffee grounds and sawdust, were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor under controlled conditions. Gasification tests were performed isothermally in a magnetic suspension thermobalance and the reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph with TCD/FID detectors. According to the characterization results, the samples presented higher carbon and lower volatile matter contents than the biomasses. Nevertheless, all of the materials had high calorific value. Syngas production was influenced by both temperature and steam partial pressure. Higher concentrations of H2 and CO were found in the conversion range of 50–80% and higher concentrations of CO2 in conversions around 10%, for all the gasified biochars. The H2/CO decreased with increasing temperature, mainly in kinetic control regime, in the lower temperature range. The results indicate the gasification potential of Brazilian biomass residues and are an initial and important step in the development of gasification processes in Brazil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conversion of Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) as a Caspian Sea's green macroalgae into gaseous, liquid and solid products was carried out via pyrolysis at different temperatures to determine its potential for bio-oil and hydrogen-rich gas production for further industrial utilization. Non-catalytic tests were performed to determine the optimum condition for bio-oil production. The highest portion of bio-oil was retrieved at 500 °C. The catalytic test was performed using the bio-char derived at 500 °C as a catalyst. Effect of the addition of the algal bio-char on the composition of the bio-oil and also gaseous products was investigated. Pyrolysis derived bio-char was characterized by BET, FESEM and ICP method to show its surface area, porosity, and presence of inorganic metals on its surface, respectively. Phenols were increased from 8.5 to 20.76 area% by the addition of bio-char. Moreover, the hydrogen concentration and hydrogen selectivity were also enhanced by the factors of 1.37, 1.59 respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Macro-algae are recognized as a potential feedstock for renewable energy and fuel production. Saccharina japonica is a kind of macro-algae that has been extensively cultivated in Korea. Through pyrolysis, S. japonica can be converted into bio-oil, gas, and char. In this study, we investigated the fast pyrolysis of S. japonica in a fixed-bed reactor at different temperatures from 350 to 550 °C with sweeping-gas flow rates of 100, 300, and 500 ml/min. As the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 350 °C to 500 °C, the bio-oil yields decreased while the gas yields increased. The highest liquid yield (40.91 wt%) was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 350 °C with a sweeping-gas velocity of 300 ml/min. The major compositions in the bio-oil were di-anhydromannitol (34.45%), iso-sorbide (19.84%), and 2-methyl furyl ketone (8.43%). The gas products (including CO, CO2, H2, and hydrocarbon gases from C1 to C4), were analyzed by gas chromatography with an FID and a TCD. The bio-chars contained a high carbonaceous content can be used as a pollution-free solid fuel or for the production of activated carbon and other chemicals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Like ester type biodiesel fuel, green diesel is a next generation transportation fuel emerging due to the need for a renewable replacement of internal combustion engine fuel, which is also fully compatible with existing automotive powertrain systems. Besides other limitations, the main obstacle for wider application of such renewable fuels is their relatively high production cost, depending mainly on the raw material cost and the application of more efficient processing technology. Green diesel and ester type biodiesel can be produced from waste vegetable oil by catalytic hydrogenation, homogeneous alkali catalysed transesterification and supercritical non-catalytic transesterification. Techno-economic analysis and the sensitivity analysis reveal that economics of these production technologies strongly depend on the process unit capacity and the cost of feedstock. Green diesel production by catalytic hydroprocessing located in a petroleum refinery appears to be the most cost effective option for unit capacity close to and above 200,000 tonnes/year. Conventional ester biodiesel process and non-catalytic ester biodiesel process under supercritical conditions are less profitable at specified capacity. Unit capacities of the investigated processes which are below 100,000 tonnes/year are likely to result in negative net present values after 10 years of project lifetime. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alkyl levulinates are biobased chemicals with a great number of applications and great biofuel potential for blending to conventional diesel or gasoline. The present work focuses on the liquid-phase synthesis of butyl levulinate (BL) by esterification of levulinic acid (LA) with 1-butanol (BuOH) using a set of acidic ion-exchange resins. Experiments were performed at 80 °C and 2.5 MPa in a batch reactor by using an initial molar ratio AL/BuOH of 1/3 and a catalyst loading of 0.8%. It has been found that BL could be successfully obtained over ion-exchange resins with a selectivity higher than 99.5%. LA conversions ranged from 64% (Amberlyst 46, macroreticular, surface sulfonated) to 94% (Dowex 50Wx2, gel-type resin, conventionally sulfonated) at 8 h reaction time. By comparing their catalytic behavior, it was seen that resins morphology plays a very important role in the synthesis of BL making easier the access of reactants to acid sites. Accessibility of LA and BuOH to acid centers was high over highly swollen and low polymer density resins. Thus, gel-type resins with low divinylbenzene (DVB) content have been found as the most suitable to produce BL, e.g. Dowex 50Wx2, Dowex 50Wx4 and Purolite® CT224. Among them, Dowex 50Wx2 (2% DVB) is the most efficient catalyst tested. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bio-oils were produced through intermediate (IP) and fast pyrolysis (FP), using Eucalyptus sp. (hardwood) and Picea abies (softwood), wood wastes produced in large scale in Pulp and Paper industries. Characterization of these bio-oils was made using GC/qMS and GC × GC/TOFMS. The use of GC × GC provided a broader characterization of bio-oils and it allowed tracing potential markers of hardwood bio-oil, such as dimethoxy-phenols, which might co-elute in 1D-GC. Catalytic FP increased the percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons in P. abies bio-oil, indicating its potential for fuel production. However, the presence of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) draws attention to the need of a proper management of pyrolysis process in order to avoid the production of toxic compounds and also to the importance of GC. ×. GC/TOFMS use to avoid co-elutions and consequent inaccuracies related to identification and quantification associated with GC/qMS. Ketones and phenols were the major bio-oil compounds and they might be applied to polymer production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sewage sludge fast pyrolysis bio-oil, produced in a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) in the 450-600°C range, has been characterized. On the one hand, the effect of temperature on bio-oil composition has been analyzed by means of online chromatography and, furthermore, the ultimate analysis and the higher heating value of each liquid have been determined. On the other hand, the bio-oil collected at 500°C, at which the liquid yield is maximized (77 wt.% on dry ash free), has been characterized in detail by determining its density, viscosity, water content and pH. The major organic compounds in the bio-oil were oxygenated and nitrogenated ones (phenols, ketones, alcohols, amides and nitriles among others). It is noteworthy that the bio-oil obtained in this work contains a lower amount of O than those derived from lignocellulosic materials; therefore, the concentrations of C and H in this bio-oil, as well as the lower heating value (LHV), are higher. In addition, the simulated distillation reveals that > 70% of the sewage sludge pyrolysis oil corresponds to the gasoil range. The fuel properties of sewage sludge bio-oil evidence that it has the potential to substitute conventional fuels; however, some properties need to be improved, i.e., the heating value should be increased and the nitrogen content reduced by subjecting this bio-oil to further treatments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To evaluate the influence of metals on the catalytic activity of HZSM-5 zeolite, the catalytic fast pyrolysis of sawdust was investigated using a vertical two-stage reactor with Fe- (different loading amounts), Zr-, and Co-modified zeolite catalysts. Simultaneously, the effects of biomass pretreatments (HCl, NaOH, and NaBH4 impregnation) were also explored. Increasing the temperature of the catalytic reaction from 450 to 650 °C led to simplification of the composition of the bio-oil, and there was a marked increase in the content and yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. With respect to modification of the catalyst, 4Co/HZSM-5 produced the highest gas and coke yields, whereas 4Fe/HZSM-5 and 4Zr/HZSM-5 exhibited similar effects on the product yields and demonstrated better features in the catalytic process than HZSM-5, resulting in a content of over 45% aromatic hydrocarbons in the generated bio-oil. The 4Zr/HZSM-5 catalyst promoted the formation of more benzene and its derivatives, whereas 4Fe/HZSM-5 produced a higher yield of naphthalene and its derivatives. With increased Fe loading, catalytic deoxygenation and hydrocarbon formation became more effective. A reaction pathway leading to aromatics is proposed to describe the catalytic pyrolysis process. HCl and NaBH4 pretreatments largely promoted the formation of hydrocarbons, whereas NaOH pretreatment was favorable for the formation of phenolics. The combined utilization of biomass pretreatments and 4Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was found to be an effective method for upgrading bio-oil. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A highly efficient ruthenium pincer-catalyzed Guerbet-type process for the production of biofuel from ethanol has been developed. It produces the highest conversion of ethanol (73.4%, 0.02 mol% catalyst) for a Guerbet-type reaction, including significant amounts of C4 (35.8% yield), C6 (28.2% yield), and C8 (9.4% yield) alcohols. Catalyst loadings as low as 0.001 mol% can be used, leading to a record turnover number of 18 »209. Mechanistic studies reveal the likely active ruthenium species and the main deactivation process. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The enzymatic production of biodiesel by methanolysis of canola oil was studied using self-made biocatalysts. Mesoporous SBA-15 nanoparticles were prepared, characterized and functionalized by 3-glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane. Lipases from Candida antarctica (CALB), Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) and Rhizomucor miehei (RML) were covalently immobilized onto SBA-epoxy. Thermal stability and the influence of methanol concentration on the catalytic activity were also evaluated. Higher thermal stability and methanol tolerance for immobilized derivatives were achieved compared to the free enzyme. In an optimization study, the effect of water, t-butanol and blue silica gel as water adsorbent on the yield of FAME was considered. For the SBA-RML catalysed reaction, water had little effect in increasing FAME yield, but when 20 wt% water by substrate weight was added to the SBA-TLL catalysed reaction, the methyl ester content reached nearly complete conversion (98% FAME). t-Butanol had a great effect on yield, with almost complete conversion for SBA-RML and SBA-TLL. The effect of blue silica gel also was investigated. The immobilized TLL was quite stable and can be reused for 20 cycles without significant loss in activity (6%). RML and CALB also presented a good reusability, keeping 95% of their initial activities after 7 and 15 cycles of the reaction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential of banana peels as a suitable catalyst for conversion of Bauhinia monandra seed oil (BMSO) to fatty acidy methyl ester (FAME) in a transesterification reaction was investigated. The FAME was produced through a two-step method of esterification and transesterification. The high free fatty acid (FFA) content of BMSO was reduced in the esterification reaction to less than 1% using reaction conditions of methanol/FFA molar ratio of 46:1, Fe2(SO4)3 of 12 wt.%, and reaction time of 75 min. The design of experiments (DoE) was applied in the transesterification step to investigate the effect of pertinent process parameters on the yield of BMME (Bauhinia monandra methyl esters). The results showed that BMME, which is consistent with ASTM D-6751 and EN 14214 standards, can be obtained at an optimum yield of 98.5 ± 0.18 wt.% using catalyst loading of 2.75 wt.%, methanol/oil molar ratio of 7.6:1 and reaction time of 69.02 min. FT-IR, XRD, SEM and elemental analysis revealed that the catalytic action of banana peels was as a result of the potassium content and the microstructural formation when calcined at 700 °C. The study revealed the possibility of developing heterogeneous catalyst from banana peels for FAME production, which may reduce the overall cost of production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (BFCs) may power implanted medical devices and will rely on the use of glucose and O2 available in human bodily fluids. Other than well-established experiments in aqueous buffer, little work has been performed in whole human blood because it contains numerous inhibiting molecules. Here, we tested our BFCs in 30 anonymized, random and disease-free whole human blood samples. We show that by designing our anodic and cathodic bioelectrocatalysts with osmium based redox polymers and home-made enzymes we could reach a high selectivity and biofunctionnality. After optimization, BFCs generate power densities directly proportional to the glycaemia of human blood and reached a maximum power density of 129 μW cm-2 at 0.38 V vs. Ag/AgCl at 8.22 mM glucose. This is to our knowledge the highest power density attained so far in human blood and open the way for the powering of integrated medical feedback loops. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, a techno-economic comparison was performed considering three processes (thermochemical, biochemical and hybrid) for production of jet fuel from lignocellulosic biomass (2G) versus two processes from first generation (1G) feedstocks, including vegetable oil and sugar cane juice. Mass and energy balances were constructed for energy self-sufficient versions of these processes, not utilising any fossil energy sources, using ASPEN Plus® simulations. All of the investigated processes obtained base minimum jet selling prices (MJSP) that is substantially higher than the market jet fuel price (2-4 fold).The 1G process which converts vegetable oil, obtained the lowest MJSPs of $2.22/kg jet fuel while the two most promising 2G processes- the thermochemical (gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis) and hybrid (gasification and biochemical upgrading) processes- reached MJSPs of $2.44/kg and $2.50/kg jet fuel, respectively. According to the economic sensitivity analysis, the feedstock cost and fixed capital investment have the most influence on the MJSP. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A tandem process involving the dehydroaromatization of the terpene limonene and the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid has been found to be efficiently catalyzed by Pd-Ni/HZSM-5. The process involves the generation of p-cymene from terpene with concomitant formation of H2, which leads to the one-pot hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid to C17 and C18 alkanes; these products can be used as kerosene additives for aviation fuel. Screening a wide range of catalysts, the bimetallic Pd-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst is the most efficient, leading to quantitative conversion of stearic acid to alkanes in limonene at 280 °C at a H2 pressure of 2 bar after 120 min. It has been found that single Ni or Pd catalysts lead to a poor conversion of stearic acid in limonene at a H2 pressure of 2 bar. The combination of physically mixed Pd- and Ni-sites onto different supports (Pd/HZSM-5 or Pd/C, and Ni/HZSM-5, Ni/HY, or Ni/HBEA) leads to catalysts which show satisfactory conversion to p-cymene but generally have very low stearic acid conversion rates. Directly incorporating Pd and Ni onto the HZSM-5 scaffold forms the Pd-Ni/HZSM-5 bimetallic catalyst, which demonstrates a remarkable improvement in stearic acid conversion to C17 and C18 alkane products. In this catalyst system, Pd is shown to be the active site for limonene dehydroaromatization, while Ni catalyzes the separate stearic acid hydrodeoxygenation. The acidity of HZSM-5 (modified by the Si/Al ratios) influences the performance of the Pd-Ni bimetallic catalyst, and the proper pore size of HZSM-5 prevents side-reactions from limonene condensation. In addition, the alloyed Pd-Ni nanoparticles (optimized with higher Pd/Ni ratios) on the external surface of HZSM-5 enhance internal H• transfer between the two metals, thereby increasing the rate of stearic acid hydrodeoxygenation. The catalytic compatibility of the Pd and Ni sites, coupled with the proper pore sizes and optimized level of Brönsted acid sites in HZSM-5, result in the design of a multifunctional catalyst that is efficient for both steps of the cascade reaction. Hence, a bimetallic 5%Pd-10%Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst has been developed that allows for a simple approach for producing aromatics and hydrocarbon components present in biojet fuel derived from two biomass resources. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis bio-oil derived from empty palm fruit bunch was upgraded in supercritical ethanol (scEtOH) without using external catalysts and molecular hydrogen. The effects of the reaction temperature and time on the product yield and the quality of the upgraded oil based on parameters like the elemental content, total acid number (TAN), water content, high heating value (HHV), and viscosity were examined. At 400 °C, almost all of the organic species in the fast pyrolysis bio-oil were converted to the liquid and gas phase in 30 min, resulting in a high yield of the upgraded oil (83.0 wt%) with an enhanced HHV of 34.1 MJ kg-1 and very low values of TAN (4.8 mg KOH g-1) and water (1.6 wt%) when compared to the fast pyrolysis bio-oil (HHV, 24.3 MJ kg-1; TAN, 69.4 mg KOH g-1; water, 14.0 wt%). The major chemical species in the upgraded oil were alcohols, esters, phenols, hydrocarbons, and aromatics. After aging at 80 °C for one week, a marginal increase in the viscosity of the upgraded bio-oil was observed, indicating a significant improvement in the stability of the bio-oil. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the process performed in a commercial boiler demonstrated that the upgraded oil firing exhibited high gas temperature profiles, a high firing peak of 1599 °C, and a high total heat transfer rate of 121.81 MWth. These results are comparable to the performance parameters of conventional heavy oil-firing processes. © 2016.

AB  - The upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapors by zeolite cracking over H-ZSM5 (Si/Al 45, biomass:zeolite mass ratio 1:10) was investigated by analytical (Py-GC-MS) and preparative pyrolysis. Pine sawdust, the microalgae Spirulina platensis, seaweed (Ulva sp.), and marine fish discard were selected as representative biomass with different composition, in particular protein content (from <1% to 55% d.w.). Py-GC-MS showed that the relative product distribution from zeolite cracking was dominated by alkylated benzenes, with minor levels of benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for all the samples, while the levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (N-CCs) increased with increasing biomass protein content. Preparative pyrolysis was conducted with a semi-batch system by treating the biomass at 460 °C. The evolved vapors were subjected to zeolite cracking at 460 °C, the yields of pyrolysis fractions (char, bio-oil, aqueous phase, volatiles, coke and gas) were quantified and compared with those determined in the absence of catalytic treatment (thermal pyrolysis). Due to the reactor configuration the yields of char formed from thermal and catalytic pyrolysis were similar, while the yield of bio-oil decreased considerably after zeolite cracking with a concomitant formation of coke (6-14%), water and volatiles, which was higher for the proteinaceous biomass. However, the bio-oils from catalytic pyrolysis were characterized by lower levels of nitrogen and oxygen, a higher carbon content and a GC-MS composition dominated by monoaromatic hydrocarbons (>60%), followed by PAHs (mostly naphthalene). The relative abundance of N-CCs in catalytic bio-oil was lower in comparison to Py-GC-MS suggesting that a fraction was distributed into the aqueous phase. In general, HZSM-5 exhibited a significant dehydration, deoxygenation and denitrogenation effect favoring the formation of a "gasoline-like" bio-oil even from a highly proteinaceous biomass. However, it also induced the formation of nitrogen-containing polyaromatic compounds, like carbazoles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spent coffee grounds (SCG) were liquefied in hot-compressed water to produce crude bio-oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in a 100 cm3 stainless-steel autoclave reactor in N2 atmosphere. We investigated the effects of operating parameters such as retention times (5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min and 25 min), reaction temperatures (200 °C, 225 °C, 250 °C, 275 °C and 300 °C), and water/feedstock mass ratios (5:1, 10:1, 15:1 and 20:1) and initial pressure of process gas (2.0 MPa and 0.5 MPa) on the yield and properties of the resulting crude bio-oil. The highest yield of the crude bio-oil (47.3% mass fraction) was obtained at conditions of 275 °C, 10 min retention time and water/feedstock mass ratio of 20:1 with an initial pressure of 2.0 MPa. The elemental analysis of the produced crude bio-oil revealed that the oil product had a higher heating value (HHV) of 31.0 MJ kg-1, much higher than that of the raw material (20.2 MJ kg-1). GC-MS and FT-IR measurements showed that the main volatile compounds in the crude bio-oil were long chain aliphatic acids and esters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study dealt with biomass, lipid concentration, fatty acid profile and biodiesel properties of microalga Scenedesmus abundans under different phosphate concentrations, pH and light intensities, one at a time. Among different phosphate concentrations, higher biomass (770.10. ±. 11.0. mg/L) and lipid concentration (176.87. ±. 4.6. mg/L) were at the concentration of 60. mg/L. Light intensity at 6000. lux yielded higher biomass and lipid concentration of 742.0. ±. 9.7 and 243.15. ±. 9.1. mg/L, respectively. The biomass (769.0. ±. 12.3. mg/L) and lipid (179.47. ±. 5.5. mg/L) concentration were highest at pH 8 and pH 6, respectively. All the culture treatments showed marked effect on the fatty acid profile and biodiesel properties of the extracted oil. FAME derived biodiesel properties were compared with European biodiesel standards (EN 14214), Indian biodiesel standards (IS 15607) and American biodiesel standards (ASTM D 6751-08) to assess the suitability of algal oil as biodiesel feedstock. © 2015.s

AB  - Conversion of biomass into valuable chemicals is a highly sought process across the globe. 5-Hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) is a biobased platform chemical that can be valorized into a spectrum of fuels and chemicals. In the current work, HMF was transformed into 2,5-dimethyl furan (2,5-DMF) using a number of catalysts among which a novel bifunctional metal-acid catalyst, Pd-Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40/K-10 clay, palladium-cesium dodeca-tungstophosphoric acid supported on K-10 acidic clay, was found to be the best. Because of its high energy density, 2,5-DMF is a potential biofuel additive. The acidic nature of Cs-DTP/K-10 facilitates rapid hydrogenolysis of HMF at mild reaction conditions. 2% Pd-20% w/w CsDTP/K-10 clay designated as 2Pd-20CsDTP/K-10 gives 98% conversion of HMF with 81% selectivity to 2,5-DMF at 90 °C and 10 atm hydrogen pressure in 2 h. The catalyst was prepared by a simple and cheap wet impregnation method and characterized, both before and after reuse, by XRD, FTIR, BET surface area, NH3-TPD, TGA, TEM, and SEM. The catalyst was robust and could be used with very minimal loss of activity. The reaction mechanism and kinetics are also presented. The overall process is clean, green, and sustainable. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of pinewood sawdust and two of its major components, namely lignin and cellulose was carried out using a laboratory scale induction-heating reactor. The effect of five different temperatures (500, 550, 600, 650 and 700 °C) was tested on the product yield and quality. The products were characterized to evaluate the water content, elemental composition, chemical composition and energy content. The char yield decreased with temperature for all of the biomasses. The maximum liquid yield of 55.28% was achieved at 600 °C for pine sawdust, and the highest liquid yields for cellulose and lignin were obtained at 500 °C. Water content in the liquid fraction decreased as reaction temperature increased. The GC-MS revealed that the bio-oil from cellulose was rich in anhydrosugars while majority of the liquid from lignin had high phenolic contents. Analysis of the gas fraction shows that as the temperature increases the gas yield increases, which, when paired with the declining char masses, showed an increase in the biomass breakdown at higher temperatures. Liquid fraction from pine sawdust has the highest HHV with a peak at 550 °C. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work is to explore process parameters (pressure, time, formic acid content) for producing high-yield and high-calorific bio-oil from concentrated sulfuric acid hydrolysis lignin (CSAHL) with formic acid as an in-situ hydrogen source in supercritical ethanol (scEtOH). Even at short reaction time of 30 min, high conversion of 92% and high bio-oil yield of 85 wt% were observed at 350 °C and formic-acid-to-lignin mass ratio of 1.5 using a stirred reactor. The effective deoxy-liquefaction nature associated with scEtOH with aid of formic acid resulted in significant reduction in oxygen content of 44% and high higher heating value of 31.2 MJ kg-1 of produced bio-oil. The overall process is energetically efficient with 112% energy recovery (ER) and 78% energy efficiency (EE). The results are compared with Kraft lignin (KL) under identical reaction conditions. The inherent recalcitrant nature of CSAHL resulted in lower conversion and lower bio-oil yield when compared to the liquefaction of Kraft lignin (KL, 99% conversion, 90 wt% bio-oil yield). Bio-oil with better flow properties, low molecular weight, and a high amount of monomeric phenol was produced after 60 min of reaction. The compounds in the bio-oil were mainly phenols, esters, furans, alcohols, and traces of aliphatic hydrocarbons. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to exhaustibility of fossil fuels and their adverse effects on the environment, bio-oil has been considered as an alternative energy source for fuel applications. Currently, there are two main processes for bio-oil production: pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The hydrothermal liquefaction is defined as biomass-to-liquid conversion route carried out in the hot compressed water with or without the presence of a catalyst. The major concern in HTL is the high pressure of the process which results in high capital cost of equipment. Thus, the process pressure and temperature should be reduced, but at a lower temperature, bio-oil yield is not high enough to make HTL an economical process for sustainable fuel production. In this research, we investigated the applicability of a nanocatalyst (nano-Ni/SiO2), an acid catalyst (synthesized zeolite), and an alkali catalyst (Na2CO3) to increase the bio-oil yield at low temperatures (210 °C, 230 °C, 250 °C). The major result of this work was higher bio-oil yields with the order of nano-Ni/SiO2 &gt; zeolite &gt; Na2CO3 in hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. The highest bio-oil yield (30.0 wt%) was obtained at 250 °C by using Nano-Ni/SiO2. Moreover, applying catalyst resulted in a decrease in the oxygen and the nitrogen contents of the bio-oil and consequently an increase in its heating value. The results of this research also suggest the possibility of nanocatalyst recovery for 2–3 times. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis bio-oils are feasible energy carriers and a potential source of chemicals. Detailed characterization of bio-oils is essential to further develop its potential use. In this study, quantitative 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) was used to characterize fast pyrolysis bio-oils originated from pinewood, wheat straw, and rapeseed cake. The combination of both techniques provided new information on the chemical composition of bio-oils for further upgrading. 13C NMR analysis indicated that pinewood-based bio-oil contained mostly methoxy/hydroxyl (≈30%) and carbohydrate (≈27%) carbons; wheat straw bio-oil showed to have high amount of alkyl (≈35%) and aromatic (≈30%) carbons, while rapeseed cake-based bio-oil had great portions of alkyl carbons (≈82%). More than 200 compounds were identified and quantified using GC × GC coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID) and a time of flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS). Nonaromatics were the most abundant and comprised about 50% of the total mass of compounds identified and quantified via GC × GC. In addition, this analytical approach allowed the quantification of high value-added phenolic compounds, as well as of low molecular weight carboxylic acids and aldehydes, which exacerbate the unstable and corrosive character of the bio-oil. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Distilled and oxidized distilled bio-oils were subjected to 1st-stage mild hydrodeoxygenation and 2nd-stage full hydrodeoxygenation using nickel/silica-alumina catalyst as a means to enhance hydrocarbon yield. Raw bio-oil was treated for hydrodeoxygenation as a control to which to compare study treatments. Following two-stage hydrodeoxygenation, four types of hydrocarbons were mainly comprised of gasoline and had water contents, oxygen contents and total acid numbers of nearly zero and higher heating values of 44-45 MJ/kg. Total hydrocarbon yields for raw bio-oil, oxidized raw bio-oil, distilled bio-oil and oxidized distilled bio-oil were 11.6, 16.2, 12.9 and 20.5 wt.%, respectively. The results indicated that oxidation had the most influence on increasing the yield of gasoline fuel type followed by distillation. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry characterization showed that 66.0-76.6% of aliphatic hydrocarbons and 19.5-31.6% of aromatic hydrocarbons were the main products for oxidized bio-oils while 35.5-38.7% of aliphatic hydrocarbons and 58.2-63.1% of aromatic hydrocarbons were the main products for non-oxidized bio-oils. Both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons are important components for liquid transportation fuels and chemical products. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable and sustainable biofuel. There are various production processes to produce biodiesel from different kinds of raw materials. In this study, the environmental impacts of biodiesel production from non-edible Jatropha oil and waste cooking oil (WCO) were investigated and compared using systematic life cycle assessment. The results show that crops growing and cultivation of non-edible Jatropha curcas lead to higher environmental impacts compared to WCO process. However, biodiesel production process from Jatropha oil has better performance because the WCO process needs to consume variety of chemicals and requires a large amount of energy for the pretreatment of raw WCO and further chemical conversion to biodiesel. Results also indicate that the collection mechanism of WCO has significant contributions towards environmental impacts. In general, biodiesel production from Jatropha oil shows higher impacts for damage categories of climate change, human health and ecosystem quality whereas biodiesel production from WCO has more severe environmental impacts for resource category. The total environmental impact is 74% less in case of using WCO as raw material compared to non-edible Jatropha oil. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study was set to explore the effect of a novel soluble hybrid nanocatalyst in diesel/biodiesel fuel blends on exergetic performance parameters of a DI diesel engine. Experiments were carried out using two types of diesel/biodiesel blends (i.e., B5 and B20) at four concentrations (0, 30, 60 and 90 ppm) of the hybrid nanocatalyst, i.e., cerium oxide immobilized on amide-functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). Furthermore, the exergy analysis was performed at five different loads and two engine speeds. The results obtained revealed that the exergetic parameters were profoundly influenced by engine speed and load. In general, increasing engine speed and load increased the magnitude of the destructed exergy. Moreover, the exergy efficiency increased by increasing engine load, while it decreased by elevating engine speed. However, the applied fuel blends had approximately similar exergetic efficiency and sustainability index. Interestingly, a remarkable reduction in emissions was obtained by incorporating the soluble catalyst nanoparticles to the diesel/biodiesel blends. Thus, it could be concluded that the diesel/biodiesel blends containing amide-functionalized MWCNTs-CeO2 catalyst might substitute the use of pure diesel fuel without any unfavorable change in the exergetic performance parameters of the DI engines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transferring lignocellulose-derived compounds to cyclic hydrocarbons via aldol condensation has great potential in synthesizing high-density biofuel. But current synthesis involves large amount of solvent that inevitably affects the production efficiency. Herein, we synthesized high-density biofuel efficiently using solvent-free condensation of cyclopentanone/cyclohexanone and furfural/5-hydroxymethylfurfural. It is found that the solvent-free reaction gives much higher conversion than the diluted one does, for example 86.7% vs 62.7% for cyclopentanone/furfural condensation, and the selectivity of condensed product is above 90.0%. The reaction rate slows down when the reactant is changed from cyclohexanone to cyclopentanone or from furfural to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, but can be improved by simply increases the dosage of catalyst or reaction temperature. As a result, the yield over 85.0% is obtained for the condensation reactions. Subsequently, the condensed products were converted to branched cyclic hydrocarbons with selectivity of about 70-80%. Their density increases from 0.815 g/ml to 0.826 g/ml with the increase of carbon number, with the freezing point increasing from - 24.6 °C to - 9.5 °C. They have very low viscosity and can be used as liquid fuels alone or blended with other fuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Combining algae cultivation and wastewater treatment for biofuel production is considered the feasible way for resource utilization. An updated comprehensive techno-economic analysis method that integrates resources availability into techno-economic analysis was employed to evaluate the wastewater-based algal biofuel production with the consideration of wastewater treatment improvement, greenhouse gases emissions, biofuel production costs, and coproduct utilization. An innovative approach consisting of microalgae cultivation on centrate wastewater, microalgae harvest through flocculation, solar drying of biomass, pyrolysis of biomass to bio-oil, and utilization of co-products, was analyzed and shown to yield profound positive results in comparison with others. The estimated break even selling price of biofuel ($2.23/gallon) is very close to the acceptable level. The approach would have better overall benefits and the internal rate of return would increase up to 18.7% if three critical components, namely cultivation, harvest, and downstream conversion could achieve breakthroughs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Advanced biofuels like dimethyl-carbonate (DMC), isobutanol and n-pentanol can be derived from non-food based biomass feedstock without unsettling food supplies and biodiversity. An experimental and statistical investigation was carried out to analyze the effects of injection-timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on performance and emissions of a DI diesel engine using advanced biofuel/diesel blends (containing 8 wt% oxygen). Engine characteristics were measured under high-load condition using moderate EGR (up to 30%) and injection-timing modification (up to ±2°CA bTDC) for controlling charge-dilution and combustion-phasing. Multiple regression models developed using response surface methodology (RSM) for measured responses like nitrogen oxides (NOx), smoke opacity and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were found to be statistically significant by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Interactive effects between injection timing and EGR for all blends were analyzed using response surface plots that were fitted using developed models. Optimization was performed using desirability approach of the RSM to minimize NOx and smoke emissions simultaneously with minimum BSFC. Isobutanol/diesel blend injected at 22°CA bTDC without EGR was predicted to be optimum for the tested engine. Confirmatory tests validated that the models developed using RSM are adequate to describe the effects of the injection timing and EGR on performance and emissions characteristics using all blends as the error in prediction is within 5%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - ZSM5 zeolite was impregnated with different KOH loadings (15 wt.%, 25 wt.% and 35 wt.%) to prepare a series of KOH/ZSM5 catalysts. The catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h and then characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The catalysts were tested in the transesterification reaction in a batch reactor at 60 °C and under atmospheric pressure. It was found that KOH/ZSM5 with 35 wt.% loading showed the best catalytic performance. The best reaction conditions in the presence of KOH/ZSM5 (35 wt.%) were determined while modifying the catalyst to oil ratio and the reaction time. The highest methyl ester yield (&gt;95%) was obtained for a reaction time of 24 h, a catalyst to oil ratio of 18 wt.%, and a methanol to oil molar ratio of 12:1. The properties of produced biodiesel complied with the ASTM specifications. The catalytic stability test showed that 35KOH/ZSM5 was stable for 3 consecutive runs. Characterization of the spent catalyst indicated that a slight deactivation might be due to the leaching of potassium oxides active sites. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work addresses in-situ transesterification of wet spent coffee grounds (SCGs) for the production of biodiesel. For in-situ transesterification process, the methanol, organic solvent and acid catalyst were mixed with wet SCG in one pot and the mixture was heated for simultaneous lipid extraction and transesterification. Maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was 16.75 wt.% based on the weight of dry SCG at 95 °C. Comprehensive experiments were conducted with varying temperatures and various amounts of moisture, methanol, co-solvent and acid catalyst. Moderate polar and alcohol-miscible organic solvent is suitable for the high FAME yield. Unsaturated FAMEs are subject to oxidative cleavage by nitric acid and shorter chain (C6 and C10) FAMEs were mainly produced while sulfuric acid yielded long chain unsaturated FAMEs (C16 and C18). Utilization of wet SCGs as a biodiesel feedstock gives economic and environmental benefits by recycling the municipal waste. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lamellar and pillared ZSM-5 materials modified with Mg and Zn oxides were synthesized and tested for in-situ catalytic upgrading of eucalyptus woodchips fast-pyrolysis vapors. The introduction of silica pillars into the lamellar ZSM-5 support led to a higher BET area, but also reduced the overall catalyst acidity. The incorporation of MgO and ZnO occurred with a high dispersion over the zeolitic supports, causing also a significant reduction in the value of their textural properties due to a partial blockage of the zeolite pores. Likewise, the acid features of the zeolitic supports underwent sharp changes by the addition of both MgO and ZnO with a strong decrease in the concentration of the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites present in the parent zeolite, as detected by pyridine adsorption followed FTIR spectroscopy. However, additional Lewis acid sites were created associated to the metal oxides deposited onto the zeolitic supports. Pyrolysis tests were accomplished using a lab-scale downdraft fixed-bed reactor working at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of 500 °C. The use of zeolitic catalysts increased the gas yield, mostly due to the formation of CO and CO2, to the detriment of bio-oil production. However, the so obtained bio-oils presented higher quality in terms of H/C and O/C ratios, and larger heating values. The incorporation of MgO and ZnO allowed tailoring the zeolite activity to avoid an excessive cracking of the bio-oil, which in turn resulted in a higher yield of the organic compounds present in the bio-oil, and decreasing the formation of undesired polyaromatic hydrocarbons and coke. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Decomposition behavior of two kinds of high-protein high-ash microalgae, including wild Cyanobacteria sp. and cultivated Bacillariophyta sp., was examined via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Physicochemical properties of bio-oil were extensively investigated through various techniques. Special attention was paid on transfer behavior of elements (i.e. C and N) during HTL process. A maximum bio-oil yield of 21.10 wt% (Cyanobacteria sp.) and 18.21 wt% (Bacillariophyta sp.) on dry basis was achieved at 325 °C for 45-60 min, accompanying with the maximum (51.38% and 48.76%) of energy recovered in bio-oil. Although high HHV (33.87-36.51 MJ kg-1) and high H/C ratio (1.37-1.62) were estimated for bio-oil products, high N/C ratio (0.06-0.09) and nitrogen content (5.31-7.50%) negatively affected its quality. GC-MS analysis combining with FTIR and NMR detection revealed that components and functional structure of bio-oils were greatly distinguished from other algae bio-oil. TG analysis showed approximate 72.32-75.79% of bio-oils was distilled in the range of 200-550 °C. Large fraction of carbon and small fraction of nitrogen were recovered in bio-oils, together with high portion of nitrogen was enriched into aqueous liquid. This study demonstrated the feasibility of applying HTL to produce bio-oil from high-protein high-ash microalgae, and the findings on bio-oil properties and transfer behavior of carbon and nitrogen supplied useful information for downstream utilization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Optimum catalyst design plays a pivotal role in maximizing catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) bio-oil yield and quality. This work investigates the use of mordenite framework inverted (MFI) zeolites with hierarchical pore structures as potential catalysts to address the aforementioned challenges. Mesoporous MFI catalysts were created using both top-down and bottom-up approaches, were characterized and evaluated as CFP catalysts. CFP with mesoporous catalysts resulted in higher yields to aromatics and lower coke and char yields. The results of this study indicate that there is a maximum amount of mesopore volume required for optimal acid site accessibility leading to increased bio-oil production. After this maximum, intermediate aromatic hydrocarbons continue to polymerize to form bulky poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and coke. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of an environmentally benign sulfonated carbon microsphere catalyst for biodiesel production from waste cooking oil was investigated. This catalyst was prepared by the sequential hydrothermal carbonization and sulfonation of xylose. The morphology, surface area, and acid properties were analyzed. The surface area and acidity of the catalyst were 86 m2/g and 1.38 mmol/g, respectively. In addition, the presence of sulfonic acid on the carbon surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalytic activity was tested for biodiesel production from waste cooking oil via a two-step reaction to overcome reaction equilibrium. The highest biodiesel yield (89.6%) was obtained at a reaction temperature of 110 °C, duration time of 4 h, and catalyst loading of 10 wt% under elevated pressure 2.3 bar and 1.4 bar for first and second step, respectively. The reusability of the catalyst was investigated and showed that the biodiesel yield decreased by 9% with each cycle; however, this catalyst is still of interest because it is an example of green chemistry, is nontoxic, and makes use of xylose waste. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bifunctional metal/acid catalysts of 5 wt% Ni/HBeta, 5 wt% Fe/HBeta, 2.5 wt% Ni-2.5 wt% Fe/HBeta (NiFe-5/HBeta) and 5 wt% Ni-5 wt% Fe/HBeta (NiFe-10/HBeta) were used for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of a simulated phenolic bio-oil consisting of phenol (50 wt%), o-cresol (25 wt%) and guaiacol (25 wt%). Nickel and iron metals were supported on hydrogen form Beta zeolite (HBeta) under similar ion-exchange conditions. BET surface area and acid sites density of Ni/HBeta, Fe/HBeta, NiFe-5/HBeta and NiFe-10/HBeta were 463, 445, 455, 417 m2/g and 0.53, 0.48, 0.50, 0.38 mmol/g, respectively. Cycloalkanes (21.39 wt%) and aromatic hydrocarbons (20.21 wt%) were the dominant hydrocarbons obtained over monometallic catalysts of Ni/HBeta and Fe/HBeta through reactions of hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, respectively. It was revealed that both hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis mechanisms were effectively proceeded over the bimetallic catalyst of NiFe/HBeta which showed enhanced HDO efficiency compared to monometallic catalysts of Ni/HBeta and Fe/HBeta due to the synergistic effect between the two metals. The effect of reaction temperature on HDO efficiency of NiFe-10/HBeta catalyst was investigated at 220, 260, 300 and 340 °C. Maximum catalytic activity and hydrocarbons selectivity was observed at 300 °C. Replacement of water with methanol as solvent in HDO of the simulated phenolic bio-oil over NiFe-10/HBeta remarkably reduced the selectivity towards hydrocarbons. © 2016 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB  - Biorefineries aim to convert biomass into a spectrum of products ranging from biofuels to specialty chemicals. To achieve economically sustainable conversion, it is crucial to streamline the catalytic and downstream processing steps. In this work, a route that combines bio- and electrocatalysis to convert glucose into bio-based unsaturated nylon-6,6 is reported. An engineered strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as the initial biocatalyst for the conversion of glucose into muconic acid, with the highest reported muconic acid titer of 559.5 mg L-1 in yeast. Without any separation, muconic acid was further electrocatalytically hydrogenated to 3-hexenedioic acid in 94 % yield despite the presence of biogenic impurities. Bio-based unsaturated nylon-6,6 (unsaturated polyamide-6,6) was finally obtained by polymerization of 3-hexenedioic acid with hexamethylenediamine. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is recalcitrant to enzymatic and microbial degradation due to its chemical compositions and physical structures that inhibit the hydrolysis reactions. To obtain a high sugar yield for biofuel production, pretreatment process is generally needed to improve efficiency of hydrolysis. Here, organic acids were used to pretreat rice straw. Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effect of three pretreatment parameters, including acid concentration, treatment time, and reaction temperature, on pretreatment efficiency were evaluated and used to generate mathematic optimization model. The hydrolysis results indicated that oxalic acid pretreatment led to the highest enhancement of enzymatic saccharification up to 213.4 mg (starting from 500 mg of pretreated sample) when using 5.01% oxalic acid concentration at 135.91 °C for 30.86 min, which was 2.68 times higher than the untreated rice straw. The structural changes in the pretreated biomass were investigated using FT-IR analysis. The results suggested that lignin composition was significantly removed from the pretreated biomass, and the crystalline cellulose was also modified to amorphous form during pretreatment. Both untreated and pretreated rice straw were subjected to anaerobic digestion to evaluate the influence of organic acid pretreatment on biogas production. The highest biogas yield was 322.1 ml/g-rice straw when using citric acid pretreatment which was 7.40 times higher than untreated biomass. These results demonstrated that organic acids can be used for pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials to enhance hydrolysis and biogas production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Upgrading of bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis over Cu-modified β-zeolite catalyst in a down-draft fixed-bed reactor, in which the pyrolysis and upgrading processes are integrated, is investigated in details. It is found that high silica β-zeolite has high selectivity to the hydrocarbon during the upgrading process. When it is modified by a small amount of Cu, the selectivity can be obviously promoted. Especially, when 0.50. wt% of Cu is loaded on it, almost only hydrocarbons can be detected in the light oil of upgraded bio-oil and its activity can be remained for several reuses even without regeneration treatment. However, if more Cu is loaded, the selectivity decreases to some extent. Interestingly, low Cu loading on β-zeolite results in the increase of surface area as well as the formation of more micropores. The surface area reaches the maximum in the case of 0.50. wt% of Cu doping. Based on XRD analysis, when the loading amount is over 1.00. wt%, Cu species aggregate on the surface of zeolite, resulting the blockage of zeolite pores and the decrease of surface area. Doping of Cu decreases the coke deposit on spent catalyst but overloading of Cu results in the increase of coking and the decrease of activity and selectivity. These results indicate that the synergetic effect between the doped metal sites and the protonic sites on the zeolite structure should be benefit for the promising catalytic performance and thus, a proper loading amount is very important for this kind of catalyst. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ultrasound assisted intensification of synthesis of biodiesel from waste cooking oil using methyl acetate and immobilized lipase obtained from Thermomyces lanuginosus (Lipozyme TLIM) as a catalyst has been investigated in the present work. The reaction has also been investigated using the conventional approach based on stirring so as to establish the beneficial effects obtained due to the use of ultrasound. Effect of operating conditions such as reactant molar ratio (oil and methyl acetate), temperature and enzyme loading on the yield of biodiesel has been investigated. Optimum conditions for the conventional approach (without ultrasound) were established as reactant molar ratio of 1:12 (oil:methyl acetate), enzyme loading of 6% (w/v), temperature of 40°C and reaction time of 24 h and under these conditions, 90.1% biodiesel yield was obtained. The optimum conditions for the ultrasound assisted approach were oil to methyl acetate molar ratio of 1:9, enzyme loading of 3% (w/v), and reaction time of 3 h and the biodiesel yield obtained under these conditions was 96.1%. Use of ultrasound resulted in significant reduction in the reaction time with higher yields and lower requirement of the enzyme loading. The obtained results have clearly established that ultrasound assisted interesterification was a fast and efficient approach for biodiesel production giving significant benefits, which can help in reducing the costs of production. Reusability studies for the enzyme were also performed but it was observed that reuse of the catalyst under the optimum experimental condition resulted in reduced enzyme activity and biodiesel yield. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microbial contamination is an obstacle to widespread production of advanced biofuels and chemicals. Current practices such as process sterilization or antibiotic dosage carry excess costs or encourage the development of antibiotic resistance. We engineered Escherichia coli to assimilate melamine, a xenobiotic compound containing nitrogen. After adaptive laboratory evolution to improve pathway efficiency, the engineered strain rapidly outcompeted a control strain when melamine was supplied as the nitrogen source. We additionally engineered the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica to assimilate nitrogen from cyanamide and phosphorus from potassium phosphite, and they outcompeted contaminating strains in several low-cost feedstocks. Supplying essential growth nutrients through xenobiotic or ecologically rare chemicals provides microbial competitive advantage with minimal external risks, given that engineered biocatalysts only have improved fitness within the customized fermentation environment. © 2016; American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - The catalytic upgrading of crude bio-oils obtained through the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass remarkably improves the properties of the final bio-oil. Here, it is demonstrated that the impregnation of hierarchically structured ZSM-5 zeolites with metal cations (Sn, Cu, Ni, or Mg) promotes oxygen removal. Remarkably, the Mg-loaded hierarchical zeolite has led to the best fuel characteristics, achieving the greatest reduction in the oxygen-content and the lowest acidity. The promotion of ketonization reactions of acids with aldehydes to produce ketones seems to be favored over the Lewis acid sites created after incorporation of Mg cations at the ion exchange sites. A slightly lower deoxygenation rate is obtained for Cu-loaded hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. However, some subtle differences are identified, such as the remarkable amount of evolved CO observed in the gas fraction. Thus, decarbonylation of acids to aldehydes at Cu cations incorporated at ion exchange positions seems to be the prevalent deoxygenation reaction for this solid. Similarly, the preferential mechanism for O-removal using hierarchically structured Ni and Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts seems to proceed through decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions at the Lewis acid sites evolved after metal incorporation. Although a prevalent reaction mechanism could not be identified, lower cation incorporation at ion exchange positions could explain the inferior deoxygenation rate. In all the cation-loaded hierarchical zeolites, the incorporation of metallic species at the ion exchange sites decreases the production of aromatics, and this is linked with a lower amount of Bronsted acid sites. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microwave pyrolysis using a well-mixed bed of activated carbon as both the microwave absorber and reaction bed was investigated for its potential to recover useful products from waste palm cooking oil – a cooking oil widely used in Asia. The carbon bed provided rapid heating (∼18 °C/min) and a localized reaction hot zone that thermally promoted extensive pyrolysis cracking of the waste oil at 450 °C, leading to increased production of a biofuel product in a process taking less than 25 min. It also created a reducing reaction environment that prevented the formation of undesirable oxidized compounds in the biofuel. The pyrolysis produced a biofuel product that is low in oxygen, free of sulphur, carboxylic acid and triglycerides, and which also contains light C10-C15 hydrocarbons and a high calorific value nearly comparable to diesel fuel, thus showing great potential to be used as fuel. This pyrolysis approach offers an attractive alternative to transesterification that avoids the use of solvents and catalysts, and the need to remove free fatty acids and glycerol from the hydrocarbon product. The pyrolysis apparatus operated with an electrical power input of 1.12 kW was capable of producing a biofuel with an energy content equivalent to about 3 kW, showing a positive energy ratio of 2.7 and ≥73% recovery of the energy input to the system. The results show that the pyrolysis approach has huge potential as a technically and energetically viable means for the recovery of biofuels from the waste oil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising thermo-chemical processing technology for the production of biofuels but produces large amounts of process water. Therefore recirculation of process water from HTL of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) is investigated. Two sets of recirculation on a continuous reactor system using K2CO3 as catalyst were carried out. Following this, the process water was recirculated in batch experiments for a total of 10 rounds. To assess the effect of alkali catalyst, non-catalytic HTL process water recycling was performed with 9 recycle rounds. Both sets of experiments showed a large increase in bio-crude yields from approximately 35 to 55 wt%. The water phase and bio-crude samples from all experiments were analysed via quantitative gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) to investigate their composition and build-up of organic compounds. Overall the results show an increase in HTL conversion efficiency and a lower volume, more concentrated aqueous by-product following recycling. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To improve the quality of fast pyrolysis bio-oil, an efficient catalytic upgrading process is proposed with pristine Ni/MgO catalyst and ethanol. Esterification, hydrogenation, alkylation of aromatic ring and depolymerization of lignin-derived pyrolytic oligomers simultaneously occurred in the upgrading process. Esters, ketones and alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds were found to be the main components in the volatile fraction of the upgraded bio-oil. Under the optimal conditions, pH value and HHV (high heating value) of the upgraded bio-oil were 5.01 and 24.9 MJ kg-1, respectively. This result suggested that the properties of bio-oil could be effectively improved by the catalytic upgrading process. Moreover, carbon efficiency of this upgrading process was relatively high because that formation of coke is suppressed in the upgrading process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temperature effect on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Nannochloropsis gaditana and Chlorella sp. was investigated with 10% biomass loading at HTL temperatures of 180-330°C, and reaction time of 30 min. Maximum yields of 47.5% for Nannochloropsis sp. and 32.5% biocrude oil yields for Chlorella sp. were obtained at 300°C. The higher heating values of biocrude oils produced in this work ranged between 34 and 39 MJ/kg. 79% of energy in the Nannochloropsis sp. was recovered at 300°C and 62% of energy recovery from Chlorella sp. was achieved at 200°C. Valuable nutrients (NH3-N and PO43-) produced during the HTL process were quantified from the aqueous phase for both strains of biomass. The aqueous phase samples obtained at all temperatures were also analyzed for amino acids and carbohydrates. The suitable temperatures for extraction of lipids, amino acids and carbohydrates have been identified. Sequential HTL experiments conducted have shown the prospect of recovering nutrients and other valuable byproducts along with biocrude oil. The experimental results and analysis indicate that sustainable biofuel production requires the development of strain based strategies for the hydrothermal liquefaction process. © 2016.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuels has caused the price of petroleum to rise remarkably and created need for alternative energy such as biodiesel. In the present study, the biodiesel was produced from castor oil using ferromagnetic zinc oxide nanocomposite as heterogeneous catalyst for transesterification reaction. Single phase of nanocatalyst were confirmed by X-Ray Diffraction analysis. The spherical shape of the aggregated nanocatalyst was observed in Scanning Electron Microscopy. Magnetic properties were analysed using vibrating sample magnetometer. Atomic Force Microscopic analysis revealed the larger surface area and roughness of nanocatalyst. The biodiesel yield of 91% (w/w) was obtained in 50 min at 55 °C with 14 wt % catalyst loading and 12:1 methanol/oil ratio and was confirmed by Gas chromatograph with Mass Spectrometer. The result showed that the iron (II) doped ZnO nanocatalyst is a promising catalyst for the production of biodiesel via heterogeneous catalytic transesterification under milder reaction conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The catalytic conversion of (bio)ethanol into butanol is an attractive route to upgrade the modest fuel characteristics of this widely available bioderived substrate into a molecule that has properties much closer to conventional gasoline. The Guerbet reaction, known for more than 100 years, provides an ideal mechanism for this transformation. However, despite the apparently simple nature of this reaction for ethanol, it provides formidable challenges, especially in terms of achieving high selectivity. There have been advances in both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis in this regard, and this Perspective focuses on the very recent reports of homogeneous catalysts that describe encouraging results in terms of achieving high selectivity, mechanistic understanding, and widening scope. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The feasibility of co-digestion of chicken manure (CM) and maize silage (MS) without water dilution was investigated in 5-L digesters. Specific methane production (SMP) of 0.309 L CH4 g−1 volatile solids (VS) was achieved but only at lower %CM. Above a critical threshold for total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), estimated at 7 g N L−1, VFA accumulated with a characteristic increase in acetic acid followed by its reduction and an increase in propionic acid. During this transition the predominant methanogenic pathway was hydrogenotrophic. Methanogenesis was completely inhibited at TAN of 9 g N L−1. The low digestibility of the mixed feedstock led to a rise in digestate TS and a reduction in SMP over the 297-day experimental period. Methanogenesis appeared to be failing in one digester but was recovered by reducing the %CM. Co-digestion was feasible with CM ⩽20% of feedstock VS, and the main limiting factor was ammonia inhibition. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid additives were used as a microwave absorber to improve the low microwave absorption rate of switchgrass going through pyrolysis, and as a catalyst to improve the bio-oil and biochar characteristics. The synergistic effects were manifested in the presence of a mixture of K3PO4 and clinoptilolite or bentonite compared with single catalyst, resulting in increased microwave absorption rate, and improved bio-oil and biochar quality. The sample of microwave heating switchgrass with 10wt.% K3PO4+10wt.% bentonite reached 400°C after 2.8min, compared with 28.8min through conventional heating, producing biochar with increase in BET surface area from 0.33m2/g to 76.3m2/g compared with conventional heating. Furthermore, water content of the bio-oil reduced from 22.7 to 15.0wt.% compared with biomass mixed with 20wt.% SiC, a chemically-inert microwave absorbing material used to increase microwave heating. Introducing catalysts showed a great potential for accelerating microwave heating and improving bio-oil and biochar qualities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reactions are efficient transformation routes to upgrade biobased chemicals. Herein, we report a facile and template-free route to synthesize a series of heterogeneous nitrogen-containing alkyltriphosphonatemetal hybrids with enhancive Lewis acid and base sites, and their catalytic activity in converting biomass-derived carbonyl compounds to corresponding alcohols in 2-propanol. Particularly, a quantitative yield of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) was obtained from furfural (FUR) over organotriphosphate-zirconium hybrid (ZrPN) under mild conditions. The presence of Lewis basic sites adjacent to acid sites with an appropriate base/acid site ratio (1:0.7) in ZrPN significantly improved the yield of FFA. Mechanistic studies for the transformation of FUR to FFA with ZrPN in 2-propanol-d8 evidently indicate CTH reaction proceeding via a direct intermolecular hydrogen transfer route. It was also found that ZrPN could catalyze isomerization of C3-C6 aldoses to ketoses involving intramolecular hydrogen transfer in water. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Distilling and purifying ethanol and other products from second generation lignocellulosic biorefineries adds significant capital and operating costs to biofuel production. The energy usage associated with distillation negatively affects plant gate costs and causes environmental and life-cycle impacts, and the lower titers in fermentation caused by lower sugar concentrations from pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis increase energy and water usage and ethanol production costs. In addition, lower ethanol titers increase the volumes required for enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation vessels increase capital expenditure (CAPEX). Therefore, increasing biofuel titers has been a research focus in renewable biofuel production for several decades. In this work, we achieved approximately 230 g L-1 of monomeric sugars after high solid enzymatic hydrolysis using deacetylation and mechanical refining (DMR) processed corn stover substrates produced at the 100 kg per day scale. The high sugar concentrations and low chemical inhibitor concentrations achieved by the DMR process allowed fermentation to ethanol with titers as high as 86 g L-1, which translates into approximately 10.9% v/v ethanol. To our knowledge, this is the first time that titers greater than 10% v/v ethanol in fermentations derived from corn stover without any sugar concentration or purification steps have been reported. The potential cost savings from high sugar and ethanol titers achieved by the DMR process are also reported using TEA analysis. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Catalytic microwave pyrolysis of peanut shell (PT) and pine sawdust (PS) using activated carbon (AC) and lignite char (LC) for production of phenolic-rich bio-oil and nanotubes was investigated in this study. The effects of process parameters such as pyrolysis temperature and biomass/catalyst ratio on the yields and composition of pyrolysis products were investigated. Fast heating rates were achieved under microwave irradiation conditions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of bio-oil showed that activated carbon significantly enhanced the selectivity of phenolic c3/30/2016 4:14:58 PMompounds in bio-oil. The highest phenolics content in the bio-oil (61.19 %(area)) was achieved at 300 °C. The selectivity of phenolics in bio-oil was higher for PT sample compared to that of PS. The formation of nanotubes in PT biomass particles was observed for the first time in biomass microwave pyrolysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biorefinery process development relies on techno-economic analysis (TEA) to identify primary cost drivers, prioritize research directions, and mitigate technical risk for scale-up through development of detailed process designs. Here, we conduct TEA of a model 2000 dry metric ton-per-day lignocellulosic biorefinery that employs a two-step pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis to produce biomass-derived sugars, followed by biological lipid production, lipid recovery, and catalytic hydrotreating to produce renewable diesel blendstock (RDB). On the basis of projected near-term technical feasibility of these steps, we predict that RDB could be produced at a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of USD $9.55/gasoline-gallon-equivalent (GGE), predicated on the need for improvements in the lipid productivity and yield beyond current benchmark performance. This cost is significant given the limitations in scale and high costs for aerobic cultivation of oleaginous microbes and subsequent lipid extraction/recovery. In light of this predicted cost, we developed an alternative pathway which demonstrates that RDB costs could be substantially reduced in the near term if upgradeable fractions of biomass, in this case hemicellulose-derived sugars, are diverted to coproducts of sufficient value and market size; here, we use succinic acid as an example coproduct. The coproduction model predicts an MFSP of USD $5.28/GGE when leaving conversion and yield parameters unchanged for the fuel production pathway, leading to a change in biorefinery RDB capacity from 24 to 15 MM GGE/year and 0.13 MM tons of succinic acid per year. Additional analysis demonstrates that beyond the near-term projections assumed in the models here, further reductions in the MFSP toward $2-3/GGE (which would be competitive with fossil-based hydrocarbon fuels) are possible with additional transformational improvements in the fuel and coproduct trains, especially in terms of carbon efficiency to both fuels and coproducts, recovery and purification of fuels and coproducts, and coproduct selection and price. Overall, this analysis documents potential economics for both a hydrocarbon fuel and bioproduct process pathway and highlights prioritized research directions beyond the current benchmark to enable hydrocarbon fuel production via an oleaginous microbial platform with simultaneous coproduct manufacturing from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A systematic study was conducted to make a comparative evaluation of the effects of blending n-butanol and n-pentanol with biodiesel at 10% and 20% by volume on engine performance and on the physico-chemical characteristics of particulate emissions from a single cylinder, direct injection diesel engine. The engine was operated at a constant engine speed and at three engine loads. Compared to biodiesel, butanol-biodiesel blends lead to a maximum of 1.6% increase in the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and an increase in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 1.9-3.9% at low and medium engine loads. Pentanol-biodiesel blends result in an improvement in the BTE and a maximum of 2% increase in the BSFC. Compared to biodiesel, both the blended fuels can reduce the particulate mass and elemental carbon (EC) emissions, with butanol being more effective than pentanol. The blended fuels also show a lower emission of total particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and also a lower carcinogenic potential. However, the proportion of particulate-bound organic carbon (OC) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) are increased for the both blended fuels, especially for 20% butanol in blends. The emissions of volatile and solid particles are reduced significantly in terms of their counts for both kinds of blended fuels at medium and high engine loads, whereas the total particle counts for both 10% and 20% butanol in blended fuels are increased at low engine load due to a significant increase in particles with diameter less than 15 nm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - β-Glucosidases are diverse group of enzymes with great functional importance to biological systems. These are grouped in multiple glycoside hydrolase families based on their catalytic and sequence characteristics. Most studies carried out on β-glucosidases are focused on their industrial applications rather than their endogenous function in the target organisms. β-Glucosidases performed many functions in bacteria as they are components of large complexes called cellulosomes and are responsible for the hydrolysis of short chain oligosaccharides and cellobiose. In plants, β-glucosidases are involved in processes like formation of required intermediates for cell wall lignification, degradation of endosperm’s cell wall during germination and in plant defense against biotic stresses. Mammalian β-glucosidases are thought to play roles in metabolism of glycolipids and dietary glucosides, and signaling functions. These enzymes have diverse biotechnological applications in food, surfactant, biofuel, and agricultural industries. The search for novel and improved β-glucosidase is still continued to fulfills demand of an industrially suitable enzyme. In this review, a comprehensive overview on detailed functional roles of β-glucosidases in different organisms, their industrial applications, and recent cloning and expression studies with biochemical characterization of such enzymes is presented for the better understanding and efficient use of diverse β-glucosidases. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Palladium nanoparticles were firstly stabilized with metal-organic framework-derived porous carbon for biofuel upgrade, where the catalyst wettability is crucial. The remarkable catalytic performance of Pd/NPC-ZIF-8 in water can be attributed to the well-dispersed and electron-rich Pd sites, high surface area and hierarchical pores, as well as the favorable hydrophilicity of NPC-ZIF-8. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - The pyrolysis of poplar wood were comprehensively investigated at different pyrolysis temperatures (400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 °C) and at different heating rates (10, 30, and 50 °C/min). The results showed that BET surface area of biochar, the HHV of non-condensable gas and bio-oil reached the maximum values of 411.06 m2/g, 14.56 MJ/m3, and 14.39 MJ/kg, under the condition of 600 °C and 30 °C/min, 600 °C and 50 °C/min, and 550 °C and 50 °C/min, respectively. It was conducive to obtain high mass and energy yield of bio-oil at 500 °C and higher heating rate, while lower pyrolysis temperature and heating rate contributed towards obtaining both higher mass yield and energy yield of biochar. However, higher pyrolysis temperature and heating rate contributed to obtain both higher mass yield and energy yield of the non-condensable gas. In general, compared to the heating rate, the pyrolysis temperature had more effect on the product properties. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic fixed-bed and microwave pyrolysis of palm kernel shell using activated carbon (AC) and lignite char (LC) as catalysts and microwave receptors are investigated. The effects of process parameters including temperature and biomass:catalyst ratio on the yield and composition of pyrolysis products were studied. The addition of catalyst increased the bio-oil yield, but decreased the selectivity of phenol in fixed-bed. Catalytic microwave pyrolysis of PKS significantly enhanced the selectivity of phenol production. The highest concentration of phenol in bio-oil of 64.58 %(area) and total phenolics concentration of 71.24 %(area) were obtained at 500 °C using AC. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicated that concentration of OH, C. H, C. O and C. O functional groups in char samples decreased after pyrolysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis clearly indicated the development of liquid phase in biomass particles during microwave pyrolysis, and the mechanism is also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived phenols is important to produce the renewable biofuels. Herein, we reported a simple method to prepare magnetic nitrogen-doped carbon supported cobalt nitride catalysts (CoNx@NC) by copyrolysis of cellulose and cobalt nitrate under ammonia atmosphere. The catalysts were prepared at different temperatures and characterized by elemental analysis, atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The CoNx@NC-650 (pyrolyzed at 650°C) exhibited the best HDO activity for eugenol conversion among a series of Co-based catalysts. The yield of propylcyclohexanol from eugenol was &gt;99.9% under 2 MPa H2 at 200°C for 2 h. Moreover, a high yield of propylcyclohexane (99.1%) could be achieved when the solid acid HZSM-5 was added to the reaction system. Other lignin-derived phenolic compounds were also investigated and the yield of alkanes was &gt;90%. Based on the mechanism investigation, the catalyst demonstrated a high selectivity to cleave the Caryl-OR bond under mild conditions. (Chemical Equation Presented). © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The high-yield synthesis of the biofuel γ-valerolactone (GVL) is a challenging task, which currently stems from the depolymerization of cellulose to levulinic acid, followed by its hydrogenation. We have developed a novel integrated process for the production of GVL from hemicellulose without using liquid acids and external hydrogen. The hemicellulose feed underwent hydrolysis and consecutive dehydration to produce furfural over ZSM-5 catalyst. Subsequently, the formed furfural with 2-propanol performed tandem conversion to GVL over Au/ZrO2 catalyst combined with ZSM-5. This process gave a high yield of GVL under mild conditions: up to 61.5% based on hemicellulose. The outstanding performance was mainly ascribed to the strong interface interaction of Au with ZrO2 species, large amounts of medium-strength acid sites over ZSM-5, and efficient synergy between active metal and acid sites. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biorefineries will produce a substantial pool of lignin-enriched residues, which are currently slated to be burned for heat and power. Going forward, however, valorization strategies for residual solid lignin will be essential to the economic viability of modern biorefineries. To achieve these strategies, effective lignin depolymerization processes will be required that can convert specific lignin-enriched biorefinery substrates into products of sufficient value and market size. Base-catalyzed depolymerization (BCD) of lignin using sodium hydroxide and other basic media has been shown to be an effective depolymerization approach when using technical and isolated lignins relevant to the pulp and paper industry. To gain insights in the application of BCD to lignin-rich, biofuels-relevant residues, here we apply BCD with sodium hydroxide at two catalyst loadings and temperatures of 270, 300, and 330 °C for 40 min to residual biomass from typical and emerging biochemical conversion processes. We obtained mass balances for each fraction from BCD, and characterized the resulting aqueous and solid residues using gel permeation chromatography, NMR, and GC-MS. When taken together, these results indicate that a significant fraction (45-78%) of the starting lignin-rich material can be depolymerized to low molecular weight, water-soluble species. The yield of the aqueous soluble fraction depends significantly on biomass processing method used prior to BCD. Namely, dilute acid pretreatment results in lower water-soluble yields compared to biomass processing that involves no acid pretreatment. Also, we find that the BCD product selectivity can be tuned with temperature to give higher yields of methoxyphenols at lower temperature, and a higher relative content of benzenediols with a greater extent of alkylation on the aromatic rings at higher temperature. Overall, this study shows that residual, lignin-rich biomass produced from conventional and emerging biochemical conversion processes can be depolymerized with sodium hydroxide to produce significant yields of low molecular weight aromatics that potentially can be upgraded to fuels or chemicals. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, hydrothermal carbonization of the main lignocellulosic components was investigated as a method of renewable solid biofuel production from biomass. Hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose, xylan, and lignin was experimentally conducted between 150 °C and 280 °C, and the chemical and fuel properties of the resulting biochars were investigated. The properties of each of the three biomass components were greatly improved by hydrothermal carbonization and were similar to coal-like fuel substances; an increase in fixed carbon and carbon contents was also observed. Furthermore, by assessing carbon recovery and energetic retention efficiency, we could establish the optimum condition for hydrothermal carbonization of biomass to produce energy. The C/O and C/H ratios of all of the obtained biochars were decreased and found to be similar to those of lignite and sub-bituminous coal. The calorific values of the biochars were between 23–26 MJ/kg at a reaction temperature of 220 °C. The results of this study indicate that hydrothermal carbonization can be used as an effective method to generate highly energy-efficient renewable fuel resources from biomass. © 2016 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - In this work we investigate two renewably based alternative fuels; methanol and dimethyl ether. The ultimate feedstocks for production are wind-based electrolytic hydrogen and carbon dioxide captured from an ethanol fermentation process. Dimethyl ether production was modeled in ASPEN Plus using a previously simulated methanol production facility. The facilities use 18.6 metric tons (mt) of H2 and 138.4 mt CO2 per day. Methanol is produced at a rate 96.7 mt/day (99.5 wt%) and dimethyl ether is produced at a rate of 68.5 mt/day (99.6 wt%). A full comparative life-cycle assessment (cradle-to-grave) of both fuels was conducted to investigate their feasibility and sustainability. Renewable methanol and dimethyl ether results were independently compared and this renewable process was also compared to conventional production routes. Results show that production of dimethyl ether impacts the environment more than methanol production. However the combustion of methanol fuel evens out many of the emissions metrics compared to dimethyl ether. The largest environmental impact was found to be related to the fuel production stage for both fuels. Both biofuels were shown to be comparable to biomass-based gasification fuel production routes. Methanol and dimethyl ether from CO2 hydrogenation were shown outperform conventional petroleum based fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions 82–86%, minimizing other criteria pollutants (SOx, NOx, etc.) and reducing fossil fuel depletion by 82–91%. The inclusion of environmental impacts in feasibility analyses is of great importance in order to improve sustainable living practices. The results found here highlight the favorable feasibility of renewably produced methanol and dimethyl ether as alternative fuels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The direct conversion of glucose to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) is a promising biomass transformation due to the potential application of the product as a biofuel. Here, the conversion of glucose to EMF was examined over several solid acid catalysts in ethanol between 96 and 125°C. Among the catalysts employed, dealuminated beta zeolites [DeAl-H-beta-12.5 (700)] gave a moderate yield of EMF (37%) in a single step catalytic process. A combined catalytic system consisting of H-form zeolite and Amberlyst-15 was found to be more efficient for the transformation of glucose to EMF (46%) via a one-pot, two-step reaction protocol. Alternative biomass-based mono-, di- and polysaccharides also gave moderate to good yields of EMF with the catalytic systems, including fructose which yielded 67% of EMF and 4% of ethyl levulinate (ELevu) along with 10% 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) in the combined reaction protocol. A significant amount of ELevu (1-16%), a rehydrated product of EMF and a promising fuel additive, was observed in this study. Recyclability studies suggested that it was possible to reuse the DeAl-H-beta-12.5 (700) catalyst in consecutive reactions without significant changes in product yields due to its easy recovery and thermal stability during regeneration. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation of a model compound of lignin-derived bio-oil, guaiacol, which can be obtained from the pyrolysis of biomass to bio-oil, has attracted considerable research attention because of its huge potential as a substitute for conventional fuels. In this study, platinum-loaded HY zeolites (Pt/HY) with different Si/Al molar ratios were used as catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol, anisole, veratrole, and phenol to a range of hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane. The cyclohexane (major product) yield increased with increasing number of acid sites. To produce bio-oil with the maximum level of cyclohexane and alkylated cyclohexanes, which would be suitable as a substitute for conventional transportation fuels, the Si/Al molar ratio should be optimized to balance the Pt particle-induced hydrogenation with acid site-induced methyl group transfer. The fuel properties of real bio-oil derived from the fast pyrolysis of cork oak was improved using the Pt/HY catalyst.

AB  - To improve world energy security, lignocellulosic substrates are being used to generate inexpensive renewable biofuel. Pretreatment of these biomasses is pre-requisite to obtain fermentable sugar for production of ethanol. Crystallinity, degree of polymerization, particle size, and accessible surface area of biomass often limits decrystallization of cellulose and depolymerization of hemicellulose during pretreatment. Various pretreatment technologies employed to diverse biomasses, their mechanism of action, feasibility and practicability for production of bioethanol and other bio-based products has been compared in this article. Intelligent combinatorial pretreatment approaches such as microwave-acid-alkali, ultrasound-surfactant, supercritical carbon dioxide and hot water-acid have been applied to increase sugar yield from a wide variety of feedstocks such as sugarcane bagasse, sugarcane top, corn stover, and switchgrass. Biological pretreatment using white, brown and soft rot fungi are attractive in terms of being cost effective, low energy requiring, and eco-friendly. Emphasis to optimize integrated biorefining processes, delineate pretreatment chemistries and their impact on cellulosic biomass to obtain greater yield of fuels and co-products are the highlights of this article. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The present work illustrates the parametric effects on biodiesel production from Hevea brasiliensis oil (HBO) using flamboyant pods derived carbonaceous heterogeneous catalyst. Activated carbon (AC) was prepared maintaining 500 °C for 1 h and steam activated at optimised values of activation time 1.5 h and temperature 350 °C. Carbonaceous support was impregnated with KOH at different AC/KOH ratios. The transesterification process was optimized and significant parameters affecting the biodiesel yield was identified by Taguchi method considering four parameters viz. reaction time, reaction temperature, methanol to oil ratio and catalyst loading. The physicochemical properties of Hevea brasiliensis methyl ester (HBME) were examined experimentally at optimised condition and found to meet the global American standards for testing and materials (ASTM). The optimum condition observed to yield 89.81% of biodiesel were: reaction time 60 min, reaction temperature 55 °C, catalyst loading 3.5wt% and methanol to oil ratio 15:1. Contribution factor revealed that among four parameters considered, catalyst loading and methanol to oil ratio have more prominent effect on biodiesel yield. The cost for preparing carbonaceous catalyst support was estimated and observed to be fairly impressive. Thus, Hevea brasiliensis oil (HBO) could be considered as suitable feedstock and flamboyant pods derived carbon as effective catalyst for production of biodiesel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Compost habitats sustain a vast ensemble of microbes specializing in the degradation of lignocellulosic plant materials and are thus important both for their roles in the global carbon cycle and as potential sources of biochemical catalysts for advanced biofuels production. Studies have revealed substantial diversity in compost microbiomes, yet how this diversity relates to functions and even to the genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes remains obscure. Here, we used a metagenomic analysis of the rice straw-adapted (RSA) microbial consortia enriched from compost ecosystems to decipher the systematic and functional contexts within such a distinctive microbiome. Results: Analyses of the 16S pyrotag library and 5 Gbp of metagenomic sequence showed that the phylum Actinobacteria was the predominant group among the Bacteria in the RSA consortia, followed by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes. The CAZymes profile revealed that CAZyme genes in the RSA consortia were also widely distributed within these bacterial phyla. Strikingly, about 46.1 % of CAZyme genes were from actinomycetal communities, which harbored a substantially expanded catalog of the cellobiohydrolase, β-glucosidase, acetyl xylan esterase, arabinofuranosidase, pectin lyase, and ligninase genes. Among these communities, a variety of previously unrecognized species was found, which reveals a greater ecological functional diversity of thermophilic Actinobacteria than previously assumed. Conclusion: These data underline the pivotal role of thermophilic Actinobacteria in lignocellulose biodegradation processes in the compost habitat. Besides revealing a new benchmark for microbial enzymatic deconstruction of lignocelluloses, the results suggest that actinomycetes found in compost ecosystems are potential candidates for mining efficient lignocellulosic enzymes in the biofuel industry. © 2016 Wang et al.

AB  - Sugarcane is a major crop cultivated globally and the residue left over after the crop harvest and extraction of juice is a good biomass source that can be used for the production of several useful chemicals. The sugarcane bagasse is an excellent substrate for the production of various biochemicals and enzymes through fermentation. Now major interest is focused on the utilization of these residue for biofuel production. The sugarcane crop residue is rich in cellulose and hemicellulose, hence it can be used for the production of bioethanol and other liquid transportation fuels. The present review gives a detailed account of the availability of sugarcane residue and various commercially important products that can be produced from this residue. It also provides recent developments in R&D on the bioconversion of sugarcane crop residue for value added products. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated fast microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of corn stover and scum for bio-oil production with CaO and HZSM-5 as the catalyst. Effects of reaction temperature, CaO/HZSM-5 ratio, and corn stover/scum ratio on co-pyrolysis product fractional yields and selectivity were investigated. Results showed that co-pyrolysis temperature was selected as 550°C, which provides the maximum bio-oil and aromatic yields. Mixed CaO and HZSM-5 catalyst with the weight ratio of 1:4 increased the aromatic yield to 35.77wt.% of feedstock, which was 17% higher than that with HZSM-5 alone. Scum as the hydrogen donor, had a significant synergistic effect with corn stover to promote the production of bio-oil and aromatic hydrocarbons when the H/Ceff value exceeded 1. The maximum yield of aromatic hydrocarbons (29.3wt.%) were obtained when the optimal corn stover to scum ratio was 1:2. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Roadmaps towards sustainable bioeconomy, including the production of biofuels, in many EU countries mostly rely on biomass use. However, although biomass is renewable, the efficiency of biomass production is too low to be able to fully replace the fossil fuels. The use of land for fuel production also introduces ethical problems in increasing the food price. Harvesting solar energy by the photosynthetic machinery of plants and autotrophic microorganisms is the basis for all biomass production. This paper describes current challenges and possibilities to sustainably increase the biomass production and highlights future technologies to further enhance biofuel production directly from sunlight. The biggest scientific breakthroughs are expected to rely on a new technology called “synthetic biology”, which makes engineering of biological systems possible. It will enable direct conversion of solar energy to a fuel from inexhaustible raw materials: sun light, water and CO2. In the future, such solar biofuels are expected to be produced in engineered photosynthetic microorganisms or in completely synthetic living factories. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising technology for the conversion of a wide range of bio-feedstock into a biocrude; a mixture of chemical compounds that holds the potential for a renewable production of chemicals and fuels. Most research in hydrothermal liquefaction is performed in batch type reactors, although a continuous and energy-efficient operation is paramount for such process to be feasible. In this work an experimental campaign in a continuous bench scale unit is presented. The campaign is based on glycerol-assisted hydrothermal liquefaction of aspen wood carried out with the presence of a homogeneous catalyst at supercritical water conditions, 400°C and 300bar. Furthermore, in the experimental campaign a water phase recirculation step is incorporated to evaluate the technical feasibility of such procedure. In total, four batches of approximately 100kg of feed each were processed successfully at steady state conditions without any observation of system malfunctioning. The biocrude obtained was characterized using several analytical methods to evaluate the feasibility of the process and the quality of the product. Results showed that a high quality biocrude was obtained having a higher heating value of 34.3MJ/kg. The volatile fraction of the biocrude consisted mostly of compounds having number of carbon atoms in the C6-C12 range similar to gasoline. In terms of process feasibility, it was revealed that total organic carbon (TOC) and ash significantly accumulated in the water phase when such is recirculated for the proceeding batch. After four batches the TOC and the ash mass fraction of the water phase were 136.2 [g/L] and 12.6 [%], respectively. Water phase recirculation showed a slight increase in the biocrude quality in terms on an effective hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, but it showed no effects on the product gas composition or the pH of the water phase. The successful operation demonstrated the technical feasibility of a continuous production of high quality biocrude. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolysis bio-oil is a promising source of liquid fuels, but requires upgrading to remove excess oxygen and produce a satisfactory fuel oil. Nickel phosphide has been shown to be an active composition for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil model compounds. In this study, nickel phosphide catalysts were used for direct upgrading of an actual pyrolysis bio-oil derived from cedar chips. The activity of Ni2P deposited on an amorphous SiO2 support for HDO was first verified using the model compound, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), at the temperature of the pyrolysis oil treatment of 350°C. The Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst showed high activity for 2-MTHF hydrodeoxygenation under atmospheric pressure hydrogen with low cracking activity. Fast pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading were conducted sequentially using a laboratory-scale, two-stage system consisting of a fluidized bed pyrolyzer and a fluidized bed catalytic reactor both operating at 0.1 MPa, with a hydrogen partial pressure of 0.06 MPa. It was found that the Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst was moderately effective in upgrading the biomass pyrolysis vapors and producing a refined bio-oil with decreased oxygen content. The moderate deoxygenation of the bio-oil was confirmed by elemental analysis and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analysis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that the treated bio-oil mainly consisted of phenolic compounds, and the MS spectra before and after upgrading suggested that reactions including hydrodeoxygenation, hydrogenation, decarbonylation, and hydrolysis occurred during the upgrading. Furthermore, Ni2P supported on ZSM-5 zeolite eliminated oxygen in the bio-oil with smaller reduction in the oil yield than Ni2P supported on SiO2. The deoxygenation activity of the nickel phosphide catalysts was higher than that of conventional catalysts such as Ni/SiO2, Pd/C and an FCC-catalyst. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The development of an integrated biorefinery process capable of producing multiple products is crucial for commercialization of microalgal biofuel production. Dilute acid pretreatment has been demonstrated as an efficient approach to utilize algal biomass more fully, by hydrolyzing microalgal carbohydrates into fermentable sugars, while making the lipids more extractable, and a protein fraction available for other products. Previously, we have shown that sugar-rich liquor could be separated from solid residue by solid–liquid separation (SLS) to produce ethanol via fermentation. However, process modeling has revealed that approximately 37% of the soluble sugars were lost in the solid cake after the SLS. Herein, a Combined Algal Processing (CAP) approach with a simplified configuration has been developed to improve the total energy yield. In CAP, whole algal slurry after acid pretreatment is directly used for ethanol fermentation. The ethanol and microalgal lipids can be sequentially recovered from the fermentation broth by thermal treatment and solvent extraction. Almost all the monomeric fermentable sugars can be utilized for ethanol production without compromising the lipid recovery. The techno-economic analysis (TEA) indicates that the CAP can reduce microalgal biofuel cost by $0.95 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE), which is a 9% reduction compared to the previous biorefinery scenario. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODE) is an emerging biofuel with properties of high cetane number (CN), high oxygen content and no C-C bond, which shows a significant potential to achieve high efficient and clean combustion and to be one of the competitive alternative fuels for diesel engine. In the current study, the effects of diesel/PODE blends on the combustion and emission characteristics with the PODE volume blending ratio of 15% and 25% have been experimentally investigated in a heavy duty diesel engine. Fuel properties optimization coupled with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is utilized to achieve high efficient and clean combustion. The combustion and emission characteristics of diesel, PODE15 and PODE25 are compared at low, medium and high loads. The experimental results show that blending PODE can accelerate the combustion rate in the late combustion phase and it is also beneficial for soot emission reduction, especially at low excess air ratio conditions. The HC and CO emissions can be improved by fueling diesel/PODE blends. The NOx emission of diesel/PODE blends can be slightly improved, while the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is penalized at low and medium loads. As the NOx is further decreased to relatively low values by increasing EGR at high load, the BTE of diesel/PODE blends gradually gets close to that of diesel and shows the capability to improve BTE. The NOx-soot trade off relationship can be dramatically improved by fueling diesel/PODE blends. The weighted results over the World Harmonized Stationary Cycle (WHSC) indicate that the raw soot emission of PODE25 can meet the Euro VI soot emission standard when the weighted NOx is controlled at 2.7 g/kW h, In this case, a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device with an average conversion efficiency of 85% is adequate to meet the Euro VI NOx emission standards for PODE25, which means that the requirement on aftertreatment device for achieving low emissions can be reduced by fueling diesel/PODE blends. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in water has been proposed as a promising solar fuel instead of gaseous hydrogen because of advantages on easy storage and high energy density, being used as a fuel of a one-compartment H 2 O 2 fuel cell for producing electricity on demand with emitting only dioxygen (O 2) and water. It is highly desired to utilize the most earth-abundant seawater instead of precious pure water for the practical use of H 2 O 2 as a solar fuel. Here we have achieved efficient photocatalytic production of H 2 O 2 from the most earth-abundant seawater instead of precious pure water and O 2 in a two-compartment photoelectrochemical cell using WO 3 as a photocatalyst for water oxidation and a cobalt complex supported on a glassy-carbon substrate for the selective two-electron reduction of O 2. The concentration of H 2 O 2 produced in seawater reached 48 mM, which was high enough to operate an H 2 O 2 fuel cell.

AB  - Energy supply and its efficient use in production are key to ensuring the healthy functioning of the world economies. Based on that, to ensure sustainability, the supply and use of energy have to apply the principle of minimising negative environmental impacts and even improving the environment through net-regenerative development. In this context, ensuring cleaner energy is the cornerstone for cleaner production, especially for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, which are directly related to the types and loads of the energy sources used. This introductory article presents a review of the main lessons recently learned in the area of more efficient energy use, cleaner fuels and biofuels, cleaner production, CO 2 capture, optimisation and waste management. This article provides the readers with ideas and technologies that can be incorporated into real world solutions and can serve as the foundations for future research. With firm realisation of the importance of these issues, the 17th conference "Process Integration, Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction - PRES" was held in Prague, Czech Republic, to provide a platform for discussing ideas and devising solutions for cleaner energy supplies that are used more effectively and efficiently. This was followed by comprehensive research that resulted in several high quality scientific contributions published in the Journal of Cleaner Production. The wide topical coverage and the high quality provided excellent directions for future collaborative research of the PRES family - including process level emission minimisation, self-sufficient regions, and industrial symbiosis for optimizing usage of waste heat and waste material flows. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The thermal and catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass aims at the production of pyrolysis oil (bio-oil), which can be utilized as a source of chemicals or as a bio-crude for the production of hydrocarbon fuels. We investigated low-cost, naturally derived basic MgO materials as catalysts for the catalytic fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass as alternatives to classical acidic zeolite catalysts. The MgO catalysts were produced from natural magnesite mineral without any significant treatment besides calcination, crushing and sieving. Their structure, composition, porosity, morphology and surface properties were thoroughly examined by XRD, XRF, N2 porosimetry, SEM, TEM, TPD-CO2 and TPD-NH3. The physicochemical characteristics of the MgO catalysts depended mainly on the different production conditions (duration and temperature of calcination). Despite their negligible acidity, the MgO catalysts effectively reduced the oxygen content of the produced bio-oil and exhibited similar or even better performance compared to that of an industrial ZSM-5 catalyst formulation (i.e. non-catalytic pyrolysis: 38.9 wt.% organic bio-oil with 38.7 wt.% O2; ZSM-5 based catalyst: 20.7 wt.% organic bio-oil with 30.9 wt.% O2; selected natural MgO catalysts: 25.7 wt.% organic bio-oil with 31.0 wt.% O2 or 21.1 wt.% organic bio-oil with 28.4 wt.% O2). The basic sites of the MgO catalysts favored reduction of acids and deoxygenation via ketonization and aldol condensation reactions, as indicated by the product distribution and the composition of the bio-oil. Oxygen was removed mainly via the preferred pathway of CO2 formation, compared to CO and water as in the case of ZSM-5 zeolite. On the other hand, reaction coke slightly increased over the MgO catalysts as compared to ZSM-5; however, the MgO formed coke was oxidized/burnt at significantly lower temperatures compared to that of ZSM-5, thus enabling MgO regeneration by relatively mild calcination in air. A systematic correlation of product yields and oxygen content of bio-oil with the physicochemical properties of the MgO catalysts has been established. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Considerable amounts of fruit wastes and agro-food residues are generated worldwide as a result of food processing. Converting the bioactive components (e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, fats, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) in food wastes to biofuels is a potential remediation approach. This study highlights the characterization and hydrothermal conversion of several fruit wastes and agro-food residues such as aloe vera rind, banana peel, coconut shell, lemon peel, orange peel, pineapple peel and sugarcane bagasse to hydrogen-rich syngas through supercritical water gasification. The agro-food wastes were gasified in supercritical water to study the impacts of temperature (400-600 °C), biomass-to-water ratio (1:5 and 1:10) and reaction time (15-45 min) at a pressure range of 23-25 MPa. The catalytic effects of NaOH and K2CO3 were also investigated to maximize the hydrogen yields and selectivity. The elevated temperature (600 °C), longer reaction time (45 min) and lower feed concentration (1:10 biomass-to-water ratio) were optimal for higher hydrogen yield (0.91 mmol/g) and total gas yield (5.5 mmol/g) from orange peel. However, coconut shell with 2 wt% K2CO3 at 600 °C and 1:10 biomass-to-water ratio for 45 min revealed superior hydrogen yield (4.8 mmol/g), hydrogen selectivity (45.8%) and total gas yield (15 mmol/g) with enhanced lower heating value of the gas product (1595 kJ/Nm3). The overall findings suggest that supercritical water gasification of fruit wastes and agro-food residues could serve as an effective organic waste management technology with regards to bioenergy production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new liquid ammonia pretreatment methodology called Extractive Ammonia (EA) was developed to simultaneously convert native crystalline cellulose Iβ (CI) to a highly digestible cellulose IIII (CIII) allomorph and selectively extract up to ∼45% of the lignin from lignocellulosic biomass with near-quantitative retention of all polysaccharides. EA pretreated corn stover yielded a higher fermentable sugar yield compared to the older Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX) process while using 60% lower enzyme loading. The EA process preserves extracted lignin functionalities, offering the potential to co-produce lignin-derived fuels and chemicals in the biorefinery. The single-stage EA fractionation process achieves high biofuel yields (18.2 kg ethanol per 100 kg untreated corn stover, dry weight basis), comparable to those achieved using ionic liquid pretreatments. The EA process achieves these ethanol yields at industrially-relevant conditions using low enzyme loading (7.5 mg protein per g glucan) and high solids loading (8% glucan, w/v). © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The novelty of this manuscript is that it discusses about the experimental analysis of a new biofuel feedstock as an alternative fuel that has not drawn much attention among the researchers. An exploration for a new biofuel feedstock resulted in Cymbopogon flexuosus as an alternative energy source. Raw oil of Cymbopogon flexuosus was obtained through steam distillation process. Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel was blended with diesel fuel in various proportions on volume basis, namely 10, 20, 30, 40, and 100 percent and its properties were assessed according to American Society for Testing and Materials standards. The considered test fuel was experimentally analysed in a single cylinder diesel engine at 1500 rpm for its performance, emission and combustion characteristics. Among various blends, Fuel blend of Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel 20% + diesel 80% fuel profile stayed close to diesel fuel resulting in higher thermal efficiency and lower hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and smoke emission. However, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide emission was marginally higher for the test fuel considered. Cylinder pressure and heat release rate curves were lower at full load condition as compared with diesel fuel. Against the grim background of fossil fuel depletion, Fuel blend of Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel 20% + diesel 80% fuel acts as a promising alternative fuel and brings hope to the nation as well as the research world. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pentanol is a long-chain alcohol with five carbons in its molecular structure and is produced from renewable feedstock, which may help to improve the challenging problems of energy security and environmental issues. In this investigation, the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, direct-injection diesel engine were evaluated by using 10%, 15%, and 20% pentanol and Calophyllum inophyllum (CI) biodiesel blends in diesel under different speed conditions. The fuel properties of the blended fuels were measured and compared. Combustion attributes, such as cylinder pressure and heat-release rate, were also analyzed. Results indicated that increasing the proportion of pentanol in biodiesel blends improved the fuel properties compared with 20% blend of CI biodiesel (CI 20). The modified blends of pentanol showed reduced brake-specific fuel consumption with higher brake thermal efficiency and brake power than CI 20. Although the modified test blends showed a slightly higher nitric oxide emission, the carbon monoxide emission and unburned hydrocarbon emission for 15% and 20% blends of pentanol showed even better reduction than CI 20. Smoke emission was also reduced significantly. The carbon dioxide emission of the test blends were reduced at the maximum speed condition compared to CI 20. In terms of combustion, the modified test fuels exhibited a significant improvement, thus indicating better performance and emission. This study concluded that the 15% and 20% blends of biodiesel, diesel, and pentanol can optimize engine performance and emission without any engine modification. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Highly stretchable textile-based biofuel cells (BFCs), acting as effective self-powered sensors, have been fabricated using screen-printing of customized stress-enduring inks. Due to the synergistic effects of nanomaterial-based engineered inks and the serpentine designs, these printable bioelectronic devices endure severe mechanical deformations, e.g., stretching, indentation, or torsional twisting. Glucose and lactate BFCs with single-enzyme and membrane-free configurations generated the maximum power densities of 160 and 250 μW cm2 with the open circuit voltages of 0.44 and 0.46 V, respectively. The textile-BFCs were able to withstand repeated severe mechanical deformations with minimal impact on its structural integrity, as was indicated from their stable power output after 100 cycles of 100% stretching. By providing power signals proportional to the sweat fuel concentration, these stretchable devices act as highly selective and stable self-powered textile sensors. Their applicability to sock-based BFCs and self-powered biosensors and mechanically compliant operations was demonstrated on human subjects. These stretchable skin-worn “scavenge-sense-display” devices are expected to contribute to the development of skin-worn energy harvesting systems, advanced non-invasive self-powered sensors and wearable electronics on a stretchable garment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The consequence of using cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticle as additive in Lemongrass Oil (LGO) emulsion fuel was experimentally investigated in a single cylinder, constant speed diesel engine. A novel biofuel plant was introduced in this project, namely lemongrass whose binomial name is Cymbopogon flexuosus. The main objective of the project is to reduce the level of harmful pollutants in the exhaust such as unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and smoke. The engine performance could also be increased due to the addition of CeO2 nanoparticle. The LGO emulsion fuel was prepared in the proportion of 5% of water, 93% of LGO and 2% of span80 by volume basis. Span80 acted as surfactant and it would reduce surface tension between the liquids with a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value of 4.2. The ceria nanoparticle was dispersed with the LGO emulsion fuel in the dosage of 30 ppm (ppm). The diesel engine performance, combustion behavior and emission magnitude were compared with diesel and LGO as the base fuels. The whole investigation was conducted with a single cylinder diesel engine using the following fuels, namely neat diesel, neat LGO, LGO emulsion and LGO nano emulsion fuels respectively. The LGO emulsion fuel could reduce smoke and NOX emissions and could improve Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Brake Specific Energy Consumption (BSEC) compared with neat LGO despite the marginal increase in HC and CO emissions. For ceria nanoparticle blended test fuel, the drastic reduction of carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOX) and marginal decrease of smoke opacity emission could be achieved compared with the LGO emulsion and diesel fuel at various power outputs. Improvement in BTE was also observed for LGO nano emulsion test fuel compared to neat LGO and LGO emulsion fuels due to improved atomization and rapid evaporation rate of fuel owing to large surface area to volume ratio of CeO2 nanoparticle. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Extracellular electron transfer in microorganisms has been applied for bioelectrochemical synthesis utilizing microbes to catalyze anodic and/or cathodic biochemical reactions. Anodic reactions (electron transfer from microbe to anode) are used for current production and cathodic reactions (electron transfer from cathode to microbe) have recently been applied for current consumption for valuable biochemical production. The extensively studied exoelectrogenic bacteria Shewanella and Geobacter showed that both directions for electron transfer would be possible. It was proposed that gram-positive bacteria, in the absence of cytochrome C, would accept electrons using a cascade of membrane-bound complexes such as membrane-bound Fe-S proteins, oxidoreductase, and periplasmic enzymes. Modification of the cathode with the addition of positive charged species such as chitosan or with an increase of the interfacial area using a porous three-dimensional scaffold electrode led to increased current consumption. The extracellular electron transfer from the cathode to the microbe could catalyze various bioelectrochemical reductions. Electrofermentation used electrons from the cathode as reducing power to produce more reduced compounds such as alcohols than acids, shifting the metabolic pathway. Electrofuel could be generated through artificial photosynthesis using electrical energy instead of solar energy in the process of carbon fixation. © 2016 Choi and Sang.

AB  - Self-powered artificial nanomotors are currently attracting increased interest as mimics of biological motors but also as potential components of nanomachinery, robotics, and sensing devices. We have recently described the controlled shape transformation of polymersomes into bowl-shaped stomatocytes and the assembly of platinum-driven nanomotors. However, the platinum encapsulation inside the structures was low; only 50% of the structures contained the catalyst and required both high fuel concentrations for the propelling of the nanomotors and harsh conditions for the shape transformation. Application of the nanomotors in a biological setting requires the nanomotors to be efficiently propelled by a naturally available energy source and at biological relevant concentrations. Here we report a strategy for enzyme entrapment and nanomotor assembly via controlled and reversible folding of polymersomes into stomatocytes under mild conditions, allowing the encapsulation of the proteins inside the stomach with almost 100% efficiency and retention of activity. The resulting enzyme-driven nanomotors are capable of propelling these structures at low fuel concentrations (hydrogen peroxide or glucose) via a one-enzyme or two-enzyme system. The confinement of the enzymes inside the stomach does not hinder their activity and in fact facilitates the transfer of the substrates, while protecting them from the deactivating influences of the media. This is particularly important for future applications of nanomotors in biological settings especially for systems where fast autonomous movement occurs at physiological concentrations of fuel. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cobalt oxide hollow nanododecahedra (Co3O4-HND) is synthesized by a facile thermal transformation of cobalt-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF, ZIF-67) template. The morphology and properties of the Co3O4-HND are characterized by a set of techniques, including transmission electron microscope (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET). When tested as a non-enzymatic electrocatalyst for glucose oxidation reaction, the Co3O4-HND exhibits a high activity and shows an outstanding performance for determining glucose with a wide window of 2.0 μM to 6.06 mM, a high sensitivity of 708.4 μA mM-1 cm-2, a low detection limit of 0.58 μM (S/N=3), and fast response time(&lt;2 s). Based on the nonenzymatic oxidation of glucose, Co3O4-HND could be served as an attractive non-enzyme and noble-metal-free electrocatalyst in glucose fuel cell (GFC) due to its excellent electrochemical properties, low cost and facile preparation. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Being the only sustainable source of organic carbon, biomass is playing an ever-increasingly important role in our energy landscape. The conversion of renewable lignocellulosic biomass into liquid fuels is particularly attractive but extremely challenging due to the inertness and complexity of lignocellulose. Here we describe the direct hydrodeoxygenation of raw woods into liquid alkanes with mass yields up to 28.1 wt% over a multifunctional Pt/NbOPO 4 catalyst in cyclohexane. The superior performance of this catalyst allows simultaneous conversion of cellulose, hemicellulose and, more significantly, lignin fractions in the wood sawdust into hexane, pentane and alkylcyclohexanes, respectively. Investigation on the molecular mechanism reveals that a synergistic effect between Pt, NbO x species and acidic sites promotes this highly efficient hydrodeoxygenation of bulk lignocellulose. No chemical pretreatment of the raw woody biomass or separation is required for this one-pot process, which opens a general and energy-efficient route for converting raw lignocellulose into valuable alkanes.

AB  - Furfural is a promising renewable platform compound derived from lignocellulosic biomass that can be further converted to biofuels and biochemicals. The highly functionalized molecular structure of furfural makes it a desired raw material for the sustainable production of value-added chemicals containing oxygen atoms. The conversion of furfural to C4 and C5 chemicals by various catalytic processes is reviewed. The C5 chemicals are mainly produced through sequential steps of selective hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis, while most of the C4 chemicals are synthesized with selective oxidation as the first step. This review divides the chemical products from furfural into several groups according to their carbon numbers and synthesis routes, with emphasis on the catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The applications of these chemicals and their traditional production from fossil feedstocks have also been added as background information. Additionally, recent advances in the development of heterogeneous catalysts for furfural production are briefly reviewed. (Chemical Equation Presented). © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the last decades the interest in the biomass gasification process has increased due to the growing attention to the use of sustainable energy. Biomass is a renewable energy source and represents a valid alternative to fossil fuels. Gasification is the thermochemical conversion of an organic material into a valuable gaseous product, called syngas, and a solid product, called char. The biomass gasification represents an efficient process for the production of power and heat and the production of hydrogen and second-generation biofuels. This paper deals with the state of the art biomass gasification technologies, evaluating advantages and disadvantages, the potential use of the syngas and the application of the biomass gasification. Syngas cleaning though fundamental to evaluate any gasification technology is not included in this paper since; in the authors' opinion, a dedicated review is necessary. © 2015 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics.
