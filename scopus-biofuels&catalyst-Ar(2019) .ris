AB  - In this work, sodium titanate nanotubes were prepared by a hydrothermal method for 23 h at 160 °C and characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The obtained nanotubes were used as catalysts in the transesterification of pure and cooked oils under different experimental conditions (molar ratio, temperature, catalyst weight, and time). The catalyst showed high efficiency depending on the chosen conditions. The biodiesel yield was found to be 95.9% at 80 °C for 2 h. The catalyst also showed high activity for cooked oil conversion, with yields of 96.0, 96.0, and 93.58% for the first, second, and third uses of oil, respectively. The methanol was recycled and used in another transesterification experiment, and the biodiesel yield reached 91%. Density functional theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and molecular dynamics simulation were employed to clearly understand the transesterification mechanism. The transesterification reaction is represented by a pseudo-first-order kinetics model. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Refined palm kernel oil was trans-esterified with ethanol to produce fatty acid ethyl esters. The medium-chain fatty acid ethyl ester (bio-kerosene) was fractionated from the bottom fraction and was characterized for its properties as well as lubricity. The heat of combustion was reported at 38.32 MJ/kg which was 11.09% lower than fossil kerosene. Combustion testing in a small-scale gas-turbine jet engine was investigated without engine modification. The optimum thrust-specific fuel consumption was reported for 0.99 L/kJ at 102,200 rpm. The exhaust gas characteristic was superior to fossil kerosene due to lower emission of CO, hydrocarbon, and NO2. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Platinum- and palladium-based catalysts are commonly used in hydrogenation reactions, but they present a great disadvantage of being quite expensive. In most cases, they can be substituted by cheaper alternative catalysts formed by transition metal carbides, such as molybdenum carbide (Mo2C). Among the reactions that can be catalyzed by Mo2C, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) presents a great technological interest, especially in biofuel production. Nonetheless, the selectivity of carbides in HDO reactions of fatty acids is not well understood yet. In the present work, the reaction mechanism of the acrylic acid HDO over Mo2C, a fatty acid model molecule, was studied by density functional theory (DFT), with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and periodic boundary conditions. A global mechanism is proposed, divided in four steps, from acrylic acid to propane. In the first reaction step, decomposition by C–OH bond cleavage, with 24 kcal mol− 1 of activation energy, dominates over C=C and C=O hydrogenation. This result is in line with the absence of propanoic acid among the products and the formation of acrolein, as shown in an experimental work previously published. The proposed global mechanism is in fair agreement with the experimental findings. The main product is propane, which has the same number of carbon atoms of the reactant. This mechanism can be viewed as a model for HDO of any fatty acid catalyzed by Mo2C, since acrylic acid has the minimal structural features of fatty acids, i.e., a carboxyl group and a C=C double bond.

AB  - Abstract: Lignocellulosic biomass-derived bio-oil is considered as a promising renewable biofuel. In this paper, incipient wetness impregnation method, ammonia grafting method and direct synthesis method were employed as nickel loading methods for the preparation of Ni/Al-SBA-15 catalysts. The effects of these nickel loading approaches on the structure and hydrodeoxygenation performance of Ni/Al-SBA-15 were studied. The structure of Ni/Al-SBA-15 was significantly influenced by the nickel loading methods, including the specific surface area, the pore volume, the wall thickness and so on. Nickel loading methods also affected the actual nickel content of nickel-based catalysts. Unsuccessful loading of nickel species was observed during the preparation of Ni/Al-SBA-15 using direct synthesis method. The conversion of eugenol and selectivity of products after hydrodeoxygenation in n-dodecane over Ni/Al-SBA-15 catalysts were investigated. Results showed that the conversion of eugenol nearly reached 100% for all the reaction, but the composition of product was significantly different when using different Ni/Al-SBA-15 as hydrodeoxygenation catalyst. The reaction pathway of eugenol hydrodeoxygenation in n-dodecane was also speculated in this paper. Graphic Abstract: Effects of nickel loading approaches on the structure and hydrodeoxygenation performance of Ni/Al-SBA-15 were investigated. For the liquid phase hydrodeoxygenation of eugenol to hydrocarbon, catalysts prepared by ammonia grafting method exhibited the highest catalytic activity.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Lignin as a potential renewable source of biofuels, chemicals, and other value-added products has gained much attention. However, the complexity of lignin structure poses a significant challenge for developing efficient valorization techniques. As most processes involve solvothermal conditions to minimize energy cost, lignin depolymerization is governed by reaction conditions (temperature and pressure) and solvents. In this work, binding of β-O-4 linkage consisting lignin dimers on MWW two-dimensional (2D) zeolite is investigated using periodic density functional theory. Furthermore, the effect of different terminated surfaces (H:OH% = 100:0; 50:50; 0:100%), different temperatures (323, 353, 373 K), and different solvents (water and methanol) on the binding modes is quantified. Our work shows that in the gas phase the binding strength increases 10-15 kcal/mol upon increasing the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface. Also, the phenolic dimer binds more strongly than the nonphenolic dimer, and the binding strength of model compounds increases in the presence of the solvent. Analysis of structural changes in the presence of the solvent reveals that the aromatic rings are parallel to the zeolite surface and primary interaction with zeolite is through the hydroxyl groups near the β-O-4 linkage. Furthermore, while the solvation energy decreases with increasing temperature, the opposite trend is observed for the binding energy with the surface. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels are already part of the energy matrix in many countries because of their environmental and economic benefits. Ethyl biodiesel can be produced by various processes, the main one being transesterification of triglyceraldehydes and ethanol. The current technological challenge is to develop efficient heterogeneous catalysts, at low cost, non-polluting and recyclable to be used in this process. In this context, hydromagnesites Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2⋅4H2O modified with different cations (Ca2+, Zn2+, Cu 2+, Ba2+) and synthesized by co-precipitation are used as precursors of catalytic oxides calcined at 600 °C. The biodiesel synthesis was conducted at 120 °C for 12 h using 20% (w/w) of catalyst per mass of soybean oil and the ratio 1:20 (mol/mol) of soybean oil/ethanol. The alkyl esters formed were quantified by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID). The transesterification reaction catalyzed by the reference oxide had a yield of 40%, whereas the best yield (80%) came from the hydromagnesite modified with 20% of Ca2+ which also had the highest basicity/acidity ratio. After use in three reaction cycles, the catalyst with 20% Ca2+ had no significant reduction in efficiency when it was washed with acetone and recalcined at 600 °C, while the untreated catalyst only had a yield of 42%, showing the need for effective reconditioning. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In recent trends due to the increase in rate of petrol and diesel prices biodiesel has been used as an alternate fuel in many of the fast developing countries. However in our country also many research work has been done using different oils. In this paper instead of using a single oil, two different oils was mixed with diesel in different blends and the emissions were calculated and the results were plotted. The two different oils used was the Cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) and the Rice bran oil. Cashew oil is found to be a by-product which is available from the Cashew industry and after the transesterification process the cardanol obtained was used without any modifications. Rice bran oil is mostly found in the places where rice is grown in a huge quantity and more number of research works has not been done in this oil. By the transesterification process the rice bran oil was prepared and mixed with the CNSL in the different proportions, which was also mixed with diesel in some amounts and the different characteristics were evaluated and plotted. © BEIESP.

AB  - Abstract: This review considers the problems associated with the development and operation of highly active and stable structured catalysts for biogas/biofuel conversion into syngas and hydrogen based on nanocrystalline oxides with fluorite, perovskite, and spinel structures and their nanocomposites promoted by nanoparticles of platinum group metals and alloys based on nickel. The design of these catalysts is based on finding the relationships between the methods of their synthesis, composition, real structure/microstructure, surface properties, and oxygen mobility and reactivity largely determined by the metal–support interaction. This requires the use of modern structural, spectroscopic, kinetic methods, and mathematical modeling. Thin layers of optimized catalysts deposited on structured heat-conducting supports demonstrated high activity and resistance to carbonization in the processes of biogas and biofuels conversion into syngas, and catalysts deposited on asymmetric ceramic membranes with mixed ionic–electronic conductivity allowed oxygen or hydrogen to be separated from complex mixtures with 100% selectivity. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Research in the fields of biofuels and biochemicals production from lignocellulosic biomass has increased significantly in recent years. Furfuryl alcohol (FFA), which is the most important derivative of furfural, is of great industrial interest owing to its use in foundry technology. The only method to produce FFA is from hemicellulose-rich agricultural wastes. Thus it is considered a key green chemical in C5-based biorefinery. However, the conventional process is energy-intensive and has a low degree of integration owing to the lack of improvement. In this study, a comprehensive reaction-distillation (RD) process producing FFA from raw bio-furfural is proposed. Subsequently, a novel hybrid extraction-distillation process is suggested for improving the developed RD process. Heat integration is considered for both conventional and hybrid processes. All processes were simulated using Aspen Plus V.9. The total annual cost (TAC) and total carbon dioxide emissions (TCE) were evaluated for a fair comparison between these developed processes. The results indicate that the proposed integrated hybrid process can achieve substantial improvement as compared to the conventional process. In particular, this proposed configuration can reduce the TAC and TCE by up to 88.5% and 92.2%, respectively, compared to the RD process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aliphatic medium-chain alkanes, a major component of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels, are drop-in compatible fuels. Microorganisms with the capacity to produce medium-chain alkanes are promising for the bio-production of drop-in fuel. We found that Klebsiella sp. NBRC100048 has the ability to produce medium-chain alkanes from medium-chain aldehydes. We cloned a gene involved in conversion of aldehydes to alkanes by using a genomic fosmid library derived from Klebsiella sp. NBRC100048. The gene termed orf2991 encodes 506 amino acids and shows 62% sequence homology to the aldehyde dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli, aldB. The finding of orf2991 as a novel alkane-synthesizing enzyme gene similar to E. coli aldehyde dehydrogenase family, which is generally known to catalyze a reaction oxidizing aldehydes to fatty acids, indicated a novel function of aldehyde dehydrogenase. This finding is not only significant academically but allows developing the novel manufacturing methods of alkanes fermentation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) has been ranked as one of the “Top 10" building blocks for future bio-refineries as proposed by the US Department of Energy. It is considered one of the most important platform molecules for the production of fine chemicals and fuels based on its compatibility with existing processes, market economics, and industrial ability to serve as a platform for the synthesis of important derivatives. Hydrogenation of LA to produce γ-valerolactone (GVL) is an active area of research due to the potential of GVL to be used as a biofuel in its own right and for its subsequent transformation into hydrocarbon fuels. This paper contains a new design for a simple, cost effective, and safe hydrogenation reactor for the transformation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone (GVL) by utilizing high boiling point organic fluid. The hydrogenation reactor is composed of a heating source-organic fluid (called “DOWTHERM A” or “thermex”) and the catalytic reactor. The advantages of high boiling temperature fluids, along with advances in hydrocracking and reforming technologies driven by the oil and gas industries, make the organic concept more suitable and safer (water coming in contact with liquid metal is well understood in the metallurgical industry to be a steam explosion hazard) for heating the hydrogenation reactor. COMSOL multi-physics software version 4.3b was applied in this work and simultaneously solves the continuity, Navier-Stokes (fluid flow), energy (heat transfer), and diffusion with chemical reaction kinetics equations. It was shown that the heat flux supplied by the DOWTHERM A organic fluid could provide the necessary heat flux required for maintaining the hydrogenation process. It was found that the mass fractions of hydrogen and levulinic acid decreased along the reactor axis. The GVL mass fraction increased along the reactor axis. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - Emission characteristics and performance of biodiesel blends with 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% from fuel of SchleicheraOleosa oil, in accordance with hydrodynamic cavitation were distinguished as diesel fuel, in this work to recognize effectuality based on EN 14214 and ASTMD 6751 standards. SOME (SchleicheraOleosa Oil Methyl Ester) is mixed with diesel in 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% proportion by volume, here pure diesel is utilized as fuel and second fuel (biodiesel) is with blends of Neem oil. Neem oil helps preparing biodiesel; with transesterification procedure by adding 1% of v/v H2SO4 and third fuel are crude rice bran and rice bran biodiesel and its associated blends with diesel for enhancing diesel engine performance. Single cylinder four stroke diesel engine at diverse loading condition assists in carrying out the experiment, with blended fuel at 1500 rpm rated speed. From the experimental result, it is confirmed that diesel efficiency is superior and brake fuel consumption is lesser at loads with diesel and SOME blends. Outcomes demonstrate that superior performance and lower emissions for B10 than diesel and subsequent blends, for rice bran and neem biodiesel. Brake thermal efficiency is superior when compared with HC, diesel and CO and NOX emissions were 23%, 8.5%, and 22% smaller to diesel. Biodiesel acquired from biological materials is attaining huge interest and also it behaves as an alternative fuel. This examination distinguished with biodiesel quality produced from palm kernel oil (PKO) and lipase-transesterified palm oil (PO) based on fuel properties and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Jatropha biodiesel and Turpentine oil (methyl ester) is low and high viscosity fuels in co-operated with diesel heating value; this leads to conducive for utilization in diesel engine. © TJPRC Pvt.

AB  - The continuous rise of fuel prices and environmental concern due to emission from diesel engines has intensified the research in clean alternative fuels for improving the performance and emission of multi-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines. This makes ethanol and butanol attractive clean and renewable biofuels which are viewed promising on the grounds that they can be produced from biological matter through well-known procedures. In addition, many of their physical-chemical properties are agreeable with the needs of present engines, which make them appealing either as substitution for fossil fuels or as fuel additives. In this study, the impact of ethanol-diesel (5E, 15E and 25E) and butanol-diesel (5B, 15B and 25B) on the performance and emission of a six-cylinder, four-stroke and turbocharged compression ignition (CI) diesel engine were investigated using GT-Power computational simulation package. The numerical simulations were performed at constant engine speed of 1800 r/min and four distinct loads of brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) (4.5 bar, 7.5 bar, 10.5 bar and 12.75 bar). The performance and exhaust emissions of the engine when working with ethanol-diesel and butanol-diesel blends were compared with each other and with neat diesel fuel operation. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) values for blends were found to be slightly higher in comparison with diesel fuel operation. With respect to emissions, the results showed that carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions for ethanol and butanol blends increased compared with that of diesel fuel operations while emissions of carbon monoxide and oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) decreased. Butanol showed better performance in terms of BTE and reduced emissions (i.e. more than 70% reduction in NOX and 40% in CO) as compared with ethanol. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Objective: The development of a solvolysis process by combining microwave heating and glycerol is a promising method to enhance the economic viability of biorefinery. The application of this technology on the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is of great significance. Method: The liquefaction treatment of Populus alba ×P. glandulosa 84 K, Larix kaempferi, Phyllostachys viridis and Panicum virgatum was carried out by microwave liquefaction method. The products were divided into liquid and solid cellulose components. Using cellulose as raw material, the cellulose components were comprehensively characterized. Result: The chemical analysis result showed that the cellulose fiber had high glucan content. Infrared spectroscopy showed that the signals of lignin and hemicelluloses gradually weakened, further confirming the effective removal of hemicelluloses and lignin in the liquefaction treatment. The result of XRD analysis showed that the cellulose fibers had high crystallinity and large surface area. Conclusion: Compared with the original lignocellulosic biomass, the enzymolysis saccharification efficiency of the cellulose fiber of four kinds of raw materials was not improved to a certain degree, indicating the potential of cellulose fiber in liquefied solid product in the preparation of fuel ethanol. © 2019, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

AB  - The appropriate utilization of waste cooking oil (WCO) can benefit public health and environmental protection. Environmental benefits of biodiesel production from WCO have not been fully investigated, which cannot fully support WCO-related policy decisions and the development of related industries. Taking a typical enterprise producing biodiesel from WCO as an example, this study investigated its environmental impacts throughout the whole life cycle based on the GaBi platform, including the processes of WCO collection, pre-treatment, esterification, and transportation. Results show that the esterification stage has the largest environmental impacts by contributing 53%~96% of the total. Its environmental impacts are mainly attributable to the uses of coal, electricity, and methanol. The sensitivity analysis identifies critical factors influencing the life cycle environmental impacts: the uses of coal, electricity, and methanol and the collection distance of WCO. The life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel production from WCO are 16406 MJ•t-1 and 815 kg CO2 eq•t-1, which are lower than that of fossil-based diesel. Findings of this study can provide scientific foundations for WCO management in China. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels are the most promising sustainable fuels that can be added to the crude oil pool to refill the dwindling fossil resources. In this work, we tested a Raney-Ni catalyst for the hydrogenation of four bio-oil model compounds and their binary mixtures to assess their reactivity under mild conditions suitable for bio-oil stabilization preceding green diesel production from lingo cellulosic biomass. The hydrogenation experiments were performed at ambient hydrogen pressure at temperatures in the range 30-70 °C. Raney-Ni was found to hydrogenate all investigated model compounds efficiently; both carbonyl groups and double bonds were saturated. In addition, it was also active in the demethoxylation of guaiacol. When studying the binary mixtures, furfuryl alcohol was found to significantly inhibit the hydrogenation of the other model compounds (guaiacol and methyl isobutyl ketone) due to their very strong adsorption. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, an anthracene cross-linker is introduced to enhance the catalytic activity of glucose oxidase (GOx) based catalysts and to increase the amount of enzyme loading. The crosslinked GOx is bonded with the CNT/PEI support using the electrostatic interaction (AC[CNT/PEI/GOx]). Electrochemical evaluations are done to evaluate the performance of this catalyst and the performance of CNT/PEI/GOx catalyst is also measured as a control. According to the measurements, it is confirmed that the amount of loaded GOx increases, while K m value calculated by Lineweaver–Burk plot shows that AC[CNT/PEI/GOx] (K m : 0.73 mM) is superior to CNT/PEI/GOx (K m : 1.71 mM) without cross-linking reaction. Based on these effects, it is demonstrated that the maximum power density of the enzymatic biofuel cell using AC[CNT/PEI/GOx] increases from 21.2 µW/cm 2 to 57.4 µW/cm 2 . © 2019 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - This work describes EtOH,O2 membraneless enzymatic biofuel cells (EtOH,O2 MlessEBFCs) that employ laccase-based biocathodes and ADH/NAD+ bioanode. Laccase biocathodes were prepared by immobilizing a polypyrrole film containing different redox mediators (ruthenium and osmium complexes). The bioanode for EtOH,O2 MlessEBFCs was fabricated by immobilizing multiwalled carbon nanotubes, NAD+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (ADH), polymethylene green, and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer onto a carbon cloth platform. Maximum power density and current density were 21.0 ± 0.2 μW cm-2 and 0.15 ± 0.07 mA cm-2, respectively, in PBS (pH 6.5). Lifetime tests conducted for EtOH,O2 MlessEBFCs showed promising perspectives for their future application in miniaturized devices. © 2019 Atlantis Livros Ltda.. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was carried out on CO2 reforming catalysts using ethanol based on biofuels for the production of syngas(CO, H2), a reducing agent for NOx reduction. Ni catalyst in various supports, such as γ-AI2O3, MgO-Al2O3, SiO2, CeO2, ZrO2, showed great synthetic gas production capability, and through evaluation, resistance to performance and carbon impaction was compared. The performance assessments of the catalyst were carried out by lowering the temperature to a 50 °C range from 850 °C to 700 °C. The reaction products were analyzed via IR. The characterization of the catalysts were performed through BET, XRD, and TPR, and TG analysis was performed to check the amount of deposited coke in catalysts after the reaction. In this study, Ni/MgO-Al2O3 showed an enhanced performance on carbon deposition. Copyright © 2019 KSAE.

AB  - The utilization of artificial neural networks (ANN) for the prediction of biofuel properties, engine performance parameters, and emission of gases within statutory regulations in engine research has been topical in recent times and is predicted to replace the cumbersome and highly technical requirements of real-time engine testing. This study developed an ANN model to predict the engine performance and emission parameters of an unmodified compression ignition (CI) engine fueled with biodiesel using two fatty acid compositions as inputs. The ANN model adopted the backpropagation with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, tangent-sigmoid transfer function comprising two, eight, and eight nodes as input, hidden, and output layers respectively. The overall regression coefficient (R) was found to be 0.9998 while the R-value for predicted outputs ranged between 0.9966 and 0.9997, the root mean square error varied between 0.01834 and 0.1725, and the mean absolute percentage error was reported to be between 1.6243 % and 4.546 % showing an acceptable prediction accuracy. It was found that the MATLAB NNTool is a reliable and effective tool for the prediction of engine performance parameters and emission of CI engines using two fatty acid compositions as inputs thereby minimize the time, cost, and infrastructural requirements of real-time engine test. © International Research Publication House.

AB  - The synthesis and characterization of coconut-based heterogeneous catalysts and its application in the biofuel production has been studied. Catalyst samples were prepared according to an orthogonal experimental design where the best synthesis conditions were identified. Specifically, the catalysts were obtained from a char-based support prepared from the pyrolysis of coconut endocarp, which was chemically treated with KOH and Ca(NO3)2. Catalysts were employed for the transesterification reaction of commercial safflower oil with methanol at 60 °C to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Surface chemistry characterization of the char support and catalysts was carried out in order to understand the impact of the synthesis route on the FAMEs yield. These catalysts showed a competitive performance for biofuel production where the maximum FAMEs yield was 90.5%. © 2019 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Union of Chemists in Bulgaria

AB  - Crude glycerol (CG) is a low-cost biodiesel industry co-product in a ratio of 1:10 with the main product. The large quantities of CG produced affect the biodiesel and glycerol markets. As the composition of CG differs significantly from that of purified glycerol, the effect of CG impurities on its polymerization was evaluated. An experimental design using simulated- CG was performed to study the effect of the most abundant impurities in the CG on the polymerization and the impurities that would persist with such reaction conditions, e.g., soap and sodium. The response variable for the experimental design was the hydroxyl number of the reaction products. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to analyze differences among the reaction products obtained from different treatments. The presence of soap was the primary inhibitory factor and the bottleneck in the formation of polyglycerol via polymerization of CG. The identification of the effect of impurities of CG polymerization suggests new routes for using it in the production of high value-added chemicals.

AB  - One of the most important problems in the worldwide community is the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable sources. One of the most promising renewable sources is considered lignocellulosic biomass for it has high productivity, requires low agricultural inputs, has positive environmental impacts, is easy to process, and does not compete with food crops. In particular, from this raw material is possible to obtain different types of biofuels, e.g., syngas, bio-oil, and bioethanol. This chapter is focused on the production of bioethanol from renewable sources and the various steps of the production processes and the implementation of the technology by membrane reactors.

AB  - In line with the growing environmental awareness developed along the last decades, modern societies are urged to evolve into sustainable economics where the reuse of organic wastes represents the key feedstock for a green transaction. The oil phase obtained from different biomasses has the potential to be a source of food supplements, medicines, cosmetics, or feedstock for biofuel production. In the present work, the composition of 104 different biomasses including seeds, peels, flowers, plants, and leaves has been reviewed for the lipid content. Based on the most frequent fatty acids screened, experimental data for normal boiling point temperature, normal melting point, critical properties, and acentric factor were collected and compared with the most common estimation methods, which are functions of the molecular structure and interaction between different functional groups. New predictive equations have been proposed to reduce the estimation deviation and to provide simple correlations to be used in simulation software when dealing with biomass processes. For all the properties, the estimations proposed have an absolute average deviation equal to or lower than 4.6%. © 2019 Ana M. Sousa et al.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative and renewable biofuel for blending with fossil-based diesel. One of the challenges is to design the supply-chain network for biohydrodeoxygenated diesel (BHD) under uncertainty from both raw materials availability and the demand. The supply chain with four echelons; suppliers, factories, inventories and customers has been studied. The biodiesel factory has been simulated by commercial simulation program Pro/II to find the utility cost and biodiesel production capacity. In this study, the stochastic optimization is used to solve mathematical model of the BHD supply chain network. The proposed model is based on stochastic mixed-integer programming with chance constraints. The chance constrained optimization has been applied to design supply chain network under the uncertainty at different levels of confidence. Then optimized supply chain network has been investigated on stability of the supply chain network under the uncertainties, accuracy of the profit and the effect of penalty. This study shows profit and trade-off between profit and penalty cost with different levels of confidence of BHD supply chain under uncertainties in raw-material supply and biodiesel demand. The results show that the chance constrained optimization can be used to design optimum supply chain network under uncertainties within levels of confidence. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The performance characteristics of water-cooled, single-cylinder, four-stroke, diesel engine fuelled with neat Mustard biodiesel and two blends of octanol (Higher Hydrocarbon Alcohol, HHA) and biodiesel, i.e. MUBD80O20 (20%Volume of HHA blended in 80% volume of MUBD) and MUBD60O40 (40%Volume of HHA blended in 60% volume of MUBD) at 2400 rpm for compression ratio 18:1 were investigated. The transesterification process was used for biodiesel production with the presence of the acid catalyst (H2SO4) and methanol. Experimental results exposed that the BSFC reduced and BTE enhanced with HHA blending to mustard biodiesel. Additionally, the diesel engine EGT, when fuelled with MUBD80O20 and MUBD60O40, reduced significantly when compared to base fuel. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Pyrolysis has been considered as a promising thermochemical process that can convert biomass in nonoxidizing atmospheres to value-added liquid bio-oil, solid biochar, and noncondensable gas products. Fast pyrolysis has a better economic return because of the valuable biofuel production (e.g. bio-oil, syngas). Because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the feedstocks, the one-step pyrolysis often leads to the mixed, acidic, and highly oxygenated liquid products. Moreover, the downstream processes (e.g. deoxygenation) for the desired fuels require high costs on energy and catalysts consumption. Stepwise pyrolysis is defined as a temperature-programmed pyrolysis that can separately obtain the products from each temperature step. It is a feasible approach to accomplish the fractionation by optimizing the pyrolysis process based on the decomposition temperature ranges and products among the biomass constituents. In recent years, the stepwise pyrolysis technology has gained attentions in thermochemical conversion of complex organic solid wastes. Through the stepwise pyrolysis of a real waste, oxygenated and acidic products were concentrated in the first-step liquid product, whereas the second-step product normally contained a high portion of hydrocarbon with low acidity. The stepwise pyrolysis of biomass, plastics, and their mixtures is comprehensively reviewed with the objective of fully understanding the related mechanisms, influence factors, and challenges. ©2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.

AB  - The demand for renewable energy sources such as waste pyrolysis plastic oil (WPPO), ethanol biofuel with high oxygen content is increasing globally. This study used blending of conventional diesel oil, waste plastic pyrolysis oil, ethanol and 2-ethyl hexyl nitrate (EHN) as additive. The purpose was to improve combustion, the ignition quality, and performance and emission characteristics of WPPO as an alternative source of energy. As an additive EHN reduces emissions of CO, CO2, UHC, NOX, and PM. On the other hand, the inclusion of ethanol purposed to improve the viscosity, increase the oxygen content of the blends, and increase miscibility of WPPO. The study utilized the following ratios, 50/WPPO25/E25, 60/WPPO20/E20, 70/WPPO15/E15, 80/WPPO10/E10 and 90/WPPO5/E5 for conventional diesel (CD), WPPO and ethanol and EHN respectively. The ratio of the additive was determined by the percentage method based on the total quantity of the blended fuel and was calculated as 0.001 %. A complete Miscibility was observed to avoid phase separation during the study and experimentation, for the blended ratios of WPPO. The testing for performance and emission characteristics was conducted on a fixed bed, water-cooled, single cylinder diesel generator engine. The results were compared to ASTM standards and discussed using tables and figures. The results conclusively show very close densities of 792 kg/m3, 963 kg/m3, 825 kg/m3 for WPPO, ethanol, EHN respectively, which are close to CD fuel at 845 kg/m3. Increased blend ratio decreased BSFC, 50 % engine load blend 80/WPPO10/E10 had values of 0.043 g/kW.h compared to full load with 0.041 g/kW.h. The highest brake thermal efficiency was by blend 90/WPPO5/E5 at 25 % engine load with a value of 26.5 % compared to 19 % at full engine load. Increase in the blend ratio and engine load decreased CO emissions up to 75 % engine load. For example, blend 90/WPPO5/E5 had a value of 0.035 % carbon emissions compared to 0.055 % at 25 % engine load. Therefore, conclusively WPPO blends can be alternative fuel with or without major engine modification. © 2019 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional biofuel cells (BFCs) are devices that use biological catalysts to catalyze the oxidation of organic materials and in the meantime convert chemical energy into electrical energy. In this work, a nonenzymatic catalyst that integrated copper oxide with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CuO/MWCNTs) was synthesized by a simple solvothermal method, and the composites show an outstanding electrocatalytic activity for oxidation of phenol due to the synergistical contribution of CuO nanoparticles and MWCNTs. The effects of the pH, concentration of electrolyte and phenol and scan rate on the phenol oxidation are investigated. Benefitting from the excellent performance toward phenol oxidation, a H-type phenol fuel cell was fabricated with CuO/MWCNTs as anode material and electro-deposited platinum film as cathode material. The results show that the phenol fuel cell has an open-circuit potential (OCP) of 0.69V and can produce a maximum power density of 0.25mWcm-2 at 0.44V with 500mg·L-1 phenol and 0.1mol·L-1 PBS. The stability test revealed that the fuel cell could still deliver about 0.24mW·cm-2 after repeating the test for five times, indicating that the fuel cell has good stability. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The key advantage of microfluidic technology in chemical processing is the high interfacial area, which is especially important in multiphase reactions. Multiphase reactions such as transesterification of vegetable oil and methanol to produce biodiesel are largely dependent on the interfacial area for better mass transfer. However, little attention has been given to the hydrodynamic factor, which affects the interfacial area in the microchannel. In this study, the interfacial area from the droplet flow regime was studied by varying three parameters: Methanol to oil ratio (M/O), total flow rate (QTotal), and catalyst concentration. The droplet flow was created by a cross-junction channel and photos were made to measure the size of the droplets with the help of a microscope. The maximum M/O ratio (23) and the lowest flow rate (10 μL/min) exhibited the highest interfacial area, where increasing the M/O by 67% could increase the interfacial area by 23%. By varying the KOH catalyst concentration, the change in the interfacial area was very small, thus having the lowest impact on the interfacial area of the droplet. Further analysis must be performed to investigate the impact of interfacial area and mass transfer coefficient on reaction performance in producing the highest yield of biodiesel in a microchannel reactor. © 2019 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.

AB  - Currently, biodiesel produced from algae is receiving a positive response as a substitute for conventional base diesel. To cope up from the costs of expensive downstream stages in the production of biodiesel from algae, present investigation is conducted using algae growing in wastewater as lipid source for biodiesel production. The in situ transesterification using algae was carried to optimize the effect of reaction parameters on the biodiesel yield. The parameters studied were: temperature (35-75 ºC), algae biomass (wt.) to methanol (vol.) ratio (1:1-1:6), catalyst concentration (25-100 wt. %) and stirring intensity (150-750 rpm). The optimum conditions for maximum biodiesel yield achieved were: catalyst concentration and algae biomass to methanol ratio were 60 % and 1:4, respectively with stirring intensity of 450 rpm at 55 ºC. The gas chromatographic studies and fuel properties of biodiesel also establish its potential to be used as fuel in existing engines in accordance to American and European standards. © 2019 Chemical Publishing Co..

AB  - In this paper was assessed the potential of biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas oil. The proposed process was simulated in the software Aspen Plus™ involving the stages of transesterification reaction, methanol recovering, purification of the obtained methyl esters, catalyst removing, purifying of glycerol and the energy integration through heat exchange networks (HEN). The biodiesel process was carried out through the catalytic reaction of transesterification of Jatropha oil with methanol using a molar ratio of methanol oil of 6:1, and with 1% w/w of NaOH (related to oil mass) as catalyst. Under these conditions, it is technologically feasible to carry out the production of biodiesel. With energy integration through the synthesis of HENs, reductions of 8.5% and 6.5% of hot and cold utilities were achieved. This way, the utility cost decreases 7.2%. The net present value (NPV) for the integrated process was 7.3% higher than the one corresponding to the non-integrated process under the same production conditions. © 2003-2012 Latin American Applied Research Journal.

AB  - Ccphalaria syriaca (Turkish Pelemir) seed oil is edible oil which is not used as cooking oil our coun-try. The current work it was aimed to maximize the yields of biodiescl production from Pelemir seed oil (PSO) by using the grey based taguchi method and at the same time to keep the kinematic viscosity values between the nominal limits. This study presents joined effect of four input parameters (factors) such as catalyst concentration (A), molar ratio of oil to methanol (molar ratio) (B), reaction temperature (C) and reaction time (D) in controlling two significant performance parameters (responses) yields of biodiescl (yi) and kinematic viscosity (y:). Orthogonal array was used for the design of experiments on the principle of L9. Taguchi technique was coupled with grey relational analysis to obtain a grey relational grade for evaluating multiple outputs. Grey relational analysis in the Taguchi technique was employed for determining the best combination values of input parameters. It was found that A1B3C3D3 (0.5%, 12:1,60°C, 80 min) optimal parametric combination. © 2019 Parlar Scientific Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel as a fuel has become more preferred due to its environmental benefits and the fact that it is made from renewable resources. Waste coking oil (WCO) is the residue oil generated during food or semi-product preparation by frying and cooking. It is tremendous in the houses and restaurants, so the technical disposal of it becomes necessary. In this study, WCO containing low free fatty acids (FFA) was used as raw material for methyl ester (biodiesel) production. As a result of trances terification, the optimum conditions for methyl ester production can be determined by changing the basic parameters (factors) affecting product yield. This scope of study, the effects of catalyst amount, reaction temperature and molar ratio of alcohol to oil (molar ratio) parameters on the yield of waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME) was determined. For this purpose, experiments were carried out at reaction temperatures of 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C; 0.5, 1, and 1.5% catalyst amount at 4:1, 6:1, 8:1, and 10:1 molar ratios using KOH catalyst. ANOVA (Analysis of variance) was used for optimizing the parameters used in methyl ester production. After ANOVA, Tukey HSD multiple comparison test was used as a more realistic awareness resource for the determination of optimal production parameters and levels. © 2019 Parlar Scientific Publications.

AB  - As the common agricultural feedstock, rice husks can be a sustainable biofuel option with significant calorific value (16-17 MJ/kg) and ash deforming temperature recorded above 1450°C. The research determines product gas on the 100 kW dual fluidized bed steam gasifier performance of rice husks pellets at temperatures between 760 and 810°C. Pure steam was used as a gasification agent at a ratio of 0.87 kgsteam /kgfuel, db. Calcite with mainly CaCO3 in compositions was used as bed material for the reactor. Significant H2 content was determined with high quantity of CO2 and CH4 in product gas, while CO level was relatively low. Due to the considerable sulfur and nitrogen contents of this fuel, values of the impurities NH3 and H2S in the producer gas was detected. It is also shown that the majority of sulfur was released in the gasification zone and, therefore, no further cleaning of the flue gas was necessary. Ethylene, ethane and propane were also formed but only in amounts below 2 vol.-% dry gas. Specific product gas yield reached 1.2 Nm3db /kgfuel,db,af. © 2019, University of Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Environmental Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis may serve as an alternative production strategy to petroleum-derived fuels and chemicals. Furthermore, red mud, a toxic industrial bauxite byproduct, could serve as a sustainable catalyst and overcome the need for more robust catalysts. To test this, in situ catalytic pyrolysis was run on a semi-pilot scale reactor with various ratios of red mud and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Authors hypothesized that the coking process would render red mud environmentally friendly, improve soil quality, and yield for bioenergy crop production, like biochar. Therefore, this work investigated red mud's capability to enhance bio-oil quality, as well as, how the modified biochar produced from in situ pyrolysis affected switchgrass seedling vigor, and root/shoot mass. The results indicated that red mud was effective at increasing soil pH and biochar and bio-oil yields, while reducing the total acid number in bio-oil. While a high loading of reacted red mud had a negative impact on plant yield, the addition of uncatalyzed biochar to pure red mud considerably improved the seedling yield in marginal soils. These results suggest that this technology has potential for valorizing a waste stream and creating a soil amendment from red mud that closes nutrient and bioenergy production cycles while potentially reducing soil pollution. © 2019, North Carolina State University.

AB  - Many aldehydes, such as furfural, are present in high quantities in lignocellulose lysates and are fermentation inhibitors, which makes biofuel production from this abundant carbon source extremely challenging. Cbei_3974 has recently been identified as an aldo-keto reductase responsible for partial furfural resistance in Clostridium beijerinckii. Rational engineering of this enzyme could enhance the furfural tolerance of this organism, thereby improving biofuel yields. We report an extensive characterization of Cbei_3974 and a single-crystal X-ray structure of Cbei_3974 in complex with NADPH at a resolution of 1.75 Å. Docking studies identified residues involved in substrate binding, and an activity screen revealed the substrate tolerance of the enzyme. Hydride transfer, which is partially rate limiting under physiological conditions, occurs from the pro-R hydrogen of NADPH. Enzyme isotope labeling revealed a temperature-independent enzyme isotope effect of unity, indicating that the enzyme does not use dynamic coupling for catalysis and suggesting that the active site of the enzyme is optimally configured for catalysis with the substrate tested. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - This study was to investigate the use of waste mushroom substrate (WMS) material, and waste mushroom substrate pellets (WMSP), with two catalysts (K2 CO3 and CaO), as biofuel feed to produce CH4 in an updraft gasifier. The WMS was made from composted rubber wood chips which had been used for mushroom bed log culture, and pelletizing the WMS (WMSP) to create a biomass with a greater bulk density than the normal WMS. The gasification was determined in the high temperature range of 400-800°C by dry fuel feeding at the rate of 25 kg/ha. The results showed that the optimum operation was achieved with WMSP with K2 CO3 as the catalyst, at ER = 0.11. The combination of WMSP and K2 CO3 produced more CH4 at 62.2 and 15.27% than single WMS and WMSP, respectively. WMSP with CaO as the catalyst produced 29.65 % less CH4 than WMSP. Based on gasification equation, CO produced from WMSP was calculated 24.116 % wt, 31.52% wt from WMSP with K2 CO3 and 19.21% wt from WMS. The amount of gas produced from the available waste material as the biomass was sufficient to meet all heating requirements of the mushroom production. © 2019 Universitas Brawijaya.

AB  - A biphasic process for the conversion of the xylose that remains as a by-product after biomass fermentation into furfural was considered to maximize the economics of biomass-based fuel production. Widely used solvents such as toluene and methyl isobutyl ketone are toxic and environmentally unfriendly; therefore, 2-pentanone, which is one of the intermediates of the modeled process in this work, is suggested as an alternative. The amounts of the solvent that allowed 95% of the produced furfural to be recovered were determined, and the required numbers of trays in the solvent recovery column were calculated. In the production of nearly pure furfural, the process with 2-pentanone required a smaller number of trays than that with the other solvents, resulting in the lowest equipment costs and energy usage. In addition, because 2-pentanone can be converted into hydrocarbons during the downstream processes for biofuel production, the required purity for the furfural product in the separation column could be decreased, whereas the other solvents should be fully recovered so that they can be kept within the process. As the purity was decreased, the number of trays needed also decreased, indicating that the economics of the entire process could be improved through lower capital costs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In relevance to materials chemistry, this study presents biodiesel as an important non-aqueous medium for the synthesis of nanomaterials by demonstrating the synthesis of most versatile gold (Au) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) in biodiesel medium. We show single-step in situ synthesis of Au and Ag NPs using biodiesels prepared from soybean and olive oil. Both biodiesels proved to be excellent solvents, reducing agents, and stabilizing agents for Au and Ag NPs. Au and Ag NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscope and XRD analyses, and were within the range of ∼10–50 nm. Colloidal stabilization of NPs by the surface adsorption of biodiesel was evaluated by detailed FT-IR analysis and determined to be driven by the ester head group of biodiesel molecules. Biodiesel-stabilized NPs in aqueous phase were efficiently extracted in the organic phase without using any phase transfer agent, suggesting the applicability of biodiesel in entrapping metal particulates and removing them from the aqueous phase with relevance to environmental sustainability. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL), a biofuel additive for petroleum and biodiesel can also be used as a 100% fuel to replace petroleum diesel with the existing diesel engine. The major problem to make the EL process economical is the lack of a proper conversion technology to convert C 6 sugars such as glucose with higher yield of EL as well as process which can tolerate higher glucose concentration to increase productivity. The present study highlighted the catalytic synthesis of EL from glucose over synergetic combination of zeolite H-USY and Lewis acidic catalysts such as Sn-beta, TiO 2 , ZrO 2 , and SnO 2 . Because of the strong Lewis acidic nature and the subsequent enhancement in the isomerization rate from glucosides to fructosides, the synergetic combination of H-USY with SnO 2 showed higher EL yield than the combination with other Lewis acidic catalysts. So far, the highest EL yield of 81% from glucose (50 g/L) at 180 °C in 3 h was achieved over the optimal combination of 95% H-USY and 5% SnO 2 having strong/weak acidity and B/L ratios of 1.30 and 0.75, respectively. The study was further extended for establishing the proposed reaction mechanism without the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, levulinic acid, and formic acid which makes the overall process clean and green. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The Brazilian legislation does not establish limits or methodology for the measurement of aldehydes in the exhaust of heavy diesel engines. No conclusive studies on aldehyde emissions by such engines have been found in the literature available. This work measured the aldehyde emissions from a P7 diesel cycle engine (EURO V), which was tested on an engine test bench according to ETC (European Transient Cycle) and ESC (European Stationary Cycle) cycles using fuels with 5, 7 and 20% v/v of biodiesel and 10 and 500 ppm of sulphur. The results showed that biodiesel participation in the mixture did not significantly affect the aldehyde emissions of the tested engine and that the emission level generated in the ETC cycle is higher than that obtained with the ESC cycle. The diesel content in the blend was weakly and negatively correlated with the pollutant emissions, and the inverse pattern was observed for biodiesel. This finding indicates that an increase in biodiesel content causes a slight increase in pollutant emissions. Regarding the sulphur content, positive correlations between the sulphur content and particulate matter, NOx, CO and total hydrocarbon emissions were observed. When comparing the test cycles, the results were significantly different, with higher values for the ETC cycle. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Among the various types of biomass, microalgae have a potential to become a significant energy source for the production of third generation biofuel. The hydrothermal liquefaction is the direct biomass-to-liquid conversion route carried out in the hot compressed water with or without the presence of a catalyst. In this study, the process pressure and temperature is reduced, but at a lower temperature, bio-oil yield is not high enough to make hydrothermal liquefaction an economical technique. Thus, Fe-MCM 41 catalyst was used to increase the bio-oil yield at low temperatures (250 ºC). This catalyst increased the total bio-oil yield from 42.7 to 61.28 % in hydrothermal liquefaction of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. The bio-oil yield (%) of oil 1, 2 & 3 were 24.72, 17.08 & 19.48, respectively obtained at 250 ºC by using catalyst. Moreover, use of catalyst also resulted in the decrease in oxygen and nitrogen contents of bio-oil and consequently increases in its heating value. © 2019 Asian Journal of Chemistry.

AB  - To meet the increasingly strict emission limits imposed by regulations, internal combustion engines for transport applications require the urgent development of novel emission abatement systems. The introduction of biodiesel or other biofuels in the engine operation is considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these alternative fuels can affect the performance of the post-combustion systems due to the variability they introduce in the exhaust particle distribution and their particular physical properties. Bioceramic materials made from vegetal waste are characterized by having an orthotropic hierarchical microstructure, which can be tailored in some way to optimize the filtration mechanisms as a function of the particle distribution of the combustion gases. Consequently, they can be good candidates to cope with the variability that new biofuel blends introduce in the engine operation. The objective of this work is to predict the filtration performance of a wall-flow particulate filter (DPF) made of biomorphic silicon carbide (bioSiC) with a systematic procedure that allows to eventually fit different fuel inputs. For this purpose; a well-validated DPF model available as commercial software has been chosen and adapted to the specific microstructural features of bioSiC. Fitting the specific filtration and permeability parameters of this biomaterial into the model; the filtration efficiency and pressure drop of the filter are predicted with sufficient accuracy during the loading test. The results obtained through this study show the potential of this novel DPF substrate; the material/microstructural design of which can be adapted through the selection of an optimum precursor. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Electrochemical oxidation of glucose has been attracting more and more attention because of its importance in the development of advanced glucose biosensing or biofuel cell for various medical applications, where electrocatalysts with high activities are viewed as one of the most critical factors to determine the performance in these electrochemical devices. There are usually three strategies to enhance the activity of an electrocatalyst system by increasing the number of active sites on the specific electrocatalyst, the intrinsic activity of each active sites and the ability to transfer charges. The utilization of various nanocatalysts with high specific surface areas is the most common way to increase the number of active sites, whereas the intrinsic activity of each active sites is mainly related to the component and crystal structure of catalysts as well as the type of exposed facets, which are partially responsible to the charge conductivity too. In principle, these three strategies are independent and not mutually exclusive, which could be ideally placed together for being comprehensively considered. However, it is still a great challenge to realizingly describe the relation of these three strategies and simultaneously realize the optimization of these three strategies in an electrocatalyst system owing to the limitation of mass and charge transport, which usually leads to a lower practical performance than the theoretical value from increasing active surfaces. Considerable efforts have been devoted to discovering and developing electrocatalysts with different compositions from noble metals, carbon, to transition metals and their hydroxides or oxides and different mesostructures from nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets to their three-dimensional superstructures. Among of them, hollow Co3O4 nanomaterials are well-known to be a kind of promising electrocatalyst due to their multiple valence states and unique mesostructures. Especially, hollow multi-shelled structure (HoMs) of Co3O4 nanomaterials possess some advantages over their counterparts with only one shell, such as more active surfaces, better stability, and usually exhibit higher performance. Herein, we present a nonenzymatic glucose biosensor based on hollow multi-shelled Co3O4 dodecahedra, which obtained from the thermal transformation of Co-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-67). Morphology, crystal structure and electrochemical property of hollow multi-shelled Co3O4 dodecahedra were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, N2 physisorption, cyclic voltammetry, amperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Due to the topological arrangement of Co atoms in ZIF-67, the oriented assembly of Co3O4 nanoparticles in hollow dodecahedra leads to a porous shell with more exposure of (111) facets, which allows for the improved molecule-diffusion and charge-transfer properties as well as enhanced catalytical activities for the electro-oxidation of glucose. As a result, multi-shelled hollow Co3O4 hollow dodecahedra gives a high sensitivity of 4075.2 µA mmol/(L cm2) toward glucose at a low concentration level of 0.01-0.338 mmol/L, which is superior over ordered mesoporous Co3O4 with large and small mesopores of 12 and 4.5 nm (3561.1 and 2074.3 µA mmol/(L cm2), respectively). This work demonstrated the potential of hollow multi-shelled Co3O4 dodecahedra as a novel electrocatalyst for advanced nonenzymatic glucose biosensor, which will bring more opportunities for designing and developing other electrocatalysts with higher activities. © 2019, Science Press.

AB  - Aldol condensation reaction is usually catalysed using homogeneous catalysts. However, the heterogeneous catalysis offers interesting advantages and the possibility of cleaner biofuels production. Nowadays, one of the most used kinds of heterogeneous catalysts are hydrotalcites, which belong to a group of layered double hydroxides. This paper describes the aldol condensation of cyclohexanone (CH) and furfural (F) using Mg/Al mixed oxides and rehydrated mixed oxides in order to compare the catalyst activity after calcination and rehydration, as well as the possibility of its regeneration. The catalysts were synthesized by calcination and subsequent rehydration of the laboratory-prepared and commercial hydrotalcites, with Mg:Al molar ratio of 3:1. Their structural and chemical properties were determined by several analytical methods (inductively coupled plasma analysis (ICP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT), specific surface area (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), temperature programmed desorption (TPD)). F-CH aldol condensation was performed in a continuous fixed-bed reactor at 80◦C, CH:F = 5:1, WHSV 2 h−1. The rehydrated laboratory-prepared catalysts showed a 100% furfural conversion for more than 55 h, in contrast to the calcined ones (only 24 h). The yield of condensation products FCH and F2CH was up to 68% and 10%, respectively. Obtained results suggest that Mg/Al mixed oxides-based heterogeneous catalyst is suitable for use in the aldol condensation reaction of furfural and cyclohexanone in a fixed-bed reactor, which is an interesting alternative way to obtain biofuels from renewable sources. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Abstract: The processes of oxidative depolymerization and acidic hydrolysis have consistently been used for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (wheat straw, sawdust, and lignin), which makes it possible to obtain a high content of soluble organic compounds in the hydrolysate (44–94 g COD/L) and to enhance the concentration of reducing sugars from 1 to 36%. The introduction of Clostridium acetobutylicum bacteria to an acidogenic biocatalyst resulted in an even greater increase in the content of volatile fatty acids and ethanol in the end product. The maxima among the studied substrates yields of butyric acid and ethanol were observed when the pretreated straw was hydrolyzed (27% (0.82 g/L) and 17.4% (0.44 g/L), respectively). It was shown that the addition of glycerol as a substrate makes it possible to increase the yields of butyric and acetic acids as a result of the conversion of the pretreated biomass; the addition of glycerol to straw in a 1 : 1 ratio enhanced the maximum butyric acid and VFA yields up to 32% (0.96 g/L) and 72% (2.67 g/L), respectively. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - In the transportation sector, biofuels are an appropriate replacement to petroleum-derived fuels. These fuels require major changes neither in the engine nor in the refueling process. Therefore, they are more easily compatible. To produce biofuels from microalgae, the use of Chlomydomonas sp. MCCS026 was studied in Iran. The study of microalgae in the production of liquid biofuels in thermochemical processing was carried out and integrated with the results of the main medium-sized pyrolysis research of an algae sample. Our research domain included key elements of pyrolysis versus hydrothermal liquefaction, identified the optimization opportunities of the energy conversion phase, and provided useful insights into the global biofuels chain design of the microalgae. The organic phase product was approximately 36% w/w for both the samples. Viscosities were near to viscosity of the lignocellulose fast-pyrolysis oils, while pH (about 7) showed a significant difference with pyrolysis oil obtained from lignocellulosic material. In contrast, the amount of water, oxygen, and nitrogen was important and they must be reduced. The product of the experimental pilot reactor oil mass reached about 36% w/w, while the energy product was 46% w/w for sample A. Despite this, if the experiment did not achieve the goal of energy optimization as well as the design modified randomly, it would definitely result in better functions. The experimental results showed that there were significant differences in the two samples. According to the technological methods, the analysis suggested that microalgae were a promising way of pyrolysis in terms of product quality and at least in comparison with energy production. © 2019, Agri.

AB  - Fossil fuels consumption impacts the greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels are considered as alternative renewable energy sources to reduce the fossil fuels dependency. Bioethanol produced by recombinant microorganisms is a widely suggested alternative to increase the yield in fermentation processes. However, ethanol and acetate accumulation under the fermentation process had been described as important stressors for the metabolic capabilities of the microorganisms, stopping the fermentation process and affecting the ethanol yield. Ethanol tolerance is a determining factor in the improvement of fermentative properties of microorganisms; however understanding of ethanol tolerance is limited. The engineered Escherichia coli KO11 strain has been studied in detail and used as an ethanologenic bacteria model. The strain is capable of using glucose and xylose for an efficient ethanol yield. In the current work, the effect of the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) over-expression in the KO11 strain, on its tolerance and ethanol yield, was evaluated. Fatty acids profiles of membrane phospholipids in the E. coli KO11 were modified under ethanol addition, but not due to the hscA mutation. The hscA mutation provoked a decrease in ethanol tolerance in the Kmp strain when was grown with 2% ethanol, in comparison to KO11 parent strain. Ethanol tolerance was improved in the mutant Kmp complemented with the recombinant isc gene cluster (pJC10 plasmid) from LD50 2.16% to LD50 3.8% ethanol. In batch fermentation on 1 L bioreactor using mineral medium with glucose (120 g/L), the KO11 strain showed ethanol production efficiencies of ~ 76.9%, while the hscA mutant (Kmp) ~ 75.4% and the transformed strain Kmp(pJC10) showed ~ 92.4% efficiency. Ethanol amount increase in the engineered Kmp(pJC10) strain was correlated with less organic acids (such as acetate and lactate) production in the fermentation medium (2.3 g/L), compared to that in the KO11 (17.05 g/L) and the Kmp (16.62 g/L). Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was increased ~ 350% in the transformed Kmp(pJC10) strain, whereas in the Kmp mutant, the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), pyruvate kinase (PYK), and ADH activities were diminished, comparing to KO11. The results suggest that the isc system over-expression in the ethanologenic E. coli KO11 strain, increases ethanol yield mainly by improving ethanol tolerance and ADH activity, and by redirecting the metabolic flux from acetate synthesis to ethanol. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Triacylglycerides are naturally abundant and renewable feedstock for biofuels and chemicals. In this report, these seemingly stable compounds are shown to be reactive toward a variety of sulfonamides under Lewis acid catalysis. In these reactions, alkyl C(sp3)–O bonds are cleaved and C–N bonds constructed, providing functionalized value-added products directly from renewables. Mechanistic and scope study demonstrate that the origin of the reactivity could be the synergy of Lewis acid catalysis and neighboring group participation by the 2- or 3-acyloxy or acylamido group with respect to the reactive site. Since poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a widely available consumer polyester, also contains 1,2-diol diester group as the repeating unit in the main chain, this chemistry can also be applied to efficient depolymerization of PET. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Palm oil is the most abundant plant oil resource in the world. Through fuel reforming, properties of diesel, palm oil, and gasoline blend fuels are superior to those of diesel. With the constraint of major properties, D56Z24G20 (56% D100, 24% palm oil, and 20% gasoline by vol.) and D42Z18G40 (42% D100, 18% palm oil, and 40% gasoline by vol.) are prepared for experimental investigation and comparison with D100 (100% diesel). The combustion and emission results indicate that D56Z24G20 and D42Z18G40 release heat more concentratedly than D100 and thereby have a higher peak combustion temperature (PCT). NOx emission of D56Z24G20 and D42Z18G40 are higher than that of D100. Particle number concentrations (PNC) of D56Z24G20 and D42Z18G40 are higher than that of D100 at low and partial loads and a little lower at medium and high loads. The high PNC of D56Z24G20 and D42Z18G40 particles is mainly attributed to the high PNC of nucleation mode particles and this phenomenon can be eliminated with a 20% ratio of exhaust gas recirculation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study deals with the open pond (OP) pilot scale treatment of cassava effluent and enhancement of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) enzyme through CO2 utilization by the microalga, Acutodesmus obliquus RDS01. The cassava effluent treatment (ET) revealed maximum reduction of ammonia (96.8%), calcium (94.6%), chloride (95.2%), chlorine (98.5%), inorganic phosphate (94.6%), magnesium (96.8%), nitrate (96.89%), organic carbon (95.9%), organic phosphorus (96.3%), potassium (97.9%), sodium (97.1%), and sulfate (95.4%) on 15th day using A. obliquus. The microalga produced highest RuBisCO enzyme activity (90%), CO2 utilization efficiency (95%), biomass (8.9 gL−1), lipid (176.65 mg mL−1), carbohydrate (96.78 mg mL−1), biodiesel (4.1 mL g−1), and bioethanol (3.7 mL g−1) during OP treatment. The isolated RuBisCO gene (rbcL) was used to construct the protein model by homology modeling. The microalgal-lipid content was analyzed through thin layer chromatography, the biodiesel produced was analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). The bioethanol production was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography and GCMS analyses. A. obliquus produced of 98.75% biodiesel and 96.83% bioethanol in the OP pilot scale treatment A. obliquus. Overall, the microalga A. obliquus could act as an effective CO2 capturing and bioremediation agent in the cassava ET, and also for the biodiesel and bioethanol can be produced. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A bioenergy summit was organized by Advanced Hardwood Biofuels Northwest (AHB) to debate the barriers to the commercialization of a hybrid poplar biofuels industry for the alternative jet fuels market from the perspective of five years of AHB research and development and two recent surveys of the North American cellulosic biofuels industry. The summit showed that: (1) Growing and converting poplar feedstock to aviation fuels is technically sound, (2) an adequate land base encompassing 6.03 and 12.86 million respective hectares of croplands and rangelands is potentially available for poplar feedstock production, (3) biofuel production is accompanied by a global warming potential that meets the threshold 60% reduction mandated for advanced renewable fuels but (4) the main obstruction to achieving a workable poplar aviation fuels market is making the price competitive with conventional jet fuels. Returns on investment into biomass farms and biorefineries are therefore insuffcient to attract private-sector capital the fact notwithstanding that the demand for a reliable and sustainable supply of environmentally well-graded biofuels for civilian and military aviation is clear. Eleven key findings and recommendations are presented as a guide to a strategic plan for a renewed pathway to poplar alternative jet fuels production based upon co-products, refinery co-location with existing industries, monetization of ecosystem services, public-private financing, and researching more effcient and lower-costs conversion methods such as consolidated bioprocessing. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Enzyme-coated polymeric membranes are versatile catalysts for biofuel production and other chemical production from feedstock, like plant biomass. Such bioreactors are more energy efficient than high temperature methods because enzymes catalyze chemical reactions near room temperature. A major challenge in processing plant biomass is the presence of lignin, a complex aromatic polymer that resists chemical breakdown. Therefore, membranes coated with enzymes such as laccase that can degrade lignin are sought for energy extraction systems. We present an experimental study on optimizing an enzyme-based membrane bioreactor and investigate the tradeoff between high flow rate and short dwell time in the active region. In this work, zero flow rate voltammetry experiments confirm the electrochemical activity of Trametes versicolor laccase on conductive polymer electrodes, and a flow-through spectroscopy device with laccase-coated porous nylon membranes is used with a colorimetric laccase activity indicator to measure the catalysis rate and percent conversion as a function of reactant flow rate. Membrane porosity before and after laccase coating is verified with electron microscopy. © 2019 The Authors. Engineering in Life Sciences published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Dual-fuel strategies can enable replacement of diesel fuel with low reactivity biofuels like hydrous ethanol. Previous work has shown that dual-fuel strategies using port injection of hydrous ethanol can replace up to 60% of diesel fuel on an energy basis. However, they yield negligible benefits in NOX emissions, soot emissions, and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) over conventional single fuel diesel operation. Pretreatment of hydrous ethanol through steam reforming before mixing with intake air offers the potential to both increase BTE and decrease soot and NOX emissions. Steam reforming can upgrade the heating value of the secondary fuel through thermochemical recuperation (TCR) and produces inert gases to act as a diluent similar to exhaust gas recirculation. This study experimentally investigated a novel thermally integrated steam reforming TCR reactor that uses sensible and chemical energy in the exhaust to provide the necessary heat for hydrous ethanol steam reforming. An off-highway diesel engine was operated at three speed and load settings with varying hydrous ethanol flow rates reaching fumigant energy fractions of up to 70%. The engine achieved soot reductions of close to 90% and minor NOX reductions; however, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions increased. A first law energy balance using the experimental data shows that the developed TCR system effectively upgraded the heating value of the secondary fuel. Overall, hydrous ethanol steam reforming using TCR can lead to 23% increase in fuel heating value at 100% conversion, a limit approached in the conducted experiments. © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - This study purposed to characterize the sewage sludge from various sewage treatment plants (STPs) as a biodiesel feedstock. Crude biodiesel was produced from each dried primary sludge (PS) and waste activated sludge (WAS) via in situ transesterification process. The average yield of transesterifiable lipid (TL) was 77.8% and 60.4% of the total lipid content from PS andWAS, respectively. The TL yield had a greater margin amongWAS than PS samples due to differences in the biological processes adopted in each treatment plant. The TL recovered from PS and WAS contained 54.2% and 40.1% fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), respectively, which were mostly made up of palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0). The FAME composition of the biodiesel in the WAS sample was highly associated with a microbial community that grows otherwise, depending on the purpose of the biological treatment process. In particular, the increase in the proportion of nitrifying bacteria that grow predominantly under a relatively longer solid retention time (SRT) contributed significantly to the improvement in FAME content. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - As global biodiesel production increases, there are concerns over the potential health impact of exposure to the exhaust, particularly in regard to young children who are at high risk because of their continuing lung development. Using human airway epithelial cells obtained from young children, we compared the effects of exposure to exhaust generated by a diesel engine with Euro V/VI emission controls running on conventional diesel (ultra-low-sulfur mineral diesel, ULSD), soy biodiesel (B100), or a 20% blend of soy biodiesel with diesel (B20). The exhaust output of biodiesel was found to contain significantly more respiratory irritants, including NOx, CO, and CO2, and a larger overall particle mass. Exposure to biodiesel exhaust resulted in significantly greater cell death and a greater release of immune mediators compared to both air controls and ULSD exhaust. These results have concerning implications for potential global health impacts, particularly for the pediatric population. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As a derivative product of bio-glycerol, this study first uses solketal as a combustion improver for enhancing diesel engine characteristics. The emulsions of nanometer- and micrometer-sized droplets of solketal, which disperse evenly in the ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), are formed by the effects of microwave irradiation. The performance of diesel engine fueled with the nanoemulsion of ULSD with scattered solketal droplets is analyzed and compared to that with the microemulsion. The experimental results show that the nanoemulsions can form when over 15 wt. % surfactant mixtures of Span 80 and Tween 80 and less than 5 wt. % solketal are mixed and emulsified with the remaining ULSD content, which acts as the continuous phase of the emulsions. The nanoemulsions are observed to have significantly lower brake-specific fuel consumption (bsfc) and higher fuel conversion efficiency and exhaust gas temperature than those of the microemulsions and the neat ULSD. However, the bsfc of the nanoemulsions increases with greater engine speed and gradually approaches those of the latter two test fuels. In addition, the dispersed solketal droplet sizes are mostly concentrated around 127 nm with peak intensity of 12.65% in the nanoemulsions. The microwave-assisted formation used in this study is found to successfully produce the nanoemulsions in which all of the dispersed droplet sizes are much smaller than 1000 nm. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The alkylation of biomass-derived aromatic oxygenates (anisole, phenol, guaiacol, and m-cresol) with furfural alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is a step toward high-density biofuel. Conversion and selectivity trends toward monoalkylated products were evaluated in the presence of different operational conditions in batch process. It was observed that FeCl3 was the best catalytic system for phenol alkylation and produced 84.7% monoalkylated product at 80 °C, for 30 min in a continuous nitrogen flow. Guaiacol, anisole, and m-cresol gave 100%, 79.6%, and 85.5% monoalkylated product, respectively. The effect of nitrogen pressure on alkylation was reported for the first time; the monoalkylated product selectivity of phenol, anisole, m-cresol reached 95.5%, 88.7%, and 100% at 4, 8, and 10 bar of N2 pressure, respectively. The alkylation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) with aromatic oxygenates was also studied by replacing furfuryl alcohol with 5-HMF. The selectivity of the monoalkylated product reached almost 100% with every oxygenate, but alkylation of 5-HMF was slower compared to furfuryl alcohol and longer time was required. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel wastewaters contain high amounts of oil, methanol, soap and glycerin. These wastewaters pollutant concentrations as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), glycerin and MeOH are fluctuating in the ranges of 250,000–450,000 mg/L, 54,000–110,000 mg/L, 800–1,500 mg/L, and 6,000–15,000 mg/L, respectively. Biodiesel wastewaters lead to blockage of oil drainage systems and reduction of biological activity in biological treatment systems. The purpose of this study was to treat wastewater by ozonation after the electrocoagulation process as pre-treatment. In the ozonation process, the initial wastewater pH value was 13.9, ozone dose was 1.5g/L h, reaction time was 7 h and reaction temperature was 45°C. As a result of 7 h of ozonation, 98.64% of COD, 97.48% of TOC and 99.37% of MeOH removal efficiencies achieved. With these results, biodiesel waste water can be discharge to into the receiving environment according to standards. © 2019 Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Furfural is an interesting compound that can be produced from renewable and sustainable resources and is used in platform chemicals for the synthesis of biofuels and other chemicals. However, a recovery step is required to separate furfural from lignocellulosic hydrolysates when cellulose-based raw materials are used. In this work, nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) processes have been evaluated to purify or concentrate synthetic furfural solutions. RESULTS: Two NF membranes (NF90 and NF270) and three RO membranes (XLE, BW30 and SW30) were evaluated to recover furfural from high-concentrated solutions containing 9 g furfural L−1. Rejection percentages and permeate flux performances were determined and membranes were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results indicated that higher trans-membrane flux could be obtained by NF membranes, being the highest when using NF membranes (260 ± 14 L m−2 h−1) and the lowest with the BW30 membrane (3.3 ± 0.7 L m−2 h−1) working at 20 bar. On the other hand, NF270 allowed the passage of furfural (around 84 ± 3%), while the other tested membranes (NF90, XLE, SW30 and BW30) rejected it (between 67 ± 2 and 90 ± 3%). CONCLUSION: For this reason, it can be concluded that NF270 will be an option for furfural purification, while NF90 and RO membranes could be used for concentration purposes. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - In this experiment, the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine were tested using bio-fuel (Anise oil) at different loads. The main focus of this study was to compare the existing biodiesel blends with the proposed mixture (anise + cerium oxide) of biodiesel blends in terms of engine parameters, cost, efficiency, and pollution control. The blends used in this experiment are B10 (Biodiesel-10%), B20 (Biodiesel-20%), and B30 (Biodiesel-30%). The emission and performance parameters considered for the test are SFC (specific fuel consumption), CO (carbon monoxide), NOX (nitrogen oxide), and HC (hydrocarbon). These parameters were tested for different load conditions such as 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. From the results, it shows that SFC is lower for B20 blend compared to that of pure diesel fuel, while B10, B30, B40, and B50 blends have slightly higher values. From the experiment, it is found that emissions of the HC and NOx were reduced and CO emission is slightly higher than the pure diesel. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This work aims to utilise the experimental approach to perform the analysis of three-biomass feed stocks–bamboo, mustard and camellia and to provide insight into the operation and design of pyrolysis processes. Experiments on biomass fast pyrolysis were performed in a fixed bed (tubular) reactor at a temperature of 500°C and a residence time of 2 min under the constant flow of nitrogen. The analysis of pyrolysis gases and bio oil produced by pyrolysis was done using GC-MS and GC-TCD. Hydrous pyrolysis of biomasses was performed in a high-pressure autoclave for the temperature range 250–400°C and at a pressure of 20 bar with 30 min of residence time. Experiments were conducted both with and without the use of a catalyst. The pyrolysis vapour is made to pass through the catalyst bed of ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 35). The results for all the biomass samples are then compared. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recent movements for the decarbonization of the electricity sector have become a priority for many countries around the world and will inevitably lead to the sharp decline of fossil-fuel-based energy. Energy from fossil fuels is to be replaced by renewable energy sources (RES), although the transition will neither be cheap nor smooth. One sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels and which will take a considerable share in the increasing supply of renewable energy resources is biofuels. There are various types of biofuels used in practice; however, biodiesels represent one of the most popular and widespread ones. This paper focuses as a case study on the byproducts of Jatropha curcas, a crop and a plant that is already used for biofuel production and which is subsequently employed in electricity generation in Jatropha curcas producing regions. This paper identifies the limitations and prospects of Jatropha curcas utilization. Also, Jatropha curcas is compared to other materials suitable for biomass generation. An economic analysis for a 2 MW biofuel powerplant was conducted incorporating various market-related risks. The study shows that at current prices, net profitability can be achieved using Jatropha curcas byproducts for producing electricity. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - To enhance the mass transfer efficiency of bio-oil inside the zeolite based catalyst and improve the catalytic selectivity of jet biofuel product, conventional Y zeolite was modified into hierarchical mesoporous Y (meso-Y) zeolite by desilication and loaded with Ni to catalyze the conversion of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) into jet biofuel. Mesopores in the range of 2 to 10 nm were effectively generated by desilication with NaOH and a certain degree of crystal structure expansion was caused accordingly. When Ni was loaded on meso-Y zeolite treated with 0.4 mol/L NaOH for 1 h, BET surface area and specific pore volume were increased to 554.9 m2/g and 0.340 cm3/g, respectively. A maximum of jet biofuel product selectivity (65.8%) was hence obtained. Iso-alkanes and arenes took up 19.1% and 12.8% within jet biofuel product, guaranteeing the fuel characteristics. As by-products of both hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking, the selectivity of CH4 in the gas phase product was up to 25.2%, and the CO2 is stable at about 12%. Although the overall selectivity of jet biofuel product varied greatly with NaOH treatment duration, the proportion of each component remained stable. Desilication only modified the physical structure of meso-Y zeolite to enhance the mass transfer of reactants and products. Its chemical properties were preserved to maintain the catalytic activity. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetically engineered to enhance butanol production will be used in a manufacturing process similar to that of fuel ethanol production, including co-production of distillers products for animal feed. A poultry feeding trial was conducted with simulated isobutanol-derived dried distillers grains with solubles (bDDGS), comprising nonfermentable corn solids and heat-inactivated Butamax modified yeast (BMY), to determine potential health effects. Simulated dried distillers grains were produced in 2 variants: BDDGS containing 10% (B10) or 50% (B50) BMY. The BMY concentrations were selected based on a conservative estimate from ethanol-derived distillers grains (eDDGS) approximating 2.5 and 12-fold margins of exposure. The B10 and B50 DDGS were evaluated in a 42-day feeding trial using male Ross 708 broiler chickens fed diets containing eDDGS, B50 DDGS, or B10 DDGS without or with isobutanol, 2,3-butanediol, and isobutyric acid metabolites each at target concentrations of 2 (B10-2), 5 (B10-5), or 10 (B10-10) times the anticipated specification limit in the commercial product. Diets were fed (n = 50 broilers/treatment) in 3 phases: Starter phase with 8% DDGS and grower and finisher phases each with 15% DDGS. No statistically significant differences or diet-related effects on mortality, clinical pathology, or organ weights, and no microscopic observations associated with consumption of diets containing B10, B50, or B10 supplemented with metabolites at any targeted exposure level were observed. A lower (P < 0.05) mean absolute bursa of Fabricius weight in the B10-10 group compared to the B10 group was considered to be within the range of biological variability. A non-significant trend toward lower weight, gains, and feed intake, and higher feed:gain ratio was observed in the B10-10 group, and was considered a non-adverse palatability effect of consuming high concentrations of metabolites. Theseresults demonstrate that consumption of phase diets containing simulated DDGS from a novel isobutanol production process was well-tolerated. © 2019 Roper et al.

AB  - This paper presents a beneficial combination of biomass gasification and pyrolysis oil hydrodeoxygenation for advanced biofuel production. Hydrogen for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of liquid phase pyrolysis oil (LPP oil) was generated by gasification of softwood. The process merges dual fluidized bed (DFB) steam gasification, which produces a hydrogen rich product gas and the HDO of LPP oil. Synthesis gas was used directly without further cleaning and upgrading, by making use of the water gas-shift (WGS) reaction. The water needed for the water gas-shift reaction was provided by LPP oil. HDO was successfully performed in a lab scale over 36 h time on stream (TOS). Competing reactions like the Boudouard reaction and Sabatier reaction were not observed. Product quality was close to Diesel fuel specification according to EN 590, with a carbon content of 85.4 w% and a residual water content of 0.28 w%. The water-gas shift reaction was confirmed by CO/CO2-balance, high water consumption and 28% less hydrogen consumption during HDO. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In recent years, following the amendment to the European renewable energy directive (RED), there is an increasing interest to exploit Crude Tall Oil (CTO) for energetic purposes. This study conducted an integrated assessment to quantify the environmental, economic and social impact of these two competing material and energetic routes that consume CTO as a feedstock. The integrated assessment follows a cradle-to-grave approach to compare the impact on climate change from the production of bio-chemicals to that generated from the production of renewable diesel from CTO. In addition, the economic and social impact assessment estimates the total economic added value as well as the total number of direct, indirect and induced jobs generated by the two respective routes utilising CTO. The environmental assessment showed that the application of CTO for bio-chemicals has 23% lower greenhouse gas emissions than its application for renewable diesel. The economic assessment showed that the European pine chemicals industry generated at least 4 times higher added value than that generated from renewable diesel. Finally, when analysing the social impact, the utilisation of 650,000 of CTO to produce bio-chemicals generated around 9100 jobs. On the other hand, the renewable diesel production route was estimated to generate only 400 jobs. Therefore, the integrated assessment concludes that, diverting and utilising CTO to produce biofuels does not present a sustainable case when compared to its established use in the production of bio-chemicals. © 2019

AB  - A novel mesoporous cerium-incorporated anthranilic acid binded chloromethylated polystyrene (PS-AN-Ce) has been developed by functionalization of chloromethylated polystyrene with anthranilic acid in DMF medium, followed by grafting of cerium on its surface using CeCl3·7H2O. The synthesized PS-AN-Ce has been characterized by FESEM, EDAX, AAS, FTIR, UV–Vis, TGA, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. The synthesized material is stable up to 376 °C and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area is 40.12 m2 g−1. PS-AN-Ce showed excellent catalytic effectiveness with high conversion rate and high TOF in the synthesis of β-amino alcohol derivatives and esterification of fatty acids in a short reaction time. In addition, the synthesized catalyst is easy to remove from the reaction mixture by centrifugation as it is a heterogeneous catalyst in origin and can be reused up to six times without any major loss of its catalytic activity. Also leaching limit of the synthesized catalyst is studied in different reaction cycle which implies that leaching of cerium from its polymeric support is negligible to consider. The extremely dispersed and sturdily bound Ce sites in the Ce-incorporated mesoporous polymer could be responsible for the observed high catalytic activities. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

AB  - As fuel additives, ethyl levulinate (EL) can be used up to 5 wt% directly in the regular diesel engines, which can overcome the limited stock of fossil fuels and reduce the environment pollutions to some extent. In this work, the three-dimensional porous hybrids consisting of SiO2 and graphene aerogel, which are denoted as SiO2@GA, are facilely assembled and used as supports for H3PW12O40 (HPW)-based solid acid catalysts. Structural analysis confirms that the resultant HPW/SiO2@GA catalysts possess unique porous structure (SBET ≥ 257 m2 g−1, Vp ≥ 0.450 cm3 g−1) and exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the synthesis of EL by the esterification of levulinic acid (LA) with ethanol. The conversion of LA can be as high as 92.4% under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, various catalytic reaction parameters are also optimized over the 10 wt.% HPW/SiO2@GA catalysts, which exhibit the highest turnover frequency (TOF = 83.91 mmol g−1 h−1) among the resultant catalysts. The results confirm the promising application of the HPW/SiO2@GA heterogeneous catalysts in the synthesis of biofuel. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biomass is a sustainable fuel, as its CO2 emissions are reintegrated in biomass growth. However, the inorganic precursors in the biomass cause a negative environmental impact and slag formation. The selected short rotation coppice (SRC) willow wood has a high ash content (x = 1.96%) and, therefore, a high content of emission and slag precursors. Therefore, the reduction of minerals from SRC willow wood by low temperature microwave assisted hydrothermal carbonization (MAHC) at 150 °C, 170 °C, and 185 °C is investigated. An advantage of MAHC over conventional reactors is an even temperature conductance in the reaction medium, as microwaves penetrate the whole reactor volume. This allows a better temperature control and a faster cooldown. Therefore, a succession of depolymerization, transformation and repolymerization reactions can be analyzed effectively. In this study, the analysis of the mass loss, ash content and composition, heating values and molar O/C and H/C ratios of the treated and untreated SCR willow wood showed that the mineral content of the MAHC coal was reduced and the heating value increased. The process water showed a decreasing pH and contained furfural and 5-methylfurfural. A process temperature of 170 °C showed the best combination of energy input and ash component reduction. The MAHC allows a better understanding of the hydrothermal carbonization process, while a large-scale industrial application is unlikely because of the high investment costs. © 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) has been linked to adverse human health outcomes. DEPs are reactive and can directly or indirectly lead to oxidative stress, which promotes inflammation in the body. The oxidative potential (OP) of DEPs is not well understood, particularly for combustion with alternative fuels, under different engine loads, and in combination with modern emissions control devices. In this study, we measured the OP of DEPs using a dithiothreitol assay (OP-DTT) from a modern-day non-road diesel engine for two different fuels (conventional diesel and soy-based biodiesel), two different engine loads (idle and 50% load), and with and without an emissions control system. The OP-DTT of DEPs was sensitive to the fuel used and the presence of an emissions control system but not to the engine load. On average, the use of biodiesel resulted in factor of ∼6 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the DEP mass and a factor of ∼12 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the fuel consumed. The use of the emissions control, on average, resulted in a factor of ∼6 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the DEP mass and a three order of magnitude decrease in OP-DTT normalized to the fuel consumed. When studied in conjunction with the DEP composition, the OP-DTT seemed to correlate most strongly with elemental carbon (EC), followed by semi-volatile organic vapors. Assays performed on DEPs where EC was deliberately filtered out suggested that the species responsible for the OP-DTT might be correlated with EC but would need to be water soluble (e.g., quinones). The semi-volatile organic vapors accounted for more than a quarter of the OP-DTT of DEPs collected on the quartz filters. Finally, sensitivity studies performed with a different filter membrane (i.e., Teflon®) and solvent (i.e., dichloromethane) tended to increase the OP-DTT value. OP-DTT is emerging as an important metric for studying the adverse effects of DEPs and PM2.5 on human health; results of this work help define the sources and components of diesel PM2.5 that contribute to OP-DTT. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The three most important biomass sources in Morocco, namely almond shells A 0 , acorn cups C 0 , nut shells N 0 and their derived solid biofuel respectively A 400 , C 400 and N 400 were evaluated with regards to their energetic, combustion and structural characteristics and for their environmental impact. The solid biofuel samples were produced by slow pyrolysis at a temperture of 400 °C for a reaction time of 2 h. Properties, such as combustion process, combustion index, ignition index, calorific value, chemical composition and structural characteristics of biomass wastes and their solid biofuel were determined.The results showed that solid biofuel had better fuel qualities than their parent biomasses, the combustion properties of solid biofuel are influenced by its structure, in fact the more ordered solid biofuel was the less reactive and that in comparison with the studied biofuels, the solid biofuel derived from almond shells was the most suitable for energy generation by combustion. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Around 1% of waste cooking oil (WCO) is currently recycled to make biodiesel in Brazil, mainly because used oils can acquire physicochemical characteristics that render them unsuitable as raw materials. To make biofuel production from waste oils and fats more efficient and economically feasible, it is important to develop simple, rapid, and low-cost methods for testing the quality of WCOs. With the objective of establishing the applicability of stochastic modeling of e-nose profiles in assessing the suitability of WCO for biodiesel production, the synthesized biodiesel samples from 36 pre-used frying oils, obtained from domestic and commercial premises, were analyzed regarding ester content, acidity index, density, viscosity, and iodine index. Olfactory profiles of the WCO sources were obtained using a Cyranose chemical vapor-sensing instrument and interpreted by application of stochastic modeling and quadratic discriminant analysis. The predictive model obtained by stochastic analysis exclusively from the olfactory profiles of the samples of WCO allowed the latter to be classified according to their ability to generate biodiesel that would be compliant with standard specifications and with an overall accuracy greater than 80%. Our results demonstrated that stochastic modeling is a promising tool for predicting the quality of biodiesel based only on the WCO olfactory profiles and its origin, since it allows qualitative assessments of the principal biodiesel properties and eliminates the need for complex and time-consuming laboratory tests. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Abstract: With wide use of biomass in various industries and enterprises, large amounts of biomass waste are being produced. This causes severe environmental issues and inadequate utilization of renewable resources. In this work, a sustainable and green process approach is proposed to utilize lignocellulosic biomass residues from biofuel conversion proceeding via direct mechanical treatments. The obtained nanofibers containing cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose were directly isolated from lignocellulosic biomass residues and had diameters of approximately 21 nm. After being treated via ultra-micro grinding for 0.5 h with a millstone gap of approximately 5 μm, and undergoing ultrasonication for 20 min at 1000 W as well as high-pressure homogenization shearing for 15 times in a chamber with 87 μm diameter, partially hydrogen and covalent bonds between cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose chains could be broken down. Lignin and hemicellulose were wrapped around the cellulose bundles, thus the residue nanofiber aerogels became easy to redisperse and redry in water. Additionally, the specific capacitance of carbonized nanofiber aerogels was up to 73.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. A remarkable reduction of specific capacitance happened along with the fermentation process prolongation and which is mainly related to the fermentation degree. With characteristics, such as special composite texture, high specific surface area, and excellent electrochemical performances, lignocellulosic biomass residue nanofibers displayed positive attributes in terms of energy storage and nanomaterials.

AB  - Renewable biomass resources could reduce the dependency on the fossil fuels by conversion of its lignocellulose into bio-fuels and other valuable chemicals. Depolymerisation of lignocellulose, hydrolysis of cellulose to monomer glucose and its subsequent dehydration results 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). HMF is an important platform chemical for fuels and various other applications. The hydrogenation of HMF results 2, 5-dimethylfuran (DMF), which may be a biofuel with 40 per cent greater energy density than that of ethanol. The homogeneous catalytic method is preferred for lignocellulosic biomass conversion to cellulose, its hydrolysis and further dehydration to HMF. The Cu-Ru/C and related catalysts are preferred for hydrogenation of HMD to 2, 5-dimethylfuran. This review is an attempt to summarise the current research and developments in the field of lignocellulose derived HMF and further conversion to DMF as a potential biofuel. © 2019, DESIDOC.

AB  - Biogas resulting from anaerobic digestion can be utilized for the production of liquid fuels via reforming to syngas followed by the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Renewable liquid fuels are highly desirable due to their potential for use in existing infrastructure, but current Fischer-Tropsch processes, which require operating pressures of 2 4 MPa (20 40 bar), are unsuitable for the relatively small scale of typical biogas production facilities in the EU, which are agriculture-based. This paper investigates the feasibility of producing liquid fuels from biogas-derived syngas at atmospheric pressure, with a focus on the system's response to various interruption factors, such as total loss of feed gas, variations to feed ratio, and technical problems in the furnace. Results of laboratory testing showed that the liquid fuel selectivity could reach 60% under the studied conditions of 488 K (215 °C), H2/CO = 2 and 0.1 MPa (1 bar) over a commercial Fischer Tropsch catalyst. Analysis indicated that the catalyst had two active sites for propagation, one site for the generation of methane and another for the production of liquid fuels and wax products. However, although the production of liquid fuels was verified at atmospheric pressure with high liquid fuel selectivity, the control of such a system to maintain activity is crucial. From an economic perspective, the system would require subsidies to achieve financial viability. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Thermodynamics analyses were carried out in biogas fueled chemical looping reforming (CLR) process for H2 generation, where the main component of cement Ca2Al2SiO7 was used as a support for NiO/Ca2Al2SiO7 oxygen carrier. Around 430 cases for CLR were studied via a home-built MATLAB® code, considering the effects of NiO loading yNiO, oxygen carrier circulation rate Fs, oxygen carrier conversion variation ΔXs, steam concentration 〖x〗_(H_2 O) and air reactor temperature TAR. The global enthalpy variation ΔH can be easily tuned to ΔH=0, i.e. CLRa state, by varying the (NiO+Ca2Al2SiO7)/biogas ratio. Under CLRa state, increase of TAR and ΔXs can lead to the decrease of H2 yield, while rising of Fs would result in the higher H2 yield. The simulation suggests that the optimized H2 yield of 1.57 (m3 H2)∙(m3 biogas)-1 can be achieved with NiO loading lower than 10%(mass), TAR close to 1150 K, ΔXs lower than 0.25, Fs higher than 2 kg∙s-1 and 〖x〗_(H_2 O) lower than 54.5%(vol). Heat balance of the global FR, AR and WGS reactors showed that the CLRa can be run under auto-thermal condition, meanwhile heat at exits of reactors can be recovered to be used in the preheating of gases entering reactors. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - In this research, cellulose was impregnated with ionic liquid as a pretreatment and then also used as a catalyst in the subsequent pyrolysis of the cellulose to produce a bio-oil. Impregnating cellulose with ionic liquid is expected to decrease the necessary pyrolysis temperature and improve the liquid bio-oil chemical composition. [bmim][TFSI], [bmim][BF4], and [bmmim][BF4] treated cellulose samples increased liquid yields at 225 °C to ∼15% compared to untreated cellulose with a liquid yield of 4% representing a ∼400% increase in liquid yield. However, as the pyrolysis temperature is increased, the advantage of using ionic liquid to increase liquid yield diminishes. FTIR analysis of the char shows that the pyranose ring structure breaks apart at a lower temperature for the ionic liquid pretreated cellulose. GC-MS analysis shows that the ionic liquids have different effects on the liquid composition and improve the composition of the bio-oil by decreasing acids and ketones. Based on these results, reaction pathways are discussed for the different ionic liquids. In this paper, a better understanding of how ionic liquid affects cellulose pyrolysis was achieved and explains how ionic liquids increased bio-oil yields at low temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pressure loss measurements for packed beds of binary mixtures of angular parallelepipedal particles are reported for a range of Reynolds numbers from 40 to 800. Mixture void fractions generally lay between values for beds of the individual particles, but in two cases were lower than either component void fraction. Particles were found to overlap to a considerable degree in the bed, resulting in a reduction of effective surface area by up to 33%. A modified version of the Nemec and Levec (2005) pressure loss correlation which accounts for particle interference was used to estimate the degree of overlap, and gave values which agreed well with those estimated from photographs of the bed. This provides the means to estimate the effective specific surface area of a particle mixture of known component properties. It is shown that the appropriate parameters to use for a mixture are the volume-surface or Sauter mean diameter and a similarly defined average particle sphericity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - ETS-10, zeolite A and sepiolite based nano-structured materials were prepared and modified with potassium containing compounds using ion-exchange or impregnation and evaluated as basic catalysts for transesterification of vegetable oils using microwave heating. The structural features of these catalysts were characterised in detail by the variable temperature in situ X-ray diffraction, N 2 adsorption–desorption, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis and in situ FTIR spectroscopy using adsorption–desorption of acetylene as a basic probe in order to evaluate their structure–catalytic performance relationship in the methanolysis of triglycerides. A wide range of parameters were utilised in order to optimise the reaction conditions. Although a high yield of fatty acid methyl esters with almost 100% selectivity can be achieved in transesterification reactions in the presence of K-containing sepiolite, this system shows significant deactivation due to its structural degradation and loss of the active component during the reaction and regeneration cycles. In contrast, zeolite KA and ETS-10, which are thermally stable crystalline materials, demonstrated no decrease in their activity for up to four reaction runs, and therefore can be used as effective solid basic catalysts in this reaction. Here we explore for the first time how the thermal and structural stability of the supported clay can affect its activity, an essential issue which has not been sufficiently studied in the recent research related to the biofuel production over solid catalysts. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The scarcity of fossil oils in medium and long term has led to propose different alternatives to replace it, and this is the reason why biodiesel has been proposed as a suitable replacement of conventional diesel oil. One of the most widely inquired heterogeneous catalysts in biodiesel production is calcium oxide (CaO) due to some advantages such as low price and high activity. Unfortunately, this compound is leached by methanol, and in this case, compounds such as CaO and ZnO have been suggested as an alternative to avoid this unwanted phenomenon. According to this, in the current work mixed oxides of calcium–zinc catalysts were synthesized using the co-precipitation method, and later, they were characterized and their behaviors were studied identifying transesterification yields and catalysts life cycle varying some of its operational conditions. Methanol/oil ratio over catalyst amount and Zn/Ca atomic ratio were identified as the main factors that affect the transesterification reaction yield. The maximum yield was 86.99%, obtained with 7.5 wt% catalyst, Zn/Ca atomic ratio of 3.0, methanol/oil molar ratio of 30:1 and a reaction time of 2 h at 56.9 °C. To test its reactivation capacity, a reactivated catalyst with the best behavior was used again obtaining a yield of 83.87% which indicates an insignificant decrease in its catalytic activity. However, the leaching process was detected which does not allow a decrease in purification costs due to residual calcium oxide. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - An increase in greenhouse gas effect and depletion of fossil fuel leads to work on alternate renewable source of energy. Biofuel, in which biodiesel has gained its importance over a decade due to its promising characteristics. Crude glycerol is produced as an inevitable byproduct during biodiesel production. The carbon content of the waste glycerol can be utilized by many microorganisms as a cheap carbon and energy source for the production of high value chemicals like ethanol, citric acid, propanediol etc. In this present work simple sequential procedures like distillation, acidification, activated charcoal adsorption, filtration and centrifugation were carried out made to remove major impurities economically and increases the glycerol concentration. The removal of impurities from crude glycerol and the increase in the concentration of glycerol were witnessed from GCMS and GC-FID reports. The procedure followed in this work provided a realistic and concrete target shows a momentous proliferation of increased glycerol concentration from 10.43% to 44 %. The other properties of glycerol were studied and compared with standard methods. © RJPT All right reserved.

AB  - Utilizing plant-based materials as a biofuel source is an increasingly popular attempt to redesign the global energy cycle. This endeavour underlines the potential of cellulase enzymes for green energy production and requires the structural and functional engineering of natural enzymes to enhance their utilization. In this work, we aimed to engineer enzymatic and functional properties of Endoglucanase I (EGI) by swapping the Ala43-Gly83 region of Cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) from Trichoderma reesei. Herein, we report the enhanced enzymatic activity and improved thermal stability of the engineered enzyme, called EGI_swapped, compared to EGI. The difference in the enzymatic activity profile of EGI_swapped and the EGI enzymes became more pronounced upon increasing metal-ion concentrations in the reaction media. Notably, the engineered enzyme retained a considerable level of enzymatic activity after thermal incubation for 90 min at 70°C while EGI completely lost its enzymatic activity. Circular Dichroism spectroscopy studies revealed distinctive conformational and thermal susceptibility differences between EGI_swapped and EGI enzymes, confirming the improved structural integrity of the swapped enzyme. This study highlights the importance of swapping the metal-ion coordination region in the engineering of EGI enzyme for enhanced structural and thermal stability. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The demand for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) as power sources or auxiliary power sources for small devices is expected to increase in the near future. EBFCs have advanced properties and do not require a separator, depending on the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Two direct electron transfer (DET)-type enzymes were used to modify anodes (length 5 mm, width 4 mm) by a chemical modification method using a condensation agent. The DET-type enzymes used in this study were pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) with glucose as a reaction substrate and fructose dehydrogenase (FDH) using fructose as a reaction substrate. Carboxyl groups were attached to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) that act as catalyst carriers, activated to other functional groups, and reacted with the amino groups of the enzyme by the condensation agent to form covalent bonds. As a result, the upper limit of the concentration, considered to be the reaction limit, was raised as compared with that of EBFC modified with only one kind of enzyme for each electrode prepared by the same process. The output voltage was 0.155 V, and the maximum power density was 80.08 µW/cm 2 Copyright © 2019 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

AB  - This study deals with the computational analysis of methyl oleate; identified as dominant fatty acid alkyl ester produced by trans-esterifying beef tallow. The optimized parameters for biodiesel production were found to be 1:3 molar ratio (oil to methanol), 0.5% wt. catalyst concentration, 60 o C reaction temperature and 2 hours reaction time. The computational analysis was carried out using Gaussian 09 software tool using DFT method (B3LYP/6-31G*). The average bond length between C-C bond, C=C bond was found to be 1.53Å and 1.38Å respectively. The atomic charges exhibited negative charge for oxygen atoms, positive charges for hydrogen atoms and both negative and positive charge for carbon atoms in fatty acid chain. The molecular dipole moment was found to be 1.3671 Debye and quadrupole moment predicted the electronic dislocation in X+Z direction. The orbital and kinetic energies of HOMO and LUMO were found to be - 0.230290 a.u. and 0.013815 a.u. and 1.126274 a.u. and 2.057253 a.u. respectively. The electrostatic potential mapping was done on the oleate ester molecule. © 2019 World Research Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work aims at demonstrating the possibility of producing 2-butanol from lignocellulosic biomass through a new thermochemical approach. The production of biobutanol was carried out using different lignocellulosic feedstock through a 3-step process: first the whole lignocellulosic biomass is hydrolyzed under acid catalyst to produce levulinates, then the levulinates go through decarboxylation to produce 2-butanone which is, in a final step, reduced to produce of 2-butanol. The experimental conditions for the first two steps of the process were optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). The latter could represent an opportunity for the production of economical second-generation butanol without having to go through the classical pathway requiring the production of sugar prior to microbial conversion. © 2019 WIT Press, www.witpress.com

AB  - Recent environmental and economic concerns have prompted resurgence in the use of biofuels throughout the world; there is increase in CO2 emissions as well as several other air pollutants. Edible and non-edible seed oil crops have proven to be recognised sources of vegetable oils for biodiesel production, although the production process has been developed for edible seed oil. Hence this paper highlights the production of biodiesel from plant seed oil, some of the factors that influence its production, the criteria the pure biodiesel must meet, the conversion techniques and the various methods of production acknowledging transesterification as the preferred choice. The aim of this study is the production of biodiesel by choosing the method and raw material with high efficiency. © 2019, Scibulcom Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - The molybdenum-copper catalyst was prepared by impregnating with an aqueous precursors solution by the pore filling method. The catalyst was characterized by determining the acid strength and textural characteristics. The catalyst contains predominantly weak acidic centers and the average pore diameter is 4.3 nm. Conversion of residual fatty acids into deoxygenated liquid were carried out on a laboratory equipment in continuous system using a fixed bed catalytic reactor. The reaction products where mainly linear hydrocarbons C15, C16, C17 and C18 and shorter chain hydrocarbons <C15 and no oxygenated products, alkene or iso-alkane were identified. The yield in hydrocarbons obtained by decarboxylation / decarbonylation and by hydrocraking are lower than the yield in hydrocarbons obtained by hydrodeoxygenation. © 2019 SYSCOM 18 S.R.L..

AB  - Using niobium compounds as heterogeneous catalysts in biodiesel production is a promising methodology from economic and environmental viewpoints. However, the application of niobium catalysts still is a challenge due to the high temperatures and pressures for moderate biofuel yields. Therefore, easily handled and applied materials have been developed to optimize biofuel production, which is the goal of this study. Nb2O5 and ammonium niobium oxalate (AmNO) were activated in reflux and ultrasound-assisted system. Nb2O5 showed better activity under reflux, using methanol. The characterizations conclude that the Lewis-acid sites are determinant for higher conversion rather than surface area. AmNO has better activity also in the reflux system at 70 °C, against 170 °C for Nb2O5, reaching above 70% conversion. In addition, reactions in ultrasound-assisted systems are also appealing due to the lower time and temperature, with conversion rates above 40%. Both catalysts showed interesting results under milder conditions than those in the literature. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - This study investigated catalytic reforming, which is a thermochemical process, as a pioneering method to treat biogas slurry (wastewater from biogas plants) and generate hydrogen. Experimental validation for treating biogas slurries from digested cattle manure, fish intestine, and wheat straw was performed on Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst. The results showed that the total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and PO4 3- ion contents in biogas slurry could be reduced by 98.69, 98.01, and 99.32%, respectively. The highest hydrogen yield was obtained in the treatment of biogas slurry from digested cattle manure at 750 °C, in which the hydrogen yield and hydrogen concentration were 13.85 Lhydrogen/LBS and 79.77 vol %, respectively. Changes in the crystalline phase and structure of the catalyst were observed during catalytic reforming of biogas slurry. Active metal oxidization and carbon deposition were likely to be important factors affecting catalytic stability. The mass flow evaluation verified the hydrogen generation potential by the catalytic reforming of biogas slurry, which was close to the methane generation capability of the upstream biogas plant. However, additional effort is required to address the high energy consumption of this method. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the potential of applying thermochemical techniques to treat and utilize high total organic carbon-containing wastewaters. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop an approach for the processing of agricultural and organic wastes to produce alcoholic fuels such as ethanol and butanol. The cellulosic materials wheat straw (WS), rice straw (RS), and corn stover (CS) were pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) individually, and microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) was treated with dilute H2SO4 and then fermented. The results indicated that pretreatment in acidic condition was best to produce fermentable sugar. However, the high glucose concentration was achieved in C. vulgaris (32 g/L) and WS (20.6 g/L) among lignocellulosic biomass. The microalga that was grown in the nutrient deficient condition had a carbohydrate content of 51% ± 2.1. After fermentation, high concentration of ethanol 9.5 g/L (yield 93.7%) and butanol contents of 7.4 g/L (yield 91.3%) were recorded in wheat straw, whereas C. vulgaris yielded ethanol and butanol concentrations of 14 g/L and 11.8 g/L respectively. The results may help to increase the production of biofuels and reduce the need for imported fuels. © 2019 BioResources.

AB  - Hydroliquefaction is a possible pathway to produce liquid transportation fuels from solid feedstocks like coal or biomass. Though much effort has been put into the investigation of maximizing the oil yield using expensive catalysts and pasting oils in batch setups, little is known about how to commercialize the process. This work aims at the demonstration of lignin hydroliquefaction under conditions interesting for commercial operation. The results from hydroliquefaction experiments of two different lignin types using a cheap iron-based catalyst and anthracene oil as the pasting oil in a semibatch system are presented here. Oil yields of above 50% are reached without observing coke formation. Extensive analyses of the feedstocks and product oils were performed. The process supplies high-quality oil, while differences in the decomposition path of both lignin types are observed. An high heating value of 39 400 J/g and H/C and O/C ratios of up to 1.6 and 0.1, respectively, are detected for the produced bio-oils. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The research work extends our recent empirical knowledge on the rice husks, a carbonaceous solid material. This solid biofuel option was characterized with a potential net heating value of 16–17 MJ/kg, significant high ash deformation temperature recorded above 1450 °C, capable and considerable for thermochemical conversion systems. An experimental performance on a dual fluidized bed steam gasifier using rice husks pellets was carried out at a low temperature between 600 and 650 °C and fuel power of 100 kWth. Pure steam was used as a gasification agent in fluidization at a steam to fuel ratio of 1.2 kg/kg on dry basis. Calcite with mainly CaCO3 in composition was used as bed material for the reactor. Tar content and composition in the product gas stream were analyzed with a gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectrometer (GC–MS). Significant high amounts of total GC–MS tar components (without benzene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) and gravimetric tar (higher molecular tar) were detected at 29.44 and 17.82 g/m3 on dry basis. Benzene content was, respectively, presented on a value of 9 g/m3 on dry basis. Obtained products consisted of relevant amount of phenol and heterocyclic aromatic tars (class 2). The specific composition of common and additional analytes presented in GS–MS tar was summarized for better understanding of tar formation and reduction phenomena of rice husk gasification. © 2019, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In this study, catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Enteromorpha prolifera with aqueous phase recirculation (APR) was tested in order to improve bio-crude yield and reduce catalyst dosage. Bio-crude yields of 17.0% and 18.5% were obtained at 300°C in 30 min of non-catalytic HTL and catalytic HTL with 5.0% NaOH, respectively. Determination of alkali metals showed that 76.7% of the Na was recovered in the aqueous phase, indicating that APR provided the possibility for catalyst recycling. Bio-crude yields were increased to 20.0% and 22.7% when performing APR for non-catalytic and catalytic HTL, respectively. To investigate the effects of recycled catalyst and volatile aqueous products (VAPs), a different APR experiment with VAPs removal for catalytic HTL was conducted, and a bio-crude yield of 17.8% was achieved. It was concluded that bio-crude yield increased with APR, mainly due to the effects of VAPs. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - In this study, the use of liquid-phase plasma discharge (LPPD) technology to accelerate the transesterification process was explored. An innovative LPPD reactor was first evaluated by varying the conductive opening size on the dielectric plate (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mm) coupled with five methanol to oil molar ratios (MOMR; 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and two liquid flowrates through the reactor (2.7 and 4.1 mL s-1) at a given catalyst (NaOH) to oil ratio (NaOR) of 0.8% (w/w). The optimal combination of opening size (1.0 mm), MOMR (5), and flowrate (2.7 mL s-1) was then fixed while the NaOR was varied from 0.4% to 1.2% (w/w) in 0.2% increments to determine the best NaOR for the reactor. The results showed that the best combination of the four operating parameters was an opening size of 1.0 mm, MOMR of 5, liquid flowrate of 2.7 mL s-1, and NaOR of 0.6% (w/w), with which a biodiesel conversion rate of 99.5% was obtained at an applied voltage of 1.2 kV. The transesterification reaction time was found to be only 923 ms. The developed LPPD technology has potential to position biodiesel competitively against petroleum diesel. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers

AB  - The main objective of this paper was to carry out the evaluation of the liquefaction process on Water Hyacinth biomass. To achieve this, a factorial experimental design with a cubic model was developed, for determining the effect of the variables temperature, time and liquid/solid ratio (L/S) on the response variable Energy Yield (EY). Best results were obtained at 300°C, 60 min and L/S = 10 (exp. 15) with RE of 6.34 MJ/kg biomass, at 300°C, 30 min and L/S = 10 (exp. 5) with EY of 6.31 MJ/kg biomass and at 270°C, 60 min and L/S = 20 (exp. 9) with 6.29 MJ/kg biomass, selecting the conditions of exp. 5 as the most appropriate given the lower L/S ratio and the shorter reaction time. The advantage of catalyst presence in the reaction was evident when comparing the results of the EY in exp. 26 with catalyst (5.9 MJ/kg biomass) and experiment without catalyst (3.3 MJ / kg biomass) under the same conditions. It was also possible to determine that the biooils were composed mainly of aromatic compounds, fatty acids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols, and carboxylic acids under more drastic conditions. © 2019 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica.

AB  - This work presents the results of a supercritical transesterification process of soybean oil using methanol, performed in a laboratory high pressure semi-batch reactor. A full description of the equipment and a standard operating procedure are also provided. Since fossil fuels are not renewable, biofuels such biodiesel, have gained attention over the past decades. Biodiesel is the result of the transesterification of triacylglycerols in vegetable oils or animal fats and it works as an alternative fuel for compression-ignition engines. Methanol was chosen to perform the reaction, at molar ratios of 1:24 (oil: alcohol) and 0.1 (CO2:methanol), temperature of 280 °C and pressure of 130 bar. In order to decrease the reaction time, CO2 in the supercritical state was used as cosolvent. The yield of biodiesel produced was equal to 95.19% in only ten minutes of reaction. A high yield of methyl esters (84.41%) was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In general, 10 compounds were identified. The component in higher concentration was linoleate, followed by methyl hexadecanoate, oleic acid methyl ester and methyl stearate. The ester conversion rate means that the process with supercritical methanol can be successfully applied to produce biodiesel. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos, SBCTA.

AB  - Aim: The article deals with production of biodiesel from jojoba oil using ultra assisted sonicator, and the influence and optimization of process parameters on biodiesel production. Methodology: Biodiesel was produced from joboba oil through transesterification by means of ultra assisted technology. Results: The results revealed that the ultrasonic technology reduced the reaction time from 10 hr to 1 hr with an applied power of 40W, methanol-oil ratio of 5:1 and catalyst concentration of 1.5 wt/wt of 5% of oil at 60°C. The maximum yield of esters (92.5%) was obtained at minimum operating temperature of 60°C at initial concentration (1.35%) of catalyst. Intrepretation: This study endorses that biodiesel can be produced by ultra assisted technology which reduces the reaction time required. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - Active lipase-producing bacterium Burkholderia gladioli Bps-1 was rapidly isolated using a modified trypan blue and tetracycline, ampicillin plate. The electro-phoretically pure enzyme was obtained by purification using ethanol precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The molecular weight was 34.6 kDa and the specific activity was determined to be 443.9 U/mg. The purified lipase showed the highest activity after hydrolysis with p-NPC16 at a pH of 8.5 and 50°C, and the Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values were 1.05 mM, 292.95 s-1 and 279 s-1mM-1, respectively. The lipase was highly stable at 7.5 ≤ pH ≤ 10.0. K+ and Na+ exerted activation effects on the lipase which had favorable tolerance to short-chain alcohols with its residual enzyme activity being 110% after being maintained in 30% ethanol for 1 h. The results demonstrated that the lipase produced by the strain B. gladioli Bps-1 has high enzyme activity and is an alkaline lipase. The lipase has promising chemical properties for a range of applications in the food-processing and detergent industries, and has particularly high potential for use in the manufacture of biodiesel. © 2019 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology

AB  - Environmental impacts of fossil fuels and their limited supply are driving the development and use of bio-diesel. Globally, bio-diesel is gaining importance because of its environmental advantages. Jatropha curcas has been widely considered as a potential feedstock for the production of bio-diesel in several tropical countries. This study employs a method of data collection that is a face-to-face interview, along with a questionnaire. The questionnaire is designed, taking into consideration, different aspects of sustainable development. The survey is conducted in Kolkata, based on bio-diesel producing companies. Statistical analysis using SPSS version 17 is used for analysing the data collected from different bio-diesel producing companies from respondents of sample size 100 based on the questionnaire. Analysis of primary data collected is evaluated by chi-square and correlation tests. The results indicate that the relationship of design, maintenance, process capability, facility management, transportation, quality, technology, material, and human resource with sustainable development, is statistically significant and positively correlated. The major barriers that industries are facing relate to inadequate quality management, missing engine approvals and high raw material cost. Removal of tax hurdles and supportive legislative measures are the most efficient measures for overcoming these barriers. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The effect of biofuels on the operational parameters of the combustion engines, such as performance parameters or emission production, are monitored often. These changes are, however, based on the effect of biofuels on the course of combustion pressure inside the combustion chamber. The contribution deals with the effect of rapeseed oil-diesel fuel blends on the combustion characteristics of turbocharged compression ignition engine. The course of cylinder pressure was monitored and analysed and heat release rate was calculated. The brake specific fuel consumption, indicated and brake thermal efficiency were calculated and evaluated, in-cylinder temperature and ignition delay were also evaluated. As a test fuels a 5% and 20% concentrations of rapeseed oil in diesel fuel were selected while 100% diesel fuel was used as a reference. Turbocharged CI engine Zetor 1204 located in the tractor Zetor Forterra 8642 was used for measurement. During measurement the rotation speed of the engine was kept constant at approx. 1,950 min-1 and the load of the engine was selected at approx. 20, 60, 80 and 100%. The results showed decreased cylinder peak pressure, decreased intensity of heat release rate and earlier end of combustion in all tested loads for both tested fuel blends in comparison with diesel fuel, while the lowest peak cylinder pressure was reached using fuel with 5% rapeseed oil. Fuel with 5% rapeseed oil also showed highest indicated efficiency. Ignition delay was found shorter with both of the blended fuels in comparison with diesel fuel. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - Interest in alternative fuels to petroleum and classical fuels has been growing very rapidly in recent years. Furan and its alkyl derivatives, such as methylfuran (2MF), have been identified as valid alternative biofuels. This study focuses on the self-reaction of the peroxy radical generated in the first oxidation step of 2MF, initiated by Cl atoms at 323 K and 4 Torr. The experiments have been carried out by a multiplexed synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometer (mSPIMS) at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (USA). The presence of a peak at m/z = 96 reveals that furfural is the dominant product of 2MF oxidation. Various reaction mechanisms for furfural formation are proposed here. The potential energy surfaces for singlet and triplet spin states have been mapped using quantum mechanical methods, such as CCSD(T), DFT-B3LYP, and composites models (CBS-QB3), to optimize the products, transition states, and intermediates. Experimental and theoretical results provide evidence that furfural does not form by primary reaction chemistry. Self-reaction of the peroxy radical generated in the first oxidation step of 2MF has been proposed as the pathway leading to the formation of furfural. Among various reaction channels, we indentified some entirely exothermic pathways involving oxygen-oxygen coupling and the formation of ROOOOR Russell intermediates. © 2019 the Owner Societies.

AB  - Glucose biofuel cell (GBFC) is a power supply device which has attracted considerable attention because of its green environmental protection and high economic benefits. Fuels like glucose and oxygen are ubiquitous in physiological fluids, allowing the direct harvest of energy from human bodies. Compared with conventional batteries such as Li-Po, GBFC is a more promising alternative to power medical devices without the need to be replaced or refueled. However, the energy conversion efficiency of the existing GBFCs still needs to be further improved for practical applications. In this paper, the performance of the GBFC was studied based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which have relatively high conductivity and large specific surface area that could improve the activity of enzymes immobilized on the electrode surface and thus realize the direct electron transfer (DET). After optimization of the catalysts' amount, the GBFC based on SWCNTs performed well with two Pt layers sprayed on one side of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and 1.5 mL glucose oxidase (GOx) dropped on the other side, which attained the highest open-circuit potential (OCP) of 0.4 V. After being encapsulated with a flexible porous enclosure made by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the biological compatibility of the completed GBFC has been successfully improved, which provides great potential for powering wearable or implantable devices. © 2019 Yingying Li et al.

AB  - A number of viable options are being explored for the production of energy to meet growing global energy demand. The research investigated the conversion of millet husk to liquid hydrocarbons. Furfural was produced from millet husk via a single-stage process that involved simultaneous hydrolysis and dehydration processes, and was subsequently converted to straight-chain hydrocarbons through aldol condensation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions. The hydrodeoxygenation of the aldol condensation product over NiO/Al2O3 (493 K, 30 bar and reaction time of 1 hour) yielded liquid hydrocarbons with the selectivity of 77.5%. The results indicate that millet husk could be a good substrate for furfural production, and could be a source of fuels and chemicals for industries. © 2019 WIT Press

AB  - A multifunctional bioelectrocatalytic material that permits shifting the onset potential for the oxidation of glucose to the value starting below −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) is described. It includes carbon nanotubes modified with 4‑(pyrrole‑1‑yl) benzoic acid, which introduces carboxyl groups that play an important role in enzyme (glucose oxidase) immobilization and improve the stability of the system. Glucose oxidase has been immobilized by a chemical crosslinking method, where bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde are used as a blocking and a crosslinking agent, respectively. Here N-methylphenazonium methyl sulfate has been considered as co-catalyst and a component of the redox mediating system facilitating the effective flow of electrons from redox centers of the enzyme to the electrode surface at fairly negative potentials. The mediator has been confined to the system by the electrostatic attraction with the sulfonate groups of Nafion. Dynamics of charge propagation in the proposed hybrid bioelectrocatalytic films have been assessed from chronocoulometric measurements. The combination of carbon nanotubes, glucose oxidase and N-methylphenazonium methyl sulfate produces a system that is capable of effective oxidation of glucose in 0.1 mol dm−3 phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.0. It can be concluded on the basis of various biochemical and electroanalytical approaches that the system is well-behaved, stable, and redox facile. The Michaelis-Menten constant and the maximum current density (measured in the glucose-containing solutions) are 18 mmol dm−3 and 0.32 mA cm−2, respectively. By referring to fundamentals of electrochemical kinetic analysis, the rate constant in heterogeneous units, 5 ∗ 10−5 cm s−1, has been determined. The calibration plot has a linear response range for glucose concentrations up to ca. 10–12 mmol dm−3 (sensitivity, 12.1 μA mmol−1 dm3 cm−2). An observation of importance to the biofuel cell technology is the appearance of the glucose oxidation voltammetric peak at fairly negative potentials, namely ca. −0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). © 2018

AB  - Some of the main problems during vegetable oil hydrotreating are the high heat of reaction released, the huge quantity of expensive hydrogen required, and the high corrosion rates in the equipment. Some insights into the advantages and disadvantages of processing raw vegetable oils or their respective fatty acid methyl esters are given. The ASPEN Plus process simulator was used for the simulation of a hydrotreating process, with two different feedstocks coming from the same plant: raw castor oil and castor oil methyl esters. That process was modeled with two stoichiometric reactors in series. The technical viability of using methyl esters as hydrotreating feedstock for the production of biofuels such as green gasoline and diesel is demonstrated. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Background: Regarding plant cell wall polysaccharides degradation, multimodular glycoside hydrolases (GHs) with two catalytic domains separated by one or multiple carbohydrate-binding domains are rare in nature. This special mode of domain organization endows the Caldicellulosiruptor bescii CelA (GH9-CBM3c-CBM3b-CBM3b-GH48) remarkably high efficiency in hydrolyzing cellulose. CbXyn10C/Cel48B from the same bacterium is also such an enzyme which has, however, evolved to target both xylan and cellulose. Intriguingly, the GH10 endoxylanase and GH48 cellobiohydrolase domains are both dual functional, raising the question if they can act synergistically in hydrolyzing cellulose and xylan, the two major components of plant cell wall. Results: In this study, we discovered that CbXyn10C and CbCel48B, which stood for the N- and C-terminal catalytic domains, respectively, cooperatively released much more cellobiose and cellotriose from cellulose. In addition, they displayed intramolecular synergy but only at the early stage of xylan hydrolysis by generating higher amounts of xylooligosaccharides including xylotriose, xylotetraose, and xylobiose. When complex lignocellulose corn straw was used as the substrate, the synergy was found only for cellulose but not xylan hydrolysis. Conclusion: This is the first report to reveal the synergy between a GH10 and a GH48 domain. The synergy discovered in this study is helpful for understanding how C. bescii captures energy from these recalcitrant plant cell wall polysaccharides. The insight also sheds light on designing robust and multi-functional enzymes for plant cell wall polysaccharides degradation. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The shortage of fossil resources and strict environmental regulations have ignited great efforts in the production of bio-based fuels and chemicals via biorefinery. Herein, considering the strong interaction between Ni and Mg species, we specially designed and prepared Ni/CaMgO and Ni/MgSiO for alkylation and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions during the upgrading of the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixture. Gratifyingly, the Mg-decorated catalysts exhibited great catalytic performance: a selectivity of 63.9% under a conversion of 94.2% was achieved for C8-C15 ketones and alcohols, which is higher than that over other heterogeneous alkali-based catalysts, and the obtained mixture was completely converted into the corresponding alkanes at 190 °C (H2 pressure: 1 MPa). It is worth noting that jet fuels or gasoline could be efficiently and selectively obtained by facile adjustment of the composition of the ABE fermentation product. Moreover, investigation on the structure-activity correlation confirmed that the outstanding activity of Ni/MgSiO for HDO could be attributed to the synergic catalysis between Ni0 and strong acid sites. The Ni/CaMgO and Ni/MgSiO catalysts reported in this work offer three advantages: selectively upgrading zymotic biomass wastes into biofuels, replacing the expensive noble metal (Pd) by the base metal (Ni), and realizing the HDO process under mild conditions and complying with the principles of "green chemistry". Overall, this work opens a new possibility for biofuel production, which is conductive to the rational design and implementation of highly active heterogeneous catalysts. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Methane (CH4) and bio alcohols have different ignition properties. These have been extensively studied and the resulting experimental data have been used to validate chemical kinetic models. Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is of interest because of its relative availability and lower emissions compared to other hydrocarbon fuels. Given growing interest in fuel-flexible systems, there can be situations in which the combustion properties of natural gas need to be modified by adding biofuels such as bio alcohols. This can occur in dual-fuel internal combustion engines or gas turbines with dual-fuel capabilities. The combustion behavior of such blends can be understood by studying the auto ignition properties in fundamental combustion experiments. Studies of the ignition of such blends are very limited in the literature. In this work, the auto ignition of methane and bio alcohol fuel blends is investigated using a shock tube facility. The chosen bio alcohols are ethanol (C2H5OH) and n-propanol (NC3H7OH). Experiments are carried out at 3 atm and 10 atm for stoichiometric and lean mixtures of fuel, oxygen, and argon. The ignition delay times of the pure fuels are first established at conditions of constant oxygen concentration and comparable pressures. The ignition delay times of blends with 50% methane are then measured. The pyrolysis kinetics of the blends is further explored by measuring CO formation during pyrolysis of the alcohol and methane-alcohol blends. The resulting experimental data are compared with the predictions of selected chemical kinetic models to establish the ability of these models to predict the disproportionate enhancement of methane ignition by the added alcohol. © 2019 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - In this study, CuO was synthesized as a microwave absorber in the pyrolysis of a biomass model (sugarcane bagasse). CuO was synthesized for 5 min of irradiation using the following techniques: microwave (MW), ultrasound (US), combined mode (MW-US), and conduction heating (CH) as a reference material. The use of these treatments promotes changes in the morphology, as MW and US generate leaves and monolithic faceted morphologies, respectively. Changes were also generated in some textural characteristics such as crystal size, surface area, and volume-pore size. They were produced as a consequence of changes in the conditions during the crystallization stage produced by the different irradiation types. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis was performed aiming for the maximum liquid fraction (bio-oil) in the products. The reaction time, the size of the biomass, and the CuO synthesis method were also analyzed. The following particle size (ps) intervals were studied: ps &lt; 0.5 mm, 0.5 mm &lt; ps &lt; 1.7 mm, 1.7 mm &lt; ps &lt; 3.5 mm. The best conditions at 1160Watts in the microwave were: 4 min of reaction, particle size lower than 0.5 mm, and CuO synthesized by US. The use of CuO in the pyrolysis almost triples the amount of the obtained liquid fraction, when compared with the pyrolysis without the use of a microwave absorbent. The CuO was reduced to Cu2O and Cu after the pyrolysis. In this work, a reduction in the reaction times from hours to minutes was achieved during the synthesis of CuO and the pyrolysis biomass. The liquid fraction (bio-oil) can be raw material to obtain value-added chemical products or biofuels. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The combination of wastewater treatment and biodiesel production using algal cultivation was studied in the present work. The two main goals of the work were achieved by the cultivation of freshwater microalgae such as Chlamydomonas sp., Scenedesmus ecornis, and Scenedesmus communis in two different dilutions of fertilizer plant wastewater (FWWD1 and FWWD2) collected from Yara Suomi Oy, Finland. The growth pattern of different algal species in FWWD1 and FWWD2 was observed. The effect of pH on biomass concentration, lipid content, biomass productivity, and lipid productivity by all three algal species in FWWD1 and FWWD2 were monitored. The maximum biomass concentration and productivity were observed in FWWD1 at pH7.5 for Chlamydomonas sp. and at pH 8.5 for S. ecornis and S. communis. The maximum lipid content was detected in Chlamydomonas sp at pH5.5, followed by S. ecornis and then S. communis at pH 7.5 in FWWD2 obtained after co-solvent extraction method. The most significant removal percentage of COD by all algal species were observed in FWWD1, whereas the highest removal percentage of TN and TP were detected in FWWD2, respectively. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) characterization of each algal species in FWWD1 and FWWD2 at their optimum pH was investigated to determine the quality of obtained biodiesel. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has emerged as a promising technology for producing fuels/chemicals. Lignin liquefaction was carried out with different temperature 250, 270, 290 and 310 °C in the presence of 50% ethanol-50% water (v/v) and a reaction time 30 min. The catalyst reaction with 10 wt% each catalyst of Pd/C, Fe/C, Co/C and Ni/C at 270 °C for 30 min reaction time was carried out. For non-catalytic reaction maximum bio-oil (68.2 wt%) was obtained at 270 °C while catalytic reaction with Co/C catalyst gave highest bio-oil (73.2 wt%). The obtained bio-oil has been analyzed with the help of GC-MS, FT-IR, NMR, GPC and CHNS. On the basis of GC-MS analysis, the main monomeric phenolic compounds produced were phenol, 2-methoxy-phenol, 4-ethyl-phenol, 2-methoxy-4-ethyl-phenol and 2,6-dimethoxy-phenol, due to their high concentrations it was feasible to select these five monomeric phenols as target compounds. It was seen that compared to the non-catalytic liquefaction reaction, the catalytic (Pd/C, Co/C, Ni/C and Fe/C) liquefaction reaction promotes the hydrogenation and hydrogeoxygenation of bio-oils. The possible reaction pathways have been explored in this studied. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Levoglucosan (1,6-anhydro-β-D-glucopyranose) is an anhydrosugar found in significant amounts in pyrolysis liquids obtained from lignocellulosic biomass. Levoglucosan (LG) is an attractive source for glucose (GLC), which can be used as a feedstock for biofuels (e.g. bioethanol) and biobased chemicals. Here, we report a kinetic study on the conversion of LG to GLC in water using Amberlyst 16 as the solid acid catalyst at a wide range of conditions in a batch set-up. The effects of the reaction temperature (352–388 K), initial LG intake (100–1000 mol m−3), catalyst loading (1–5 wt%), and stirring rate (250–1000 rpm) were determined. The highest GLC yield was 98.5 mol% (388 K, 5 wt% Amberlyst 16, CLG,0 = 500 mol m−3 at 500 rpm stirring rate and t = 60 min). The experimental data were modelled and relevant kinetic parameters were determined using a first order approach including diffusion limitations of LG inside the Amberlyst particles. Good agreement between experiments and kinetic model was obtained. The activation energy was found to be 132.3 ± 10.1 kJ mol−1. Experiments in a continuous packed bed set-up for up to 30 h show that catalyst stability is good. In addition, the steady state LG conversion (73 mol%) and the GLC selectivity were in line with the kinetic model obtained in the batch reactor. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Microalgal biomass has been widely investigated as a source of renewable energy, but currently, some alternatives are not economically competitive. Thermochemical conversion of biomass is an alternative way to transform their organic compounds into liquid and gaseous fuels. The aim of this work is twofold; first, the pyrolytic process of the microalga Botryococcus braunii (BB) by thermogravimetric analysis, as well as the relevant reaction kinetic constants and related activation energies, is assessed. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis of the biomass gasification process with air using a thermochemical model was conducted to predict the composition of a syngas as a function of the biomass moisture content and the biomass/air ratio. The results showed that BB biomass is composed mainly of carbon (62.4 wt.%) with volatile solids of 84 wt.%, while the fixed carbon represents around 7 wt.%. Additionally, observed values for heating (27.86 MJ kg−1) and activation energy (~ 110 kJ mol−1) were different from other algal feedstocks due to the capacity of accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons of this. On the other side, the gasification process showed it was found that the moisture content in the biomass and biomass/air ratio variables are key parameters for reaction temperature and producer gas composition. Accordingly, with a suitable combination of these variables, it is possible to obtain a syngas composed of gaseous species with high energy content (CO, 18 vol.%; H2, 17 vol.%; and CH4, 2 vol.%.), which can be transformed through processes such as Fisher-Tropsch process into liquid biofuels such as kerosene or gasoline. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Many possibilities have been explored so far for replacing petro-diesel with biodiesel and hybrid fuel, but none of these bio-fuels could completely substitute the petro-diesel with or without modification in the CI engine. In this perspective, renewable diesel or green diesel has been gaining popularity due to its higher cetane index and calorific value than that of petro-diesel, biodiesel, and hybrid fuel. This study investigates the production of green diesel from waste cooking oil (WCO) by hydro-processing and TBP distillation. The fuel properties of the green diesel thus produced were estimated using ASTM/EN standards and thereafter green diesel (G100) and its blends (G10, G20, G30 &amp; G50) were used as fuel in a CI engine to analyze the effect on engine combustion, performance and emission characteristics. The results obtained were compared with petro-diesel, optimized biodiesel blend B30 and hybrid fuel (HB-1) to explore its efficacy under same experimental test rig and operating conditions. Over the entire loading conditions, green diesel blends showed higher BTE with lower BSEC. The emissions of CO, UHC and smoke opacity reduced, but a slight increase in NOX level was observed. The shorter ignition delay and higher cetane index of green diesel generated peaks of CP, HRR and ROPR near TDC as compared to the other tested fuels.

AB  - Pyrolysis oil from softwood forestry residues (sawdust and bark) often contains too much water to be a useful fuel. Excess water can be removed by distillation or pervaporation to meet the ASTM burner fuel standard, while producing methanol rich aqueous distillates/permeates. This work focuses on electrolysis of the aqueous byproduct stream to produce hydrogen. Short-path vacuum distillation produced the best fuel, but acetic acid, hydroxyacetone, acrolein, and other impurities strongly suppressed the electrolysis of the methanol. However, fractional distillation produced a distillate that could be electrolyzed at 14 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V at a PtRu catalyst, and 220 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V at a Pt catalyst. Pervaporation also produced a standard fuel, while electrolysis of permeates produced current densities as high as 44 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V and 240 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V. There is scope for substantial improvements by decreasing the effect of impurities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fractional and chemical composition of bio-oil and its gasoline fraction, obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction of Arthrospira platensis biomass, was studied. The bio-oil yield was 34.6%, the heat of combustion of bio-oil was 33.4 MJ/kg, and the gasoline fraction yield was 28.8%. The content of carbon and hydrogen in the gasoline fraction of the bio-oil was appreciably higher than in the initial bio-oil, and the calorific value of the gasoline fraction is 3.87 MJ/kg higher than that of the initial bio-oil. With respect to the carbon and hydrogen content, the gasoline fraction of the bio-oil is close to motor fuels, differing from them in the higher content of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Fractional distillation of bio-oil decreased the content of high-molecular-mass condensed compounds in the product.

AB  - A copolymer poly(methyl methacrylate-co-vinylferrocene) was synthesized and used for the first time in a biofuel cell design. Bioanaode enzyme glucose oxidase and biocathode enzyme bilirubin oxidase were physically immobilized onto the copolymer-modified electrodes. Characterization studies were conducted by scanning electron microscopy, carbon-13, fourier transform infrared and hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, and cyclic voltammograms. The designed biofuel cell was operated with linear sweep voltammetry. The maximum current was at 45°C with 120 μg of polymer amount. An improved power density of 323 μW cm−2 that is higher than other ferrocene-based fuel cells was obtained with 10-mM glucose at 0.4 V with the designed bioanode. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A holistic sustainability analysis for early-stage biofuel production processes plays a critical role in the improvement of the overall life-cycle sustainability. Once a conceptual conversion process is developed, the next step is to evaluate its overall sustainability, preferably based on a process sustainability evaluation methodology using various indicators. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Gauging Reaction Effectiveness for the Environmental Sustainability of Chemistries with a Multi-objective Process Evaluator (GREENSCOPE) methodology evaluates processes in four areas: environment, energy, economics, and efficiency. The method develops relative sustainability scores for indicators that allow comparisons across various technologies. In this study, we implemented GREENSCOPE methodology for a sustainability performance assessment of NREL's conceptual design for the indirect liquefaction of biomass to high-octane gasoline blendstock by evaluating a range of metrics beyond the typical minimum fuel selling price and greenhouse gas emissions considerations. We applied this methodology to assess the sustainability performance of this gate-to-gate conceptual design. One outcome of the sustainability evaluation is to allow researchers to identify process areas in need of sustainability improvement during biofuel production, and the challenges and opportunities for achieving the best possible sustainability targets. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The catalytic etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with t-butanol to a biofuel additive 5-(t-butoxymethyl) furfural (t-BMF) is studied by screening 27 heterogeneous protic and/or Lewis acids. Preyssler heteropolyacid H14[NaP5W30O110] and Montmorillonite-based CLOI_CSP catalysts are identified as the most efficient ones, allowing the etherification to reach the t-BMF/HMF equilibrium faster (≈1:1), thus promoting minimum side reactions. Further optimization of the batch experimental conditions, namely catalyst loading, temperature, HMF concentration, time, t-BMF stability, and additives, allows the t-BMF/HMF equilibrium to be reached in less than 3 h with outstanding selectivity &gt;95%. Under optimized conditions, CLOI_CSP is reused for four cycles without significant loss of efficiency. In addition, it exhibits high efficiency under flow conditions, allowing continuous production of t-BMF up to 0.7 g t-BMF g−1 catalyst min−1 at high concentrations of HMF. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The global interest in reducing the use of petroleum resources to mitigate climate change has created a need for the continuing demand for environmentally friendly systems from renewable resources to produce clean and sustainable technology. One promising approach involves the development of catalysts and process improvements to increase the efficiency of the chemical modification reactions. In this study, sunflower oil was used in the skeletal isomerization reaction to introduce methyl branching at the alkyl fatty acid chain of the oil (methyl-branched-chain triglycerides (MBC-TG)) in the presence of a modified H+-BETA zeolite catalyst. Such modification of the oil is proposed to improve its low temperature fluidity, by preventing precipitation at low temperatures. The modified catalyst was easy to handle and separate from the reaction products. The products were thoroughly characterized by common analytical instruments. To evaluate the practicality of this environmentally friendly process, a techno-economic model was constructed to estimate the production cost. © 2019

AB  - Alternative fuel components have a continuously growing use worldwide. Hydrocarbons with high hydrogen to carbon ratio in their molecular structures are the most suitable alternative fuels. In this paper the special hydrocracking of waste fatty acids and waste lard to paraffin mixtures over sulfided NiMoP/Al2O3 is presented. The effect of feedstock additives was investigated on the catalyst performance, such as activity, selectivity, product yield and catalyst lifetime. It was concluded that coke precursors, which were formed from olefinic components reduced the catalyst performance. Olefins were generated as intermediates of hydrocracking but could be present also in the feedstocks. Based on the results it was also concluded that application of amine and phenol type additives in the feedstocks inhibited the formation of coke precursors and coke. Results of catalytic tests having length of ca. 1000 h were compared. Applying 200 mg/kg additive in favorable combination resulted in about 21–37 wt% increase in the yield of target products relative to that using feedstock without additives. The obtained target products were rich in n-paraffins and represented diesel blending components of &gt;85 cetane number. Various ideas are proposed for the utilization of the obtained bio-paraffin mixture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of pine wood was carried out to yield a liquid bio-oil mixture that was separated into organic and aqueous phases. The organic phase (ORG-bio-oil) was characterized by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy, 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. It was further used as a raw material for producing a mixture of biphenolic compounds (ORG-biphenol). ORG-bio-oil, ORG-biphenol, and bisphenol-A were reacted with cyanogen bromide to yield cyanate ester monomers. Cyanate esters were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy and were thermally cross-linked to develop thermoset materials. Thermomechanical properties of cross-linked cyanate esters were assessed using dynamic mechanical analysis and compared with those of cross-linked bisphenol-A-based cyanate ester. ORG-biphenol cyanate ester was observed to have a superior glass transition temperature (350–380°C) as compared to bisphenol-A cyanate ester (190–220°C). Cyanate esters derived from bio-oil have the potential to be a sustainable alternative to the bisphenol-A-derived analog. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Decarboxylation process of waste cooking oils (WCOs) has been convinced to be one of the most effective methods to produce biofuels from biomass, but the high yield of correlative decarboxylation reactions used to occur under high temperature and pressure. Now, the moderate photo-decarboxylation was bursting tremendous potentials for solving the extreme situation problems, and the photoinduced active radicals ([rad]OH/h+) played the key roles in photo-decarboxylation process. However, the key step of [rad]OH-involved photo-decarboxylation has been still ambiguity. Here, we investigated the [rad]OH-involved decarboxylation reaction process using DMol3 module based on density functional theory, and the methyl stearate (MS) was chosen as the model reaction for further understanding the MS-decarboxylation controlling step and reaction mechanism. The calculated structures, thermodynamics and kinetics revealed that the MS-decarboxylation belonged to two-[rad]OH-induced reaction. With the first [rad]OH reaction, methyl hydrogen carbonate (HO–(C[dbnd]O)–OCH3, MHC), as the most stable intermediate, would exist when [rad]OH attacked the adjacent carbon of carbonyl site (C3) of MS. Then, the MHC reacted slowly with the second [rad]OH, as the controlling step of MS-decarboxylation processes. Our results indicated that the improved decarboxylation rate of MHC could accelerate the subsequent reactions in [rad]OH-involved decarboxylation processes. Finally, OH− attacking MS process was introduced for comparison. Our findings should provide new fundamental insights into [rad]OH action mechanism in photo-decarboxylation process for WCOs to biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Laminarinases exhibit potential in a wide range of industrial applications including the production of biofuels and pharmaceuticals. In this study, we present the genetic and biochemical characteristics of FLamA and FLamB, two laminarinases derived from a metagenomic sample from a hot spring in the Azores. Sequence comparison revealed that both genes had high similarities to genes from Fervidobacterium nodosum Rt17-B1. The two proteins showed sequence similarities of 62% to each other and belong to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 16. For biochemical characterization, both laminarinases were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. FLamA and FLamB exhibited similar properties and both showed highest activity towards laminarin at 90 °C and pH 6.5. The two enzymes were thermostable but differed in their half-life at 80 °C with 5 h and 1 h for FLamA and FLamB, respectively. In contrast to other laminarinases, both enzymes prefer β-1,3-glucans and mixed-linked glucans as substrates. However, FLamA and FLamB differ in their catalytic efficiency towards laminarin. Structure predictions were made and showed minor differences particularly in a kink adjacent to the active site cleft. The high specific activities and resistance to elevated temperatures and various additives make both enzymes suitable candidates for application in biomass conversion. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This paper first examines the experimental results from a 16-h plasma-assisted gasification trial for conversion of refuse derived fuel (RDF) into syngas suitable for biofuel production in a pilot plant. In particular, the work focuses on the effect on the concurrent ash vitrification and tar reforming processes on the general composition of a syngas stream produced in a fluidized bed gasifier. The effect of plasma on tar reforming is showed by continuous monitoring of gas composition before and after the plasma converter, with reduction efficiencies typically exceeding 99%v/v for most hydrocarbons, SO2, NH3, NOx, and organic sulfur. The test also investigates on the effect of plasma intensity on different contaminants reforming and syngas conditioning when varying the input power value at cracking-relevant temperatures. A simplified catalytic test is undertaken under continuous flow of cleaned syngas generated by the pilot plant to identify the short-term effects of waste-derived contaminants on catalysts activity when plasma refining is not operated. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Farnesene is an important chemical platform for many industrial products, such as biofuels and polymers. We performed high-efficiency utilization of corncobs for β-farnesene production by separate hydrolysis and fermentation with an optimized Escherichia coli strain. First, we developed a recycling strategy for both corncob pretreatment and cellulose hydrolysis, which saved great amounts of pretreatment reagents and presented a 96.83% cellulose conversion rate into glucose. However, the corncob hydrolysate strongly repressed cell growth and β-farnesene production, being caused by high-concentrated citrate. Through expressing a heterologous ATP citrate lyase and screening for a suitable expression host, an optimized strain was constructed that produced β-farnesene at 4.06 g/L after 48 h in a 5 L fermenter, representing an approximately 2.3-fold increase over the initial strain. Therefore, the proposed strategy about the recycling process and repression elimination was successful and suitable for the production of lignocellulosic-based β-farnesene, which can be further studied to scale up for industrialization. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The biofuels are the most important alternative energy sources in future to fulfil the energy demands. The team of our students carried out an innovative process to convert waste to value-added products. The students have been visited many meat stalls and gathered the required amount of resources with and without cost. The collected waste chicken skin and pig tallow is heated and extracted fat, which is the primary sources to produce the biofuel. The fat extraction process was carried by shredding down the waste chicken skin and pig tallow. The obtained fat was filtered and heated up to 110ºC to remove all the impurities, water suspensions, blood cells and pieces of bones. The process called transesterification process was carried out to convert obtained fat into biofuel with methyl alcohol and KOH as a catalyst. Transesterification process carted with fat before acid wash and after acid wash to examine the effect of FFA on biofuel yield. The quantity of biofuel yield has been observed to be 62 to 68% for fat from waste chicken skin and 82 to 83 % for fat from pig tallow. The derived fuel from fat from both resources is combined with conventional diesel fuel to check the different properties on a volume basis varied by 10% up to 40%. The essential properties such as viscosity, density, flashpoint, fire point and calorific values were determined, and results show that the fuel combination CB20 and PB20 meets the all requirements of ASTM standards to fix as an additive fuel to CI engines. The clear biofuel from both the fat expressed higher viscosity, density, flash and fire point with a lesser value of energy density. © BEIESP.

AB  - Carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is one of the promising negative emission technologies (NET). Within various CCUS routes available, CO2 conversion into fuels is one of the attractive options. Currently, most of CO2 conversion into fuels requires hydrogen, which is expensive and consume large energy to produce. Hence, a different route of producing fuel from CO2 by utilizing 1,4-butanediol as the raw material is proposed and evaluated in this study. This alternative route comprises production of levulinic acid from the reaction between CO2 and 1,4-butanediol and production of ethyl levulinate, an alternative biofuel and biofuel additive, via an esterification reaction of levulinic acid with ethanol. The process is designed and simulated according to the available data and evaluated in terms of its technical features. Because of the unavailability of reaction data for synthesis of levulinic acid from 1,4-butanediol and CO2, several assumptions were taken, which may implicate the accuracy of the studied design. This technical evaluation is followed by cost estimations and sensitivity analysis. Because of the free CO2, the profitability of the plant depends strongly on the prices of the other chemicals and the price difference between 1,4-butanediol (raw material) and ethyl levulinate (product). Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the proposed plant will always be profitable if the ethyl levulinate is slightly more expensive than the 1,4-butanediol, highlighting that the process of producing ethyl levulinate from CO2 is economically profitable. Future research should be directed towards a catalytic system that can effectively convert CO2 into levulinic acid, by-products produced from the two reaction steps, and reduce the excess ethanol used in the second reaction. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, rapid increase in vehicle population led to increase in demand of fossil fuel. Decrease in availability of crude oil made the researchers to find a renewable alternative fuel, biofuels. Methyl esters are preferred as alternative to petro-diesel engines. The present experimental study of Mimusops elangi methyl ester (MEME) is used as biodiesel on single cylinder four stroke, direct injection air cooled diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at various loads. The general optimum biodiesel blends 20MEME-80D (20%MEME-80%Diesel) with optimum of 25 ppm TiO2 nanoparticle additives were taken for the experiment. The injection pressure of the engine is varied from 180 bar to 240 bar in the steps of 20 bar. The results of experimental investigation reported that the change in injection pressure 220 bar with modified fuel (20MEME-80D + 25 ppm TiO2 nanoparticle) shows better performance and emission characteristics in the diesel engine. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - In this study, the effect of using a blended biodiesel fuel containing 10% rapeseed methyl ester (RME) on the composition and quantity of the chemicals emitted by a modern diesel engine was investigated. The diesel engine that was utilized fulfilled Japan’s Post New Long Term emission standards and was equipped with an after-treatment system comprising a diesel oxidation catalyst and a catalyzed diesel particulate filter (c-DPF). Using the Japanese JE05 transient cycle as the testing cycle, the exhaust gas was sampled for three different states: when the after-treatment system was not deployed, termed “engine-out” (due to the sampling location); when the after-treatment system was deployed, termed “tailpipe-out” (likewise due the sampling location); and when the after-treatment system was deployed and the c-DPF was regenerating, termed “regen”. Evidence from this study indicated that the use of 10% RME biodiesel had no significant impact on the emissions of CO, CO2, the total hydrocarbons, and NOx, which are regulated, regardless of the sampling state. However, the emissions of elemental carbon, organic carbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are unregulated, showed some effects. During engine-out and tailpipe-out, emissions of the elemental carbon species EC2 were slightly lower when using the biodiesel blend than the petroleum diesel (D) fuel; however, an increase in the organic carbon species OC1 and OC2 and in some PAHs was observed during regen because of the sizable consumption of the biodiesel blend compared to D fuel. These results confirm that 10% RME biodiesel is a promising alternative to fossil fuels for diesel engines, but it is important to grasp the behavior of individual components and carefully investigate the effects of increased mixing ratios. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The increasing consumption of coffee worldwide has led to higher amounts of spent coffee grounds (SCG) being produced which are generally disposed of in landfill or used as compost. However, the wide range of molecules present in SCG such as saccharides, lignin, lipids and proteins give this biomass source a large chemical functionality. In this work, SCG were fractionated to separate the components into three separate portions for further valorization; these were hemicellulose-enriched fractions (HEF), lignin-enriched fraction (LEF) and cellulose-enriched fraction (CEF). HEF was effectively used in the growth of the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima, additionally, the C6 sugars present in this fraction suggests that it can be used in the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The LEF had a considerable high heating value (HHV) and would be suitable as a biofuel component for combustion. CEF was efficiently used in the production of HMF as 0.35 g of this product were obtained from 10 g of SCG. Such results demonstrate that SCG can be effectively used in the production of HMF within a biorefinery concept. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate simultaneously the effect of produced ethanolic biodiesel from several feedstocks (soybean, crambe, macaw, sunflower, and waste cooking oil) and engine operational conditions (low and high engine speed) during combustion of biodiesel/diesel blends on the N2O, NOx, NO, CO2, and CO emission levels in the atmosphere. The biodiesel samples were prepared in one and/or two reaction steps, according to the acid index of each raw material, by esterification using H2SO4 and/or chemical transesterification using sodium ethoxide, both, through ethanolic route. The quality of the produced biodiesels was confirmed by ASTM/EN specifications. Then, biodiesel/diesel blends were prepared according to the following proportions: 10% (B10), 15% (B15), 25% (B25), and 50% (B50). In general way, all raw materials under combustion at low and high engine speed contributed to the formation of NOx and this effect was more drastically increased as the biodiesel concentration in the blends increases. N2O presented a similar behavior except for blends containing crambe and macaw biodiesel whose emissions were slightly reduced as a function of biodiesel content in these blends. Then, Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to discriminate the effect of engine operating conditions, biodiesel kind, and biodiesel content in the blends during their combustion on the exhaust emissions. The attained results point to crambe and macaw as more environmentally sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel production because they generate less greenhouse gas emissions. These results are particularly attractive considering that, both, crambe and macaw are non-edible feedstocks with great potential for biodiesel production. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Deoxygenation of methyl laurate was carried out over potassium FAU zeolites. The influence of the silicon/aluminum molar ratio was studied using K-USY (3.2), KNaY (2.6) and KNaX (1.1). Decreasing the Si/Al ratio increases the basicity of the zeolite, which improved the deoxygenation capacity by decarboxylation/decarbonylation of the methyl laurate. The use of methanol as solvent it is necessary to avoid the transesterification or the hydrolysis of the methyl ester, as well as to produce hydrogen in situ increasing the formation of dodecane. Potassium X zeolite (K-KNaX) showed a steady catalytic activity with the time on stream over 40% with yield to bio-hydrocarbons C10 to C12 of 30% and reaching selectivity of 70%. The biofuel produced reduced the viscosity 25% and improved the heat value 2500 kJ/kg respect to the initial methyl laurate. Therefore, it is possible to upgrade of the biodiesel by thermocatalytic processes using potassium X zeolites. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A single-phase transesterification of linseed oil has been investigated in the presence of heterogeneous base catalyst (CaO) with different co-solvents and hydrogel as a water absorber. Di-ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, biodiesel, n-hexane were depleted as co-solvents to improve the mutual solubility of the oil and methanol. The molar ratio of methanol to oil, the molar ratio of co-solvent to methanol, and catalyst concentration are among the integral parameters that influence the FAME yield. The results of transesterification processes with co-solvent and without co-solvent were compared with each other, thus, T-test and F-test depicted striking level of modification. Response surface methodology was carried out to optimize the main process parameters. The maximum FAME yield of 98.77% was reached under the following optimum conditions: molar ratio of methanol to oil 9.41:1, molar ratio of DEE to methanol of 1.11:1, catalyst concentration of 0.98 wt%, temperature of 30 °C, agitation rate of 650 rpm, and reaction time of 60 min. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An experiment was carried out to investigate the performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine using jojoba ethyl ester (JEE), and its blends with ethanol in different ratios of 5, 10, 15 and 20% ethanol (denoted by E5, E10, E15 and E20). Engine performance and exhaust emission of five different fuels in a single-cylinder, naturally aspirated, direct-injection diesel engine were compared with those of diesel fuel at different engine speeds from 1000 to 2000 rpm. The engine performance (power, torque, specific fuel consumption, and thermal efficiency) and exhaust emissions (CO2, CO, NOx, and SO2) were measured and are presented here. Details of the effects of the fuels on the combustion and exhaust emissions are discussed in the present work. JEE and its blends with ethanol are considered good biofuels, which can be used in diesel engines, with minimum modifications needed to the engine; however, efforts are still needed to reduce the viscosity of JEE. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The TGA analysis shows that most of the degradation take place between the temperature range of 250-400oC. The studies were carried out at two different temperatures of 500oC and 600oC using a batch reactor with different blended ratios, with blended feedstocks to catalyst ratio of 4:1. The effects of the two variables i.e. temperature and blending ratios among the two feedstocks, in terms of the products yield of liquid fuel, gas, coke and conversion were determined. The blending ratio of 4:1 (RFO: BL) yielding highest conversion of 76 wt. % at 600oC was found to be the most favourable condition in this investigation. © 2020 Phcogj.Com.

AB  - This study investigated the acid-catalyzed esterification of two brands of crude rice bran oil (CRBO) with free fatty acids (FFAs) content of about 8 and 10%, respectively. Experimental variables included reaction time, methanol-to-FFA molar ratio and sulfuric acid content with temperature and stirring speed fixed at 60 °C and 600 RPM, respectively. A central composite design was used initially for sequential experimentation and followed by a Box-Behnken design to refine the optimum process conditions. Results showed that final FFA in CRBO could be reduced to less than 1% FFA in a single-step. The methanol-to-FFA molar ratio had the maximum influence on the esterification process and was followed by the reaction time and amount of catalyst. The optimum conditions for FFA conversion in CRBO were: reaction time 90 and 48 min, 62:1 and 70:1 methanol-to-FFA molar ratio, 22.5 and 20% (w/w) sulfuric acid based on FFA for Brand I and II, respectively. Under these pretreatment conditions, initial FFA was reduced to 0.61 and 0.70%, respectively making the CRBO suitable for biodiesel production. © 2019, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative renewable fuel in the world energy matrix, originating from animal fats and vegetable oils from grains, such as the castor bean cultivated by family farmers in the Brazilian semiarid region. However, the production of biodiesel has some disadvantages. For example, it is difficult to use the same types of oil/fat all year round. In addition, the use of methanol in the biodiesel synthesis and agitation process results in a high consumption of energy. Given this background, this article proposes an alternative biodiesel synthesis using castor oil and peanut oil mixtures, ultrasound-assisted in an ethylic route. The experimental conditions were optimized utilizing a Box-Behnken design. The response variable was a biodiesel yield. In this work, it was possible to reduce the ratio of alcohol to oil and thus reduce the energy consumption and increase the mass yield. This permitted the generation of biofuel with lower production costs. Finally, the response surface methodology leads to operational conditions more suitable for the production of biodiesel. In this work, the best conditions were obtained using 0.50% catalyst concentration, 50/50 castor:peanut oil rate, and 5:1 alcohol:oil ratio. These were moderate and suitable conditions for the synthesis of biodiesel in comparison with the works found in the literature, reaching a high yield of 97.93%. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel, as a renewable energy, has gained much attention due to the threat of exhaustion of fossil sources and the enormous pressure of environmental pollution. However, biofuels often suffer from low densities and high volatilities, which limit their application in important liquid transportation fuels, for example, jet and diesel fuels. At present, the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass-derived chemicals has become a promising approach to produce high-density jet and diesel biofuels. Herein a rapid, green Michael addition reaction is developed for constructing intermediates of a series of new high-density biofuels with volumetric neat heat of combustion (VNHOC) values. The reactions are performed under solvent-free conditions with commercially cheap tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.05 eq) and K3PO4·3H2O (0.03 eq) as a catalyst and a base, respectively, to afford products with good to excellent yields of 89%–99%. The theoretical calculation indicates that the VNHOC values of the potential biofuels (up to 39.06 MJ L−1) are comparable to those of most state-of-the-art biofuels and commercial jet fuels that are obtained from fossil sources. This method may pave a new way of investigating high-density biofuels with accurate structures and high-energy contents. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The present study aim is to characterise catalytic and non-catalytic biomass pyrolysis liquid products. Turkey is the world’s largest hazelnut producer and also ranks fifth in tea production, so a mixture of hazelnut shell, tea bush and hazelnut knot was selected as the biomass sample, and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) was also used as a catalyst. Considering the biomass mixture and catalyst used, this research is unique for the literature. Bio-oils, which are obtained by catalytic and non-catalytic processes and collected in two sub-fractions, were characterised. The sub-fractions of toluene and ethyl acetate, there was a significant increase in calorific values compared with the mixture without catalyst, because of the decrease in the amount of oxygen and increase in the amount of carbon. The increase in this calorific value in the toluene sub-fraction is about 76% higher than the raw material mixture. In the sub-fractions of toluene and ethyl acetate produced by catalytic pyrolysis, an increase in carbon content was observed when compared with non-catalytic products, while the amounts of oxygen decreased. Considering the results, the toluene sub-fraction is generally composed of phenolic structures. Generally, the ethyl acetate sub-fraction comprises the carbonyl group – containing ketone and aldehyde structures as well as aromatic and phenolic compounds. The resulting bio-oil has the potential to be used as a liquid fuel both in terms of calorific values and in terms of the H/C and O/C ratio. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - There is a potential opportunity to convert almost any type of biomass into biofuel and bio- nanomaterials, if the appropriate biotechnological and chemical processing methods are used. The preference for this or that bioresource is due to the stability of the raw material base and the prospect of its use. Jerusalem artichoke stem (Helianthus tuberosus L.) (JA) is widely known as a potential nonfood raw material for biofuels due to high biomass extraction (36–49 t/ha (tons per hectare)) and limited cultivation requirements. But little attention is given to study the possibility of using the stems to produce various kinds of cellulose. This article presents samples of cellulose that were obtained from the Jerusalem artichoke stem using mechanical and chemical methods. Cellulose yield from the stem was: Cortex 51.1%, pith 65.2% with the α-cellulose content 96–98%. Methods of electron microscopy, atomic absorption, IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, BET for nitrogen adsorption, thermogravimetry were used to study the cortex and the pith of the Jerusalem artichoke stem. Analysis of the cellulose samples confirmed the possibility of obtaining high-quality cellulose. © 2019 Eurasian Chemico-Technological Journal.

AB  - The growing demands on alternative fuels which can be used in present-day engines have imposed strong necessity on this proposal. Biofuels, the hydrocarbons less than C18, are believed to be the promising alternative fuel. In the present work, the abundantly available pongamia oil was experimented to produce biofuel using hydrothermally synthesized porous catalysts such as HZSM-5 and AlMCM-48 and synergistic composite catalyst AlMCM-48/HZSM-5. Characterization techniques such as XRD, BET, TPD, and TEM were used to study the characteristics of catalysts. The catalytic activity of the catalysts in cracking of pongamia oil at optimized reaction conditions—temperature, 400 °C; WHSV, 4.6 h−1; and reaction time, 1 h in a pilot scale stainless steel high pressure fixed bed reactor (100 ml volume; 15 mm id)—was studied. Among mesoporous AlMCM-48 with different Si/Al ratios, AlMCM-48 (27) efficiently cracked 69% of pongamia oil into 45% bioliquid products (BLP) with 34% and 44% selectivity towards green gasoline (GG). The composite catalyst was synthesized with the most active microporous catalyst (HZSM-5) as core and mesoporous material AMCM-48(Si/Al = 27) as a shell. The composite material AlMCM-48/HZSM-5 proved to be an excellent catalyst in converting 97% of pongamia oil into 70% bioliquid hydrocarbons with 70% selectivity towards gasoline. The calorific value (ASTM D 240) of the biofuel was observed to be higher, while the viscosity (ASTM D 445) and specific gravity (ASTM D 1298) were found to be lower than biodiesel produced through transesterification process.

AB  - A Ni-based cage-like C–SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 (Ni/CL-CSA) catalyst was synthesized successfully via a facile dual-templating method and used for the hydrotreatment of phenol. The catalyst was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TG and N 2 adsorption techniques. Results show that Ni/CL-CSA has three-dimensional connected macroporous structure with pore size of about 100 nm and ordered mesoporous windows with average pore size of approximately 3.8 nm. Size of nickel particle is 6.1 nm. BET surface area of the catalyst is 212 m 2 /g and pore volume is 0.24 cm 3 /g. Hydrogenation and the stability performance of the catalyst was studied for bio-oil model compound phenol. Results reveal that adding macropores into Ni-based mesoporous C–SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 (Ni/MP-CSA) can improve the mass transfer rate and reduce the particles growth, thus improve the catalytic activities in the hydrotreatment of phenol, reducing catalyst sintering at high temperature and improving the stability of the catalyst. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hybrid disintegration of waste activated sludge (WAS) before the thermophilic anaerobic stabilization of WAS contributes to the intensification of organic compounds decomposition and increases the effectiveness of the anaerobic stabilization process compared to the fermentation of raw WAS. This article investigates the influence of a chemical–thermal pretreatment procedure with the use of NaOH and freezing by the dry ice on WAS. We found that the hybrid pretreatment of WAS causes higher concentration of released organics in the liquid phase (represented here as a change in soluble chemical oxygen demand–SCOD value) in comparison to these disintegration techniques used separately. The use of disintegrated WAS (WASD) as an additional material in the digester chambers impacts (varying on its proportion added), the generation of biogas and its yield. The recorded amount of the produced biogas and biogas yield after 21 days of fermentation increased by 26.6% and 2.7%, respectively (in comparison to blank sample). In addition, it was observed that the hybrid process before anaerobic stabilization contributes to a higher hygienisation of the digested sludge. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - As a green material, date pit oil is increasingly utilized as an inexpensive feedstock for ethyl ester (biodiesel) production. Waste date pits as a raw material are one of the highly produced agricultural wastes in Iran. This study investigated the effect of several procedure parameters including the ethanol/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and amount of catalysts on the yield of the produced ethyl ester. The activity of date pit oil can be considered a method of second-generation biofuels production including green diesel fractions. Efficient from waste date pits and synthesis of ethyl ester have made a breakthrough in biodiesel production. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) were employed to determine the composition of product. The optimized ethyl ester yield obtained was 92% when the procedure temperature was 65 °C, within 6h, with 7:1 ethanol/oil molar ratio with 0.75 wt.% of catalyst (KOH). Waste date pits oil as feedstock can be an efficient platform for ethyl ester production. The purified ethyl ester satisfies the stringent quality standards imposed by ASTM D-6751 (USA standard) and EN-14214 (European standard). © 2019, Iranian Chemical Society.

AB  - An integrated manure treatment system, including a mixed algal-bacterial bioreactor (MABB) and hydrothermal processing of biomass solids, was found to remove 76.4–97.0% of the total estrogenic hormones (estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3)) from the liquid portion of animal manure (LPAM). The mixed biomass was converted into either biocrude oil with a yield up to 40% via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) or syngas with a yield up to 54% yield via catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG). Adding granular activated carbon (GAC) in the MABB enhanced the removal of estrogenic hormones (+ 7.2%), cytotoxicity (+ 58%), and heavy metals (+ 10.5%). After the integrated system with the MABB, HTL, and CHG processes, the overall percent removal of heavy metals from the LPAM ranged from 27.1 to 40.3%. The concentrations of potentially toxic heavy metals (lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr)) in the aqueous phase after HTL and CHG tests ranged from 0.01 to 25.3 mg/L. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work aims to evaluate the adsorption potential of bentonite and sugarcane bagasse clay for the reduction of free fatty acids in cooking oil through batch technique, experimental planning with different operating conditions (temperature, adsorbent mass and agitation). After were carried out kinetic studies and thermodynamic studies. Thus, both adsorbents were characterized by nitrogen dispersion, scanning electron microscopy with coupled energy dispersion spectroscopy. The sugarcane bagasse provided higher reductions compared to the bentonite clay, 58 and 50%, respectively. In the kinetic studies, it was observed that the pseudo-secunda model for both materials. Among the isotherms studied, the Langmuir model was better adjusted for sugarcane bagasse and Freundlich for bentonite clay. Thermodynamic parameters indicated spontaneous and endothermic adsorption at temperatures of 18°C, 20°C and 25°C. Both materials showed an advantageous result with the reduction to the adsorption of free fatty acids in the residual oil, considering that they are low-cost materials, their pre-treatment is simple from the operational point of view and their physical and chemical characteristics are favorable to the adsorption process, sugarcane bagasse contains about 42% hemicellulose, which is a hydroxyl-rich material that attracts the H+ ions from the medium. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The influence of main nutrient stress conditions KNO3, MgSO4, K2HPO4 and KCl on biofuel production from biomass by two Botryococcus braunii strains has been investigated. Low concentrations of KNO3 and MgSO4 exhibited positive effect on hydrocarbon, oil contents and their relative ratios without much affecting the growth. Most of the saturated hydrocarbons were identified in the range of C15 to C44, the major ones being C17H34, C19H38, C21H44, C24H50 and C27H56. Fatty acids ranged from C12 to C28, with palmitic, linoleic, oleic and stearic acids being the major ones. The relative proportion of the desirable biofuel component, palmitic acid, was significantly increased under NO3 1−, PO4 3− and potassium stress conditions. These findings suggest that monitoring of concentration of a few nutrients may enhance the quantity and desirable types of biofuel components together with substantial growth of Botryococcus braunii for bioenergy production and for commercial large scale cultivation. © 2016, © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A study of converting fresh and waste sunflower oil to biodiesel through transesterification reaction using heterogeneous catalysts is established. Calcium Oxide (CaO) was selected as a basic heterogeneous catalyst because it is the cheapest and the most available comparing with other options. The characteristics of the catalyst were evaluated using several evaluation tests. The results confirm that the best preparation condition is at 850ºC and 2 hours. This catalyst has demonstrated positive results, high productivity and good recycling potential. The best conditions for reaction were obtained by varying the reaction conditions to obtain the highest bio-fuel production. The reaction has been studied in various operating conditions of methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst loading, agitation speed and reaction time at temperature 65ºC. The maximum yield of biodiesel was 97.4% for fresh vegetable oil. Moreover, the catalyst shows perfect results for transesterification of waste vegetable oil. It was tested for market waste sunflower oil and home waste sunflower oil, where the yield was 88.2% and 91.6% respectively. The reuse of the catalyst showed good activity with no less than 5 cycles. So, the production of biodiesel using calcium oxide as a catalyst is a perfect promising approach. © 2019, World Research Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Engine performance and mapping were done using diesel and used cooking oil biodiesel fuels. This was done using the Tempest, 1500 cc compression ignition engine testbed. This engine is connected to a dynamometer testbed and its control panel to measure the needed performance parameters. The crankshaft speed varied between 35 and 60 rps, while the load tested from no load to full load. The engine speed according to the manufacturer should not exceed 60 rps. The coolant temperature remained almost constant at around 70oC. The experimental results were then utilized to adjust the engine simulation model using the Diesel-RK software. Results showed that improvement in engine operation with diesel is slightly compared with that of biodiesel fuel. It was also found that the combustion process with biodiesel starts earlier during the mixing phase than diesel fuel. The primary results showed that using potassium hydroxide as a catalyst, the biodiesel yielded 45% more compared with sodium hydroxide, 5% higher calorific value, and 10% lower viscosity. From mapping point of view, the results showed that biofuel has a lower thermal efficiency than the regular diesel. A diesel-powered engine has the lowest fuel consumption of around 250–300 g/kWh at the relatively higher power and mean effective pressure values. While for the biodiesel fuels this is around 350 g/kWh at relatively lower engine speeds, power, and mean effective cylinder pressure. From heat release rate point of view, biodiesel burns earlier than diesel fuel due to higher cetane number and reduced delay periods, on cylinder pressure and temperatures, for the ignition timing and engine-operating parameters, diesel shows better performance than biodiesel for high and half loads. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Biofuel cells (BFCs) based on anodic oxidation and cathodic oxygen reduction represent an attractive alternative to self-powered devices. A glucose/oxygen BFC is described for monitoring glucose. It is making use of a piece of paper carrying a glucose oxidase (GOx) based bioanode, and a bilirubin oxidase (BilOx) based biocathode. The performance of the BFC is affected by the generation of H 2 O 2 , a byproduct of enzymatic glucose oxidation. Therefore, the removal of H 2 O 2 is a crucial step in terms of BFC performance and stability. In addition, direct, unambiguous visual read-out is an ideal way to provide quantitative information. The colorimetric readout system described here is based on the consumption of undesired H 2 O 2 and to convert the extent of energy generation into recognizable variations in color. As the H 2 O 2 travels along the hydrophilic channel by capillary action, the formation of red gold nanoparticles from AuCl 4 − leads to the appearance of a red bar that provides distance-based information that can be read visually. The multiply readable information (maximum power density of BFC or visible distance) provides further choices for quantification. It also enhances reliability. The self-powered system based on the BFC exhibits excellent performance. Glucose can be determined by this method in the 1 to 50 mM concentration range.

AB  - Waste vinasse has been used, for the first time, as a reducing agent to prepare a 20 wt% Pt/C electrocatalyst. After alkalization and subsequent filtration, abundant cations such as Ca, Mg and Fe were effectively removed, precipitating as hydroxides and insoluble phosphates. Pt chemical reduction was carried out under reflux in the presence of Vulcan XC-72R carbon by the action of reductive species such as sugars and phenols present. Reduction was confirmed by thermal analysis and X-ray diffractograms displaying the typical Pt fcc structure formed by nanocrystals. In the transmission images, an irregular dispersion of the Pt nanoparticles was observed on the carbon support, with the presence of large agglomerations with a cotton-like structure. This structure was found to be very active for glycerol electrolysis in an alkaline membrane electrolysis cell, comparable to commercial materials. Finally, results for electrolysis of the vinasse were also presented, demonstrating the possibility of valorizing this residue by the production of hydrogen. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - This study describes a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to evaluate the feasibility of developing an electrofuel (eFUEL) system based on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The system is developed to make use of the carbon in the aqueous and gas phases of an HTL process as inputs for the production of renewable transportation fuels, supplementing those from the ‘traditional’ HTL pathway. An Aspen Plus® model of the eFUEL system is developed containing a partial oxidation gasifier (POX), a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reactor, and a Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process. The combined HTL, upgrading, and eFUEL (Electro-HTL) system is designed with a capacity of 1000 tonne of organic matter per day as input. The electro-HTL system increases carbon efficiency to 84.81% and the plant's fuel mass yield by 69.2% (from a yield of 27.8 to 47.0%) compared to a stand-alone HTL and upgrading system. The TEA of the electro-HTL system shows a minimum fuel-selling price (MFSP) of 26.06 USD GJ −1 , with a carbon efficiency of 84.91%. A sensitivity analysis is performed identifying hydrogen as the key cost influence on the MFSP. The study shows that the incorporation of the eFUEL system decreases the MFSP by 8.9% compared to the standalone HTL and upgrading system. The price generated by the electro-HTL system is 1.5–2.2 times higher than the price of fossil gasoline. In conclusion, the study shows that the production of renewable drop-in fuels using the electro-HTL system is not only cost competitive with other alternative fuel processes, but also with fossil fuels. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Traditional biodiesel is produced from feedstocks such as vegetable oils and animal fats by converting the triglycerides with methanol in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). However, drawbacks of this process include an undesired glycerol byproduct and post-reaction processing that result in increased production costs. In this study, unrefined corn oil and waste restaurant grease containing high free fatty acids (FFA) were used to evaluate the ability of triazabicyclodecene (TBD), a non-ionic, guanidine base, to function in a high free fatty acid environment. Reactions were carried out using both methanol and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as methylating agents. Although increasing amounts of FFAs reduced the conversion of triglycerides (TGs), the TBD catalyst, using either methanol or DMC, adequately esterified FFAs at moderate temperatures (60 °C) but was not effective in converting triglycerides. The homogeneous catalyst work aided in elucidating the reaction chemistry. This work also studied the ability of a heterogeneous catalyst (TBD supported on a layered double hydroxide) to convert both FFAs and TGs in which 80% conversion was seen for neat canola oil and 58% conversion for unrefined oil. This study illustrates that the TBD/DMC process is an effective and commercially viable method for producing sustainable biofuels. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pt/C has a good performance for decarboxylation of oleic acid, but its catalytic stability needs further improvement. In this work, metal oxide films with controllable thicknesses were synthesized using atomic layer deposition to protect the Pt in the Pt/C to increase its catalytic stability. Compared to Pt/C, which showed only a 17% yield of heptadecane at the fourth catalytic cycle, the Pt/C deposited with porous Al2O3 films after high-temperature calcination showed improved catalytic stability that still obtained a 41% yield of heptadecane at the fourth catalytic cycle. These findings are important for improving the stability of noble metal–based catalysts and reducing the cost of industrial biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work aimed to produce ethyl esters from Chlorella vulgaris microalgae biomass, using an immobilized enzymatic catalyst associated with pressurized fluid (propane) by direct transesterification. In order to optimize the ethyl conversion, different temperatures (46.7–68.1 °C) and pressures (59.5–200.5 bar) were applied a central composite design rotational (CCDR) obtaining the high conversion (74.39%) at 50 °C and 180 bar. The molar ratio also was investigated showing conversions ~ 90% using a molar ratio of 1:24 (oil:ethanol). From the best transesterification conditions, 50 °C, 180 bar, 20% enzymatic concentration, and 1:24 oil:ethanol molar ratio were obtained with success 98.9% conversion in 7 h of reaction. The enzyme reuse maintained its activity for three successive cycles. Thus, this simple process was effective to convert microalgal biomass into ethyl ester by direct transesterification and demonstrate high yields. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Rigid cell wall of microalgae is a serious obstacle in commercialization of microalgae biofuels. Conventional cell wall rupturing techniques require organic solvents and are not so efficient. In this research work, TiO2 photocatalyst was used to rupture the cell walls of two different indigenously isolated microalgae strains; Scenedesmus and Chlorella. Cell wall rupturing was monitored by the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) formed in reaction mixture which is an important secondary metabolite of lipid peroxidation. Different important influencing parameters like calcination temperature, catalyst synthesis pH, catalyst dose, algae media pH, stirring speed and sunlight exposure time were optimized during this study. Maximum MDA concentration of 2.839 nM ml-1 from Scenedesmus and 1.697 nM ml-1 from Chlorella was achieved by using catalyst synthesized at 600 °C calcination temperature and pH 3 by 5 h of sunlight exposure. The synthesized catalyst was immobilized to check out its recycling capability. The catalyst with maximum catalytic activity was characterized by SEM, XRD and FT-IR analysis. Kinetic study for lipid oxidation was also performed and overall study results indicated that TiO2 has good capability to rupture microalgae cell wall for lipid release and this method is cost effective as it does not require the involvement of organic solvents. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This work aims at combusting a high viscous high cetane biofuel completely and efficiently under dual combustion mode using another low viscous low cetane biofuel. Maduca longifolia oil (MO) was selected as the base fuel. Combustion was achieved by using EFI (electronic fuel injection) and carburetion of eucalyptus oil at the intake manifold. Eucalyptus oil was also blended externally with MO at different mass ratios and tested. A comparison of engine results was made at 100% and 40% loads (power outputs) for all the attempts. Test results indicated significant improvement in BTE (brake thermal efficiency) with all modes with moderate energy shares of eucalyptus oil. The BTE increased from 25.2% with neat MO operation to a maximum of 29%, 32.3%, and 33.4% respectively with eucalyptus oil addition, carburetion, and EFI modes whereas it was observed as 30.8% with ND (neat diesel). Smoke was reduced with eucalyptus oil addition, carburetion, and EFI at the maximum efficiency points at 100% load. Peak pressure and energy-release rate indicated as superior to neat MO at all modes mainly at 100% load. Thirty percent, 40.2%, and 30.4% respectively with eucalyptus oil addition, carburetion, and EFI were recommended to be the optimal mass shares for 100% load. EFI of eucalyptus oil could be preferred for the highest BTE, lowest smoke, and NO emissions and maximum replacement of MO for the optimal operation of the engine among the methods tested. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper reviews the domestic political and legislative context surround biofuels initiatives to highlight what opportunities exist for establishing a biofuels trade network between South Africa (as an anchor market) and its neighbours, specifically in Zambia and Mozambique. By analysing global developments in major biofuel importers, reasons for policy inertia in South Africa, and recent experiences with biofuels investments, we suggest that the likelihood for a regional biofuels market developing is slender without addressing land-related challenges in producer countries and revising South Africa’s domestic legislation. © 2019, © 2019 UNU-WIDER.

AB  - Isoberlinia doka sawdust; an abundant waste material was pre-treated using FeCl3, HCl, NaOH, sequential HCl and NaOH treatments at 121 °C for 15 min to mitigate the challenges of its utilisation as a carbon source for bioethanol production. The effects of these treatments on the biomass were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and gravimetric methods. The capability of the pre-treated residue to produce fermentable sugars and bioethanol were also assessed. The treated biomass were saccharified using cellulase mix from Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesi and fermented using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The result shows that the chemical treatments significantly (p &lt; 0.05) diminished the lignin contents and improved cellulose content of the treated samples; evident from decreased FTIR spectral intensities related to lignin. The cellulase mixture efficiently digested the treated biomass and resulted in significant (p &lt; 0.05) sugar yield compared to the untreated biomass. Although the sequential HCl and NaOH treatment had the highest reducing sugar yield (280.1 mg/g), its ethanol yield (172.2 mg/g) was low, possibly due to formation of inhibitory bye-products. The alkali treatment reduced the lignin content and resulted in the highest ethanol yield (230.7 mg/g). Isoberlinia doka sawdust demonstrated great potential to be used as a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Solvothermal liquefaction of Acacia mangium is presented. First, process variables, such as temperature, reaction time, and solvent-biomass ratio were optimized through 3 k factorial experimental design. Results showed that at 270°C and solvent (water)-biomass ratio of 20- and 60-min reaction time, the highest biooil yield (40,2%) and highest HHV value (29,63 MJ/kg) were obtained. When energy yield, equipment dimension and energy consumption were taken into account, the best experimental conditions are 330°C for the solvent temperature, solvent (water)-biomass ratio of 15 and 0 min reaction time, with biooil yield 36% and heat power of 31,7MJ/Kg. Higher biooil yields (47,8%) resulted using acetone as solvent with almost the same heat power. Hydrogen atmosphere has a positive effect in the liquefaction only with acetone as solvent. © 2019 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Microalgal lipids have a huge potential in several applications such as biofuels, food and feed. However, enzymatic lipolytic reactions during wet storage cause the formation of substantial amounts of free fatty acids (FFA), which give several problems for these applications. In this study, a full factorial (32) design with varying time and temperature was used to optimize a heat treatment, that inactivates lipolytic enzymes in the wet paste of T-Isochrysis lutea. Therefore, the FFA and lipid content were evaluated at three time points (0, 3 and 7 days) during wet storage at 4 °C. A treatment of at least 8 min at 80 °C was found to inactivate the lipolytic enzymes. A second experiment elucidated that this optimal treatment had no negative impact on fatty acid composition, peroxide value, phenolic content or carotenoid content. A short heat treatment, thus, enables wet storage of microalgal paste to several days at 4 °C. © 2018

AB  - The catalytic performances of Ru-Pt/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalysts synthetized by three methods (co-impregnation (CI), successive impregnations (SI) and redox deposition (CR)) were compared for their sorbitol transformation to hexane under hydrothermal conditions. The existence of Pt-Ru interaction was demonstrated by TEM-EDX only on SI and CR samples, with a PtRu alloy suspected by XRD and XPS. The chemical nature of the Ru species differed according to the synthesis method with the presence of Ru 4+ species on SI-(Ru-Pt) and CR catalysts. The SI-(Ru-Pt)/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 system displayed the best metal-acid function balance leading to the highest selectivity to hexane. The study of the reactivity of isosorbide and 2,5-dimethylfuran intermediates highlighted that the first one was poorly reactive compared to the second one, and the latter was selectively convertible to hexane. The synergy effect on SI-(Ru-Pt)/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was attributed to the presence of small-sized bimetallic particles favoring an electronic exchange from Ru to Pt, and increasing the formation of 2,5-dimethylfuran. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass fractionation is important for the further conversion of the cellulosic fraction and the effective utilization of the lignin fraction for the production of biofuels and value-added products. Solvent properties play a crucial role on the fractionation efficiency of lignocellulosics using an organosolv fractionation process catalyzed by acidic ionic liquids (AILs). Herein, 12 organic solvents were selected as co-solvents with water based on their solubility parameters for lignin dissolution, including alcohols, alcohol ethers, lactones, and alkanolamines, in order to fractionate poplar and rice straw. Effects of fractionation liquor solubility parameters on the delignification efficiency of organosolv fractionation were investigated under the same conditions. Relative energy differences (REDs) of the cosolvent systems for lignin dissolution were closely related to the degree of delignification with adjusted coefficients of determination of 0.899 and 0.800 for poplar and rice straw processes, respectively. The application of solubility parameter analysis may provide a rational way to screen solvent or co-solvent fractionation systems for biomass fractionation process. © 2019 North Carolina State University.

AB  - Huge amounts of waste acid and wastewater are generated during the corncob pretreatment process, which limits chemical utilization of biomass resources to produce value-added chemicals and biofuels. In this work, a new approach, i.e., reuse of the corncob pretreatment liquid, is proposed toward diminishing acid and water consumption. Metal ions and soluble proteins in the pretreatment liquid were analyzed by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and the Coomassie rilliant blue G250 method, respectively. The results showed that the increament of soluble proteins and total metal ions in solution by three reuse rounds of the pretreatment liquid is nearly identical to that in solution by new added pretreatment liquid. Besides, the surface morphology of the corncob obtained by three reuse rounds of the liquid pretreatment did not exhibit significant difference comparing to that of the corncob acquired by new liquid pretreatment. Further, selection basis of an optimal reuse round of the pretreatment liquid is suggested depending on the effective removal of soluble proteins and metal ions from corncobs. By repeated use of the pretreatment liquid, the consumption of both acid and water during the corncob pretreatment process is expected to be significantly reduced. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Lignocellulose feedstock constitutes the most abundant carbon source in the biosphere; however, its recalcitrance remains a challenge for microbial conversion into biofuel and bioproducts. Bacillus licheniformis is a microbial mesophilic bacterium capable of secreting a large number of glycoside hydrolase (GH) enzymes, including a glycoside hydrolase from GH family 9 (BlCel9). Here, we conducted biochemical and biophysical studies of recombinant BlCel9, and its low-resolution molecular shape was retrieved from small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. BlCel9 is an endoglucanase exhibiting maximum catalytic efficiency at pH 7.0 and 60 °C. Furthermore, it retains 80% of catalytic activity within a broad range of pH values (5.5–8.5) and temperatures (up to 50 °C) for extended periods of time (over 48 h). It exhibits the highest hydrolytic activity against phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), followed by bacterial cellulose (BC), filter paper (FP), and to a lesser extent carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The HPAEC-PAD analysis of the hydrolytic products demonstrated that the end product of the enzymatic hydrolysis is primarily cellobiose, and also small amounts of glucose, cellotriose, and cellotetraose are produced. SAXS data analysis revealed that the enzyme adopts a monomeric state in solution and has a molecular mass of 65.8 kDa as estimated from SAXS data. The BlCel9 has an elongated shape composed of an N-terminal family 3 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM3c) and a C-terminal GH9 catalytic domain joined together by 20 amino acid residue long linker peptides. The domains are closely juxtaposed in an extended conformation and form a relatively rigid structure in solution, indicating that the interactions between the CBM3c and GH9 catalytic domains might play a key role in cooperative cellulose biomass recognition and hydrolysis. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Infrared microscopy was applied in the study of laccase biofuel cell electrodes that demonstrated high current and power densities traceable to the use of a low equivalent weight (EW), short side chain (Aquivion) ionomer in the catalyst layer. The electrodes were prepared from a biocatalyst ink composed of orientation-directing anthracene-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (An-MWCNTs) in a dispersion of ionomer exchanged by hydrophobic cations. The ink was applied to an electronically conductive carbon felt support that was hot-pressed to a Nafion-NRE 212 (51 μm thickness) membrane, forming the framework for an air-breathing biofuel cell cathode. Infrared microscopy sampling was performed with the use of a micro-attenuated total reflection probe that enabled spectra to be recorded from ∼32 μm diameter circular spatial regions on the materials investigated. Sensitivity to deformation of the soft polymer membrane-based materials was assessed through trial experiments on pure membrane samples before approaching the compositionally more complex biofuel cell electrodes. In studies of laccase cathodes, infrared spectral features of enzyme, buffer anions and surrounding An-MWCNTs were identified. Heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of components and unexpected bands traceable to insoluble copper salts were detected. The results suggest directions for improving electrode activity and bring to light needs for advancing quantitative interpretations. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Biodiesel and single cell oils obtained from oleaginous yeasts grown in industrial waste are attractive alternatives to the conventional fuels. However, there are only few articles dealing with the stability of the microbial biofuels. Hence, this study aimed at characterizing the storage time of biodiesels using Rancimat methods. The microbial oil and the biodiesel obtained from microbial oil have been characterized with storage stability due to various oxidizing and thermal damage. Here, the microbial fuels were subject to Rancimat analysis and found to have high thermal-oxidative stability of 18 and 8.78 h for biodiesel and oil, respectively. The storage stability resulting from storage conditions was extrapolated for biodiesel and oil and has been found to be 1.62 and 0.54 years, respectively. The infrared spectroscopic analysis reveals the degree of oxidation found after the induction time was reached and shows the characteristic peaks for degradation products. Gas chromatography revealed the compounds that were responsible for the stability as well as the amount of degradation products left. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biobased 2-butanol offers high potential as biofuel, but its toxicity toward microbial hosts calls for efficient techniques to alleviate product inhibition in fermentation processes. Aiming at the selective recovery of 2-butanol, the feasibility of a process combining in situ vacuum stripping followed by vapor adsorption has been assessed using mimicked fermentation media. The experimental vacuum stripping of model solutions and corn stover hydrolysate closely aligned with mass transfer model predictions. However, the presence of lignocellulosic impurities affected 2-butanol recovery yields resulting from vapor condensation, which decreased from 96 wt % in model solutions to 40 wt % using hydrolysate. For the selective recovery of 2-butanol from a vapor mixture enriched in water and carbon dioxide, silicalite materials were the most efficient, particularly at low alcohol partial pressures. Integrating in situ vacuum stripping with vapor adsorption using HiSiv3000 proved useful to effectively concentrate 2-butanol above its azeotropic composition (>68 wt %), facilitating further product purification. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A simple method for dispersing supported metal catalysts comprising Ni and/or Mo supported on γ-Al2O3 was performed by wet impregnation. This study investigated the preparation, characterization, and catalytic application of monometallic catalyst of NiO and MoO and bimetallic catalyst NiO–MoO supported on γ-Al2O3 for hydrocracking of Calophyllum inophyllum oil (CIO). Two variations of metal content were set at 7.5 wt% (marked as x) and 15.0 wt% (marked as y); thus, the prepared catalysts were denoted as yNiO/γ-Al2O3, yMoO/γ-Al2O3, xNiOxMoO/γ-Al2O3, and yNiOyMoO/γ-Al2O3. Among the catalysts investigated, yNiOyMoO/γ-Al2O3 exhibited the best performance in hydrocracking of CIO with total metal content, acidity, and specific surface area of 13.73 wt%, 9.13 mmol g−1, and 104.31 m2 g−1, respectively, and produced 69.44 wt% liquid product (biofuel). The gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy analysis result of the liquid product showed that the biofuel was composed of 38.54 wt% gasoline fraction (C5–C12), 9.80 wt% kerosene fraction (C13–C15), 17.69 wt% diesel fuel fraction (C16–C19), and 3.43 wt% heavy oil (&gt;C19). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In response to the escalating energy crisis and related pollution problems, there is an urgent need to adopt new energy supply technologies that utilize renewable energy sources in an efficient and environmentally friendly manner. Today, approximately 65 million tons of hydrogen are produced annually worldwide. Steam reforming of natural gas is the prevalent hydrogen production technology. Hydrogen is increasingly considered as a fuel for transport applications. Production from logistic fuels is considered a viable option to accelerate market introduction of hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier. Today, hydrogen is predominantly produced by steam reforming of natural gas in large-scale, central production plants. However, with an increasing share of fuel cell vehicles in the market, central hydrogen production will suffer from additional costs associated with the distribution of gaseous-phase hydrogen by trailer over long distances. In contrast, distributed hydrogen generation (DHG) at fueling stations offers the advantage of using readily available liquid fuels, e.g., diesel and biodiesel with high energy densities and existing infrastructure. DHG is widely seen as a promising alternative in the transition phase toward a fully renewable hydrogen production economy.

AB  - Since the long history of Indonesia, the majority of Indonesian residence are working as farmers as the primary job. Plantation in Indonesia supplies the world market in remarkable amount. There are several main commodity holding important role in Indonesian agriculture: rice, sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cassava, and tobacco. Those products are cultivated in a large amount almost in each district and consequently generating a large amount of agricultural waste from the postharvesting process. The residue of those commodity were studied in this paper, including rice husks, sugarcane bagasse, spent coffee ground, cocoa pod husks, cassava peels, and tobacco stalks. They contain mostly cellulose of 29.1-57.4 % and hemicellulose of 7.49-35.5 % which are convertible to fermentable sugar. The lignin content in the range of 10.9-27.3 % which produces inhibitors in sugar and alcohol production. The utilization of this feedstock to produce biobutanol and bioethanol requires delignification process to prevent the inhibitor formation. Sequentially, hydrolysis is necessary to convert the cellulose and hemicellulose to fermentable sugars completely by using enzymatic or chemical process. Finally fermentation can be performed to produce bioethanol by yeast or biobutanol by Clostridium sp. The uniformity of the main constituent and the physical characteristic have made them potential to be efficiently utilized in heterogeneous mixture to produce large capacity of biobutanol and bioethanol. © 2019, Asian Research Publishing Network.

AB  - To reduce the concentration of hydrocarbon compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases and to increase the completeness of combustion when using biofuel, it is proposed to use heating of biofuel. On the basis of experimental studies, the optimal heating range of biofuel - from 115 to 120 °C. They are obtained the values of hourly and specific fuel consumption, carbon monoxide emissions, hydrocarbon compounds and nitrogen oxides depending on the engine load when working on diesel fuel of petroleum origin, biofuel without heating and with heating. It is established that when using biofuel without heating, depending on the engine load, the fuel consumption is in the range of 17.67 to 27.77% when compared to the performance of diesel fuel of petroleum origin. The use of biofuel with temperature 120 °C immediately before injection into the engine cylinders reduces the consumption of biofuel from 2.78 to 9.34% depending on the engine load. When using biofuel, emissions of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen do not differ significantly from the emissions while engine operation with diesel fuel of petroleum origin, however, the emissions of carbon monoxide are reduced almost twice. The use of heating of biofuel immediately before injection into the engine cylinders is reduced fuel consumption that indicates a more complete combustion of high-molecular compounds of biofuel. © 2019, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - The rapid development of both wearable and implantable biofuel cells has triggered more and more attention on the lactate biofuel cell. The novel lactate/oxygen biofuel cell (L/O-BFC) with the direct electron transfer (DET)-type lactate oxidase (LOx) anode and the platinum group metal (PGM)-free Fe-N-C cathode is designed and constructed in this paper. In such a reasonable design, the surface-controlled direct two-electron electrochemical reaction of the lactate oxidase was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on the carbon nanotube (CNT) modified electrode with favorable high electrochemical active surface area and electronic conductivity. Additionally, the biosensor based on DET-type LOx modified electrode impressively presented linear response to lactate with different concentrations from 0.000 mM to 12.300 mM. In particular, the apparent Michealis-constant (KM app) calculated as 0.140 mM clearly indicates that LOx on CNT has strong affinity to the substrate lactate. Meanwhile, 4e- transfer oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was proven to take place on the Fe-N-C catalysts inthe 0.1 M PBS system, indicating the advantage by using the Fe-N-C catalysts at the cathode of L/O-BFC. Last but not least, the L/O-BFC with the direct electron transfer (DET)-type lactate oxidase(LOx) anode and the Fe-N-C cathode produced an superior open circuit potential (OCP) of 0.264 V and a maximum output power density (OPD) of 24.430 μW cm-2 in O2 saturated 95.020 mM lactate solution. The above results will not only bring about significant interest in developing a DET-type biofuel cell, but also offer guiding direction to explore novel catalyst materials for the biofuel cell. This work enriches the research content and may push developments of the implantable and wearable biofuel cell forward. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Aim:The present study was conducted to optimise the production of biodiesel from goat tallow by chemical andbiologicaltransesterificationandtoanalysethefuelcharacteristicsofbiodiesel. Methodology: Lipid from goat tallow was extracted after subjecting the tallow to ultrasonication and microwaveheating.Thelipidobtainedwasconvertedtobiodieselbychemicalandbiologicaltransesterification processes. Results: Microwave heating of goat tallow with hexane produced 550 ml of oil whereas ultrasonication method produced 350 ml and 430 ml with Hexane and Hexane: Isopropanol (3:2) as solvent mixture, respectively. When one litre of this oil was subjected to transesterification reaction, 750 ml and 640 ml of biodiesel was produced by chemical and biological methods under optimized conditions (temperature 60oC for chemical and 35oC for biological transesterification). GC-MS analysis of transesterified oil indicated linolenic acid, pentadecanoic acid and stearic acid as major lipid components in goat tallow. Fuel properties were tested as perASTM standards. Interpretation: The biological process (either with the enzyme or with organism), if properly designed can definitely be an advantageous as this process is cost effective and environmental friendly. Goat tallow can be a potential candidate for the nline production of biodiesel, an alternate to fossil fuel, which is the need of the hour. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)

AB  - Bio-oil obtained from thermal cracking of waste cooking oil (WCO) is a complex mixture of different chemical compounds and, like crude oil, it is composed mainly of hydrocarbons. The large number of compounds in bio-oil leads to complex and expensive methods for its properties determination. In this study, the distillation curves were constructed for samples of bio-oils obtained from the thermal cracking of WCO in order to predict the properties (such as molecular weight, viscosity and refractive index). Although it is not often employed for bio-oil analyses, the distillation curve method is commonly used in the petroleum industry. Atmospheric and vacuum distillations were performed according to ASTM D86 and ASTM D1160 standards, respectively, for six samples of bio-oil and one sample of crude oil. The results were converted to true boiling point (ASTM D2892) according to the API method (1997) and common petroleum refning correlations were employed. The estimated values for the properties showed little deviation in relation to the experimental data. The bio-oil and crude oil samples contained heavy compounds in their composition, and all samples studied are considered as heavy oils considering the °API range. © 2019 Assoc. Brasiliera de Eng.

AB  - Background: Lignocellulosic residues generated by various anthropogenic activities can be a potential raw material for many commercial products such as biofuels, organic acids and nutraceuticals including xylitol. Xylitol is a low-calorie nutritive sweetener for diabetic patients. Microbial production of xylitol can be helpful in overcoming the drawbacks of traditional chemical production process and lowring cost of production. Objective: Designing efficient production process needs the characterization of required enzyme/s. Hence current work was focused on in-vitro and in-silico characterization of xylose reductase from Emericella nidulans. Methods: Xylose reductase from one of the hyper-producer isolates, Emericella nidulans Xlt-11 was used for in-vitro characterization. For in-silico characterization, XR sequence (Accession No: Q5BGA7) was used. Results: Xylose reductase from various microorganisms has been studied but the quest for better enzymes, their stability at higher temperature and pH still continues. Xylose reductase from Emericella nidulans Xlt-11 was found NADH dependent and utilizes xylose as its sole substrate for xylitol production. In comparison to whole cells, enzyme exhibited higher enzyme activity at lower cofactor concentration and could tolerate higher substrate concentration. Thermal deactivation profile showed that whole cell catalysts were more stable than enzyme at higher temperature. In-silico analysis of XR sequence from Emericella nidulans (Accession No: Q5BGA7) suggested that the structure was dominated by random coiling. Enzyme sequences have conserved active site with net negative charge and PI value in acidic pH range. Conclusion: Current investigation supported the enzyme’s specific application i.e. bioconversion of xylose to xylitol due to its higher selectivity. In-silico analysis may provide significant structural and physiological information for modifications and improved stability. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - World energy demand will continue to increase because of the development of the economy of the world and an increase in population. Non-renewable crude oil- derived liquid fuels are used in the world for more than two hundred years. 90% of liquid fuels are estimated to be consumed for energy generation and transportation. Liquid fuels cause environmental pollution like carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur-containing residues which results in global warming. As we know energy is required but it is short supply, on other side waste is unwanted but it also unavoidable. Agricultural, industrial & domestic waste can be converted into biodiesel, biogas utilizing various techniques. Biogas, biodiesel, biomass, biofuel, alcohol, vegetable oils and so on can solve environmental problems. A pulse detonation engine is anticipated to be a high- performance, next-generation aerospace propulsion engine. This new concept propulsion systems that use repetitive detonations to generate power or thrust. This review is, therefore, a parallel comparison with the hope of analyzing comparatively various biofuels that have been used and documented for PDE. Biofuel combustion characteristics are also investigated in detonation mode. The strategy for exploring the possibility of using biofuels for PDE operation is presented here. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication. All rights reserved.

AB  - CI engine have always been the primary choice for on-road, agriculture and industrial applications. On-road operations are dominated by CI engines because of their better efficiency, fuel availability and fuel economy. Worldwide, nearly 14% of greenhouse gas emissions are releasing from the world’s highest energy demanding sector, transportation. The day-by-day increase in diesel engine’s use associated with the aspiration of underdeveloped or developing countries to improve their economic status has led to increase the demand for diesel fuel supply, which is causing running out of fossil fuel very shortly. The increasing fuel usage will increase the level of air pollutants in the atmosphere, which are threatening the environment and human health. Fossil fuel depletion and harmful exhaust gas emissions has created an intensive interest for the development of renewable alternative fuel. Since last three decades, researchers are showing interest to develop an alternative fuel from biomass-based feed stock. Fuels developed from biomass-based feed stock are referred as biofuels. These biofuels can be categorized into bio-alcohols and biodiesel, which are more suitable to use as an alternate fuel for SI and CI engines because of their high octane and cetane numbers respectively. This paper presents the exhaustive review of literature on testing of different renewable alternative biofuels under different testing conditions in CI engine to replace petroleum diesel and to have effective control over the harmful exhaust emissions. This paper also gives insight of recent trends in development of fourth generation biofuels based on photobiological solar fuels and electro fuels, which can be a more promising alternate fuel in the field of biofuels. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

AB  - Due to the awareness of adverse effects of conventional fuels to environment and the frequent rise in crude oil price, the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative source of energy has gained importance in recent years. This alternative has been identified to be biofuel, one of which is biodiesel. As such, this work was carried out to contribute to the development of biodiesel. The aim was accomplished by employing Design Expert, based on the chosen operating factors (reaction temperature and methanol-to-oil ratio), to design experiments carried out for the production of biodiesel using used cooking oil and methanol in the presence of alkaline catalyst. After carrying out the experiments using the design parameters generated, the results were analysed, and a model equation was developed for the system. Furthermore, the model equation was used to optimize the process using Excel Solver to obtain a temperature, a methanol-to-oil ratio and a yield of 63.45°C, 3 and 59.32 as the optimum values, respectively. The optimum parameters estimated were validated experimentally and with the Aspen HYSYS model of the process that was also developed. The results obtained using the design factors showed that the factors considered were having effects on the yield of biodiesel. Also, the results of the experimental validation carried out with the optimum parameters obtained with the aid of Excel Solver were found to compare very well with those obtained from the simulation of the developed Aspen HYSYS model of the biodiesel production because the errors were estimated to be less than 5%. Therefore, the developed Aspen HYSYS model of biodiesel production of this work was able to represent the process very well and can be used for further studies on the process. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

AB  - Biodiesel is a highly effective fuel with the same efficiency such as diesel oil derivative only accompanied by moderate engine modifications. This type of biofuel can be obtained from renewable sources such as vegetable, animal or frying oils. In this context, waste frying oils transesterification was studied to obtain the maximum value of biodiesel. Transesterification reactions were carried out between 70 to 90 min using waste frying oils (WFOs), methanol, and sodium hydroxide as catalyst. In order to determine the best conditions for biodiesel production, a series of experiments were carried out, using catalyst percent and temperatures in a range of 0.16 to 1.84% and 40 to 90°C, respectively. The highest biodiesel production was obtained using catalyst percent, temperature and reaction time of 0.5%, 80°C and 90 min, respectively. By statistical experimental design was possible to determine a mathematical model to predict the best operational conditions to maximize biodiesel production. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Microalgae lipid-derived biofuels is considered promising candidates for substitution of petroleum-based energy sources. However, the lipid extraction from the algal biomass stands as a challenge due to its low yields and cost-intensive cell disruption procedures. In this study a multivariate optimization of the extraction conditions was suggested, aiming a maximization of the lipid extraction from Scenedesmus sp. microalgae grown using wastewater as a nutrient medium. The extraction method, extraction time, solvent mixture and pretreatment were considered between upper and lower levels in order to access their significance, including their interactions, on the experimental response, while using a reduced number of experiments. The studies were performed using low-cost extraction methods (magnetic stirring and ultrasonication). The optimal extraction condition was obtained using CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) solvent mixture, in a 2-hour extraction period using ultrasonication. Fatty acid profiles of extracted lipids were also evaluated. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - In this study, the microalgal consortium (MC) was cultivated with low CO2 concentration (1% v/v) in the semi-continuous outdoor open system in order to apply for large-scale biofuel production. The results found that the recorded levels of dry weight, lipid content of MC cultured with 1% CO2 supplementation in all cycle were higher than of those with ambient air (0.03% CO2) supplementation. The means of biomass concentration and lipid content of the MC with 1% CO2 supplementation were 0.41+0.04 g/l and 17.3+0.77% of dry weight, respectively. CO2 supplementation also had strongly affected on biovolume ratio of microalgae. The results of characteristics and chemical compositions analysis found that cultivating algae with a low concentration of CO2 supplement (1% v/v) enhanced the properties that make MCB suitable as a raw material for biofuel production. MCB cultivated with CO2 supplement showed high volatile matter content, carbon content, and HHV (78.01 wt%, 45.68 wt%, and 16.37 MJ/Kg, respectively). The major fatty acids from MCB under 1% CO2 concentration were palmitic acid and oleic acid. Therefore, cultivating microalgae with low CO2 concentration was considered suitable for applications in large scale biofuel production. © 2019 Journal of Biotech Research.

AB  - As a renewable energy source, microalgae have wide interest as a potential tool to produce biofuel and bioproducts. Prevailing in the local habitat, indigenous microalgae are more successful for wastewater treatment processes. Integrated microalgae-based biofuel and bioproduct production with wastewater treatment is a successful practice of modern research. This report describes the isolation and identification of 61 microalgal strains from lakes, springs, ponds, creeks, and rivers of the gigantic area of Malakand, Pakistan. Our study involves the seasonal existence of Chlorophyta in the area, with most dominant flora identified in the summer season followed by spring, autumn, and winter seasons, respectively. The highest ratio of microalgae was found in stagnant waters followed by slow-running water and running water, respectively. However, algal species were reported from all water bodies throughout the year. Commercially important genera like Chlorella, Scenedesmus, and Chlamydomonas were also reported, attracting the research area for further analysis regarding biofuel, bioproduct production, and simultaneous wastewater treatment. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

AB  - Coprocessing of bitumen-derived feeds and biomass through a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) route has the potential to assist in the reduction of fuel and petroleum product carbon footprints while meeting government regulatory requirements on renewable transportation fuels. This approach is desirable because green house gas (GHG) emissions for producing renewable biofuels are significantly lower than those for fossil fuels, and coprocessing can be executed using existing refining infrastructure to save capital cost. The present study investigates the specific FCC performances of pure heavy gas oil (HGO) derived from oil sands synthetic crude, and a mixture of 15 v% canola oil in HGO using a commercial equilibrium catalyst under typical FCC conditions. Cracking experiments were performed using a bench-scale Advanced Cracking Evaluation (ACE) unit at fixed weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 8 h−1, 490–530 °C, and catalyst/oil ratios of 4–12 g/g. This work focuses on some cracking phenomena resulting from the presence of oxygen in the blend—a lower heat requirement for cracking due to the exothermic water formation, which also entails lower hydrogen yield at a given severity. The distribution of feed oxygen in gaseous and liquid products, the mitigation in GHG emissions, and the technological and economical advantages of the coprocessing option are also discussed. © 2018 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - This study is one component of a two-part paper aiming to investigate the feasibility of directly feeding renewable liquid biofuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs). In part 1, we examined changes that occur in the physicochemical properties upon upgrading process via catalytic esterification of fast pyrolysis crude bio-oil and we preliminary analyzed and compared the influence on the power outputs of SOFCs. Upgraded bio-oil was characterized revealing that all acid groups present in the crude bio-oil were totally converted to esters. The H/C ratio increased while the O/C ratio decreased upon upgrading. Upgraded bio-oil composition is comprised mostly of aliphatic groups (60 %) followed by saturated methyl esters (30 %). Upgraded bio-oil viscosity (2.78 cP), neutrality (pH≈7) and energy density (40.94 MJ kg−1) were considerably enhanced. SOFC electrochemical performance results are promising showing that current density increases by 1.7 and ≈2 times while peak power density increases by 1.6 and 3 times upon upgrading at 700 °C and 750 °C, respectively. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Pyrolysis of anaerobically digested sludge can serve as an efficient biomass for biofuel production. Pyrolysis produces products like char, bio-oil, and combustible gases by thermochemical conversion process. It can be used for sludge treatment that decreases sludge disposal problems. Sludge produced from anaerobic co-digestion (microalgae, cow dung, and paper) waste has high carbon and hydrogen content. We investigated the candidacy of the anaerobic sludge having high heating value (HHV) of 20.53 MJ/kg as a reliable biomass for biofuels production. The process of pyrolysis was optimized with different temperatures (400, 500, and 600 ◦C) to produce high quantity and improved quality of the products, mainly bio-oil, char, and gas. The results revealed that with the increase in pyrolysis temperature the quantity of char decreased (81% to 55%), bio-oil increased (3% to 7%), and gas increased (2% to 5%). The HHV of char (19.2 MJ/kg), bio-oil (28.1 MJ/kg), and gas (18.1 MJ/kg) were predominantly affected by the amount of fixed carbon, hydrocarbons, and volatile substance, respectively. The study confirmed that the anaerobic sludge is a promising biomass for biofuel production and pyrolysis is an efficient method for its safe disposal. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this research, a novel glucose/O2 biofuel cell was developed with glucose dehydrogenase bioande and laccase biocathode. For the preparation of a bioanode, glassy carbon electrode was modified in a layer by layer structure of graphene oxide nano-sheets, glucose dehydrogenase, and nicotine amide adenine dinucleotide by electrostatic affinities and the capping layer consist of glutaraldehyde, bovine serum albumin and glucose dehydrogenase. The proposed system depicted a high bioelectrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation and the oxidation commenced at-0.30 V (vs. Ag/ AgCl). For implementation in a biofuel cell, a biocompatible enzyme-based cathode was developed. Therefore, laccase nanoflowers were immobilized onto gold nanoparticles, which were electrodeposited on a gold electrode and polydopamine biofilm was employed to keep the immobilized laccase nanoflowers in place. The biocathode illustrated a high electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction with a direct electron transfer at a positive potential of +0.61 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The prepared bioelectrodes were integrated into a glucose/O2 biofuel cell system, without a membrane and the performance and the stability of the biofuel cell were evaluated in vitro. The obtained operating circuit voltage and maximum current densities were 0.86 V and 1.11 mA - cm-2 and maximum power density of 0.40 mW - cm-2 was achieved at 0.67 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The output power of the biofuel cell is almost persistent after 24 days of sustained operation. The achieved results suggest that the proposed modifications provide a high-performance and very stable biofuel cell for application in implantable medical devices. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Mild hydrothermal treatment (245 °C) was used to break microalgal cell walls for lipids hydrolysis and solvent-free extraction in batch reactors to obtain biocrude for biodiesel production. Microalgal biocrude obtained through hydrothermal treatment for 10 min had the highest heating value (33.83 MJ/kg), the highest carbon and hydrogen contents (69.63% and 9.39%), and the lowest nitrogen content (3.56%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that microalgal biocrude had increased long-chain alkane peaks and disappeared carbohydrate peaks compared to the original microalgal biomass. Thermogravimetric analysis implied that triglycerides in microalgal biomass were hydrolyzed into fatty acids through hydrothermal treatment, while fatty acids and protein hydrolysates reacted to produce amides with higher boiling points. After 10 min subcritical hydrothermal treatment with microalgal solid concentration of 5% at 245 °C and esterification reactions (100 °C)with methanol and H2SO4 catalysts, the solvent-free lipids extraction efficiency was improved from 69.9% (260 °C) to 95.0 wt% without losing the valuable unsaturated fatty acids in microalgae cells. The resulted main compositions of C16:0, C16:1 and C20:5 in microalgal biodiesel reached the highest of 22.7%, 24.1% and 16.2% (based on total lipids in microalgae), much higher than those lipids obtained from 260 °C treatment (C20:5 = 6.1%). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The quantity of fossil fuel is declining year by year, and the pollutant also released to the environment which insist on the exploration of new alternative fuel. Biodiesel from non-edible seeds is of primary concern for increasing prices of crude oil and thereof preventing greenhouse gas emissions. In the present study, the production of biodiesel by In-situ acid catalyzed transesterification from Sterculia foetida oil and seeds were reported. GC-FID characterization of oil sample revealed the presence of long-chain fatty acids with a higher proportion of sterculic acid (32%). The operating parameters in acid transesterification process viz., the weight of the oil and biomass, solvent volume, acid volume, temperature and time were optimized using Placket-Burman design. The maximum biodiesel yield obtained for sterculia oil and seeds were 91.58% and 95.91% exhibiting volume of oil being the critical factor based on Plackett-Burman design. One-way ANOVA analysis showed that chosen parameters were statistically significant (P &lt; .05) except for temperature. FT-IR analysis confirms the presence of biodiesel (1741 cm–1) obtained from the transesterification process. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The catalytic hydrolysis of cellulose allows the transformation of this sustainable and renewable raw material to obtain biofuels and high-added value chemicals. The process requires acidic catalysts, which should be preferably solid in order to make it greener and, thus, this work proposes the use of functionalized carbon materials for such an application. A mesoporous commercial carbon of trade name SA-30, abbreviated as SA in this work, has been chemically treated at room temperature to create acidic surface oxygen functional groups. The prepared carbon catalysts have been thoroughly characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption at − 196 ºC, temperature programmed desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. SAS carbon (prepared by treatment with a saturated solution of (NH4)2S2O8 in 1 M H2SO4 and named by adding S to the name of the original carbon) is the most effective of the studied catalysts. It allows achieving high cellulose conversion (about 61%) and glucose selectivity. Thus, the low-cost functionalized carbons prepared at mild conditions are effective and promising catalysts for the transformation of cellulose into glucose. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The green microalga Botryococcus braunii produces hydrocarbon oils at 25–75% of its dry weight and is a promising source of biofuel feedstock. Few studies have examined this species’ ecology in natural habitats, and few wild genetic resources have been collected due to difficulties caused by its low abundance in nature. This study aimed to develop a real-time PCR assay for specific detection and quantification of this alga in natural environments and to quantify spatiotemporal variations of wild B. braunii populations in a tropical pond. We designed PCR primers toward the hydrocarbon biosynthesis gene SSL-3 and examined amplification specificity and PCR efficiency with 70 wild strains newly isolated from various environments. The results demonstrated that this PCR assay specifically amplified B. braunii DNA, especially that of B-race strains, and can be widely used to detect wild B. braunii strains in temperate and tropical habitats. Field-testing in a tropical pond suggested a diurnal change in the abundance of B. braunii in surface water and found B. braunii not only in surface water, but also at 1–1.5 m deep and in bottom sediments. This method can contribute to efficient genetic resource exploitations and may also help elucidate the unknown ecology of B. braunii. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: 2,3-butanediol is a chemical component with wide industrial applications, such as biofuels and chemical precursors. Reducing 2,3-butanediol production costs is a high priority and recent focus has been on its biological synthesis from raw renewable materials rather than through conventional chemical procedures. In this study, a 2,3-butanediol native bacterial producer was selected for the fermentation of Agave cupreata bagasse waste by enzymatic hydrolysation to obtain 2,3-butanediol. Results: The native Klebsiella oxytoca UM2-17 strain was selected to efficiently produce 2,3-butanediol on synthetic mineral media. Using glucose (100 g L−1) and glucose: xylose (50 g L−1:50 g L−1) as sugar sources obtained titres of 29.36 g L−1 and 25.9 g L−1 of 2,3-butanediol, corresponding to yields of 0.29 g g−1 and 0.26 g g−1, respectively. Agave bagasse solid waste after acid pre-treatment was utilized to obtain enzymatic hydrolysates, obtaining liquors with glucose/xylose/arabinose at 25.8 g L−1 with efficiency of ∼52.5% sugar conversion from residual solid pre-hydrolysed bagasse. The production of 2,3-butanediol through batch fermentation of the enzymatic-hydrolysate by the UM2-17 strain showed total depletion of glucose and xylose, achieving a maximal production of 10.3 g L−1 of 2,3-butanediol plus 0.28 g L−1 ethanol, corresponding to 2,3-butanediol yield of 0.40 g g−1. Conclusion: The results indicate that A. cupreata bagasse waste from mezcal beverage elaboration is a sustainable bioresource for production of 2,3-butanediol by fermentation of enzymatic bagasse-hydrolysate using the K. oxytoca UM2-17 strain. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Two de-lignified cellulose of loofah sponge and sawdust were applied in two ways to enhance the lipid production from oleaginous yeast using acetic acid. When 30 g/L of acetic acid was used as a carbon source, direct addition of de-lignified loofah sponge or sawdust increased the extracellular lipid content to 33.94% and 53.25%, respectively. The latter reduced the energy input of lipid extraction process from 0.86 to 0.57 GJ per ton of biodiesel production. To relieve the inhibition caused by 40 g/L acetic acid, immobilization of oleaginous yeast on de-lignified sawdust increased the lipid concentration and yield from 3.83 g/L, 0.18 g/g C to 7.15 g/L, 0.20 g/g C, respectively. These improvements occurred due to the cell-immobilized sawdust which play an important role in the loading of cells and adsorption of acetic acid. Immobilized cultivation also increased the fatty acid proportion of C18:1, thereby improving biodiesel performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Stranded driftwood feedstocks may represent, after pretreatment with steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis, a cheap C-source for producing biochemicals and biofuels using oleaginous yeasts. The hydrolysis was optimized using a response surface methodology (RSM). The solid loading (SL) and the dosage of enzyme cocktail (ED) were variated following a central composite design (CCD) aimed at optimizing the conversion of carbohydrates into lipids (YL) by the yeast Solicoccozyma terricola DBVPG 5870. A second-order polynomial equation was computed for describing the effect of ED and SL on YL. The best combination (ED = 3.10%; SL = 22.07%) for releasing the optimal concentration of carbohydrates which gave the highest predicted YL (27.32%) was then validated by a new hydrolysis. The resulting value of YL (25.26%) was close to the theoretical maximum value. Interestingly, fatty acid profile achieved under the optimized conditions was similar to that reported for palm oil. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The various benefits of biofuels versus fossil fuels due to recent global challenges and issues are the best approach toward low-cost economic production of renewable energy. This study is trying to obtain economic catalysts with easy fabrication technology. The synthesized catalysts were obtained using calcium oxide/nanoclay catalysts by an initial ion-exchange reaction of calcium oxide and nanoclays (montmorillonite). These catalysts have been synthesized for the first time by being stirred for 5 h at a temperature of 80 °C, and the colloidal supernatant is obtained and kept in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. The solution was filtered, washed several times, the residual mixture on filter paper was dried in the oven at 50 °C for few hours, and the powder was calcined for 8 h in a furnace at 600 °C. After identification and characterization, using XRD, BET, and SEM, the results approved the formation of a new nanostructure in synthesized catalysts, which were suitable to be used in biodiesel production from waste oils with high free fatty acids content. The results of this study indicate that the catalysts production process is not complicated, and methyl ester production rates in all biodiesel samples were more than 97% (97.1–98.8%). © 2019, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - The "Guerbet condensation reaction" was considered as a seminal sustainable chemical process for production of renewable platform chemicals and biofuels from biobased aliphatic alcohols feedstock. Thermochemical data for the main condensation product 2-butyl-1-octanol and for the hexyl hexanoate as the main side product were determined by using the combustion calorimetry and the transpiration method. Experimental data on standard molar enthalpies of formation and standard molar enthalpies of vaporization were validated with the help of quantum-chemical and empirical methods. Thermodynamic analysis of the "Guerbet alcohols synthesis reaction" was performed. The most efficient conditions are expected to be between ambient temperatures and 400 K, and the experimental conditions are limited by the dehydrogenation reaction and catalyst activity in this process.

AB  - Large amounts of lignin are produced in the pulp and paper industry and are still not used in a more valuable way. Lignin has great potential as a renewable raw material for the production of biofuels and high value chemical products. The aim of the present work was to study the hydropyrolysis process of two industrial Kraft lignin types and evaluate the influence of operating temperature and the addition of two acid catalysts: a widely known commercial zeolite (ZSM-5) and niobic acid (HY-340), which has been poorly explored as a catalyst applied to biomass. HY-340, Nb2O5·nH2O, as well as commercial zeolites, has desirable acidic properties, and a low cost compared to traditional catalysts employed in catalytic pyrolysis. The composition of the vapors produced in a micropyrolyzer (CDS-5200) was analyzed in an online gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (PY-GC/MS). The effects of operational parameters, such as reaction temperature and catalyst concentration added to lignins, were also investigated. The results showed that the use of ZSM-5 as a catalyst in hydropyrolysis reactions of both lignins promotes a significant increase in the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. In the tests performed, the increase in selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons reached a maximum of 98% of the area for lignin 1 and 99% for lignin 2. The addition of HY-340 in the reactions of catalytic hydropyrolysis of the industrial lignins resulted in an increase in the selectivity of open chain or aliphatic hydrocarbons, mainly n-alkanes, which reached a maximum value of 93% of area for lignin 1 and 92% for lignin 2. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The marine benthic diatom Halamphora coffeaeformis is a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. This species shows high growth rates, important triacylglycerol (TAG) contents and grows in seawater making large-scale cultivation advantageous. Moreover, sustainable biofuel production in future biorefineries requires the implementation of technologies that employ renewable solvents. Thus, the goal of this work was to evaluate ethanol usage as extraction solvent and reaction medium for biodiesel production from H. coffeaeformis. In a first step a bio-oil extraction was carried out comparing ethanol and n-hexane to investigate the performance of ethanol with respect to a conventional solvent. Then, a free-catalyst supercritical ethanol transesterification of the bio-oils was carried out to obtain biodiesel. Higher lipid extraction yields were obtained using ethanol respect to n-hexane (26 wt.% vs 21.1 wt.%). The transesterification of crude lipids extracted with ethanol as solvent at 305 °C and 40 min. produced up to 15.9 wt.% of biodiesel respect to dried biomass processed. Comparable biodiesel yields were obtained using non-renewable organic solvents and a conventional catalytic technology. Thus, ethanol extraction and subsequent supercritical transesterification of H. coffeaeformis oil proved to be technically feasible and environmental friendly technology for the production of biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phaeodactylum tricornutum is considered a promising source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In this study, P. tricornutum cultivation using waste products from anaerobic digestion (i.e. liquid digestate and CO2) was tested and scaled-up in closed and open prototype systems. The chemical composition of algal biomass was evaluated to optimize the lipid content. Algal productivity and composition, especially in terms of PUFAs, were not modified by the use of waste CO2. Digestate led to a lower protein (24%) content than medium (36–37%), without affecting lipid amount (about 37%). Algal and EPA productivity were nearly two-fold higher by using photobioreactors (0.075 g biomass L−1 day−1 and 1.62 mg EPA g−1 day−1) than open ponds, which are more influenced by environmental conditions. This study highlights that economic and environmental benefits could be achieved by using waste CO2 and liquid digestate from anaerobic digestion for microalgae cultivation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents the first comprehensive assessment of ethanol dissolved in rainwater of São Paulo State's sugar cane belt, considering the period from 2012 to 2017. Ethanol concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 20.9 μmol L−1, with a volume-weighted mean (VWM) of 4.67 ± 0.13 μmol L−1 (n = 410). Despite the increasing use of ethanol fuel in Brazil, during the study period, the ethanol concentration in rainwater showed an average decrease of 0.54 μmol L−1 per year, attributed to technological improvements in vehicular fuel combustion and catalysts. Anthropogenic emissions appeared to overwhelm possible seasonal fluctuations of ethanol in rainwater due to biogenic sources or meteorological conditions such as temperature, solar radiation, rainfall amount, rainfall rate, and air mass origin. Higher VWM concentrations were generally observed in dry months, when the production of ethanol in the distilleries was highest and biomass burning increased. Consideration of ethanol oxidation in aqueous media by OH radicals indicated that secondary formation of highly toxic aldehydes is likely to increase with greater use of this biofuel. Dissolution of gaseous ethanol during cloud formation appeared to be a more important mechanism of atmospheric removal of this alcohol, compared to below-cloud processes. The wet flux of ethanol was ca. 3 kg ha−1 year−1 and there were evidences that atmospheric replenishment of this species was fast. Brazil has used ethanol fuel on a large scale since the 1980s, so better understanding of the behavior of this species in the lower troposphere of the study region can provide valuable information to assist in predicting future worldwide impacts of increasing use of this biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A biopolymer-based catalyst with an alkaline moiety was prepared by radiation induced grafting (RIG) of glycidylmethaacrylate (GMA) onto flax fibres followed by functionalisation with diethyl amine (DEA) and treatment with NaOH. The density of amine loading was tuned by optimisation of the reaction parameters including DEA concentration, reaction temperature, and time using the Box–Behnken Design (BBD) of Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The chemical composition, morphology and structure of the alkaline catalyst were examined using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Thermal properties of the catalyst were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The optimum parameters for obtaining a maximum amine density (3.65 mmol/g) in the catalyst were 79.8% DEA concentration, 80 °C reaction temperature, and 2.9 h reaction time. The catalyst was tested for transesterification of cottonseed oil with methanol. A maximum 88.6% conversion to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was achieved at optimum parameters of 33:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, 2.5 wt% catalyst concentration and 60 °C reaction temperature. The results indicate that radiation induced grafting can be effectively used to prepare alkaline biocatalyst catalyst from flax fibres and the catalyst is a promising green candidate for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There are different technologies for biodiesel production, each having its benefits and drawbacks depending on the type of feedstock and catalyst used. In this study, the techno-economic performances of four catalyst technologies were investigated. The catalysts were bulk calcium oxide (CaO), enzyme, nano-calcium oxide, and ionic liquid. The study was mainly based on process simulations designed using Aspen Plus and SuperPro software. The quantity and quality of biodiesel and glycerol, as well as the amount of biodiesel per amount of feedstock, were the parameters to evaluate technical performances. The parameters for economic performances were total investment cost, unit production cost, net present value (NPV), internal return rate (IRR), and return over investment (ROI). Technically, all the studied options provided fuel quality biodiesel and high purity glycerol. However, under the assumed market scenario, the process using bulk CaO catalyst was more economically feasible and tolerable to the change in market values of major inputs and outputs. On the contrary, the enzyme catalyst option was very expensive and economically infeasible for all considered ranges of cost of feedstock and product. The result of this study could be used as a basis to do detail estimates for the practical implementation of the efficient process. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Electrical properties have gained interest in biofuels applications due to advances in radio frequency and microwave processing and characterization of biodiesel. In those applications, sensors play a key role since the accurate measurement of electrical properties is needed. This work presents the design, construction and characterization of a broadband (1 kHz to 100 MHz) permittivity sensor for biodiesel and blends. The sensor was characterized in the temperature range from 293 K to 343 K in the full intended frequency range. The sensor is apt for industrial use, inexpensive, and easy to build and it has very low electrical losses. For low permittivity substances the measurement uncertainty is below 1%, up to 100 MHz. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for energy in the world. With an energy system still based on fossil fuels, a paradigm shifts towards clean energy production based on available renewable resources is necessary. Hydrogen is a high-quality energy carrier that can be used with great efficiency and is expected to acquire a great importance in the next generation of fuels. This study aims to analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the steam reforming of alcoholic waste from distilleries to produce clean electricity by using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The main findings from this study reported that the global environmental profile is better than other alternatives more common as sanitary landfill or incineration. In terms of some impact categories as Abiotic and Ozone Depletion, Acidification and Eutrophication, steam reforming of alcoholic waste performed better profiles than other processes that produce hydrogen from diverse feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The sago starch industry is one of the major revenue sources of the Malaysian state of Sarawak. This state is currently among the world’s leading producers of sago starch, exporting more than 40,000 tons every year to different Asian countries. This number is expected to rise since starch production and export value have been increasing 15.0%– 20.0% each year. Sago palm is subjected to various processes to obtain starch from its trunk. During processing, a huge amount of residual solid wastes is generated, such as bark and hampas, and in general, is burned or washed off to nearby streams. Along with the rising sago starch demand, the sago starch industry is now facing waste management problems, which have resulted in environmental pollution and health hazards. These wastes comprise starch, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin; hence, can be valorized into feedstock as value-added products. To date, these wastes have been utilized in the production of many materials like adsorbents, sugars, biofuels, nanomaterials, composites, and ceramics. This review article aims to summarize the various methods by which these wastes can be utilized besides to enlighten the major interest on sago hampas and bark. © 2019, Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - Limited alternative fuels for a CO2-neutral aviation sector have already been ASTM certified; synthetic paraffinic kerosene from hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) is one of these-a sustainable aviation fuel. With the hypothesis to improve the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a HEFA plant by realizing the required hydrogen supply via electrolysis-power to gas (PTG)-an exemplary SynBioPTx approach is investigated in a comprehensive feasibility study, which is, regarding this comparatively new approach, a novelty in its extent. About 10 scenarios are analysed by technical, environmental, and economic aspects. Within the alternative scenarios on feedstocks, electricity supply, necessary hydrogen supply, and different main products are analysed. For different plant designs of the hybrid refinery, mass and energy balances are elaborated, along with the results of the technical assessment. As a result of this environmental assessment, the attainment of at least 50% GHG mitigation might be possible. GHG highly depends on the renewability grade of the hydrogen provision as well as on the used feedstock. One important conclusion of this economic assessment is that total fuel production costs of 1295 to 1800 EUR t-1 are much higher than current market prices for jet fuel. The scenario in which hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of internally produced naphtha proves to be the best combination of highly reduced GHG emissions and low HEFA-SPK production costs. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Sugarcane bagasse is a vast, inexpensive lignocellulosic feedstock that can be industrially converted into renewable materials, chemicals and biofuels. Bagasse, which results from the shredding and crushing of the sugarcane stalks, has a pore structure that is inherited from the native plant tissues and is partly disrupted due to the applied mechanical processes. The connectivity in the bagasse pore space can be critical for mass transport in industrial processes requiring liquid or solute extraction from the solid or impregnation of catalysts and reactants into the biomass. In this work, we pioneer the construction of pore network models (PNMs) to investigate intraparticle connectivity in lignocellulosic biomass. X-ray microtomograms of sugarcane bagasse are employed to extract the PNMs, which are then analyzed with support from hydraulic, diffusion, and graph theory-based methods. The analysis determines the characteristic sizes and anisotropies of the bagasse pore space. Moreover, it reveals that a relatively small number of pores are critical for the intraparticle connectivity. The critical pores can be in tissue cracks and xylem vessels as well as in ruptured parenchyma and fiber cells. The relative importance of each of these regions depends on the specifics of the bagasse particle. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An efficient bio-based heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production was successfully fabricated by radiation-induced graft polymerization of 4-vinylbenzylchloride (VBC)followed by quaternary amination of trimethylamine (TMA)and ion-exchange with aqueous sodium hydroxide onto kenaf bast fiber using electron beam irradiation at a dose of 150 kGy. The produced catalyst was characterized by FESEM–EDX, CHNS, ATR-FTIR, TGA and XRD analyses. In this study, the continuous catalytic transesterification of triolein/ethanol in a bench-scale packed bed reactor (PBR)was designed and tested. The reaction process was focused at room temperature, different residence times from 1 min to 4 min and a molar ratio of triolein/ethanol (1:50). Besides, study on the transesterification of palm oil with ethanol under optimized conditions for maximum conversion of triolein to ethyl oleate (residence time of 3 min, LHSV = 8 h−1, short chain 150kGy catalyst)with temperature fixed at room temperature (˜25 °C)has been carried out. The extracted ethyl oleate was analyzed by HPLC and ATR-FTIR. The results found that the continuous flow system has a great potential for producing ethyl ester to be used as biodiesel and it is possible to generate 100% biodiesel with high purity from palm oil using radiation-induced kenaf catalyst. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Transportation is a vital necessity without which the entire world would come to a standstill. The fossil fuels used to power transportation are consumed at rates of approximately 100,000 times their rate of natural formation, and their consumption subjects the human environment and ecosystem to significant damage. As substitutes for fossil-based diesel, second-generation biodiesels can eliminate many of the challenges concerning first-generation biodiesels in terms of their high cost and the food versus fuel debate. The seeds of the date palm tree have significant oil content and are a promising prospective energy source. This study investigated the potential environmental benefits of this biofuel in terms of diesel tailpipe emission reduction. The various blends of palm date biodiesel were produced and matched to fuel standard requirements, resulting in four standard-compatible blends that were tested in a diesel engine at varying operating conditions for speed and load. Although the biodiesel emissions had lower concentrations of CO2, CO, and HC relative to fossil diesel, higher concentrations of NOx were detected. The results suggest that date-seed biodiesel could become a sustainable energy source for the transport sector, although further technical and economic investigations will be required before its wide deployment. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In today’s technology age, especially in urban areas, one of the most important sources of environmental noise pollution is diesel engines. Due to the limited availability of petroleum-based fuels, produced in only certain regions of the world maps, high cost, and being one of the most important causes of environmental pollution, in recent years, researchers have intensively focused on the study of alternative energy sources. Today, one of the most important alternative energy sources is biodiesel obtained from various natural sources. In this study, the effect of broiler chicken and turkey biodiesel on the noise emission of diesel engines was investigated experimentally. The biodiesels were produced with special methods using broiler chicken and turkey rendering fats. Two different kinds of biodiesels were homogeneously blended into the diesel fuel at proportions of 10%, 20%, and 50%. Engine tests were carried out at full load at various engine speeds and partial loads at a constant speed of 2000 rpm. During the experiments, noise measurements of the engine were taken by hand-held noise analyser. For more detailed assessment, 1/3 octave band noise analysis between 10 and 10 kHz was performed as well. Compared with diesel fuel, results of the noise analyses showed that use of biodiesel blends produced from broiler chicken and turkey rendering fat in diesel fuel has no significantly effect on engine noise emissions. Biodiesels produced from broiler chicken and turkey fats can be used safely in terms of noise emissions as engine fuels. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The present study aims to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission from a CI engine using calcite/activated carbon-based post-combustion CO 2 capture system fueled with Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel (B100). The tests were conducted in a two-cylinder CI engine used in tractors at different load conditions. The performance and emission parameters of diesel and B100 with and without calcite and activated carbon-based CO 2 capture system were studied. The results show that compared to diesel, CO 2 emission increased by 19% for B100 due to high fuel-bound oxygen and carbon. Higher NO emission with a slightly reduced smoke opacity is observed with B100 combustion. CO 2 emission is reduced with the CO 2 capture system for both diesel and B100. CO 2 emission is reduced by 11.5% and 7.3% for diesel with calcite and activated carbon, respectively, and reduced by 15.8% and 10.5% for B100 with calcite and activated carbon. Due to the adsorption capacity of both calcite and activated carbon, NO and smoke opacity are reduced considerably. The results display that calcite is better in reducing CO 2 compared to activated carbon-based CO 2 capture system. It is perceived that the combination of biofuel and calcite-based CO 2 capture system can both reduce engine-out emissions and cause a net negative CO 2 emission as it is renewable aiding in mitigation of global warming effects. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The emergence properties of paper as the ionic conductor has driven the new development in energy generators mainly micro-nano scale energy. Instead of the flow channels in conventional fuel cells, the capillary action of the paper controls the flow of the electrolytes. Paper based biofuel cells and electrochemical fuel cells are recent trends in micro-nano power generation to support the biosensors. In this study, zinc fuel and VO+ 2 oxidant were used to form a membraneless fuel cell. Instead of membrane, Whatmann® 2 filter paper was used as the separator cum autonomous microfluidic pumping system. When 6 M KOH and 1.5 M VO+ 2 in 2.5 M H2SO4 were supplied on the anode and cathode respectively, a peak power density of 9.4 mW cm−2 at 1.21 V and open circuit voltage of ∼ 2.5 V were realized. Due to the low cost and high power associated with this system, it can be used to power the Lab-on-Chip devices employed for single use point-of-care applications. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biodiesel is an environment-friendly, alternative and renewable energy resource, synthesized from inexpensive seed oils of non-edible feedstock through transesterification reaction with alcohol and a homogenous base catalyst. In the current study, Taraxacum officinale seed oil (30% by weight) is investigated for physiochemical characterization and biodiesel production. FTIR and GC analysis was carried out to investigate chemical properties and fatty acid profile of methyl ester of Taraxacum officinale seed oil. Optimized parameters of alcohol to oil (1:4), catalyst concentration at temperature of 65 °C resulted in highest yield of 92%, in 60 min time using response surface methodology. In addition, comparison of fuel properties of synthesized biodiesel with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 showed well-matched values. Our study thus recommends cultivation, cleaner production and utilization of Taraxacum officinale as a non-edible potential feedstock for biofuel production and industrial purposes. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Abstract: A study is made of the effect of the composition of the active component of copper-doped nickel catalysts on their activity and selectivity in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of model compounds of vegetable oils (esters) to remove oxygen atoms from them with the formation of alkanes. It is shown that the Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts are active in this process. With them, the hydrodeoxygenation of methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid mixed with ethyl ester of decanoic acid results in the formation of С6−С16 alkanes and oxygen-containing products, while methane and ethane can be found in the gas phase. When the Ni : Cu ratio in the catalysts is lowered, the conversion of esters and the capability of these catalysts for C–C bond hydrogenolysis are reduced. This means the introduction of copper can promote retention of the carbon skeleton of alkanes obtained as a result of hydrodeoxygenation, along with the amount of methane. According to X-ray diffraction data, introducing copper into the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst results in the formation of Ni1 – xCux solid solutions. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data, lowering the content of copper in the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst raises the Ni : Cu ratio on a sample’s surface. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Burning of fossil fuels is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the USA as well as other parts of the World. Increased greenhouse emissions not only cause the global warming but also pose threat to public health. This has led to increased interest in the production of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiesel is an alternative fuel source that is obtained from renewable biomass, such as canola, soybean, corn, palm, sunflower, and algae. The green alga Botryococcus braunii shows great potential for biodiesel production due to its ability to produce high amounts of hydrocarbon. In this study, we investigated culture media (starter mix, miracle-Gro, and commercial fertilizer) and light sources (yellow, white LED, and pink/blue) effects on the growth of B. braunii for the production of biomass and hydrocarbons. The test results indicated that starter mix media under pink/blue light source with the light intensity of 24.3 μmol/s and photoperiod of 12 h light: 12 h dark at room temperature (22–25 °C) were found to be best condition. The highest optical density (OD680) value (1.853) was obtained on day 23 of the incubation period. Variation of the dry biomass expectedly showed similar characteristics to the optical density. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - In this paper, conventional response surface methodology (RSM) based on low-order polynomials and an alternative Kriging-based method are used for the model-based single and multi-objective optimization of fatty-acid methyl ester (FAME) production catalyzed by a novel crude lipase from the yeast Cryptococcus diffluens (D44). The coefficient of determination for the two modeling approaches was calculated as 0.97 for the Kriging method, and 0.86 for RSM; showing a more reliable representation of experimental data by Kriging. Both models were used to perform single (maximizing FAME titer and temporal productivity separately) and multi-objective (maximizing FAME titer and temporal productivity simultaneously) optimizations of four important operating conditions (reaction time and temperature; amount of crude enzyme; and volume of methanol used). In all cases, the highest temperature considered (60°C) gave the best results. A reduction of reaction time in half was seen to be necessary to achieve optimum productivity compared to titer, when the two objectives were considered separately. The observed trade-off between the two objectives was quantified via multi-objective optimization using Pareto-front analysis. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is one of the most promising feedstocks for biodiesel production as it is environment friendly, has energy supply potential, impacts edible oil safety, and enables competitive recycling costs. However, one central roadblock to the development of WCO-based biodiesel in China is its fairly low collection rate in the formal WCO supply chain. Most waste cooking oil is still collected by informal collectors with some flowing back to “table.” The aim of our paper is to identify the most effective incentive conditions and targets in the WCO supply chain to offer recommendations that address this WCO roadblock. Accordingly, we designed a Stackelberg game model among restaurants, recyclers, and biodiesel production enterprises. The results show that restaurants are the best targets for incentives in this WCO supply chain. With a certain amount of monetary incentives, the WCO supply for biofuel production can be improved significantly. If the restaurant subsidy is 4000 yuan/ton, the amount of WCO recycled would increase by 47%, which is far more efficient than incenting recyclers or biofuel producers. We also set up four scenarios and found that compared with a single policy approach (mandatory only or economic incentive only), a combined policy (mandatory with economic incentive) would be the most effective means to incent restaurants to submit WCO for biofuel. There was also a correlation between policy incentive effectiveness and restaurant sensitivity to WCO submission profits. When the price sensitivity was larger than 17.98, the best policy for the government would be to offer economic incentives to restaurants. To guarantee the effectiveness of such policy incentives, supporting laws, policy guidelines, and routine supervision should be provided as well. © 2019, The Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University.

AB  - A series of 5-(alkoxymethyl)furfurals (AMFs) have been synthesized in excellent isolated yields (>90%) by reacting biomass-derived 5-(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) or 5-(bromomethyl)furfural (BMF) with monohydric alkyl alcohols (methanol to 1-butanol) at slightly elevated temperatures (RT-50 °C) and short reaction time (3 h). The modified work-up procedure minimizes side reactions while simplifying the isolation and purification of AMFs. Although higher primary alcohols like 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol and secondary alcohol like 2-propanol were found to be less reactive, use of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as a base additive afforded AMFs in excellent yields within 6 h at 65 °C using only slight excess of the alcohol (1.2 eq.) reagent. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Background: Living organisms need to allocate their limited resources in a manner that optimizes their overall fitness by simultaneously achieving several different biological objectives. Examination of these biological trade-offs can provide invaluable information regarding the biophysical and biochemical bases behind observed cellular phenotypes. A quantitative knowledge of a cell system's critical objectives is also needed for engineering of cellular metabolism, where there is interest in mitigating the fitness costs that may result from human manipulation. Results: To study metabolism in photoheterotrophs, we developed and validated a genome-scale model of metabolism in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a metabolically versatile gram-negative purple non-sulfur bacterium capable of growing phototrophically on various carbon sources, including inorganic carbon and aromatic compounds. To quantitatively assess trade-offs among a set of important biological objectives during different metabolic growth modes, we used our new model to conduct an 8-dimensional multi-objective flux analysis of metabolism in R. palustris. Our results revealed that phototrophic metabolism in R. palustris is light-limited under anaerobic conditions, regardless of the available carbon source. Under photoheterotrophic conditions, R. palustris prioritizes the optimization of carbon efficiency, followed by ATP production and biomass production rate, in a Pareto-optimal manner. To achieve maximum carbon fixation, cells appear to divert limited energy resources away from growth and toward CO 2 fixation, even in the presence of excess reduced carbon. We also found that to achieve the theoretical maximum rate of biomass production, anaerobic metabolism requires import of additional compounds (such as protons) to serve as electron acceptors. Finally, we found that production of hydrogen gas, of potential interest as a candidate biofuel, lowers the cellular growth rates under all circumstances. Conclusions: Photoheterotrophic metabolism of R. palustris is primarily regulated by the amount of light it can absorb and not the availability of carbon. However, despite carbon's secondary role as a regulating factor, R. palustris' metabolism strives for maximum carbon efficiency, even when this increased efficiency leads to slightly lower growth rates. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural) is a well-known promising product from hexose dehydration used for production of biofuels and chemicals. Liquid-liquid extraction is an essential process in HMF production to recover HMF from reaction medium. One of the important parameters needed in the extraction process design is liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) data. Organic solvent (methyl isobutyl ketone or 2-pentanol) was applied as extraction solvent to induce phase separation and extract HMF from the aqueous solution in the presence of the ionic liquid [EMIM][BF4] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) and NaCl (sodium chloride). The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of [EMIM][BF4] on the phase equilibria of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) or 2-pentanol, HMF, water systems in the absence and presence of NaCl at 313.15 K and atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa). The separation factor and the distribution coefficient of HMF were obtained for interpreting liquid-liquid extraction performance. The results indicated that the presence of [EMIM][BF4] caused negative effect on the LLE of organic solvent-HMF-water systems. The slope of tie-lines became more negative with increasing [EMIM][BF4] concentration, indicating lower HMF distribution coefficients and separation factors. However, the presence of NaCl in the HMF aqueous ionic liquid solution can enhance both the separation factor and the distribution coefficient making the HMF extraction more favourable with the HMF distribution coefficient values higher than 1 over the whole range of initial HMF concentrations. According to the results in the present study, MIBK was found superior as an extraction solvent for HMF in the presence of [EMIM][BF4] and NaCl exhibited from the better extraction performance with the separation factors 2.0 times higher than those of 2-pentanol. Furthermore, the NRTL activity coefficient model satisfactorily correlated all the experimental phase equilibrium data provided in this study. The RMSD (root mean square deviations) of the NRTL model were 0.97% and 0.63% for the investigated LLE systems with MIBK and 2-pentanol as solvent in the absence of NaCl, respectively. Whereas, the RMSD of the LLE systems containing NaCl were 0.28% for MIBK-HMF-water-[EMIM][BF4]-NaCl and 0.90% for 2-pentanol-HMF-water-[EMIM][BF4]-NaCl. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: General types of renewable carbon sources have been considered to be suitable for production of drop-in biofuels with minimum oxygen content, fully compatible with conventional fuels. The methods for processing different feedstock types have been discussed, their main advantages and drawbacks are indicated. Preparation of drop-in fuels from vegetable oils and waste of biodiesel production is possible in the framework of current methods without significant capital investments. Processing the pyrolysis products of lignocellulose biomass is fraught with a number of technical and technological problems, being currently at the research-and-development step. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The direct liquefaction of the wastes from carob pod processing industry leaded to a biooil with 88% of conversion, further water extraction afforded two extracts that can be used, e.g., as alternatives to the synthetic antioxidants. The hydroxyl number, as well as acid value, were screened for the reaction crude and both extracts. The organic extract, despite its high concentration of phenolic compounds (19.3 g GA eq/mg extrc), proved to be less antioxidant (1.05 μL/mL) than the aqueous congener (total phenolic content, 0.92 GA eq/mg extrc; antioxidant activity, 1.19 μL/mL). Nevertheless, both extracts have proved to be more active than BHT. The composition of the aqueous extract regarding its sugar's content was also studied, revealing the presence of glucose, fructose, and sucrose. The higher heating value, estimated by Dulong's formula, along with the analysis of van Krevelen diagram indicate that the organic extract can be potentially used as a fuel, an additive or as components in fuel blends. Briefly, this work proves that carob waste can be valued as an antioxidant additive, as fuels or even as a sugar platform. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The platform chemicals 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) and 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) are important raw materials for polyesters and biofuels. However, the biosynthesis of the compounds relies on massive consumption of glucose or glycerol, leading to the uneconomical production in industrial scale. In this work, we developed a new method for co-production of 1,3-PD and 2,3-BD from waste lard to reduce the cost in carbon source supply. A waste lard utilizing Pseudomonas alcaligenes PA-3 and a 1,3-PD producing Klebsiella pneumoniae AA405 were co-cultivated by using waste lard as the sole carbon source. In a shake flask, 1.05 g/L 1,3-PD and 0.35 g/L 2,3-BD were produced from waste lard within 24 h. The addition of nitrogen source significantly increased the relative ratio of K. pneumoniae AA405 in the medium, which further favored to the higher titers of the two products. In bioreactor, the co-cultivation system produced 5.98 g/L 1,3-PD and 4.29 g/L 2,3-BD from 100 g/L waste lard within 72 h, and the conversion rate of 1,3-PD and 2,3-BD from waste lard were 62.95% and 0.75%, respectively. In all, this is the first work on 1,3-PD and 2,3-BD production from waste triglyceride, which will favor the utilization of low-cost carbon source in industrial production of chemicals. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Auto-ignition characteristics of a butanol-hexadecane droplet were researched under ambient gauge pressures of 5 and 10 bar and ambient temperatures of 553, 633 and 713 K. Butanol-hexadecane blends of 0%, 25% and 50% n-butanol by mass (hereafter denoted by BUT'XX′) were tested in a bilayer-structure chamber (BSC). Five sub-stages were observed, namely stable evaporation, faint partially premixed combustion, bright partially premixed combustion, diffusion combustion and droplet falling. Faint partially premixed combustion and droplet falling were observed under elevated pressures but not under atmospheric pressure. The temperature growth rate was generally different in these sub-stages. Four different temperature growth rates were found under 633 K and 5 bar, while only three different temperature growth rates were found under 713 K and 5 bar. The auto-ignition delay was negatively correlated with ambient pressure and temperature. The auto-ignition delay of BUT25 was shorter than that of BUT00 and BUT50 under 633 K and 5 bar, while the increase of n-butanol led to the increase of auto-ignition delay under 633 K and 10 bar. The auto-ignition distance reflected the transportation of fuel vapor in the auto-ignition delay. The auto-ignition distance changed in a similar manner with the auto-ignition delay. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Glycerol, a by-product from transesterification, is well-known as one of the factors inhibiting the reaction. Previous works have mostly shown that the reaction rate slows to a near-steady state and eventually reaches chemical equilibrium. This work aimed to study the inhibiting behavior of glycerol on the transesterification of palm oil. Observation under an LCD digital microscopy showed that glycerol-coated droplets of catalyst-methanol dispersed in the triglyceride phase. This work proposes that glycerol inhibits transesterification by the following mechanism: Droplets of catalyst-methanol disperse into the triglyceride phase; the reaction takes place at an interphase called the reactive zone; methyl ester, the desired product, has low polarity and moves to the triglyceride phase, whereas glycerol, the non-desired product, is more highly polar and accumulates on the droplet surface of catalyst-methanol droplets, inhibiting triglyceride mass transfer and diluting the concentration of the catalyst-methanol. The triglyceride mass transfer coefficient and reaction rate constant were both investigated and expressed as the exponential function. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels are the most promising sustainable fuels that can be added to the crude oil pool to refill the dwindling fossil resources. In this work, we tested a Raney-Ni catalyst for the hydrogenation of four bio-oil model compounds and their binary mixtures to assess their reactivity under mild conditions suitable for bio-oil stabilization preceding green diesel production from lingo cellulosic biomass. The hydrogenation experiments were performed at ambient hydrogen pressure at temperatures in the range 30-70 °C. Raney-Ni was found to hydrogenate all investigated model compounds efficiently; both carbonyl groups and double bonds were saturated. In addition, it was also active in the demethoxylation of guaiacol. When studying the binary mixtures, furfuryl alcohol was found to significantly inhibit the hydrogenation of the other model compounds (guaiacol and methyl isobutyl ketone) due to their very strong adsorption. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The depletion of exhaustible underground petroleum resources has put the present civilization at stake, thereby warranting intense research on non-exhaustible fuel. With this energy crisis hitting the block, microorganisms such as yeasts are gaining wider importance as potential biofuel candidates. An indigenous yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from laboratory-scale brewing was investigated for biodiesel production. Biodiesel was produced by in situ transesterification approach using 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine as the catalyst. The fuel properties such as viscosity, density, calorific value and cetane number (CN) were determined to assess the fuel quality of S. cerevisiae biodiesel. Additionally, the investigation also focuses on theoretical studies considering the yeast de-oiled cake (low-value biomass refuse). Fatty acid methyl ester analysis revealed that biodiesel was primarily composed of tricosylic acid (C23:0, 28.71%), palmitoleic acid (C16:1, 28.96%) and oleic acid (C18:1, 18.13%). Eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5, 2.01%), one of the most commonly known polyunsaturated fatty acid, was present in the yeast strain. The CN of yeast biodiesel was 71.58, which was much higher than petro-diesel. The theoretical findings suggest the competitiveness of yeast biomass conversion technologies with petroleum refining process economics. The overall study warrants the feasibility of co-production of biodiesel from S. cerevisiae and cracked biofuel products (from S. cerevisiae de-oiled cake) under the aegis of biorefining applications. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Considering world energy demand and its security, much attention has been focused on identifying promising lignocellulosic substrates to generate a variety of downstream fuels and chemicals. In response, a recent key research area has centered on hydrolysis of cell wall polysaccharides by various physical, chemical and biological means. Due to their complex chemical and molecular structure, there is a substantial knowledge gap in understanding of biomass recalcitrance and its relationship with cell wall structure. It has delayed the response in meeting the target to achieve economically feasible large-scale conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel and market entrance. Biomass of wheat straw, rice straw, corn stover, sugarcane bagasse and switchgrass has been characterized to assess their potential for bioenergy application. The mechanism involved in digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass is complex since it is hindered by many physico-chemical, structural and compositional factors. This paper highlights recent advances in analytical methods employed for physico-chemical characterization of lignocellulosic biomass and its deconvolution to maximize the benefit of biomass as a material and energy feedstock. © 2019, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

AB  - This study presents a detailed analysis of the catalytic de-oxygenation of the liquid and gaseous pyrolytic products of two biomasses (beech wood and flax shives) using different catalysts (commercial HZSM-5 and H-Y, and lab-synthesised Fe-HZSM-5, Fe-H-Y, Pt/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3). The experiments were all conducted in a semi-batch reactor under the same operating conditions for all feed materials. BET specific surface area, BJH pore size distribution and FT-IR technologies have been used to characterise the catalysts, while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) and thermal conductivity detection (GC-TCD) were used to examine the liquid and gaseous pyrolytic products. It was firstly seen that at higher catalyst-to-biomass ratios of 4:1, de-oxygenation efficiency did not experience any further significant improvement. Fe-HZSM-5 was deemed to be the most efficient of the catalysts utilised as it helped reach the lowest oxygen contents in the bio-oils samples and the second best was HZSM-5. It was also found that HZSM-5 and H-Y tended to privilege the decarbonylation route (production of CO), whilst their iron-modified counterparts favoured the decarboxylation one (production of CO2) for both biomasses studied. It was then seen that the major bio-oil components (carboxylic acids) underwent almost complete conversion under catalytic treatment to produce mostly unoxygenated aromatic compounds, phenols and gases like CO and CO2. Finally, phenols were seen to be the family most significantly formed from the actions of all catalysts. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel that can be originated from different raw materials. However, even a good quality biodiesel has its properties strongly dependent upon its fatty acid profile. For instance, samples with a high content of saturated fatty acids may present poor cold flow properties, meaning that they tend to solidify under low temperatures. In this work, we propose to synthesize polymer additives and apply them as cold flow improvers for palm methyl esters (biodiesel) and their blends with petrodiesel. The synthetic additives were evaluated at different concentrations to assess their effect on the pour point (PP) of the resulting neat or blended biofuel. By using 1000 ppm of poly(dodecyl acrylate-co-tetradecyl methacrylate), it was possible to decrease the PP of B5 (5 vol.% biodiesel + 95 vol.% diesel) and B20 (20 vol.% biodiesel + 80 vol.% diesel) to −35 °C and −14 °C, respectively, which allowed the use of these blends in regions where their flow properties would eventually be prohibitive. However, the performance of the additive on the neat fuel (B100) was negligible. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Purpose: Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can be mixed with toluene and be accidentally released into anoxic ecosystems and impact soil microbial communities. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to examine, under nitrate-reduction conditions, the biodegradation of toluene in the presence of two different types of biodiesel (sunflower and rapeseed), and their impact on the bacterial community structure. Materials and methods: Sediment samples were spiked individually with toluene, biodiesel, and their blends in laboratory-designed microcosms. Sunflower oil biodiesel was produced in the laboratory, while rapeseed oil biodiesel was a commercial product. Degradation of biodiesels and blends was monitored by directly measuring the substrate or indirectly by determining nitrate removal during the course of the experiment. Denitrification rates were estimated with the acetylene inhibition technique. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to assess impacts on the bacterial community structure exposed to biodiesels, blends, and toluene. Results and discussion: The results of this study showed that toluene and biodiesel were completely degraded within 10 days. Biodiesel significantly affected the bacterial community structure at a similar magnitude, independently of its origin. Additionally, toluene impacted the bacterial community and denitrification process to a lower extent than biodiesel and a clear decrease in the relative bacterial richness and diversity was shown in samples with biodiesel and blends. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reports describing degradation of biodiesel alone and blends under nitrate-reducing conditions, and also the effects of these compounds on the denitrification process. In addition, due to the recently discovered “oxygenic denitrification” process, the acetylene inhibition technique and nitrous oxide quantification may not be the most adequate tool to estimate denitrification rates. Further detailed studies are advised to understand whether the identified bacterial community shift impacts ecosystem functions. Conclusions: Our results help to understand the biodegradation of toluene, biodiesel, and their blends in sediments under nitrate-reducing conditions and might be important in implementing bioremediation strategies in anoxic environments. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Catalytic hydrothermal conversion diesel (CHCD-76), synthesized isoparaffin (SIP-76), and hydroprocessed renewable diesel (HRD-76) have been produced in sufficient quantity and supplied to the U.S. Navy for blending with traditional marine diesel NATO F-76. The present work investigates the storage and oxidation stabilities of DSH-76, CHCD-76, and their blends with F-76. Chemical composition and physicochemical properties of these two biofuels, including viscosity, density, peroxide value, heat of combustion, acid number, and phase behavior, were determined using required ASTM methods. ASTM D4625 and D5304 methods were employed to investigate the long-term storage stability of these two biofuels and theirs blends with F-76. ASTM D5304 method was also modified to investigate the oxidation process of these fuel samples. In addition, ASTM D2274 tests were conducted to investigate oxidation stability of the neat and blended fuel samples. The influence of long-term storage and oxidation on fuel physicochemical properties was investigated based on ASTM methods. SIP-76 and CHCD-76 were found have superior storage and oxidation stability in comparison with petroleum F-76. This is also the first report on storage and oxidation stability of SIP-76 and CHCD-76. © 2018

AB  - A method to produce the biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) from cellulose-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) using commercial gasoline as solvent to obtain mixtures of gasoline with DMF, appropriate for direct use in present internal combustion engines, is presented. Best results were obtained with gasoline:ethanol mixtures in the ratio 9:1 (E10), as ethanol acts as a solvent mediator for the dissolution of HMF. Selected potential biofuels are also found to give high DMF yields, for example, several alcohols (81-92%) and 2-butanone (94%), while γ-valerolacton and saturated hydrocarbons show limitations (75% and 37%, respectively). The reaction in gasoline is conducted sequentially up to three times with an initial loading of 10 wt % HMF per step, resulting in a concentration increase of up to 7 wt % DMF for each step, by which a concentration range between 7 and 20 wt % DMF in the final blend is covered. The obtained blends were evaluated by the determination of the derived cetane number (DCN) and a simulated distillation with comparison to premixed blends and proved to be comparable in a wide concentration range of DMF (5-15 wt %). Thus, a potentially directly usable fuel blend is produced in a direct conversion process without the need of costly separation. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, renewable biofuels (ethanol and n-butanol) were utilized to synthesize carbon nanotubes on substrate of inexpensive metal mesh (copper alloy and nickel) using inverse diffusion flame. The effects of metal mesh, synthesis time and flame temperature on growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were investigated in details. The morphology and structure of CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that there were no CNTs formed on nickel mesh. When the substrate was copper alloy mesh, the yield of CNTs increased from 2 min and reached maximum at about 15 min as the synthesis time increased. Under the condition of 15 min, CNTs synthesized in ethanol flame of 1023 K and in n-butanol flame of 1273 K had higher degree of graphitic structure. In addition, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with straight tube wall were synthesized in ethanol flame of 1023 K and 1273 K when the synthesis time was 15 min. For these experiments, CNTs with excellent quality could be synthesized effectively in ethanol flame with temperatures of 1023 K and 1273 K when the synthesis time was 15 min and the substrate was copper alloy mesh. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - - Biodiesel production using acid oils is an important alternative for biofuel cost reduction. However, it is a huge challenge for homogeneous transesterification, the main industrial route commonly used. This paper presents macauba oil with high acidity, 43.90 w/w%, as a potential raw material for biodiesel production. The acidity was reduced to 0.8 w/w% after re-esterification (80 min) with glycerol at high temperature (235 °C), without catalysts. Zinc (powder and coating) and NbOPO4 were also tested as catalysts in comparison with the reaction without a catalyst. Reactions catalyzed by metallic Zn produced a large amount of Zn carboxylate, an undesirable soap, due to the high Zn leaching. In contrast with the literature, Zinc did not show good catalytic activity, as confirmed by the kinetic parameters. NbOPO4 was not a good catalyst, too. Reaction without catalysts was performed using nitrogen as a carrier gas and it was compared with reaction under vacuum to remove co-produced water. Nitrogen showed the best result for re-esterification, avoiding degradation reactions. Triglycerides (TG) were the prevalent products in reactions using nitrogen. After re-esterification, the oil was easily converted into biodiesel with high ester content (98.4%) of methyl ester by alkaline transesterification. © 2019 Assoc. Brasiliera de Eng. Quimica / Braz.

AB  - Synthesis of biofuels is an important step in the phase out of fossil fuels in the transportation sector, especially in long-distance sea, air and road transport where direct electrification seems unfeasible. Integration of renewable electricity enables efficient electricity storage as well as an increased utilization of the biomass carbon, which lowers the biomass demand. This paper presents a flexible system for the conversion of biomass and electricity to methanol. The system is based on the deep integration of a Two-Stage gasifier and solid oxide cells (SOC). The integration enables efficient production of a nitrogen-free high-quality syngas, suitable for methanol production. This study focuses on the system in electrolysis mode, and analyzes the effects of recirculating CO2 from the gas conditioning and methanol synthesis process back to the SOC, as well as the effects of pressurized operation of the gasifier and increased H2O content in the gasifier. Thermodynamic modeling shows that CO2-recirculation allows an increase in conversion of the carbon in the biomass to methanol from 80 % up to 92 %, with an energy efficiency of 71 %. Only a slight pressurization seems feasible, as an increase in pressure beyond ~3 bar results in significant methane formation inside the SOC. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The burning of sulfate turpentine, formed as a by-product of pulp and paper mills during the kraft pulping process, causes irreparable environmental damage, as it contains a large number of toxic sulfur-containing compounds generating sulfur dioxide when being combusted. It is for this reason that the search for methods of removing sulfur compounds from the sulfate turpentine, which can make the purified product a valuable source of terpene compounds suitable for industrial processing, is being actively pursued. The problem of complex refinement and rational utilization of turpentine is mainly to establish a waste-free use of feedstock for obtaining useful products. However, the lack of selectivity in the conversion of terpenes which are the main components of turpentine, and the complexity of their separation hinder the development of effective methods for refining turpentine. In this regard, the refined turpentine is used mainly as a solvent for varnishes and paints. At the same time, it is a valuable biofuel, capable, with proper approach, of partially replacing fuels produced from mineral oil. Terpenes from turpentine and their derivatives are widely used in the organic synthesis of biologically active substances, antioxidants, pesticides, herbicides, in the perfume industry for producing fragrances (linalool, geraniol, nerol, citronellol), and also for obtaining compounds with a pronounced insecticidal, repellent, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and other types of biological activity. Sulfur-containing compounds can achieve widespread use in organic synthesis to manufacture solvents, ion-exchange resins, dyes, in the synthesis of detergents and reagents for the chemical industry (sulfochlorides, thiosulfonates, sulfoxides). © 2019 Publishing House "O- Kratkoe".

AB  - The biocatalytic application of photoautotrophic organisms is a promising alternative for the production of biofuels and value-added compounds as they do not rely on carbohydrates as a source of carbon, electrons, and energy. Although the photoautotrophic organisms hold potential for the development of sustainable processes, suitable reactor concepts that allow high cell density (HCD) cultivation of photoautotrophic microorganisms are limited. Such reactors need a high surface to volume ratio to enhance light availability. Furthermore, the accumulation of high oxygen concentrations as a consequence of oxygenic photosynthesis, and its inhibitory effect on cell growth needs to be prevented. Here, we present a method for HCD cultivation of oxygenic phototrophs based on the co-cultivation of different trophies in a biofilm format to avoid high oxygen partial-pressure and attain HCDs of up to 51.8 gBDW L−1 on a lab scale. In this article, we show: • A robust method for mixed trophies biofilm cultivation in capillary reactors • Set-up and operation of a biofilm capillary reactor • A method to quantify oxygen in the continuous biofilm capillary reactor © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The encapsulated enzyme system by metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibits great potential in biofuel cells, pharmaceuticals, and biocatalysis. However, the catalytic efficiency and the enzymatic activity are severely hampered due to enzyme leaching and deficiency of storage stability. In this study, we immobilized cytochrome c (Cyt c) into dimethylimidazole-copper (Cu(Im)2) by biomimetic mineralization, and constructed a bioinorganic hybrid material, termed Cyt c@Cu(Im)2. Encapsulated Cyt c in Cu(Im)2 with a nanosheet structure exhibited significantly improved catalytic efficiency, enzymatic activity and kinetic performance. The catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km) for Cyt c@Cu(Im)2 was ~20-fold higher compared to that of free Cyt c. Moreover, the increased activity was not affected by long-term storage. Based on this system, we further constructed a multi-enzyme composite with glucose-oxidase (GOx), termed GOx-Cyt c@Cu(Im)2, which exhibited greatly improved enzymatic activity, stability, and excellent selectivity for the detection of low concentrations of glucose. This strategy may provide new insights into the design of enzymes with high activity and stability, as well as the construction of multi-enzyme systems. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In the present work, solar energy conversion into electricity was evidenced by the Chlorophytum comosum-Microbial Fuel Cell (Chlorophytum-MFC). Our Chlorophytum-MFC had produced an Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) up to 1211 mV, without adding any nutrient or membrane. Plant biomass heigh and anodic bacterial number were proportional to OCV, current Icmax, and power Pmax, and were inversely proportional to the internal resistance Rint thus: 42 cm, 110.103 U/ml, 900 mV, 0.037 mA, 744 µW/m2 and 17 KΩ, respectively, at the 191th day of experiment. We had also highlighted that Chlorophytum-MFC had behaved like a typical fuel cell via polarization and power curves. Also, we had studied the photosynthesis effect on electrical energy production by measuring voltage fluctuation during three successive days and nights. The solar and temperatures influences were also highlighted by comparing weather software data to the measured Open Voltage. The electrogenous activity was clearly proportional to soil and climate temperature as well as to sunlight intensity. The obtained results showed that developing Chlorophytum-MFC could provide significant prospects for p-MFC and bioenergy recovery. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel derived from oilseeds or animal fats. Biofuel has low oxidative stability due to the high content of esters of unsaturated fatty acids, which are easily oxidized when exposed to air, light, heat and metals. Antioxidants are added to biodiesel to retard the oxidative process, which can capture free radicals making them thermodynamically more stable. This study aims to analyze the oxidative stability of biodiesel in the presence of metallic alloys of carbon steel and 1020 steel with the presence of rosemary extract. The rosemary extract had a phenol content of of 25,579 mgEAG/gdry mass, acting as antioxidant. In the presence of the natural rosemary extract, the biodiesel samples with metallic alloys but without rosemary extract presented similar oxidative stability and physicochemical properties, but when the rosemary extract is present, the carbon steel alloy presented a considerable compatibility, reaching higher induction periods. The thermodynamic parameters of the biodiesel sample with carbon steel and natural rosemary extract showed a significant improvement with the addition of antioxidant. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biofuels have to be produced from biomass under sustainable conditions accomplishing appropriate characteristics and specification for their use as transportation fuels. Nowadays, renewable diesel appears as a more promising option than traditional biodiesel (methyl ester), because its properties are closer to diesel, facilitating its use in current diesel motors. Hydrotreating process for obtaining renewable diesel requires catalysts which are generally supported metals. In these catalysts, the active phase can be a reduced metal, sulphide, carbide or phosphide metallic or bimetallic; while the support can be active carbon, alumina or zeolite. The reduced metals are the simplest to prepare. They do not undergo leaching and have good selectivity. In this work, the behaviour of these catalysts in the production of renewable diesel from palm oil is evaluated. Tests in a STA (simultaneous TGA and DSC) are used to compare the catalytic activity of Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru catalysts, studying the effect on selectivity and conversion of the type and concentration of the active phase, as well as the support. The tests were carried out at 5 MPa of H2 from 20 °C to 290 °C with a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min. IR and GC-MS were also used for identifying the products obtained at the best operating conditions. High selectivity and conversion were found in the generation of hydrocarbons, mainly n-C15 alkanes up to n-C18. The appearance of fatty acids with the same number of carbons was detected.

AB  - This present study was aimed to investigate the hydrocracking of coconut oil using Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst in a batch reactor at three reaction temperatures (350, 375, and 400 °C). The Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by using incipient wetness impregnation. The Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was characterized using XRD, BET, and SEM-EDX. From XRD results, the loading of Ni and Fe did not change the crystalline structure of HZSM-5 catalyst. The surface area of HZSM-5 was 425 m 2 /g and decreased after the addition of metals (Ni and Fe) into HZSM-5 support. These changes implied that Ni and Fe particles were successfully dispersed on the HZSM-5 surface and incorporated into HZSM-5 pore. The product of hydrocarbon biofuel was analyzed using GC-MS. The GC-MS results of hydrocarbon biofuel showed the highest compounds for n-paraffin and yield for gasoil was 39.24 and 18.4% at a temperature of 400 °C, respectively. The reaction temperature affected the yield and the composition of hydrocarbon biofuel. At this reaction temperature condition, decarboxylation and decarbonylation were favored; lead to the formation of n-alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms chain length. © 2019, Gadjah Mada University.

AB  - Yarrowia lipolytica, known to accumulate lipids intracellularly, lacks the cellulolytic enzymes needed to break down solid biomass directly. This study aimed to evaluate the potential metabolic burden of expressing core cellulolytic enzymes in an engineered high lipid-accumulating strain of Y. lipolytica. Three fungal cellulases, Talaromyces emersonii-Trichoderma reesei chimeric cellobiohydrolase I (chimeric-CBH I), T. reesei cellobiohydrolase II (CBH II), and T. reesei endoglucanase II (EG II) were expressed using three constitutive strong promoters as a single integrative expression block in a recently engineered lipid hyper-accumulating strain of Y. lipolytica (HA1). In yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium, the resulting cellulase co-expressing transformant YL165-1 had the chimeric-CBH I, CBH II, and EG II secretion titers being 26, 17, and 132 mg L-1, respectively. Cellulase co-expression in YL165-1 in culture media with a moderate C/N ratio of ∼4.5 unexpectedly resulted in a nearly two-fold reduction in cellular lipid accumulation compared to the parental control strain, a sign of cellular metabolic drain. Such metabolic drain was ameliorated when grown in media with a high C/N ratio of 59 having a higher glucose utilization rate that led to approximately twofold more cell mass and threefold more lipid production per liter culture compared to parental control strain, suggesting cross-talk between cellulase and lipid production, both of which involve the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Most importantly, we found that the chemical chaperone, trimethylamine N-oxide dihydride increased glucose utilization, cell mass and total lipid titer in the transformants, suggesting further amelioration of the metabolic drain. This is the first study examining lipid production in cellulase-expressing Y. lipolytica strains under various C/N ratio media and with a chemical chaperone highlighting the metabolic complexity for developing robust, cellulolytic and lipogenic yeast strains. © 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

AB  - Inadequate resources, diminution in petroleum reserves, environmental pollution hazards and escalated crude oil pricing have become major points of concern for energy use. This urged the researchers to identify an alternative source of fuel energy similar to petroleum hydrocarbons to be used in internal combustion engine. In the present study, biodiesel from leaves of Eucalyptus tereticornis was used in the processed form in compression ignition engine. The steam distillation process yielded 4.8% of Eucalyptus bio-oil through a batch process. Single stage transesterification process using methanol and sodium hydroxide produced Eucalyptus biodiesel effectively at molar ratio of 8:1. The physico-chemical properties of Eucalyptus biodiesel were found to be comparable to commercial diesel and within ASTM limits. Eucalyptus biodiesel in straight and blended form at ratio of 50:50 with commercial diesel was used in a single cylinder compression ignition engine to understand its emission characteristics. Lower unburnt hydrocarbon and smoke emission was observed when D50EBD50 fuel blend was used at part and full load condition. EBD100 fuel emitted higher CO2 across all loads. Oxides of nitrogen emission were found to be relatively higher at full load condition when compared with D100 and D50EBD50 fuel blends. The emission parameters of EBD100 and D50EBD50 were found to be comparable with mineral diesel. © 2019 Technoscience Publications. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The high oxygen content in natural biomass resources, such as vegetable oil or biomass-pyrolysed bio oil, is the main constraint in their implementation as a full-scale biofuel for the automotive industry. In the present study, renewable fuel with petrodiesel-like properties was produced via catalytic deoxygenation of oleic acid in the absence of hydrogen (H 2 ). The deoxygenation pathway of oleic acid to bio-hydrocarbon involves decarboxylation/decarbonylation of the oxygen content from the fatty acid structure in the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2 )/carbon monoxide (CO), with the presence of a goat manure supported Ni-Al hydrotalcite (Gm/Ni-Al) catalyst. Goat manure is an abundant bio-waste, containing a high mineral content, urea as well as cellulosic fiber of plants, which is potentially converted into activated carbon. Synthesis of Gm/Ni-Al was carried out by incorporation of pre-activated goat manure (GmA) during co-precipitation of Ni-Al catalyst with 1 : 3, 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 ratios. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area, field emission surface electron microscopy (FESEM) and temperature program desorption ammonia (TPD-NH 3 ) analysers. The catalytic deoxygenation reaction was performed in a batch reactor and the product obtained was characterized by using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) for compound composition identification as well as gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) for yield and selectivity determination. The optimization and evaluation were executed using response surface methodology (RSM) in conjunction with central composite design (CCD) with 5-level-3-factors. From the RSM reaction model, it was found that the Gm/Ni-Al 1 : 1 catalysed deoxygenation reaction gives the optimum product yield of 97.9% of hydrocarbon in the range of C 8 -C 20 , with diesel selectivity (C 17 : heptadecane and heptadecene compounds) of 63.7% at the optimal reaction conditions of: (1) reaction temperature: 327.14 °C, (2) reaction time: 1 h, and (3) catalyst amount: 5 wt%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Forest-based biofuels are strategically important in forest-rich countries like Sweden but the technical performance of several promising production pathways is poorly documented. This study examines product yields and energy efficiencies in six commercially relevant forest-based “drop-in” and “high blend” biofuel production pathways by developing detailed spreadsheet energy balance models. The models are in turn based on pilot-scale performance data from the literature, supplemented with input from technology developers and experts. In most pathways, biofuel production is integrated with a market pulp mill and/or a crude oil refinery. Initial conversion is by pyrolysis, gasification or lignin depolymerization and intermediate products are upgraded by hydrotreatment or catalytic synthesis. While lignin oil (LO) hydrodeoxygenation had the highest expanded system efficiency, considerable uncertainty surrounds product yields owing to absence of suitable experimental data on LO upgrading. Co-feeding vacuum gas oil and fast pyrolysis oil in a fluidized catalytic cracker has a complex and uncertain effect on fossil yields, which requires further investigation. Co-locating bio-oil hydrotreatment at the refinery improves heat utilization, leading to higher system efficiencies. Explicit consideration of mill type and energy requirements is required to avoid performance misestimation as an assumption of energy surplus can confer a definite advantage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, we propose the first demonstration of the flexibility of operating directly Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC) with liquid biofuels for sustainable clean power generation. Biofuel used in this part is prepared through an upgrading process of bio-oil obtained from olive mill wastewater sludge detailed in part 1 and demonstrated a successful improvement in physicochemical properties. Cell electrochemical polarization behavior, stability and internal decomposition of upgraded bio-oil over the Ni-SDC anode at different operating conditions such as temperatures and feed flow rates were deeply investigated. Results showed that IT-SOFC is able to convert the upgraded bio-oil to electricity at viable power densities (230 mW cm−2 at 750 °C) which is majorly related to the production of reactive fuels (H2, CO, CH4) from upgraded bio-oil cracking over Ni-based catalyst. Several side reactions may also occur over anode. Reverse Boudouard reaction is the main reaction reducing deposits as it forms. Bio-oil upgrading leads to a promising stability with limited carbon deposits (1.35 wt %) at 750 °C. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The present study investigates the quality changes of wood bio-briquette fuel after the addition of spent coffee ground (SCG) into the initial feedstock materials (sawdust, shavings) in different mass ratios (1:1, 1:3). Analysis of SCGs fuel parameter proved great potential for energy generation by a process of direct combustion. Namely, level of calorific value (GCV = 21.58 MJ kg-1), of ash content (Ac = 1.49%) and elementary composition (C = 55.49%, H = 7.07%, N = 2.38%, O = 33.41%) supports such statement. A comparison with results of initial feedstock materials exhibited better results of SCG in case of its calorific value and elementary composition. Bulk density ρ (kg m-3) and mechanical durability DU (%) of bio-briquette samples from initial feedstock materials were following for sawdust: ρ = 1026.39 kg m-3, DU = 98.44% and shavings: ρ = 1036.53 kg m-3, DU = 96.70%. The level of such mechanical quality indicators changed after the addition of SCG. Specifically, SCG+sawdust mixtures achieved ρ = 1077.49 kg m-3 and DU = 90.09%, while SCG + shavings mixtures achieved ρ = 899.44 kg m-3 and DU = 46.50%. The addition of SCG increased wood bio-briquettes energy potential but decreased its mechanical quality. Consequently, the addition of SCG in wood bio-briquette has advantages, but its mass ratio plays an important key role. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Microalgae have great potential to be used as feedstock for biofuel production. Municipal wastewater is an economically appealing culture medium to produce microalgae. Downstream processing of wastewater-adapted microalgae, i.e. transesterification of extracted lipid, needs to be more investigated due to the difference between lipid profile of pure culture microalgae and wastewater-adapted microalgae. Based on quantitative parameters of acidity, acid value, and triglyceride content it was indicated that free fatty acid and triglyceride contents of wastewater-adapted algal lipid were between the two limits i.e pure microalgal lipid and vegetable oil. Optimal transesterification conditions for wastewater-adapted algal lipid were investigated in terms of acid-catalyzed versus alkaline-catalyzed reactions, temperature and reaction time, and the type of catalyst. It was found that acid-catalyzed transesterification at 70 °C for 35 h using sulfuric acid as the catalyst is required to achieve the highest percentage of fatty acid methyl esters of 53.9 ± 9.6% in the end product. This is quite different from reaction conditions recommended for pure microalgal lipid and vegetable oil transesterification. These operating conditions resulted in a dominant fatty acid methyl ester profile of palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid in the product that satisfied international standards specified for biodiesel. The results of this study customizes the transesterification reaction conditions for wastewater-adapted algal lipid and is one step forward towards commercial production of clean fuel from microalgae feedstock obtained from wastewater. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the recent past, esters of meium-chain fatty acis have receive much attention ue to their wie inustrial application, meicinal importance, an biofuel use as alternative to petroleum iesel. Therefore, in the present work the repercussion of meium-chain-length fatty acis (MCLFAs) (C6-C10) with various alcohols for the homogeneous catalyze esterification has been stuie. The esterification of the MCLFAs with istinct alcohols (n-PrOH, i-PrOH, an n-BuOH) has been stuie in etail in a batch reactor. The impacts of various factors such as the mole ratio of MCLFAs to istinct alcohol, catalyst concentration, an temperature have been stuie. A kinetic moel reveale that the esterification of MCLFAs with various alcohols can be explaine well by a pseuohomogeneous first-orer reaction. The rate of the reaction, activation energy, an frequency factors were estimate using Arrhenius plots. The reactivity an influence of carbon chain length of MCLFAs an the effect of branching of alcohols were investigate to fin out the maximum conversion of MCLFAs.

AB  - A novel thin-layer biocatalyst for photosynthetic N2 fixation and H2 photoproduction was assembled using a Ca2+-alginate matrix and heterocysts isolated from wild-type Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 filaments. Compared to suspension heterocysts, heterocysts entrapped in Ca2+-alginate films showed improved stability of the nitrogenase system. While suspension heterocysts lost nitrogenase activity within 24 h, immobilized heterocysts supported nitrogenase activity for up to 125 h. The maximum specific rate of acetylene reduction was the same in both cases (∼0.4 μmol C2H2 mg Chl−1 h−1), but the catalyst with entrapped heterocysts required a much longer time to achieve the maximum rate (60 h instead of 3 h in suspension). Simultaneously with acetylene reduction, the immobilized heterocysts were able to photoproduce H2 for 125 h, yielding up to 1.1 mmol H2 mg Chl−1. The absence of acetylene increased the H2 photoproduction rate to a maximum of 25–30 μmol H2 mg Chl−1 h−1, and the catalyst was capable of H2 photoproduction for 190 h, yielding up to 2.5 mmol H2 mg Chl−1. The recovery of the catalyst with entrapped heterocysts was achieved through placing the cells in a N2 atmosphere for 24 h. This engaged a second cycle of H2 photoproduction, which lasted for another 240 h (10 days), thus yielding ∼3 mmol H2 mg Chl−1 in total after 454 h. Together, these findings demonstrate great potential for a heterocyst-based thin-layer platform for the sustainable production of chemicals and biofuels. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The production of biodiesel at the industrial level is mainly based on the use of basic catalysts. Otherwise, also acidic catalysis allowed high conversion and yields, as this method is not affected by the percentage of free fatty acids present in the starting sample. This work has been useful in assessing the possible catalytic pathways in the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), starting from different cooking waste oil mixtures, exploring particularly acidic catalysis. It was possible to state that the optimal experimental conditions required concentrated sulfuric acid 20% w/w as a catalyst, a reaction time of twelve hours, a temperature of 85◦ C and a molar ratio MeOH/oil of 6:1. The role of silica in the purification method was also explored. By evaluating the parameters, type of catalyst, temperature, reaction time and MeOH/oil molar ratios, it has been possible to develop a robust method for the production of biodiesel from real waste mixtures with conversions up to 99%. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Beta-glucosidases (β-glucosidases) have attracted considerable attention in recent years for use in various biotechnological applications. They are also essential enzymes for lignocellulose degradation in biofuel production. However, cost-effective biomass conversion requires the use of highly efficient enzymes. Thus, the search for new enzymes as better alternatives of the currently available enzyme preparations is highly important. Thermophilic fungi are nowadays considered as a promising source of enzymes with improved stability. Here, the crystal structure of a family GH3 β-glucosidase from the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum (CtBGL) was determined at a resolution of 2.99 Å. The structure showed the three-domain architecture found in other β-glucosidases with variations in loops and linker regions. The active site catalytic residues in CtBGL were identified as Asp287 (nucleophile) and Glu517 (acid/base). Structural comparison of CtBGL with Protein Data Bank (PDB)-deposited structures revealed variations among glycosylated Asn residues. The enzyme displayed moderate glycosylation compared to other GH3 family β-glucosidases with similar structure. A new glycosylation site at position Asn504 was identified in CtBGL. Moreover, comparison with respect to several thermostability parameters suggested that glycosylation and charged residues involved in electrostatic interactions may contribute to the stability of the enzyme at elevated temperatures. The reported CtBGL structure provides additional insights into the family GH3 enzymes and could offer new ideas for further improvements in β-glucosidases for more efficient use in biotechnological applications regarding cellulose degradation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts have a great potential to overcome the shortcomings of homogeneous and enzymatic catalysts and simplify the biodiesel production processes using low-grade, high-free-fatty-acid feedstock. In this study, we developed ZrO2-based bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts for simultaneous esterification and transesterification of microalgae to biodiesel. To avoid the disadvantage of the low surface area of ZrO2, the catalysts were prepared via a surfactant-assisted sol-gel method, followed by hydrothermal treatments. The response surface methodology central composite design was employed to investigate various factors, like the surfactant/Zr molar ratio, pH, aging time, and temperature on the ZrO2 surface area. The data were statistically analyzed to predict the optimal combination of factors, and further experiments were conducted for verification. Bi2O3 was supported on ZrO2 via the incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by a variety of techniques, which disclosed that the surfactant-assisted ZrO2 nanoparticles possess higher surface area, better acid–base properties, and well-formed pore structures than bare ZrO2. The highest yield of fatty acid methyl esters (73.21%) was achieved using Bi2O3/ZrO2(CTAB), and the catalytic activity of the developed catalysts was linearly correlated with the total densities of the acidic and basic sites. The mechanism of the simultaneous reactions was also discussed. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Furfural is a versatile platform chemical that can be used as a precursor for various biofuels and biopolymers. In this work, a novel biphasic system comprising acetone and choline chloride:ethylene glycol (ChCl:EG), an effective deep eutectic solvent (DES) for biomass pretreatment, was developed for furfural production. The optimized reaction condition was as follows: 180 °C, 30 min, 1.5 w/v% AlCl3 as a catalyst, and a volumetric ratio of 7:2 of acetone to aqueous ChCl:EG (with 30% water). By applying this optimized condition to xylose-containing pretreatment liquor from switchgrass, a furfural yield of 75% was obtained, with more than 90% furfural selectively partitioned into the acetone phase. This novel biphasic system would enable not only high-yield furfural production, but also facile separation and upgrading of furfural. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As global temperatures continue to increase the move to renewable energy sources is becoming an essential step in achieving a sustainable future. Biofuels from microalgae, while still more expensive to produce than fossil fuels, are of great interest for the high microalgae biomass growth rates, high lipid content, relatively low water requirements, and ability to be grown on non-arable land. Botryococcus braunii is a freshwater green microalga which grows in colonies supported by an extracellular matrix (ECM) of liquid hydrocarbons. Recent studies have investigated the efficiency of non-destructive in situ solvent extraction of lipids from B. braunii with a variety of solvents. These lipids are encapsulated in a retaining wall coated by a sheath of amphiphilic fibrils which have been found to act as a barrier to solvents. By carrying out repeated in situ solvent extraction in a high shear environment, we found that access to the ECM can be significantly improved. Sustainable botryococcene and total lipid productivities respectively of 29.9 ± 8.5 and 71.3 ± 20.3 mg L−1 day−1 were achieved with heptane extraction, a shear rate of 415 s−1, initial culture density of 1.62 ± 0.12 g L−1, contact period of 4 h, and a recovery period of 3 days. Nutrient supplementation to replace those lost in the emulsion entrained biomass will be required to maintain a sustainable process. The combined presence of heptane with high shear proved to be an effective colony disruption method which could be an effective pre-treatment followed by a low shear, high solvent contact, and extraction method. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

The microalga was isolated from a freshwater body and cultured for 20 days in five types of modified BG11 medium with different concentrations (0, 10−4, 10−3, 10−2, 10−1 mmol L−1) of ferric iron. The algae grown in medium supplemented with 10−2 mmol L−1 ferric iron had the highest specific growth rate of 0.36 ± 0.04 day−1 and remained in the exponential growth phase over the next 6 days compared with those grown in medium without iron supplementation. The peak of lipid content (34.19 ± 1.93% dry weight, DW) and biomass productivity (459.20 ± 2.37 mg L−1 day−1) was obtained in the media supplemented with 10−2 and 10−1 mmol L−1 ferric iron, respectively. The highest proportion of saturated fatty acids and the lowest proportion of unsaturated fatty acids were also achieved by adding 10−1 mmol L−1 ferric iron to the growth medium. These findings may lead to a two-step process for lipid production from T. obliquus, in which biomass should be separated from the culture supplemented with 10−2 mmol L−1 ferric iron concentration to achieve the maximum algal biomass in the first step and then inoculated to the culture supplemented with 10−1 mmol L−1 ferric iron concentration to reach the highest lipid productivity in the second step, leading to optimization of lipid production from T. obliquus. Although the quality of biodiesel produced from T. obliquus met the specification of the European biodiesel standard (EN14214) in all media, ferric iron supplementation could be used to optimize the lipid characteristics of T. obliquus for biodiesel production. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Although the methanolysis of microalgae oil for biodiesel preparation was studied previously, the ethanolysis for the combined production of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs, also can be used as biodiesel) and the ethyl esters of PUFAs (an important health-care product) rarely reported. In this work, a novel two-step process, hydrolysis of microalgae oil followed by lipase-mediated ethanolysis, was developed for the synthesis of FAEEs and the ethyl ester of PUFAs. The hydrolysis was firstly performed and the generated free fatty acids was collected and further used for FAEEs synthesis catalyzed by lipase. For lipase-catalyzed ethanolysis, the adding strategy of methanol, molecular sieve dosage, lipase dosage and temperature had significant influence on the FAEE yield. Under the optimized conditions, a FAEE yield of 97% could be obtained. Novozym435 was found to be equally effective for catalyzing the ethanolysis of conventional free fatty acids and PUFAs. The combined effects of multiple factors on the ethanolysis was further studied using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Validation statistical analysis suggested that the negative correlation existed between FAEE yield and the water content. This work provided a novel strategy to produce FAEEs and the ethyl esters of PUFA effectively with microalgae oil as the substrate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An innovative cascade deoxygenation concept coupling the thermal pyrolysis of lignocellulose with two consecutive (acidic and basic) catalytic beds in a single reactor has been developed. Thereby, thermal pyrolysis vapors produced by pyrolysis of acid-washed wheat straw have been upgraded by combining an acidic ZrO2-supported ZSM-5 zeolite and a basic K-grafted USY zeolite, both being prepared in technical form by extrusion with attapulgite binder. Investigation of the different coupling alternatives has shown that the most efficient strategy relies on passing the pyrolysis vapors first by the acid catalyst followed by the basic one in a fixed-bed reactor arrangement. In this way, an enhanced degree of bio-oil deoxygenation is achieved since the K/USY catalyst promotes the occurrence of both aldol condensation and ketonization reactions, thus leading to further bio-oil upgrading by removal of oxygen in the form of CO2 and H2O while affording the formation of C-C bonds. Moreover, this second basic catalyst promotes the further conversion of the oligomers still present in the bio-oil. Accordingly, the sequential integration of the two catalytic systems leads to a clear synergetic effect, improving the efficiency of the bio-oil deoxygenation process and affording the production of liquid organic fractions with oxygen content as low as 12 wt % and energy yield of 32% regarding the raw lignocellulosic biomass.

AB  - Background: To produce second-generation biofuels, enzymatic catalysis is required to convert cellulose from lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. β-Glucosidases finalize the process by hydrolyzing cellobiose into glucose, so the efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis largely depends on the quantity and quality of these enzymes used during saccharification. Accordingly, to reduce biofuel production costs, new microbial strains are needed that can produce highly efficient enzymes on a large scale. Results: We heterologously expressed the fungal β-glucosidase D2-BGL from a Taiwanese indigenous fungus Chaetomella raphigera in Pichia pastoris for constitutive production by fermentation. Recombinant D2-BGL presented significantly higher substrate affinity than the commercial β-glucosidase Novozyme 188 (N188; K m = 0.2 vs 2.14 mM for p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside and 0.96 vs 2.38 mM for cellobiose). When combined with RUT-C30 cellulases, it hydrolyzed acid-pretreated lignocellulosic biomasses more efficiently than the commercial cellulase mixture CTec3. The extent of conversion from cellulose to glucose was 83% for sugarcane bagasse and 63% for rice straws. Compared to N188, use of D2-BGL halved the time necessary to produce maximal levels of ethanol by a semi-simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process. We upscaled production of recombinant D2-BGL to 33.6 U/mL within 15 days using a 1-ton bioreactor. Crystal structure analysis revealed that D2-BGL belongs to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3. Removing the N-glycosylation N68 or O-glycosylation T431 residues by site-directed mutagenesis negatively affected enzyme production in P. pastoris. The F256 substrate-binding residue in D2-BGL is located in a shorter loop surrounding the active site pocket relative to that of Aspergillus β-glucosidases, and this short loop is responsible for its high substrate affinity toward cellobiose. Conclusions: D2-BGL is an efficient supplement for lignocellulosic biomass saccharification, and we upscaled production of this enzyme using a 1-ton bioreactor. Enzyme production could be further improved using optimized fermentation, which could reduce biofuel production costs. Our structure analysis of D2-BGL offers new insights into GH3 β-glucosidases, which will be useful for strain improvements via a structure-based mutagenesis approach. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper describes the application of an artificial neural network, genetic algorithm and analytic network process-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution for the selection of the optimum fuel blend. A single-cylinder, constant-speed direct-injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW was used for exploratory analysis at different load conditions. Ten objectives–brake thermal efficiency, maximum rate of pressure rise, NOx, CO2, CO, HC, smoke, exhaust gas temperature, ignition delay and combustion delay were considered. The proposed ANN model is integrated with GA and the hybrid multi-criteria decision-making technique of ANP-TOPSIS to evaluate the optimum blend. First the ANN model was developed to predict the performance, combustion and emission parameters of the engine. A multi-layer perception network was used for non-linear mapping between input and output parameters. The performance of the ANN model is determined and shows the efficiency of the model to predict the performance, emission and combustion parameters, with a determination coefficient of 0.9627. Second, GA was used to determine the optimum load and blend based on the predicted ANN output parameter. Third, an approach based on the TOPSIS method was used for finding the best blend from the observed optimum parameters of GA. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper discusses a preliminary design and a techno-economic analysis of a process that produces liquid hydrocarbon fuels from biomass through a combined biochemical and thermochemical process. The biochemical component involves anaerobic digestion (AD) of the biomass's biodegradable portion to produce biogas. Biogas is purified by removing contaminants and upgraded to liquid hydrocarbon fuel in a biogas to liquid facility (BGTL) via thermochemical conversion route. The BGTL process involves two major steps: tri-reforming to produce syngas (a mixture of CO and H2), and, Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) to convert the syngas to a spectrum of hydrocarbons (synthetic crude). Separation and upgrading of the produced hydrocarbon mixture allows production of transportation fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel. In order to evaluate the economics of the combined process a detailed process modelling was carried out using Aspen Plus® software. Bench-scale experimental results served as the basis of modelling the BGTL section of the plant, while the AD portion of the plant is based on empirical models selected from the literature validated by comparison with experimental results. Recent bench scale tests in our lab were used to determine processing parameters (yield, temperature, and pressure) for the reforming and FTS conversion. A plant capable of processing 90,000 tonne year−1 of wet biomass feed was designed and analyzed using the model. Results of the economic analysis estimate that a breakeven cost of diesel of $1.30 L-1 is achievable without the consideration of charging tipping fees to accept the biomass feedstock. Sensitivity study shows that the economics are significantly affected by the fixed capital investment (FCI) and less so by the operating expenses and interest rate. In addition, tipping fees and biomass feedstock cost have a substantial effect on the breakeven price of diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae has attracted great interest as a thermal conversion for biofuels. In an effort to understand the catalytic mechanism by which algae undergoes HTL in the presence of HZSM-5, the different roles of the major components (carbohydrates and proteins) were investigated. Glucose and glutamic acid were selected as model compounds of carbohydrates and proteins, respectively. Glucose, glutamic acid, and their binary mixtures were processed under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of HZSM-5 over a temperature range of 220–330 °C. The products were analyzed using a combination of elemental analysis (EA), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to characterize the physicochemical properties. The effects of HZSM-5 on the yield and quality of bio-oil were investigated. Results indicated that the addition of HZSM-5 did not significantly affect the bio-oil yield of glutamic acid but increased the bio-oil yields from glucose and their binary mixtures. The hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio and the higher heating values (HHVs) of the bio-oils were all greatly increased in the presence of HZSM-5. The addition of HZSM-5 reduced the contents of undesirable oxygenated compounds, nitrogenous compounds, and increased the hydrocarbon content. Maillard reactions between glucose and glutamic acid were also strengthened by HZSM-5. © 2019

AB  - Butyrate is an important precursor for fine chemicals and biofuels. The aim of this study is to investigate butyrate production as affected by transition metal addition of food waste fermentation including, nickel, Raney nickel and copper particles. Performance of fermentation showed nickel particles achieved the highest butyrate concentration, 7.3 g/L, which was 38.5% higher than that in the control trial. Raney nickel also showed similar effect on the enhancement of butyrate production. However, increased dosage of transition metal particle addition led to decreased butyrate production. The theoretical link between metal-assisted dark fermentation and butyrate production was tentatively explored. Redox potential affected by nickel addition was assumed to be an essential factor for butyrate production. Microbial community analysis found Clostridium sensu stricto 11 may be the dominant functional species for butyrate production. The study demonstrates that development on transition metal catalyst may contribute to waste biorefinery for added value products/energy production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aviation industry continues to grow, and consequently, more fuel is needed. With the intention of decarbonising the aviation sector, sustainable routes that have the potential to mitigate emissions, such as biomass fast pyrolysis, can positively contribute to this direction. Within this context, the present study performs a comparative techno-economic evaluation of aviation biofuel manufacture via the main bio-oil upgrading pathways, namely, hydroprocessing (HP), gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (G+FT), and zeolite cracking (ZC). The research constitutes the first endeavour to investigate and compare the feasibility of producing biojet fuel via pyrolysis-based routes. The presented work provides an inclusive evaluation that comprises process modelling and financial assessment. Based on the simulations, overall energy efficiencies of 48.8%, 45.73%, and 45.38% and jet fuel energy efficiencies of 23.70%, 21.45%, and 20.53% were calculated, while the implementation of a discounted cash flow analysis estimated minimum jet fuel selling prices (MJSPs) of 1.98, 2.32, and 2.21 $/L for the HP, the G+FT, and the ZC, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the processes are capital and feedstock intensive while an increase to the bio-oil yield will favour the economic performance of the examined biorefineries. An increase of the plant size from 100 (base case) to 150 dry tonnes per hour of feedstock will decrease the selling prices by approximately 25% for all cases. Monte Carlo simulations exhibited that without establishing and/or maintaining appropriate policy schemes, there is no pragmatic prospect for the examined biorefineries to beat the competition against the prevailing oil infrastructures. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, an experimental investigation was conducted to study the influence of adding aluminum oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3) with different average particle sizes as additive to blends of diesel and waste plastic oil (WPO) on performance, emission, and combustion attributes of single-cylinder diesel engine operated at a constant speed. Two samples of Al2O3 nanoparticle with average particle sizes of 20 and 100 nm were dispersed into a WPO20 blend containing 20% of WPO and 80% of diesel in the mass fractions of 10 and 20 ppm using ultrasonic stabilization. The experimental recordings revealed a decrease in engine performance and increase in all emission constituents while replacing diesel with WPO20. However, the addition of both 20- and 100-nm-sized Al2O3 nanoparticles into WPO20 was found to enhance the brake thermal efficiency (BTHE) by 12.2 and 8.9% respectively and decrease the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 11 and 8% respectively. The emission constituents such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitric oxide (NO), and smoke opacity were minimized by the addition of both 20- and 100-nm-sized nanoparticles into WPO20 blend. However, the reduction of emissions was better for 20-nm-sized particles compared with that of 100-nm-sized particles. The combustion attributes such as cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR), and rate of pressure rise (RPR) were raised with shortened ignition delay (ID) by the addition of both sized nanoparticles. Overall, the inclusion of 20-nm-sized nanoparticles performs better catalytic activity to enhance the engine output characteristics along with minimum exhaust emissions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study the development of a biofuel cell for potential application in microfluidics is described. The biocatalysts support is produced through vacuum-filtration of a Vulcan carbon black suspension resulting in flexible, paper-like electrodes. The glucose oxidase bioanode was assembled using an enzyme precipitate coating procedure whereas the biocathode was implemented by attaching bilirubin oxidase enzyme onto the carbon black surface via a pyrene intermediate. The bioelectrodes were first characterized by voltammetry and by chronoamperometry on their sensing ability towards the respective substrates, namely glucose and oxygen. Finally, bioanode and biocathode were integrated in a single-compartment of a heterogeneous poly (methyl methacrylate) - polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic platform and the power density produced was assessed. In 10 mM glucose solution at pH 7.0, the biofuel cell showed an open circuit potential (OCP) of 0.43 V and a maximum power density of about 28 μW cm−2 at 0.24 V. Also we demonstrate here the viability of human propelled fluidics by introducing in the microfluidic device a finger-pressure mechanism. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alkali lignin, which is derived from the pulping and paper-making process, has been recognized to have great potential in the preparation of chemicals and value-Added renewable biofuels. In this report, saturated steam was applied simultaneously, a novelty procedure, to assist in lower-Temperature pyrolysis (from 275 to 350 °C) of alkali lignin and selective production of guaiacol components in a fixed-bed reactor. The results indicated that the lower-Temperature pyrolysis displayed a positive effect on the breaking of aliphatic C-O bonds of lignin (β-O-4 bond) and helped to increase the intensity of oxygenated aromatic carbons and aromatic Câ C structures. The guaiacol components were successfully removed from alkali lignin and extracted by saturated steam. This method displayed a useful effect on pyrolysis of lignin and on higher selectivity of guaiacol components. A relatively higher yield of stable solid carbon (from 68.45 to 88.67 wt %) and relative selectivity of guaiacol components (from 79 to 90.7%) were obtained. This novel method is quite a promising technique for simultaneous pretreatment of lignin and selective production of guaiacol components. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sol–gel Ru/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ru-Co/SiO2 catalysts were prepared for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) hydrogenation to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). Catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, TPR, TEM, and XPS. Reactions were run with catalysts that were reduced at 500 °C for 1 h. Reaction time, temperature and hydrogen pressure effects were studied for hydrogenation. In the presence of both Ru and Co, the easier reduction was observed at Ru-Co/SiO2 catalyst. Although no DMF yield was observed with Ru/SiO2 and Co/SiO2, 96% DMF was obtained at 180 °C, under 15 bar H2 pressure for 2 h. Moreover &gt;99.9% DMF yield was achieved with Ru-Co/SiO2 at 120 °C for 8 h and at 140 °C for 4 h, respectively. DMF yield did not change significantly after third use, however deactivation was observed after fifth use of catalyst. It may be attributed to oxidation of cobalt active sites during recycle runs.

AB  - Methanol and ethanol are among the most important biofuels and raw materials used to produce biorenewable fuels. These fuels are used with varying water contents. Nevertheless, the exact impact of the water content of these fuels on the energy potential and combustion characteristics is still unknown. Besides that, there are two noticeable risks (environmental impact of combustion and fire risk) associated with their production, processing, and utilization. Likewise, impact of the water content of these fuels on fire risk and the impact of their combustion on the environment is also unknown. The best indicator of energy potential is the effective heat of combustion, and the best combustion characteristic and indicator of the impact of the combustion of alcohols on the environment is the carbon monoxide (CO) yield, whereas the fire risk of liquid fuels is quantified by the flash point and maximum heat release rate (mHRR). The dependency of flash point on the water content was determined via the Pensky-Martens apparatus and the dependencies of the effective heat of combustion, CO yield, and mHRR on the water content were determined via the cone calorimeter. With increased water content, the flash points of both methanol and ethanol exponentially increased and the both effective heat of combustion and mHRR almost linearly decreased. In the range of water content from 0 to 60%, the CO yield of both methanol and ethanol was practically independent of the water content. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Lignin is particularly recalcitrant for valorization via the existing pretreatment methods due to its complex cross-linking polymeric network. The aim of this study is to develop a novel integrated pretreatment strategy to exploit the potential of lignocellulosic biomass as resource for production of biofuels and aromatic chemicals. In this regard, a novel UV/TiO2/HCOOH reaction was proposed to systematically generate hydroxyl radical ([rad]OH) and carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2[rad]–) to depolymerize lignin. Usage of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran as a simple probe molecule showed cleavage β-O-4 linkage occurred via H abstraction mechanism. The addition of methyl viologen as CO2[rad]– scavengers proved the presence of CO2[rad]– in this UV/TiO2/HCOOH reaction. Lignin and wheat straw were used to investigate the effect of different parameters, including formic acid concentration and TiO2 dosage, on the efficiency of the reaction. At optimized conditions, the highest phenolic concentrations attained were 173.431 and 66.802 mg/g lignin and wheat straw, respectively. A cycle test was designed with the aim to favor the complete consumption of formic acid through more pretreatment cycles for producing the highest possible Total Phenolic Compounds (TPC) in the liquid phase. After the third consecutive cycle, 103.651 ± 5.964 mg-TPC/g, was obtained. Meanwhile it was found the remaining wheat straw solid fibers used for biogas production, showed 11.0% increase biogas production and increased degradation rate compared to the untreated wheat straw. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Residual biomass is a renewable resource with attractive characteristics to produce energy and biofuels. Diverse studies have stated that residual biomass used for biofuels and energy production can contribute partially to solve the energy demand problem, decreasing fossil fuels carbon emissions. Most works have focused on developing new technologies, processes, and processing systems based on biomass. Other works have addressed the supply chain-planning problem to determine optimal locations considering diverse objectives. A third group of works have proposed schemes based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to determine suitable locations in different types of systems. Nevertheless, works capable to combine the advantage of GIS, mathematical programming, and process design have not been properly conducted. Therefore, this paper presents a sequential approach for the optimal planning of a residual biomass processing system. The methodology considers selecting potential locations through a multicriteria methodology based on GIS. Also, this paper proposes a mathematical programming approach for the optimal planning of a residual biomass processing system, which considers as input the locations predefined by GIS methodology, as well as six potential products, six processing routes, and eight raw materials. The mathematical programming approach consists of mass balances to obtain the interconnections between the different supply chain nodes, as well as constraints to model the considered technologies involving capital investment and production costs. The GIS approach was applied to a case study in Mexico, which produced 764 harvesting sites and 334 processing plants for all considered residual biomass types. The optimization approach conducted used 33 processing plants, 467 harvesting sites, and 2 products from 3 biomass types in order to determine the final supply chain topology. Results show that the proposed methodology is a useful tool to determine the optimal supply chain topology during the decision process. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper deals with a performance evaluation of locally made 20L batch type reactor and JP and AM biodiesels produced by using this reactor. The inputs for transesterification process were Jatropha and Argemone Mexicana oils, with an alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, 1% NaOH catalyst, 55 °C reaction temperature, an hour settling time and 600 rpm agitation speed. The conversion ability of the reactor for Jatropha and Argemone Mexicana oil seeds has shown a 94% and 94.5%, respectively. The property of these biodiesels has analyzed and its result was within the limit of ASTM D6751. Performance and emission behavior of different blends of these oils such as B10, B20, B30 and pure diesel were evaluated in a single cylinder, four stroke CI engine with rated speed of 1500 rpm and rated power of 4 kW. The B10 blend has shown closer characteristics in terms of specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency and exhaust gas temperature at different loads to diesel. On the other hand, B10 has resulted with higher CO2 and CO and lower NOx emission potential compared to the two blends. The lower NO2 emission is due to its lowest exhaust gas temperature. The biodiesels finally pass standard tests of EPE by fulfilling the standard parameters that made them competitive and substitute options to diesel fuel. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The current work carted out of analysis on the production of fuel from pupae fat extracted from silkworm, and exhaustive investigations were conducted to determine the characteristics of obtained fuel and its blends. The oily organic compounds derived from silkworm is effectively adopted to produce biofuel. The soxhlet extractor is utilized here to separate the oil content from pupae and obtained oil processed into biofuel by undertaking the transesterification process using NaOH as a fast reactive agent along with methanol. The rate of biofuel derived from pupae oil has been noticed to be 65-70 by vol%. The extracted fuels from the transesterification process were mixed with high-speed diesel at a rate of B10, B20, B30 and B40 on volume base. The most important physical and chemical characteristics of generated fuel and their mixture with conventional diesel were examined. The investigation results reveal that the fuel sample B20 satisfies all the requirements of ASTM standards. Pure biofuel shows that the lesser heating value, higher KV, flash point, fire point and density than that of conventional diesel. The blended samples reveal that all the properties are keep moving towards higher value with an increasing percentage of biofuel presence except calorific value. Finally results in evidence that, well suitable biofuel can be generated from organic waste material like silkworm and effectively use it in practical applications. © BEIESP.

AB  - Microalgae biomass has gained considerable attention in recent years as an attractive feedstock for biofuel production. However, seasonal variability in algae growth presents a challenge to delivering a consistent feedstock supply to a conversion facility. Drying is one approach to preserving algae produced in productive summer months for conversion in winter, but is energy intensive and costly. Ensiling is an alternative to drying that preserves algae in wet anaerobic conditions in the presence of organic acids. We have previously demonstrated that dry matter loss of algae:corn stover blends can be limited to 8% over 35 days using this approach. However, longer storage durations will be required to maintain a consistent feedstock supply to a biorefinery. Furthermore, the impacts to biomass quality that occur during storage are unknown. A Box-Behnken design of experiment was conducted to determine the influence of moisture, soluble sugar, and algae content on dry matter loss of algae:corn stover blends in wet anaerobic storage over a 30-day period. Using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) moisture and soluble sugar content were found to significantly affect dry matter loss in storage. The results of experimental design were then used to inform the initiation of a 180 day storage study that evaluated the storage performance and biomass composition of algae:corn stover blends containing 5, 20 or 40% algae. After 180 days of storage dry matter loss ranged from 6 to 17%. A relative increase in nitrogen content of stored blends indicates that protein content was unaffected by storage, while the carbohydrate fraction was most impacted, decreasing by 5–15%. For each stored blend the oxygen content decreased in storage resulting increased higher heating values (HHV). The impact that changes to biochemical and elemental composition of algae:corn stover blends has on biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals is discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, Anabaena PCC 7120 microalgae is used as feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. Anabaena 7120 was cultivated in a closed photobioreactor. Oil was extracted by cell disruption process and purified by degumming process. Anabaena oil was characterized by GCMS spectroscopy. Barium titanium oxide (Ba2TiO4)heterogeneous catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation process and characterized through various techniques such as TGA, XRD, FTIR, HR-SEM, EDX and surface area analyzer. Basicity of synthesized catalyst was calculated by Hammett indicator titration method. The synthesized Ba2TiO4 was used in transesterification of Anabaena oil for biodiesel production and it was reused up to six cycles. The highest FAME conversion from anabaena oil was found to be 98.41% under optimized condition of 1:18 M ratio (oil:methanol), 3.5 wt% of catalyst loading and 180 min of reaction time at 65 °C temperature and 400 rpm stirring speed. © 2019

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL) has found wide applications as chemicals and biofuel additives. Efficient catalytic conversion of abundantly available glucose to ELs over solid acid catalyst having optimum Brønsted (B) and Lewis (L) acidity is highly appreciated. Present work demonstrated, direct one-step synthesis of EL from glucose over synergized Brønsted (H2Zr1PW12O40) and Lewis (Sn-Beta) acid catalyst. H2Zr1PW12O40 is prepared by exchanging H+ of tungstophosphoric acid (H3PW12O40-heteropolyacid) with Zr, improves the heterogeneity in polar medium by 50%. The combination of a physical mixture of H2Zr1PW12O40 + Sn-Beta with 80:20 weight ratio was found to be optimum for the maximum EL yield formation of 54% from glucose at 180°C for 3 h, which is probably the highest than reported over the heterogeneous catalyst in ethanol medium. An optimal combination of B and L catalyst and its ratio is found to be crucial for the direct transformation of glucose to EL in one step. The present study also explored that this combined physical mixture of H2Zr1PW12O40 + Sn-Beta can tolerate glucose concentration up to 30 g/L, which is probably the higher than reported. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The possibility to valorize levulinic acid (LA) dimers to lignocellulose-based biofuels via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) was assessed using γ-nonalactone (GNL) as a model compound. Catalytic HDO experiments were performed in a batch reactor at 280 °C and at an average pressure of 57.5 bar H2. Noble metal (Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt) catalysts supported on ZrO2. All the catalysts were active in removing oxygen from the reactant. However, the most selective catalyst for hydrocarbons (24%) was ruthenium. Unlike the other tested catalysts, Ru also provided branched hydrocarbons. In view of Ru’s comparatively high selectivity to hydrocarbons, it was tested at various reaction temperatures (220–280 °C) for 300 min. The experiments at lower temperatures resulted in less hydrocarbons and more intermediate products, such as alcohols. In total, nearly 70 products were identified, and some of the reactions that likely occurred in the HDO experiments were discussed. The production of hydrocarbons from GNL highlights the potential of LA dimers as a route to lignocellulose-based biofuels. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Carbon efficiency of a biomass to liquid process can be increased from ca. 30 to more than 90% by adding hydrogen generated from renewable power. The main reason is that in order to increase the H2/CO ratio after gasification to the value required for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, the water gas shift reaction step can be avoided; instead a reversed water gas shift reactor is introduced to convert produced CO2 to CO. Process simulations are done for a 46 t/h FT biofuel production unit. Previous results are confirmed, and it is shown how the process can be further improved. The effect of changing the H2/CO ratio to the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactors is studied with the use of three different kinetic models. Keeping the CO conversion in the reactors constant at 55%, the volume of the reactors decreases with increasing H2/CO ratio because the reaction rates increase with the partial pressure of hydrogen. Concurrently, the production of C5+ products and the consumption of hydrogen increases. However, the power required per extra produced liter fuel also increases pointing at optimum conditions at a H2/CO feed ratio significantly lower than 2. The trends are the same for all three kinetic models, although one of the models is less sensitive to the hydrogen partial pressure. Finally, excess renewable energy can be transformed to FT syncrude with an efficiency of 0.8–0.88 on energy basis. © 2019

AB  - The saturated hydrocarbon bisabolane is a diesel fuel substitute that can be derived from sesquiterpene precursors bisabolene or curcumene. These sesquiterpenes are generated from farnesyl diphosphate in reactions catalyzed by eponymous terpenoid cyclases, but they can also be generated by engineered terpenoid cyclases in which cyclization cascades have been reprogrammed by mutagenesis. Here, we describe the X-ray crystal structure determination of F95Q epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS), in which the new activity of curcumene biosynthesis has been introduced and the native activity of epi-isozizaene biosynthesis has been suppressed. F95Q EIZS generates β- and γ-curcumene regioisomers with greater than 50% yield. Structural analysis of the closed active site conformation, stabilized by the binding of 3 Mg2+ ions, inorganic pyrophosphate, and the benzyltriethylammonium cation, reveals a product-like active site contour that serves as the cyclization template. Remolding the active site contour to resemble curcumene instead of epi-isozizaene is the principal determinant of the reprogrammed cyclization cascade. Intriguingly, an ordered water molecule comprises part of the active site contour. This water molecule may also serve as a final proton acceptor, along with inorganic pyrophosphate, in the generation of curcumene regioisomers; it may also contribute to the formation of sesquiterpene alcohols identified as minor side products. Thus, the substitution of polar side chains for nonpolar side chains in terpenoid cyclase active sites can result in the stabilization of bound water molecules that, in turn, can serve template functions in isoprenoid cyclization reactions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Coniochaeta hoffmannii was isolated from soils contaminated with biscuit factory wastes showed the maximum lipid accumulation capacity in the study. Lipid production was optimized in terms of pH, carrot pomace loading, nitrogen type and amount, incubation time. Solvent, alcohol type and catalyst concentration, dried/wet biomass concentration, reaction approaches and time were optimized for lipid extraction and transesterification. The highest lipid accumulation was found as 52.0% at pH 4 in the presence of 10% carrot pomace, 0.5 g/L cheese whey at the end of the 48 h incubation. The maximum total C16 and C18 FAME rates were detected at the 25 °C, in the presence of 4 g/L dried C. hoffmannii biomass, methanol and 3% NaOH by using the in-situ transesterification process at the end of the 0.5 h as 96.3%. This is the first report about the usage of C. hoffmannii lipids obtained from carrot pomace for sustainable biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The utilization of bio-surfactant rhamnolipid (RL) modified magnetic CaFe-layered double hydroxides (RL-LDH) was successfully carried out to enhance the enzymatic saccharification and ethanol production of Artemisia ordosica (AO). The RL-LDH pretreatment could effectively improve enzymatic hydrolysis of AO. The ethanol yield reached 167.4 mg/g (the reducing sugar yield achieved 540.3 mg/g) when pretreatment pH was 9, RL-LDH to AO mass ratio was 1.5:1, pretreatment time was 1 h, enzymatic hydrolysis temperature was 50 °C, cellulase loading was 50 FPU/g, and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) time was 120 h. RL-LDH could stabilize the enzymes and yeast, resulting in increased the reducing sugar and ethanol yields and decreased conversion costs of biofuel. Furthermore, the conversion yields were still higher than that of control group (without RL-LDH) after the RL-LDH was used for 5 times repeatedly. Therefore, utilization of recyclable RL-LDH is promising for future applications in enzymatic hydrolysis and fuel conversion of biomass. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: The use of nickel-based catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils is an alternative to employing systems based on noble metals and sulfided hydrotreatment catalysts. Modifying nickel hydrodeoxygenation catalysts with molybdenum and copper increases the yield of target reaction products and the resistance of catalytic systems to the effect of an aggressive medium. The aim of this work is to determine the dependence between the temperature, contact time, and activity of modified nickel-containing catalyst in the hydrodeoxygenation of esters of fatty carboxylic acids and determine the effective kinetic parameters for the consumption of the reagent. The experiments are performed in a continuous flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed at $${{P}_{{{{{\text{H}}}_{2}}}}}$$ = 0.25 MPa, temperatures of 270, 285, 300, and 315°C, and a contact time varying from 600 to 1800 s. The results show the selectivity toward the main reaction products (nonane and decane) remains the same when either the temperature of experiment or the contact time are varied. Experimental data are used to determine the effective rate constant and energy of activation of ester consumption. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The ever increasing utilization of energy has resulted in the nation becoming progressively more dependent on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas. The mounting prices of crude oil and natural gas and their impending paucity have raised qualms about the security of energy supply in future, which has severe consequence on the augmentation of a countries economy. The alternative to fossil fuels are the non-conventional energy sources, they are plentiful, renewable, pollution-free and eco-friendly. Therefore, the need to utilize renewable energy sources like solar energy, wind, tide, biodiesel has publicized its significance. Biodiesel is one of the unsurpassed resources that have come to the cutting edge recently. In this article, highly rated research journals on biofuels were referred and a detailed assessment has been conducted to emphasize different aspects to biodiesel engineering. These aspects include biodiesel feed stocks, a range of various methods used in production of biodiesel such as pyrolysis, micro emulsion, dilution and transesterification (alcoholysis). The study was extended to understand the effect of biodiesel blend magnitude on the performance of engine parameters such as brake power (BP), brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and fuel properties like cloud point, flash point, calorific value, kinematic viscosity, density, and cetane number as well as the economic viability, emission characteristics and finally Greenhouse gas emissions. © BEIESP.

AB  - The main challenge to the wider use of biodiesel as a transport fuel has been its high cost of production. Studies have been performed to obtain the cheapest methods for biodiesel production. The calcium oxide catalyzed transesterification reaction has shown better performance for fuel-grade biodiesel from cheaper feedstock. In this study, a calcium oxide catalyzed biodiesel production process is designed in four different scenarios based on different possible arrangements of the downstream processes. The process flow diagrams of the different scenarios were designed using Aspen Plus and Super Pro software. These process simulations were used to evaluate the techno-economic performance of the process scenarios. Technical performance was been evaluated based on the quantity and quality of the biodiesel and glycerol produced, the amount of biodiesel produced per amount of feedstock consumed, and the amount of other valuable byproducts. Similarly, the economic performance of the process scenarios has also been assessed using parameters such as total investment cost, unit production cost, net present value, internal rate of return, payback time, and return on investment. Each of these four scenarios was divided into two production capacity levels to investigate the effect of change in production capacity on the economic feasibility of the process scenarios. The scenario with consecutive centrifugations for glycerol and soap separation, and distillation for biodiesel purification, evidenced poor technical performance, whereas the double reactor scenario provided more, and better quality, product, and the economic feasibility of this scenario was good when the oil supply rate was above 4600 kg h−1. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production depends to a great extent on the use of cheap raw materials, since biodiesel itself is a mass product, not a high-value product. New processing methods, such as micro-flow continuous processing combined with enzymatic catalysis, open doors to the latter. As reported here, the window of opportunity in enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel production is the conversion of waste cooking oil. The main technological challenge for this is to obtain efficient immobilization of the lipase catalyst on beads. The beads can be filled into tubular reactors where designed packed-bed provide porous channels, forming micro-flow. It turns out, that in this way, the immobilization costs become the decisive economic factor. This paper reports a solution to that issue. The use of oil cake enables economic viability, which is not given by any of the commercial polymeric substrates used so far for enzyme immobilization. The costs of immobilization are mirrored in the earnings and cash flow of the new biotechnological process. © 2019

AB  - This paper reports the effects of changes in the supported active phase concentration over titania containing mixed oxides catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Mo and CoMo supported on sol–gel Al2 O3 –TiO2 (Al/Ti = 2) were synthetized and tested for the HDO of phenol in a batch reactor at 5.5 MPa, 593 K, and 100 ppm S. Characterization results showed that the increase in Mo loading led to an increase in the amount of oxide Mo species with octahedral coordination (MoOh), which produced more active sites and augmented the catalytic activity. The study of the change of Co concentration allowed prototypes of the oxide species and their relationship with the CoMo/AT2 activity to be described. Catalysts were tested at four different Co/(Co + Mo) ratios. The results presented a correlation between the available fraction of CoOh and the catalytic performance. At low CoOh fractions (Co/(Co + Mo) = 0.1), Co could not promote all MoS2 slabs and metallic sites from this latter phase performed the reaction. Also, at high Co/(Co + Mo) ratios (0.3 and 0.4), there was a loss of Co species. The Co/(Co + Mo) = 0.2 ratio presented an optimum amount of available CoOh and catalytic activity since the XPS results indicated a higher concentration of the CoMoS phase than at a higher ratio. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Renewable energies can play an important role reversing the current fossil fuels dependence. Among these, biomass is finding more uses consolidating itself as the energy of the future. Current trend is focused on the manufacture of new blends able to achieve a better use of this biomass. The aim of this paper was to assess the potential as fuel of a series of blends consisting of wheat straw and poplar wood fertilized in organic way. Different poplar clones were fertilized with two organic amendments derived from sewage plants. Thus, the effect of clones and fertilization on the thermal behavior of the blends was studied. For this purpose, fuel and thermogravimetric analysis as well as combustion characteristic indexes were used. Results denoted acceptable fuel analysis values. Thermogravimetric profiles showed three mass losses related to volatiles (550 K and 650 K) and char (700 K) liberation. The greatest mass release for blends occurred for the first stage. In particular, the blend consisting of AF8 poplar clone without fertilizer together with straw was the one that experienced this greater release. In the same way, thermal indexes warned of better thermal behavior when fertilizer was not applied; being, again, the blend mentioned above, the one that achieved the best indexes values. Thus, fertilization decreased the thermal performance of wheat straw–poplar wood blends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microfluidic technology offers high interfacial area particularly in the multiphase reaction such as transesterification process to produce biodiesel. Methanol-to-oil molar ratio is one of the important parameters to enhance the biodiesel production. However, very few in literature are focusing on the hydrodynamic effect that is caused by the molar ratio accurately. In this study, stable and highly consistent droplet-slug flow inside a microchannel was generated using a T-junction to investigate the impact of hydrodynamic factor on the reaction. High molar ratio creates high interfacial area and number of droplets, hence resulting in the highest conversion of oil. This finding has revealed that it is possible to obtain 98% oil conversion at room temperature and relatively short reaction time of 80 s. It demonstrates that microchannel reactor has high potential for intensified process in the production of biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Because of the substantially high growth rate, algae have become a prominent biomass feedstock to produce biofuels and renewable chemicals leading to research on cost-competitive means to cultivate and convert algal biomass. Wastewater effluent streams provide the necessary water and nutrient inputs for algal growth, however, the low lipid, high ash composition of algal solids produced are not ideal for conventional conversion techniques. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a holistic algal conversion method that utilizes subcritical water to produce biocrude and high-valued solid product from wastewater-cultivated algal solids. The objective of this study was to understand how calcium, the primary inorganic element of wastewater-cultivated algal solids, affects the final HTL products. The calcium concentration was varied in six algal growth tanks and the algae was harvested via high pH induced-flocculation. The algal biomass was then processed using HTL at 350 °C for 1 h. Calcium carbonate was the primary crystalline structure observed in the algal and HTL solids. One HTL solid sample showed a significant production of tricalcium phosphate. The higher calcium concentrations resulted in near 100% capture of phosphorus in the HTL solids. Increasing the calcium content also had a positive impact on the biocrude including the H/C ratio, amide, alkene, and carboxylic acid content. The results of this study suggest that the inorganic solids collected from high pH, flocculated harvesting may have an in-situ catalytic impact on the biocrude. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Furfural derived from biomass hemicelluloses is an important intermediate for biofuels and chemicals. In order to further upgrade, furfural is usually reduced into 2-methyl furan that is more stable and useful. In this work, furfural was reduced by CuZnAl, CuMgAl, Cu2Cr2O5, CuNiAl as catalysts in a supercritical methanol without external H2 source. The best yield of 2-methyl furan was achieved among the H2 free furfural process reported as high as 74%. And the catalytic behaviors were discussed under different catalysts and temperatures conditions. © 2019, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

AB  - In this work, an effective catalytic route for the selective hydrogenolysis of renewable biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high quality bio-fuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) was reported using Ru supported on ZrO2-MCM-41. The synthesized Ru supported on ZrO2-MCM-41 catalyst was characterized by different techniques such as XRD, BET surface area, XPS, SEM, TEM, EDX, TGA and TPD. Reaction parameters, like time, metal loading on ZrO2-MCM-41, catalyst loading, temperature, H2 pressure and solvent, were optimized for the conversion of HMF to DMF using prepared catalyst. The investigation performed in this study shows that Ru supported on ZrO2-MCM-41 is highly active and selective catalyst for effective transformation of the HMF into DMF in high yield and selectivity. With the use of 2 wt % Ru-ZrO2-MCM-41 catalyst, 90% yield of DMF was obtained from HMF with very short reaction time of 1 h. The catalyst was recycled upto six time with slight decrease in yield after 4th cycle. A direct conversion of Fructose to DMF was also achieved in 53% yield using Amberlyst-15 and 2%Ru-ZrO2-MCM-41 combined catalyst in n-butanol. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - We have performed a comparative analysis of the bio-oil produced by thermal liquefaction of microalgae in different solvents using high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and GC-MS approach. Water, methanol, ethanol, butanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, toluene, and hexane were used as solvents in which the liquefaction was performed. It was observed that all resulting oils demonstrate a considerable degree of similarity. For all samples, compounds containing 1 and 2 nitrogen atoms dominated in the positive ESI spectra, while a relative contribution of other compounds was small. In negative ESI mode, compounds having 2 to 7 oxygens were observed. Statistical analysis revealed that products can be combined in two groups depending on the solvent used for the liquefaction. To the first group, we can attribute the products obtained by using protic (alcohols) and to the second by using aprotic (acetonitrile, toluene) solvents. Nevertheless, based on our results, we concluded that solvent possesses a minor impact on molecular composition of bio-oil. We suggested that the driving force of the liquefaction reaction is the thermal dehydration of the carbohydrate in algae, resulting in water formation, which could be the trigger of the producing of bio-oil. To prove this hypothesis, we performed the reaction with the dry algae in the absence of the solvent and observed the formation of bio-oil.

AB  - Background: Butyric fermentation and a substantial loss of dry matter (DM) often occur in alfalfa silage during the rainy season, which is not conducive to subsequent biofuel production. Currently, there have been negative effects on the combination of cellulases and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on processing high-moisture alfalfa silage; however, transgenically engineered LAB strains that secrete cellulase have been proposed as an alternative approach to avoid the above problem. The objective of the present study was to construct engineered Lactococcus lactis strains with high-efficiency secretory-expressing cellulase genes from Trichoderma reesei and to investigate the effects of the combination of transgenically engineered L. lactis strains HT1/pMG36e-usp45-bgl1, HT1/pMG36e-usp45-cbh2, and HT1/pMG36e-usp45-egl3 (HT2) on fermentation quality, structural carbohydrate degradability and nonstructural carbohydrate fermentation kinetics of high-moisture alfalfa silage treated without additive as a negative control (Control), or/and with cellulase (EN), wild-type L. lactis subsp. lactis MG1363 (HT1) and the combination of HT1 and EN (HT1 + EN) as positive additive controls. Results: Engineered L. lactis strains were successfully constructed and efficiently secreted endoglucanase (1118 mU/mL), cellobiohydrolase (222 mU/mL), and β-glucosidase (131 mU/mL) and had high filter paper activity (236 mU/mL). Ensiling experiments verified that HT2 obtained the highest fermentation quality score (83.6) and most efficiently processed high-moisture alfalfa silage, demonstrated by a low pH (4.49) and ammonia-N content (106 g/kg nitrogen) and a high lactic acid content (67.1 g/kg DM) and without butyric acid. Change curves of structural carbohydrates revealed that HT2 degraded more lignocelluloses, demonstrated by the lowest contents of neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, cellulose and hemicellulose after ensiling for 60 days. Kinetic analysis showed that the most residual water-soluble carbohydrates, glucose, fructose and xylose generated by lignocellulose degradation were produced by HT2, followed by HT1 + EN. The HT2-treated silages had the highest DM recovery, had the fewest Clostridia spores, emitted a fragrance and were not sticky. Conclusion: HT2 improved the conversion of lignocellulose to sugars and processed high-moisture alfalfa silage efficiently. This is a novel strategy that can be used to enhance lignocellulosic degradation in high-moisture alfalfa via a bioprocess with transgenically engineered L. lactis strains, which could enhance the development of alfalfa as a biomass feedstock and promote second-generation biofuel development in the rainy season. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Gaseous fuel as a combustion enhancer with a pilot fuel offers significant benefits in improving engine efficiency. Hydrogen and hydroxy are the two most common gaseous fuels that have been widely investigated in the CI engine but which one performs best is still inconvenient. In this study, hydrogen and hydroxy were injected with BD40 (v/v) separately in a common diesel engine to compare the performance and emission characteristics of these fuels. Engine performance parameters include brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC), and exhaust emissions include hydrocarbon (HC), CO, CO 2 , NOx, and smoke opacity. The induction of both hydroxy and hydrogen with BD40 has a positive effect on engine performance and emissions except NOx when compared to neat diesel fuel and BD40. The BTE of hydroxy-rich BD40 increased by 7.2% while BSEC reduced by 7.6% as compared to BD40 with hydrogen. The CO, HC, and smoke opacity of hydroxy-operated engine was found to be better than hydrogen-inducted engine. The NOx emission increased with the induction of both gaseous fuels and hydroxy-enriched BD40 produced 12.5% more emission than hydrogen-operated BD40 engine. Thus, more concisely, hydroxy-operated biodiesel engine performed better than hydrogen engine in terms of BTE, BSEC, CO, HC, and smoke opacity. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Perovskite BaZrO3 was synthesised via a relatively mild solid-state reaction route by using nitrate precursors. Thermal behaviour, the presence of crystalline phases and functional groups, specific surface area, microstructural characteristics, elemental composition, and basic strength of the synthesised material was examined. Further, the partial ionic exchange of Ba ions in BaZrO3 was attempted to synthesise Cs modified BaZrO3. Characterisation results revealed the synthesis of phase pure and strongly basic materials. BaZrO3 was tested as a transesterification catalyst for the synthesis of biodiesel. Transesterification reaction variables for BaZrO3 catalysed transesterification were optimised using response surface methodology based Box-Behnken designing approach. Under the suggested optimal conditions the predicted conversion was 94.12%, and the experimentally determined conversion of 93.2 ± 0.3% confirmed the validity of the generated quadratic model. Cs modification of BaZrO3 enhanced its basic strength. Under the optimised conditions for pristine BaZrO3, the effect of Cs modification on BaZrO3 was assessed, and it led to a conversion of 97.27 ± 0.4%. Both the materials were effective in catalysing the transesterification of M. pinnata oil, however; only Cs-BaZrO3 catalysed oil met the EN 14214:2003 specification for minimum ester content in biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increased NOx emission from usage of biodiesel is a burning issue to be dealt with. Many techniques have been adopted to reduce NOx emissions from diesel engines. The present experimental study deals with the analysis of performance and emission characteristics of Cotton Seed oil biodiesel with the addition of natural antioxidant extract of clove. FTIR analysis characterized the antioxidant by the presence of hydroxyl groups denoted by the corresponding wave number. The oxidation stability of the test samples was determined in terms of induction period by means of Rancimat test. The induction periods of the test fuel samples B100, B20, B20+CL1000, and B20+CL2000 were found to be 2.20 h, 2.73 h, 10.19 h, and 11.12 h, respectively. Thus, the addition of Clove antioxidant increased the oxidation stability of the biodiesel. Results show that the addition of antioxidant to biodiesel blend has increased the Brake Thermal Efficiency to a maximum of 4.71% and decreased the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption to a maximum of 6.25% at full-load conditions compared to Cotton Seed biodiesel blend. The addition of Clove extract antioxidant at a concentration of 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm decreases the NOx emission by 23.03% and 26.7%, respectively, at full-load conditions. However, CO emissions increased by 1.12% and 4.49% with the addition of CL1000 and CL2000 to B20, respectively. Similarly, HC emissions increased by 4.19% and 7.35% by the addition of CL1000 and CL2000 to B20, respectively. The increases in smoke with the addition of CL1000 and CL2000 to B20 were 42.48% and 47.71%, respectively. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Core oil palm trunk (COPT) is a lignocellulosic waste that poses as an alternative carbon source in bio-chemical and bio-fuel production. The bulk of free sugar present in its sap renders COPT as a potential starting material in the synthesis of methyl levulinate (ML). In this study, the effect of different sap extractions on COPT and synthesised methyl levulinate respectively was analysed. COPT sap was extracted using two different methods of blending and pressing, followed by the methanolysis reaction. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) results for both extraction methods have revealed that glucose is the primary sugar found in the sap. However, the total sugar concentration obtained from the pressing extraction method was found to be higher at 22.14 g/L, compared to blending extraction method at 20.23 g/L. Meanwhile, synthesized methyl levulinate was identified from the methanolysis of COPT sap in all type of catalysts (i.e. 0.5 M HCl, 1 M HCl, 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 and 1 M H 2 SO 4 ). It is worth noting that the isolated and highest concentration of methyl levulinate was obtained when catalysed by 1 M H 2 SO 4 and can be clearly seen on the NMR spectrum. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Second-generation biodiesel manufactured from waste cooking oils (WCO) and inedible animal fats (AF) are one of the alternatives to the first generation (1G) vegetable oil-based biodiesel. In this study, a quality control method is proposed to evaluate methanol content in waste fat methyl esters and is based on near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) combined with multivariate analysis. More specifically, calibration models are constructed using partial least squares regression (PLS) for the prediction of methanol content in rapeseed oil methyl ester (ROME), waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME), chicken fat methyl ester (CFME) and pork fat methyl ester (PFME) by Vis-NIR spectrometer. The calibration models are based on the absorbance spectra and computed data from five wavelength regions of 400–2170 nm, 780–2170 nm, 1400–2170 nm, 1400–1600 nm and 1970–2170 nm. For the cases with the highest prediction ability obtained in this study, the coefficient of determination of the model's goodness-of-fit for methanol concentrations range 0–5% (v/v) was R2 &gt; 0.990, and for concentrations 0–1% (v/v) was R2 &gt; 0.994, indicating the spectroscopic approach effectiveness in methanol content detection relevant to the biofuel quality assessment. A pseudo-univariate limits of detection (LODpu) and quantification (LOQpu) as well as ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) were used to confirm the validity and to evaluate the practical applicability of developed models. In addition, the obtained results indicate the possibility of developing a transmission sensor for online monitoring of the production process and the quality of biofuel. © 2018

AB  - Two inorganic solids have been evaluated as supports of Lipozyme RM IM, a Rhizomucor miehei lipase immobilized on a macroporous anion exchange resin, in order to improve its application as a biocatalyst in the synthesis of biofuels. The experimental conditions have been optimized to get the selective transesterification of sunflower oil, by using a multi-factorial design based on the response surface methodology (RSM). In this way, the effects of several reaction parameters on the selective ethanolysis of triglycerides to produce Ecodiesel, a biodiesel-like biofuel constitute by one mole of monoglyceride (MG) and two moles of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE), have been evaluated. Thus, it was obtained that a 6:1 oil/ethanol molar ratio, 0.215 g of biocatalyst supported in silica-gel (0.015 g Lipase/0.2 g silica-gel), 50 µL of 10 N NaOH, together with previous optimized reaction parameters, 35 ◦ C reaction temperature and 120 min of reaction time, gave the best results (conversions around 70%; selectivity around 65%; kinematic viscosities about 9.3 mm 2 /s) in the reaction studied. Besides, Lipozyme RM IM, supported on silica-gel, biocatalyst exhibited a very good stability, remaining its activity even after 15 cycles. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass has attracted considerable attention as energy, economic, and environmental asset, as result of its abundance and range of properties. The use of mesoporous catalysts during fast pyrolysis has been a highly important route to improve efficiency as well adding value to biomass. The addition of titanium to molecular sieves increases the efficiency of the pyrolysis reaction by improving production and selectivity of products of interest. This study aims at analyzing the catalytic pyrolysis products of elephant grass using titanium catalysts prepared at different Si/Ti molar ratios, i.e., 25 and 50. The material was supported on MCM-41 for the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. The biomass pyrolysis reactions were performed in a micropyrolyzer coupled to a GC/MS analyzer. The Ti-MCM-41 samples were characterized by XRD, BET-specific area, and UV-visible. The distribution of pyrolysis products depended on process parameters such as temperature and catalyst type. The highest yield for hydrocarbon production, such as styrene, benzene, methylbenzene, and naphthalene, was observed at 600 °C using Si/Ti equal to 50. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Since industrial wastes are increasing, the development of studies to find ways for their use is urgent. Waste cooking oil is an important source for the production of biodiesel, one of the main biofuels in Brazil. However, during cooking, the oil undergoes conditions that change its properties and decrease its quality, such as its acidity value. Current research treats waste cooking oil by the adsorption process using rice husk, an agro-industrial waste, and activated carbon to compare results. The potential of the adsorbents to remove free fatty acids in waste cooking oil has been investigated by the batch technique, evaluating different operating conditions of temperature, adsorbent mass and agitation. Adsorbents were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The maximum result obtained for activated carbon at acidity reduction was 63%, using 22.4°C, 169.64 rpm and 3.39 g of adsorbent mass. Already, using the rice husk the percentage of removal was the same, 63% using 22.4°C, 80.36 rpm and 1.61 g of adsorbent, however in shorter times. The results prove that the application of the rice husk for this purpose is advantageous, for being a low-cost material, available on a large scale and that provide results similar to activated carbon. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the effect of unsaturation of the biodiesels obtained from grapeseed oil, wheat germ oil and coconut oil (reference fuel) for compression ignition (CI) engine application. Fatty acid profile analysis and physio-chemical properties were determined by standard test procedures. Engine testing was carried out in a 5.2-kW single-cylinder CI engine and the combustion, performance and emission characteristics were analysed. The effect of fuel property variation and the combustion reaction kinetics due to unsaturation difference have been discussed. The maximum brake thermal efficiency at full load for diesel was found to be 32.3% followed by 31.3%, 30.2% and 27.4 %, respectively, for coconut biodiesel (CBD), grapeseed biodiesel (GSBD) and wheat germ biodiesel (WGBD). Maximum heat release rate as observed for diesel, CBD, GSBD and WGBD are 63.2 J/°CA 60.7 J/°CA and 59 J/°CA and 43.4 J/°CA respectively. The brake-specific NO emission at full load is higher for CBD followed by GSBD, WGBD and diesel having values of 9.23 g/kWh, 8.91 g/kWh, 8.21 g/kWh and 7.6 g/kWh respectively. Conversely, the smoke emission is lower for CBD compared to the other tested fuels. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present work, a novel cellulose-based porous heterogeneous solid acid catalyst encapsulation of ferriferous oxide (Fe 3 O 4 ) and sulfonated graphene (GO-SO 3 H) into cellulose to form composite porous microspheres catalyst (GO-SO 3 H/CM@Fe 3 O 4 ) 　 was synthesized and evaluated for biodiesel production from Pistacia chinensis seed oil. The SEM, EDS and FTIR analysis revealed that the catalyst GO-SO 3 H/CM@Fe 3 O 4 owned stronger active sites and GO-SO 3 H dispersed well in porous surface and inside of cellulose support. Under the optimum conditions, microwave-assisted transesterification process was carried out with the best catalyst amount, i.e. 5 wt% GO-SO 3 H/CM@Fe 3 O 4 (weight ratio of GO-SO 3 H/cellulose), and conversion yield reached 94%. The prepared catalyst could be easily separated from reaction solution by extra magnetic field and reclaimed at least five runs. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The need to develop an alternative fuel to fossil fuel is growing day by day, especially for the transportation industry, as the supply of fossil fuels is limited and is depleting at a rapid rate. One available resource that has emerged recently is biodiesel. However, the usage of biodiesel is very low among transportation companies. An investigation into the barriers of adopting biodiesel by transportation companies is the focus of the present study. A survey of 147 transportation companies in Malaysia was undertaken, and the data gathered were analyzed using partial least squares technique. Lack of government support, lack of environmental-commercial benefits, and lack of competitive pressure were found to be the barriers to biodiesel adoption. The results also indicated that differentiation strategy moderates the impact of lack of government support, lack of customer demand, lack of environmental-commercial benefits and lack of competitive pressure on biodiesel adoption. The results of this study could benefit policy makers by providing them key focus areas in which they can modify their strategies to actively and successfully promote the use of biodiesel among transportation companies in developing countries. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Physicochemical properties of three biofuels suitable for combustion in automotive diesel engines were compared. Two samples represented commercial hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) with different low temperature properties, one sample represented traditional biodiesel, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). One HVO sample and FAME were blended into mineral diesel fuel to form two series of mixed fuels. One series represented mixed fuels containing 7, 20, 30, and 50 vol. % of HVO, the other series represented mixed fuels containing the same amount of FAME. All pure fuels as well as all prepared blends were then analyzed and evaluated. The composition and properties of HVO samples are discussed in detail as well as the influence of biocomponents on properties of mixed fuels. © 2019 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - Enzyme immobilization using nanomaterials offers new approaches to enhanced bioelectrochemical performance and is essential for the preparation of bioelectrodes with high reproducibility and low cost. In this report, we describe the development of new three-dimensional (3D) bioelectrodes by immobilizing a “bioink” of glucose oxidase (GOD) in a matrix of reduced graphene oxides (RGOs), polyethylenimine (PEI), and ferrocene carboxylic acid (FcCOOH) on carbon paper (CP). CP with 3D interwoven carbon fibers serves as a solid porous and electronically conducting skeleton, providing large surface areas and space for loading the bioink and diffusion of substrate molecules, respectively. RGO enhances contact between the GOD-matrix and CP, maintaining high conductivity. The composition of the bioink has been systematically optimized. The GOD bioelectrodes show linearly increasing electrocatalytic oxidation current toward glucose concentration up to 48 mM. A hybrid enzymatic biofuel cell equipped with the GOD bioelectrode as a bioanode and a platinum cathode furthermore registers a maximum power density of 5.1 μW cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.40 V at 25°C. The new method reported of preparing a bioelectrode by drop-casting the bioink onto the substrate electrode is facile and versatile, with the potential of application also for other enzymatic bioelectrodes. © 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - In this work, we present the first continuous flow process to produce the tailored biofuel 2-butyltetrahydrofuran from renewable resources. In a two-step approach lignocellulose-derived furfuralacetone is first hydrogenated and then deoxygenated over commercial catalysts to form the desired product. Both reactions were studied independently in batch conditions. The transition to a continuous flow system was done and various parameters were tested in the miniplant. Both reactions were performed in a two-reactor-concept approach to yield the desired 2-butyltetrahydrofuran in a high yield directly from furfuralacetone. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - To address the challenges associated with fossil fuel depletion, exploration of the sustainable energy resources is one of the most pursued research areas in this century. Valeric acid (VA) is considered as a valuable platform molecule for the production of biofuels and chemical intermediates. However, the production of VA from levulinic acid (LA) has become one of the most desirable reactions. The aim of this work was to investigate the amount of acidity, Pt loading and experimental conditions for the hydrogenation of LA into VA operated at 0.1 MPa H2 pressure and to elucidate the relationship between the active sites and the catalytic performance. The Pt-WO3 catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 were synthesized by a simple wet impregnation method with various Pt loadings from 0.5 to 3 wt% with constant 10 wt% of WO3 and calcination at 500 °C for 4 h under air. The catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), N2 adsorption-desorption, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), pyridine Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Pyr.FT-IR) and CO-chemisorption studies. Under optimized reaction conditions, the 2Pt-10WO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest selectivity to VA (58%) with 91% conversion of LA. This is due to the availability of a huge number of acidic and Pt active sites on the catalyst surface. In addition, the catalytic activity, reaction parameters and stability of the catalyst are demonstrated clearly.

AB  - The feasibility of utilizing corn straws to produce butanol via fermentation with Clostridium acetobutylicum was evaluated. The supernatant of enzymatically hydrolyzed supernatant of steam-exploded corn straws was used as the raw material. A bacterial strain was selected from Clostridium acetobutylicum zzu-02 and Clostridium beijerinckii zzu-01, which was capable of fermenting the enzymatically hydrolyzed supernatant of steam-exploded corn straw to produce butanol with high yield. The optimal fermentation conditions for the selected strain with enzymatically hydrolyzed supernatant of steam-exploded corn straw were also investigated and they were determined as follows: sugar concentrations in enzymatically hydrolyzed solution of steam exploded corn straws, 57.5 g/L; initial pH, 6.3; the amount of added CaCO3, 5g/L; the bacterial inoculation concentration to enzymatically hydrolyzed solution, 6%; fermentation temperature, 37 °C, the amounts of the added nutritional elements, i.e. yeast extract, CH3COONH4, KH2PO4, and C6H6N2O, 0.8, 6.0, 0.5, and 0.25 g/L, respectively. Under these conditions, the butanol yield reached 9.88 g/L. Based on the butanol metabolism pathways, supplementation of a small amount of C6H6N2O was found to effectively increase the yield of butanol production. © 2018, BioResources.

AB  - Wastes from lignocellulosic materials, especially hemicellulose, are extremely promising resources to produce fuels from renewable raw materials. Furfural, resulting from the depolymerization of hemicellulose, is often considered as an extremely interesting platform molecule. Particularly, new biofuels containing molecules with 8 and 13 carbon atoms can be produced from aldol condensation of furfural and acetone followed by a deoxygenation reaction. In this work, several magnesium hydroxide fluorides MgF2-x(OH)x were prepared by a sol-gel method with various F/Mg ratios (0 to 2) at 100 °C. All solid samples were fully characterized by several techniques (nitrogen adsorption-desorption, TEM, IR, XRD and ICP). MgF2-x(OH)x were mainly composed of an intimate mixture of MgF2 and Mg(OH)2-x(OCH3)x and exhibited both acid-base properties and high surface areas. From CO2 adsorption experiments, a basicity scale corresponding to basic sites with moderate strength was established: MgF1.5(OH)0.5 &gt; MgF(OH) ∼ MgF1.75(OH)0.25 &gt; MgF0.5(OH)1.5 &gt; Mg(OH)2 ≫ MgF2. It was proposed that the presence of fluorine allowed stabilization of the basic sites with moderate strength at ambient atmosphere. The aldol condensation of furfural and acetone was carried out under mild reaction conditions (50 °C, Patm) over MgF2-x(OH)x. These catalysts were involved in this reaction without using a classical activation step for basic solid catalysts, which constitutes a major advantage of energy conservation and thus, economic efficiency. The solid with a F/Mg ratio equal to 1.5 (MgF1.5(OH)0.5) exhibited the highest activity, the furanic dimer (1,5-di(furan-2-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one) being the main product. A good correlation between the catalytic activity and the basicity scale was highlighted. Based on these results, the nature of active sites was proposed: a combination of a Lewis acid site (coordinatively unsaturated metal site) in the vicinity of a basic site (hydroxyl groups of Mg(OH)2-x(OCH3)x). The effect of the furfural/acetone ratio on the catalytic properties of MgF1.5(OH)0.5 was also investigated. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Exploring high-performance electrocatalysts is of great importance in developing nonenzymatic biofuel cells. Hybrid nanostructures with transition metal compounds and carbon nanomaterials exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and have emerged as promising low-cost alternatives for various electrochemical reactions. Herein, we report cobalt sulfide/carbon nanohybrids via a facile synthesis, which have excellent electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction. The nonenzymatic glucose biofuel cells equipped with cobalt sulfide/carbon nanohybrids deliver a high open circuit voltage of 0.72 V with a maximum open power density of 88 μW cm-2, indicating that cobalt sulfide/carbon nanohybrids are high performance biocatalysts for bioenergy conversion.

AB  - Herein, we have shown that the [Ca-O-P] sites exposed on hydroxyapatite are clearly responsible for C-C formation in ethanol direct-coupling, and their high density accelerates the C-C coupling rate and boosts C6-12 alcohol production. Notably, nanowire-like hydroxyapatite exhibited 30.4% selectivity to n-butanol and 63.9% selectivity to C6-12OH at a conversion of 45.7% at 325 °C, and thereby close to 30% yield of C6-12OH, which is greatly higher than that using the state-of-the-art catalysts (6%). © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The use of effluent from various industries by agriculture sector in developing countries may help to mitigate water scarcity and cost of fertilizers but pose considerable threats to entire ecosystem when heavy metals enter the food chain. The aim of the present study was to compare the growth and development of two biofuel tree species Jatropha curcas L. and Pongamia pinnata L. when exposed to 20 and 40 mL L−1 of effluent discharged from a local tannery along with tap water as a control. The physico-chemical attributes assessed for quality of effluent showed higher values and significantly higher chromium (Cr) concentration than other metals. Application of effluent induced profound formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) in P. pinnata. With regard to growth and pigments of plant species, a significant reduction (p≤0.05) in root length, dry shoot biomass, leaf area, chlorophylls and carotenoids occurred in P. pinnata but shoot length, collar diameter and root dry biomass remained unaffected. Similarly, J. curcas sustained root and shoot growth, dry biomass production, collar diameter and leaf area. Increased pigment contents were found at both effluent levels. The roots of P. pinnata accumulated 6 and 11 times more Cr at 20 and 40 mL L−1, respectively, than control. While in J. curcas Cr accumulation was up to 9 folds in shoots at 40 mL L−1. Thus, the two species exhibited differential potential for Cr accumulation in their above and below ground tissues. The study signified the use of contaminated water for irrigation and potential of the species to act as phytoremediator to alleviate both water scarcity and metal contamination. © 2019 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - The commercial production of advanced fuels based on bio-oil gasification could be promising because the cost-effective transport of bio-oil could promote large-scale implementation of this biomass technology. So far there has been no specialized review of bio-oil gasification processes, including non-catalytic partial oxidation of bio-oil for syngas production and steam gasification of bio-oil for hydrogen production. A detailed and comprehensive review of gasification of bio-oil for gas production is presented in this paper. The background and significance of bio-oil research, the characteristics of bio-oil suitable for gasification, bio-oil gasification theory, types and configurations of bio-oil gasifiers, the quality of the product gas, parameter effects, and economic evaluation of bio-oil gasification are discussed, and finally a summary and future outlook are also delivered. Particular emphasis is placed on the discussion regarding the atomization of bio-oil, entrained flow gasifiers and their advantages, gas composition and the economic feasibility of production of advanced fuels via bio-oil gasification. Challenges for the future are identified as follows: (1) making full use of the experience accumulated in the area of petroleum refining; (2) practical demonstration of bio-oil gasification on a scale of 500 to 1000 kg bio-oil per hour; (3) the development of mathematical models for bio-oil gasification systems; and (4) development of suitable catalysts and profoundly understanding the catalyst deactivation mechanism at different stages for steam gasification of bio-oil. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - While we have started down the path towards a global transition to a green economy, as with most things we began with the "low-hanging fruit," such that increasingly difficult material and chemical conversions remain. Coking is one such example; it is unlikely that steel production will transition away from using coking coal anytime in the near future, such that coking wastewater remains a global environmental challenge. However, we can develop greener methods and materials to treat such waste. The present work demonstrates how wheat straw, an abundant agricultural residue, can be co-pyrolyzed and co-activated with coal fly ash to produce a high surface area biochar. Coal fly ash has previously been shown to promote devolatilization and deoxygenation of pyrolyzed biofuels. This work shows how coal fly ash increases microporosity as well as aromaticity of the surface functional groups, while decreasing carbonyl but preserving or only slightly decreasing ketones and carboxylic acids. CO2-activation of 5 and 10 wt% fly ash with wheat straw blends yields heterogeneous biochars with adsorption capacities upwards of 170 mgmetal gchar-1, with 5 wt% blends showing higher capacity and adsorption uptake rates than the 0 or 10 wt% blends. The adsorption of the four heavy metals ions (Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+) was chemical in nature, with cobalt preferentially adsorbing to the char surface. The overall adsorption rate is limited by an initial rapid uptake to fill available surface adsorption sites. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Conventionally, the biodiesel (mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, FAME) production proceeds by transesterification of triglycerides with methanol accordingly by the formation of glycerol as a by-product, which cannot be included in biofuel composition. Biodiesel could also be produced via interesterification ensuring full conversion of oil to biofuel, consisting of FAME and triacetin. The most effective catalysts for interesterification reactions are alkali metal alkoxides. The effectivity of alkoxide catalyst depends on its solubility determined by the structure of the alkyl chain. In our previous studies, we have shown that the branched chain catalyst tert-BuOK/THF is highly suitable for the realisation of interesterification reactions. Till now, in the scientific literature, very little is known about the influence of metal ions. In order to investigate the influence of counterion on the activity of alkoxide catalysts, in this work, we have investigated the proceeding of interesterification reactions of rapeseed oil with methyl acetate in the presence of lithium, sodium, and potassium tert-butoxides in THF. Experimentally obtained relationships for catalyst-to-oil molar ratio (COMR) influence rapeseed oil interesterifications with methyl acetate at 55°C for 1 h, with methyl acetate-to-oil molar ratio (MAOMR) 18 showing that the tert-BuONa/THF and tert-BuOK/THF have high and similar activity, but the tert-BuOLi/THF is fundamentally different. The low and diverse activity of lithium tert-butoxide can be explained by the association of ions and very low catalytic activity of ion pairs. Simulation of the influence of association on the FAME formation shows that at COMR 0.1 (sufficient for fast reaction proceeding in the presence of tert-BuONa/THF and tert-BuOK/THF), the concentration of tert-butoxide ions in the presence of tert-BuOLi/THF because of associations lowers from 28 mmol/L to 13 mmol/L, whcih is not sufficient for effective proceeding of reaction. Activity of alkoxides in this reaction is solely determined by the counterion. © 2019 Valdis Kampars et al.

AB  - This paper reports a systematic study on the formation of particulate matter with diameter of &lt;10μm (i.e., PM 10 ) during the combustion of two formulated water-soluble fractions (FWSFs) of bio-oil in a drop-tube-furnace (DTF) at 1400°C under air or oxyfuel (30%O 2 /70%CO 2 ) conditions. FWSF-1 was an organic-free calcium chloride solution with a calcium concentration similar to that in the bio-oil. FWSF-2 was formulated from the compositions of major organics in bio-oil WSF, doped with calcium chloride at the same concentration. The results suggest that similar to bio-oil combustion, the FWSF combustion produces mainly particulate matter with diameter of between 0.1 and 10μm (i.e., PM 0.1-10 ). Since there are no combustibles in the organic-free FWSF-1, the PM is produced via droplet evaporation followed by crystallization, fusion and further reactions to form CaO (in air or argon) or partially CaCO 3 (under oxyfuel condition). With the addition of organics, FWSF-2 combustion produces PM 10 shifting to smaller sizes due to extensive break up of droplets via microexplosion. Sprays with larger droplet size produce PM 10 with increased sizes. The results show that upon cooling CaO produced during combustion in air can react with HCl gas to form CaCl 2 in PM 0.1 . The predicted PSDs of PM 10 based on the assumption that one droplet produces one PM particle is considerably larger than experimentally-measured PSDs of PM 10 during the combustion of FWSFs, confirming that breakup of spray droplets takes place and such breakup is extensive for FWSF-2 when organics are present in the fuel.

AB  - Development of suitable catalysts having deep deoxygenation activity is the key for the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass to auto fuels directly. In this study 12 catalysts, namely Fe-MCM-41, Co-MCM-41, Mo-MCM-41, Ti-MCM-41, and oxides of Fe, Co, Mo, Ti, Fe-Mo, Fe-Co, Co-Mo and Ti-Zr, were synthesised, and characterised by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), textural analysis, Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). They were evaluated for HTL of sugarcane bagasse to bio-oil in the presence of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. For non-catalytic HTL, oil obtained in the presence of hydrogen contained less oxygen, whereas for catalytic HTL oil obtained in the presence of carbon monoxide contained less oxygen. Among the catalysts studied, iron-cobalt oxide was found to be the most selective as it gave the highest oil yield of 57.6 weight% containing the least oxygen of 10.8 weight% in the presence of CO. Co-MCM-41 and cobalt oxide yielded bio-oil with the least oxygen among the metal-substituted MCM-41 and metal oxides studied, indicating that cobalt may be the most active catalytic species for strong deoxygenation activity. Metal-substituted MCM-41 yielded oil with less oxygen compared to its simple metal oxides except Ti, which may be due to very high surface area owing to its mesoporous structure. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This work compares the effectiveness of protic (PIL) and aprotic (APIL) ionic liquids in microwave-irradiated transition metal-catalysed one-pot conversion of a cellulose-rich non-edible lignocellulose, namely, June grass – composed of cellulose (82.3%), hemicelluloses (1.3%), with crystallinity index of 54% – to biofuel precursors such as glucose, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), levulinic (LA) and formic (FA) acids. Reaction parameters such as catalyst-substrate loading, IL-substrate loading, water concentration, temperature, and time are optimized to target specific biofuel precursor molecules and regulate the product distribution. The APIL ([BMIM]Cl) gives a maximum glucose yield of 88.2% at 180 °C and 40% water concentration, while the PIL ([Et3NH][HSO4]) produces a maximum HMF yield of 34.8% at 180 °C with no added water, and maximum LA and FA yields of 19.2% and 7.6%, respectively, at 200 °C. The PIL-based conversion targeting HMF as the biofuel precursor molecule, with glucose, LA, and FA as co-products, gives a product: reactant cost ratio 194. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of ethyl decanoate combined with conventional diesel or biodiesel could be economically attractive. Thermophysical properties of ethyl decanoate at high temperatures can be an essential guidance for the structural design and optimization of the fuel injection system in diesel engine. The measurements of the speed of sound and the thermal diffusivity of ethyl decanoate (EeC10: 0) were carried out by the light scattering method, which are along five isobaric lines from (0.1–10) MPa at the temperatures (300.71–562.07) K and (295.34–565.49) K, respectively. The expanded relative uncertainties (k = 2) of the measurement systems are estimated to be 1.2% for speed of sound and 2.4% for thermal diffusivity. The thermal conductivities of ethyl decanoate at pressures up to 10 MPa and in the temperature range (303–363) K are derived, which agree well with literature values finding an AAD of 0.81%. The pρT dependences of the thermal conductivity are analyzed based on the vibrational theory. The results obtained show that the higher density of biofuels leads to smaller distances between oscillating molecules, of which the collision probability and intermolecular energy transport are enhanced. The consistent behaviors of biofuels that higher density leads to higher conductivity, and the dependence of the thermal conductivity on density becomes smaller with temperature increase are verified. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass derived chemicals may offer sustainable alternatives to petroleum derived hydrocarbons, while also enhancing engine combustion performance with co-optimization of fuels and engines. This paper presents a numerical study on the oxidation and combustion of a novel biofuel compound, cyclopentanol. Its reaction kinetics and thermochemistry are first explored using ab initio quantum chemistry methods. Thermochemical properties are calculated for cyclopentanol and a set of its key oxidation intermediates. C-H bond dissociation energies of cyclopentanol are computed for different carbon sites. For the fuel radicals, the energy barriers of their ring-opening reactions and the potential energy surfaces of their oxidation reactions are determined. Based on the theoretical results, a chemical kinetic mechanism is proposed to describe the oxidation of cyclopentanol at low and high temperatures. The model is compared against data obtained from shock tube, rapid compression machine, combustion vessel, and counterflow burner experiments over a range of initial conditions. Furthermore, reaction pathway analysis is performed using the present mechanism to give insights into the underlying oxidation chemistry of cyclopentanol. It is found that the α-radical of cyclopentanol undergoes preferably an alcohol-specific HO2 elimination reaction to form stable cyclopentanone and this reaction can strongly retard reactivity. The major reaction pathways of β- and γ-radicals are similar to those of cyclopentyl radicals that are the sequential and formally direct reactions of fuel radicals with O2 to form cyclopentenols and HO2 radicals. The existence of the hydroxy moiety affects the bond dissociation energies and reaction barriers, slightly favoring the chain-branching channel for γ-radicals at low temperatures. © 2019 The Combustion Institute

AB  - After biodiesel is produced, it needs to be purified very well in order to remove impurities such as soap and glycerin. In the conventional method, washing with water is carried out for purification. However, if this water is not sufficiently removed from the biodiesel, the quality of the fuel produced is adversely affected. In this study, the aim was to remove water from biodiesel produced from sunflower oil and to purify biodiesel in this way. Cationic resin (Dowex HCR-S)was used for purification. The pre-drying and contact time of the resin, the temperature and the amount of resin were selected as parameters. The amount of water adsorbed by the resin was determined for each parameter. According to the results obtained, the parameters in which the maximum amount of water is removed from biodiesel are pre-drying time of 4 h for the resin, contact time of 50 min for the resin, temperature of 15 °C and the 6% (by weight)for amount of the resin. At these parameter values, 92.78 wt% of the water in the biodiesel was removed. Also, the water content of biodiesel purified by resin was much less than the maximum value of 500 mg/kg. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pine sawdust steam gasification in a fixed double bed reactor and continuous flow was investigated. K2CO3 as primary catalyst and cobalt supported on γ-Al2O3 and SiO2-Al2O3 as secondary catalyst was investigated. Thermal and catalytic steam gasification was compared. The effect of the support in tar yield and the H2/CO ratio was pursued. It is noteworthy to observe that the primary catalyst increases the biomass gasification. It is also marked the total consumption of CH4 species by the primary catalyst. The catalysts (K2CO3 and K2CO3-Co/γ-Al2O3) reduced tar formation from 11% in the thermal gasification to a value of 2.0% and 0.5% respectively. This tar yield reduction could be explained due to the action of potassium actives species of the primary catalyst combined with the lower acid strength of the support; high metal dispersion of cobalt species and the higher fraction of metallic cobalt species in Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The catalysts decrease the formation of CO2 from 21% in the thermal gasification to values on the order of 3%. The highest H2/CO ratio with a value of 1.6 was obtained by K2CO3-γ-Al2O3 catalytic system. The presence of cobalt supported catalysts favored hydrogen consumption reactions such as reverse water gas shift reaction. © 2019 Energy Institute

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass can be used as a source of hydrocarbons after an initial transformation by one of three different routes: biochemical conversion, chemical conversion and thermochemical conversion. In the last class, one of the possible approaches is fast pyrolysis, a process in which the biomass is exposed for a short time at high temperature and in the absence oxygen. Through this conversion step, gas, bio-char and bio-oil are the effluents that are generated. Bio-oil can be subsequently be upgraded into hydrocarbons by means of hydroconversion and hydrotreating. Like heavy oil fractions, fast pyrolysis oils are complex mixtures and, consequently, react via a complex reaction network. In the present work, the reaction pathways of model molecules representative of bio-oil are studied under hydrotreating conditions over a reduced NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. To simulate the various reactions, a general kinetic Monte Carlo method, called Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, was developed and applied to a model molecule guaiacol. The simulations are compared to the experimental results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel, and it is derived from vegetable oils or animal fats via transesterification process. The free fatty acid content of the oils is the main deciding factor to select either one or two steps transesterification process. The processing cost of biodiesel production depends upon the biodiesel production method. Generally, oil is extracted from biodiesel feedstock, and further, it is analyzed for its suitability for biodiesel production. In order to assess the suitability of groundnut seeds with different viability for biodiesel production, the experiment was conducted. Also, the relationship between seed viability and its oil's properties were studied. Eleven groundnut seed lots were tested for their seed viability as well as the fuel properties of the oil, after extraction. The result indicate that as the seeds lose its viability, the activity of antioxidant enzyme decreases leading to an alteration in free fatty acid, saponification value, iodine value, and cetane number. Correlation analysis between seed viability of seed and free fatty acid of groundnut oil indicates an inverse and strong relationship with oil's fuel properties. The groundnut seed lots with more than 60 percent germination were found to possess oil with excellent fuel properties. It was also found that the above seed lot can be suited for alkali based single-step transesterification process due to lower free fatty acid (< 1.8%). Seeds with high viability had less oil oxidation potential due to the higher activity of antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, the quick viability assessment test kit can be used to quickly assess the suitability of oilseeds for biodiesel production, at any point of seed stock storage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Castor oil has been widely used as raw material to obtain compounds such as paints, solvents, rubbers, polyurethane polymers and chemical inputs. Then, one highlighted route is thermal cracking of castor oil to produce bio-oil, mainly composed of heptaldehyde and methyl undecenoate, which are used as precursors of lactones in the food and beverage industry. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the separation heptaldehyde and methyl undecenoate by distillation of bio-oil from thermal cracking of the methyl esters in castor oil (MECO). Distilled fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Thus, it was possible to concentrate the fractions of heptaldehyde and methyl undecenoate in a section with a distillation system at atmospheric pressure with a distillation rate of 5.0 mL min-1 at 270 °C, which motivates new researches for up-scaling of the process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has been reported as renewable, green fuel with better engine-emission properties and microalgae (like C. pyrenoidosa) derived biodiesel is a step towards the sustainable supply of liquid fuel to drive the world economies. In the present investigation, Biowaste [Dairy wastewater (DWW) and rice straw hydrolysate (RSH)] was used as natural feedstock for the growth of C. pyrenoidosa. The better yield was obtained by using DWW as media for the growth of microalgae. The biodiesel produced was composed of high molecular weight fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), thus confirming its purity. Physico-chemical properties of the biodiesel produced were analyzed and compared with the petrodiesel and with standard analytical methods (ASTM-D6751 and EN 14214:2010). The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of 42.23%, the calorific value of 41.865 MJ/kg and brake power (BP) 39.99 kW was obtained for the biodiesel produced and has been found to be higher but statistically non-significant in comparison to petrodiesel. However, statistically significant reduction in emission (40–50%) and reduction in CO2 (50–60%) was found in case of biodiesel as compared to petrodiesel. The data presented clearly demonstrates that the engine performance parameters and emission parameters of the biodiesel produced were better than the conventional petrodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In a previous study, crude bio-oil (CBO) was obtained from fast pyrolysis of waste cooking oil (WCO) under different conditions, varying the temperature and the residence time of the process. The samples produced were characterized by physicochemical methods, and the results showed an acidic, viscous, and odoriferous material. In this study, the esterification reaction was used to reduce the acidity of CBO. This step decreased the acidity value of the bio-oil by almost 95%. Afterward, the CBO was then distilled at the boiling points of gasoline and diesel, producing light and heavy fractions with approximately 30 and 50% yields, respectively. The physicochemical characterization of these light and heavy fractions was performed to obtain information on their properties, such as the specific gravity, iodine value, kinematic viscosity, and acid number. These biofuels were also submitted to chromatographic analysis (gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), which partially revealed their composition as being rich in aromatics, olefin and paraffin hydrocarbons. This study contributes to a better understanding of the characteristics of bio-oil obtained from triacylglycerols and provides data that will be useful in future studies on the pyrolysis process.

AB  - Black soldier fly larvae containing high lipids had been considered an novel sustainable feedstock for lipid extraction to biofuels. The insect lipid was extracted with microwave assisted solvent extraction method. The energy consumption of this way was analyzed to determine the feasibility of the lipid extraction process. The comparison of the effects of different extraction conditions (dehydration methods, water content, extraction temperature, extraction time, equipment power, and solute-solvent ratio) on the energy consumption of lipid extraction from the energy insect was investigated systematically. The dewatering of the insect biomass was the most energy consuming step via a dry extraction method in this paper, constituting about 40–80% of the total energy consumption demand. Within the ranges of extraction factors values compared in this analysis, the microwave radiation powder and lipid extraction temperature had a pronounced effect on the total energy consumption in the ranges of investigated parameter. At last, the lipid extraction yield-dependent evolution of energy consumption for different extraction conditions was also investigated. Anyway, the economic and environmental aspects of lipid extraction from the energy insect needed to be further improved for its large scale implementation in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Castor plant (Ricinus communis) is a fast-growing shrub from Euphorbiaceae family. India ranks first in the world for the production of castor seeds. The generation of residue from its leaves and stems is more than 50% of the whole plant. This research work involves the estimation of the optimum condition for the production/value addition by hydrothermal liquefaction of castor residue using factorial design. Temperature (T) and residence time (RT) are the key parameters that affect the bio-oil yield. A 32 full factorial design was employed to understand the affects the bio-oil yield and conversion with key parameters. The key parameter and its interaction effects were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA); F-test and p-values were used to rank the process variable affecting the total bio-oil yield. It was observed that the temperature imparts significant effect on total bio-oil yield. The optimum conditions to obtain maximum total bio-oil yield are T = 300 °C and RT = 60 min. The statistical model was best fitted with high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9994 and 0.9473 for total bio-oil yield and conversion respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A magnesium-aluminum layered double hydroxide was synthesized with co-precipitation method and zinc salt was impregnated on it. The final product was calcined and used as a catalyst in the transesterification reaction to produce biodiesel from waste cooking oil. Both MgAl hydrotalcite and Zn impregnated compound (Zn/MgAl(O)) were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. High surface area and nanometric pore size of Zn/MgAl(O) was determined using Bruneure-Emmett-Teller N2 physisorption technique. Another fully co-precipitated ZnMgAl mixed oxide was synthesized by and compared with Zn impregnated product in the transesterification reaction. The reactions were performed at 65°C using 9:1 methanol to oil ratio for 3 h. The biodiesel yields were measured by gas chromatography (GC). Leaching amounts of surface active components of as-synthesized mixed metal oxides were determined by EDS and ICP analysis of used catalyst. Zn impregnated catalyst showed 78.45% conversion of the fatty acid to methyl esters and just 1.16% leaching of Zn was observed, that is much lower than the diminishing in the co-precipitated compound. Finally, the reaction and leaching proofs and the effect of synthesis method on the firmness of catalyst were discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Yarrowia lipolytica (Y. lipolytica) is an oleaginous yeast that can utilize hydrophobic substrates as carbon source to produce single-cell lipids for biodiesel production. This study attempts to increase the lipid accumulation ability of Y. lipolytica by first gradually elevating pure oil substrate concentration during the cultivation and then adding short-chain carbon compounds, such as glucose and sodium acetate, to a culture substance according to the optimal oil concentration. Results showed that Y. lipolytica cultured under 40.0 g L−1 oil concentration showed higher lipids (2.97 g L−1) and lipid content (37.35%, DW) compared with that cultured under 20.0 g L−1, where the corresponding values were 1.91 g L−1 and 24.46%. By contrast, the lipid content of Y. lipolytica increased from 37.35 to 41.50% when the substrate was changed from 40.0 g L−1 pure oil to 5% sodium acetate combined with 95% oil under the same total carbon concentration. However, lipid accumulation did not increase even though 15% sodium acetate or 5% glucose, or 15% glucose was added to the combined substrate. Moreover, the lipid biomodification of Y. lipolytica was evident when it was cultured under the oil concentration of 20.0 g L−1. Therefore, the lipid accumulation of Y. lipolytica can be elevated through the gradient increase of oil concentration and by adding a suitable amount of easily degradable carbon source. Furthermore, the lipid biomodification of Y. lipolytica improves biodiesel quality. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important platform chemical that can be generated from biomass using catalysts and used for the production of biofuels and biobased polymers. RESULTS: In this study, a novel magnetically-recoverable catalyst (Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2−HPW) was synthesized for the first time by immobilizing H3PW12O40 (HPW) on the surfaces of SiO2 and TiO2-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles. A number of techniques, including inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nitrogen (N2) adsorption–desorption analysis, were used to characterize the catalyst. Results showed that the catalyst had a porous structure and the Keggin structure of HPW on the surface of the catalyst was well-preserved. The catalyst was then used for the syntheses of HMF from fructose and inulin using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent, and the influences of reaction temperature and reaction time were investigated. Results showed that HMF yields obtained from fructose and inulin reached 83% and 54%, respectively. After reaction, the catalyst could be easily separated from reaction mixture using an external magnet, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst was well-preserved after more than five reuses. CONCLUSION: This magnetically-recoverable catalyst is efficient not only for the syntheses of HMF from fructose and inulin, but also potentially for the one-step production of HMF from inulin-containing biomass, and its magnetic property may overcome the difficulty of catalyst separation from the insoluble biomass residues. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Even if sewage sludge gain acceptance as a potential feedstock for biodiesel (BD)production, water content and contaminants in sewage sludge still remain as obstacles for the production and quality of biodiesel, respectively. Crude BD was produced from a feedstock of wet sewage sludge with 85% water content via in-situ wet-transesterification in a bench-scale (10 L)reactor, and then further treated for enhancing the BD quality to a transportation grade through a series of refining processes. The wet-transesterification was optimized in terms of crude BD yield by varying methanol dosage, methanol/co-solvent (xylene)ratio and reaction time. The maximum crude BD yield and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)content were 11.05 and 67.41%, respectively, when methanol dosage, methanol/co-solvent and reaction time were 15 mL/g, 0.5 and 12 h, respectively. The refining process consisting of vacuum distillation, degumming and neutralization, which satisfied the BD standards (EN14214)and visually improved color and transparency. Based on GC-FID analysis, the FAME content in the refined BD highly increased by eliminating the residual impurities. Applicability of the refined BD as a transportation fuel was confirmed by comparing the quality of the BD blended with the commercial petroleum-diesel (PD)at 3% (BD3)with the standard specification. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This experimental study aims to mitigate harmful emissions from a CI engine using bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) approach. The engine used for this experimental work is a single cylinder CI engine with a rated power of 5.2 kW at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The BECCS approach is a combination of plant-based biofuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. The whole investigation was done in four phases: (1) Substituting diesel with Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) (2) Equal volume blending of Orange oil (ORG) with KOME (3) 20% blending of n-butanol (B) with KOME-ORG blend (4) CCS system with zeolite based non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) and mono ethanolamine (MEA) based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system with KOME-ORG + B20 blend. The experimental results show that substitution of diesel with KOME reduces smoke emission, but increases NO and CO2 emission. KOME-ORG blend reduces CO2 and smoke emissions with high NO emission due to combustion improvement. In comparison with the sole combustion of KOME at full load condition, the combination of KOME-ORG + B20 as bio-fuel with zeolite based post-combustion treatment system resulted in a maximum reduction of NO, smoke and CO2 emission by 41%, 19% and 15% respectively. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Microbial biomass which mostly generated from the microbial processes of bacteria, yeasts, and microalgae is an important resource. Recent concerns in microbial biomass production field, especially microbial lipid production for biofuel, have been focused towards the mixed culture of microalgae and yeast. To more comprehensive understanding of the mixed culture for microbial biomass, mono Chlorella pyrenoidosa, mono Yarrowia lipolytica and the mixed culture were investigated in the present work. Results showed that the mixed culture achieved significantly faster cell propagation of microalga and yeast, smaller individual cell size of yeast and higher relative chlorophyll content of microalga. The mixed culture facilitated the assimilation of carbon and nitrogen and drove the carbon flow to carbohydrate. Besides higher lipid yield (0.77 g/L), higher yields of carbohydrates (1.82 g/L), protein (1.99 g/L) and heating value (114.64 kJ/L) indicated the microbial biomass harvested from the mixed culture have more potential utilization in renewable energy, feedstuff, and chemical industry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuel reserves and increasing demands for diesel are considered to be important triggers for many of the initiatives that have been taken to search for possible sources for the production of biodiesel from materials available within the country. It is possible to produce biodiesel from waste/used cooking oils (WCO) that is comparable in quality to that of fresh vegetable oil. Not only does reuse of WCO, which can otherwise harm human health, reduce the burden on the government of treating oily wastewater, disposing of the waste, and maintaining public sewers, it also significantly lowers the production cost of biodiesel. In the process of frying, oil undergoes many reactions, leading to the formation of a number of undesirable compounds, such as polymers, free fatty acids, and many other chemicals. This poses challenges in the transesterification of WCO. This article covers different techniques in the production of biodiesel from WCO. It also compares combustion, emissions, and engine performance characteristics of biodiesel from WCO as well as factors affecting biodiesel production from WCO and its economic feasibility. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Sustainable bio-renewable energy source is the need of hour to meet the rising global energy demands. Efficient conversion of fermentable sugars by yeast into bioethanol from lingo-cellulosic biomass is one of the most important attributes. In order to get temperature and ethanol tolerant yeast strain, one hundred and seventy one soil samples were collected from adjacent areas of various sugar mills located in Punjab, Pakistan. Fifty six yeast strains were isolated and primarily screened for bioethanol production. Maximum bioethanol producing (3.07 ± 0.05 g/L) yeast strain IHZ-26 was identified by sequencing of 18S rRNA ITS region and identified as a new strain of Wickerhamomyces anomalus which was assigned GenBank accession number KT883963. This strain demonstrated substantial tolerance to ethanol (25%) and temperature (50 ºC) and have the ability to significantly ferment several sugars i.e. glucose, fructose, mannose, maltose, xylose and lactose. To the best of our knowledge, this is first report of multi stress tolerant Wickerhamomyces anomalus from Pakistan. This yeast with these distinct characteristics can be employed in bioethanol industry for more viable and economical process. © 2019, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of market variables on biodiesel production and considers a calcium oxide catalyzed transesterification process. A conceptual process simulation of a plant using Super Pro software was used to vary the economic scenarios and to evaluate the effects of selected variables such as prices of biodiesel, glycerol, oil, alcohol, catalyst, equipment maintenance, labor, and tax variation. Changing the values of these variables led to large effects on the overall economics of the production process. Oil purchasing cost exerted a larger influence on the economic outcome, with an approximately 73% decrease in net present value (NPV) for a 22% increase in the oil purchasing cost. Under optimum conditions the process would be profitable for oil costs below 590US$ ton−1. Varying the equipment maintenance costs produced a smaller effect, which could allow the amount of cost allocated for routine maintenance activities to be increased to sustain the productivity of the process. The study could also provide cutoff values for each variable for economic feasibility of the process at the given market scenario. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In this study, catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of pretreated and intact sugarcane bagasse was investigated using waste heavy paraffin (as an in-situ supply of hydrogen). A Y-type commercial zeolite catalyst (HGY-A) which is a gasoline boosting catalyst suitable for hydrocracking reactions in oil refining was used for catalytic pyrolysis. Co-feeding of bagasse with paraffin produced higher liquid product yields and lower solid yields. The improved effective hydrogen to carbon ratio (H/Ceff) of the feedstock, and primary cracking and fragmentation reactions of heavy paraffin at temperatures around 600 °C are responsible for considerable improvement of bio-oil yield. Use of HGY-A catalyst did change the composition of the produced bio-oil; however, it did not have any appreciable impact on the bio-oil yield under various operational conditions. Results showed that acidic pretreatment of bagasse (with a 30% w/w HCl) reduced the bio-oil yield and increased the char yield. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An analysis of the toxic effects of emissions should reflect real traffic conditions. The exhaust emissions of particulate matter from diesel engines strongly depend on their operating conditions, with low-speed, low-load “urban creep” conditions, common for truck traffic in heavily congested urban areas, being one of the worst. We aimed to detect the genotoxicity of organic extracts from particulate matter in the exhaust of the diesel engine Zetor 1505 running on diesel and biodiesel (B100) fuels at characteristic modes of extended "urban creep", typical for transit truck traffic in Prague, comparing the first 5 min of idling with extended (20–80 min) idling, full load after idle, “stabilized” full load, and 30% load. The diluted exhaust was sampled with high volume samplers on glass fiber fluorocarbon coated filters. The filters were extracted with dichloromethane and DNA damage was analyzed in A549 cells using comet assay, with the inclusion of formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) and endonuclease III (ENDOIII) to recognize oxidized DNA bases. The cells were exposed to extractable organic matter (EOM) for 4 and 24 h at non-cytotoxic dose corresponding to 0.001 m3 of undiluted exhaust gas per ml cell media. At the 4 h exposure interval, all samples from B100 and diesel emissions induced DNA damage. EOM from the extended idle engine mode exerted the strongest genotoxic effect for both fuels. Twenty hours later, the cells exposed to diesel EOM exhibited a further increase of DNA strand breaks compared to the preceding interval. In contrast, DNA damage seemed to be fully repaired in cells treated with EOM derived from biodiesel B100. The preliminary results suggest that (i) diesel emissions are more genotoxic than the emissions from B100, (ii) biodiesel induced DNA lesions are repaired within 24 h. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As the renewable energy technologies are making progress every day, hydrogen energy technologies are taking huge part of this development. Nowadays, there are several industries using hydrogen. Also, the increase at biodiesel production amounts has increased the glycerol production as by-product. One of the main objectives of this study is to compare the effects Al2O3-, SiO2- and CeO2-supported nickel catalysts at steam reforming of glycerol in order to produce hydrogen. All catalysts were prepared by incipient to wetness method. The obtained steam reforming results showed that nickel catalysts supported on ceria showed the highest activity. Also the effect of nickel amount on CeO2 support material has been studied. The highest hydrogen amounts were obtained with 15 wt% nickel loading. Also the increase at water/glycerol ratio increased the hydrogen production amount. The highest hydrogen yield was obtained as 4.82 mol per glycerol mole, whereas the theoretical hydrogen yield is 7 mol, by using 15 wt% Ni/CeO2 catalyst, water/glycerol ratio of 15 and at 650 °C reaction temperature. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Availability of information on the efficiency of applied conditions to biodiesel synthesis from diverse seed oil can establish optimal biodiesel yield from favourable reaction variables. The effect of reaction parameters; temperature, time and catalyst amount, were varied on biodiesel yield from alcoholysis of Parinari polyandra oil using potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Maximum biodiesel yield of 95.62% was obtained from the experimental results. Analysis of Variance revealed that the reaction variables had significant effects on biodiesel yield. Data analysis predicted an optimal biodiesel yield of 92.75% at reaction conditions of 61.20°C temperature, 60 min, and 1 wt% of catalyst amount. Validation experiments of the optimal conditions gave an average biodiesel yield of 91.72%. The study established optimal conditions of temperature, time, and catalyst amount for biodiesel production from P. polyandra oil. The fuel properties of the biodiesel fell within the standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials D6751. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The energy security scenario in the world would remain at high risk until non-conventional, indigenously produced renewable biofuels replace/supplement petroleum-based conventional fossil fuels. In the present study, an indigenously isolated chlorophycean microalga, Scenedesmus obliquus (Turpin) Kützing GA 45, was explored under raceway pond cultivation to assess its potential for production of lipids for qualitative biodiesel purpose. Microalgal cultivation was carried out in closed raceway ponds (14 × 4 × 0.75 m) with a capacity of 40,000 L each. The maximum areal biomass and lipid productivities were recorded to be 13.12 and 1.39 g m−2 day−1 at 30 cm culture depth during winter season followed by summer and rainy seasons. Under biphasic nitrogen starvation strategy, the maximum lipid productivity increased up to 2.29, 1.88, and 2.43 g m−2 day−1, respectively during summer, rainy, and winter seasons. The average lipid productivity was consequently calculated to be 2.2 g m−2 day−1, thus projecting an approximate annual lipid productivity of 7.04 t ha−1 y−1, assuming 10 cultivation cycles per year. Characterization of various fuel properties of the biodiesel produced, were found to be within the specified limits of national and international biodiesel standards, thus signifying the potential of the new isolate S. obliquus GA 45 for qualitative biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Efficient biotechnological conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to valuable products, such as transportation biofuels, is ecologically attractive, yet requires substantially improved mechanistic understanding and optimization to become economically feasible. Cellulolytic clostridia, such as Ruminiclostridium papyrosolvens (previously Clostridium papyrosolvens), produce a wide variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) including extracellular multienzyme complexes-cellulosomes with different specificities for enhanced cellulosic biomass degradation. Identification of the secretory components, especially CAZymes, during bacterial growth on lignocellulose and their influence on bacterial catalytic capabilities provide insight into construction of potent cellulase systems of cell factories tuned or optimized for the targeted substrate by matching the type and abundance of enzymes and corresponding transporters. Results: In this study, we firstly predicted a total of 174 putative CAZymes from the genome of R. papyrosolvens, including 74 cellulosomal components. To explore profile of secreted proteins involved in lignocellulose degradation, we compared the secretomes of R. papyrosolvens grown on different substrates using label-free quantitative proteomics. CAZymes, extracellular solute-binding proteins (SBPs) of transport systems and proteins involved in spore formation were enriched in the secretome of corn stover for lignocellulose degradation. Furthermore, compared with free CAZymes, complex CAZymes (cellulosomal components) had larger fluctuations in variety and abundance of enzymes among four carbon sources. In particular, cellulosomal proteins encoded by the cip-cel operon and the xyl-doc gene cluster had the highest abundance with corn stover as substrate. Analysis of differential expression of CAZymes revealed a substrate-dependent secretion pattern of CAZymes, which was consistent with their catalytic activity from each secretome determined on different cellulosic substrates. The results suggest that the expression of CAZymes is regulated by the type of substrate in the growth medium. Conclusions: In the present study, our results demonstrated the complexity of the lignocellulose degradation systems of R. papyrosolvens and showed the potency of its biomass degradation activity. Differential proteomic analyses and activity assays of CAZymes secreted by R. papyrosolvens suggested a distinct environment-sensing strategy for cellulose utilization in which R. papyrosolvens modulated the composition of the CAZymes, especially cellulosome, according to the degradation state of its natural substrate. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - We prepared robust bioanodes by immobilizing the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme onto a one-pot electropolymerized film consisting of methylene green and pyrrole. The enzymatic film containing immobilized ADH furnished power densities as high as 183 ± 10 μW cm−2; addition of carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) increased the bioanode power density to 275 ± 12 μW cm−2. The bioanode was very stable, with a mean decay of 36% of its initial power density after 20 weeks of storage. Long-term ethanol electrolysis (12h) followed by HPLC-UV/RID confirmed that the system was highly selective and generated a two-electron product. MWNCT introduction provided five times higher acetaldehyde production. Compared to literature data, results were promising and showed that the system can be used to construct biofuel cells. In addition, the film obtained by simultaneous methylene green and pyrrole electropolymerization afforded interesting results and can be applied in other systems, such as biosensors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acetone is the expected ketone product of an acetic acid decarboxylative ketonization reaction with metal oxide catalysts used in the industrial production of ketones and for biofuel upgrade. Decarboxylative cross-ketonization of a mixture of acetic and isobutyric acids yields highly valued unsymmetrical methyl isopropyl ketone (MIPK) along with two less valuable symmetrical ketones, acetone and diisopropyl ketone (DIPK). We describe a side reaction of isobutyric acid with acetone yielding the cross-ketone MIPK with monoclinic zirconia and anatase titania catalysts in the absence of acetic acid. We call it a reketonization reaction because acetone is deconstructed and used for the construction of MIPK. Isotopic labeling of the isobutyric acid's carboxyl group shows that it is the exclusive supplier of the carbonyl group of MIPK, while acetone provides only methyl group for MIPK construction. More branched ketones, MIPK or DIPK, are less reactive in their reketonization with carboxylic acids. The proposed mechanism of reketonization supported by density functional theory (DFT) computations starts with acetone enolization and proceeds via its condensation with surface isobutyrate to a β-diketone similar to β-keto acid formation in the decarboxylative ketonization of acids. Decomposition of unsymmetrical β-diketones with water (or methanol) by the retrocondensation reaction under the same conditions over metal oxides yields two pairs of ketones and acids (or esters in the case of methanol) and proceeds much faster compared to their formation. The major direction yields thermodynamically more stable products - more substituted ketones. DFT calculations predict even a larger fraction of the thermodynamically preferred pair of products. The difference is explained by some degree of a kinetic control in the opposite direction. Reketonization has lower reaction rates compared to regular ketonization. Still, a high extent of reketonization occurs unnoticeably during the decarboxylative ketonization of acetic acid as the result of the acetone reaction with acetic acid. This degenerate reaction is the major cause of the inhibition by acetone of its own rate of formation from acetic acid at high conversions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: In the enzymatic conversion of biomass, it becomes an important issue to efficiently and cost-effectively degrade cellulose into fermentable glucose. β-Glucosidase (Bgluc), an essential member of cellulases, plays a critical role in cellulosic biomass degradation. The difficulty in improving the stability of Bgluc has been a bottleneck in the enzyme-dependent cellulose degradation. The traditional method of protein purification, however, leads to higher production cost and a decrease in activity. To simplify and efficiently purify Bgluc with modified special properties, Bgluc-tagged ELP and His with defined phase transitions was designed to facilitate the process. Results: Here, a novel binary ELP and His tag was fused with Bgluc from termite Coptotermes formosanus to construct a Bgluc-linker-ELP-His recombinant fusion protein (BglucLEH). The recombinant plasmid Bgluc expressing a His tag (BglucH) was also constructed. The BglucLEH and BglucH were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified using inverse transition cycling (ITC) or Ni-NTA resin. The optimum salt concentration for the ITC purification of BglucLEH was 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 and the specific activity of BglucLEH purified by ITC was 75.5 U/mg for substrate p-NPG, which was slightly higher than that of BglucLEH purified by Ni-NTA (68.2 U/mg). The recovery rate and purification fold of BglucLEH purified by ITC and Ni-NTA were 77.8%, 79.1% and 12.60, 11.60, respectively. The results indicated that purification with ITC was superior to the traditional Ni-NTA. The K m of BglucLEH and BglucH for p-NPG was 5.27 and 5.73 mM, respectively. The K ca t/K m (14.79 S-1 mM-1) of BglucLEH was higher than that of BglucH (12.10 S-1 mM-1). The effects of ELP tag on the enzyme activity, secondary structure and protein stability were also studied. The results showed that ELP tag did not affect the secondary structure or enzyme activity of Bgluc. More importantly, ELP improved the protein stability in harsh conditions such as heating and exposure to denaturant. Conclusion: The Bgluc-linker-ELP-His system shows wide application prospect in maintaining the activity, efficient purification and improving the stability of Bgluc. These properties of BglucLEH make it an interesting tool to reduce cost, to improve the efficiency of biocatalyst and potentially to enhance the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Water resistance and/or hydrothermal stability of catalysts are key concerns during the obtention of biofuels from fermentation products, which always involve considerable amounts of water. Herein, aimed at efficient upgrading of a water-containing acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixture to long-chain products, we designed and synthesized a series of 10 wt % Ni-MgO-SBA-16 catalysts, which were based on hydrophobic SBA-16 with highly condensed structures. These catalysts exhibited low water adsorptive capacities and relatively favorable hydrophobicity. As expected, the as-prepared catalysts showed excellent catalytic activity and water-tolerance: 76.4% conversion and 90.5% selectivity for C5-15 species were achieved under solvent-free conditions; when the initial water content increased to 7.4 wt %, comparable conversion and total selectivity for C5-15 species were also achieved. Besides, on account of the hydrophobic surface, monoalkylation products readily converted into doublealkylation ones even under conditions of high water content. The results demonstrated the 10 wt % Ni-MgO-SBA-16 catalysts acted as the role of "killing two birds with one stone": Promoting the water tolerance and exhibiting high hydrothermal stability; suppressing competitive adsorption of water molecules and facilitating the adsorption and transformation of hydrophobic intermediate 2-heptanone to long-chain hydrocarbons; replacing the rare noble metal by base metal and complying with the principles of "green chemistry". Overall, this work not only makes significant progress in value-adding of water-containing ABE but also provides the rational synthetic direction of catalysts requiring high hydrothermal stability and/or water resistance in the biomass conversion process. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The electrocoagulation (EC) for the wastewater treatment from biodiesel production using waste cooking oil was studied. The effects of current density, initial pH and electrolysis time on the EC process using Al and Fe electrodes were evaluated for removal of chemical oxygen demand. The COD removal efficiencies were 62.7% and 63.4% at optimum conditions for Al (current density: 43 mA/sq cm, pH: 5, at 21 min) and Fe (current density: 47 mA/sq cm, pH: 7.7, at 30 min) electrodes, respectively. At these optimum conditions, the removal efficiencies of oil and grease, total phosphorus (TP), orthophosphate, and total suspended solids were determined, respectively, to be above 89.9%, 98.9%, 99.5%, 86.7% for Al electrodes and 90.8%, 98.5%, 97.6%, 89.6% for Fe electrodes. Total operating costs were also found to be 6.43 €/cu m and 7.01 €/cu m for Al and Fe electrodes, respectively. These results indicated that the EC process using both types of electrodes ensure an efficient treatment of biodiesel wastewater in terms of oil and grease and TP.

AB  - Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODEn with n = 3–8) is a new biofuel that has a great potential to become one of the competitive alternative fuels for diesel engine. It also plays a crucial role in expansion of C1 chemical industry. Because PODE6–8 tends to precipitate in PODE3–8/diesel blends at low temperatures, it is very important to increase the selectivity to PODE3,4 and to decrease the selectivity to PODE6–8. Here a series of Lewis acids were used for the first time as catalyst to synthesize PODEn from methylal and trioxane. For the investigated Lewis acids, MgCl2 yielded the greatest selectivity to PODE3,4 and the smallest selectivity to PODE5–8. Similar selectivity to PODE3,4 and much lower selectivity to PODE5–8 can be achieved by using optimized reaction time and using MgCl2 in place of the traditional catalyst H2SO4 and ionic liquids catalysts [NOP][TFO] (1-octyl-2-pyrrolidinonium trifluoromethanesulfonate) and [NOP][DNBSA] (1-octyl-2-pyrrolidinonium 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate) as catalyst. In addition, these Lewis acids have many advantages over the traditional catalysts and ionic liquids catalysts, including low corrosiveness, high separability, and low cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalyst-type mixed metal oxides with different compositions and Co/Fe ratios were obtained from layered double hydroxides to be used as heterogeneous catalysts in the production of biodiesel. The effect of the Co/Fe ratio on the precursors of the catalysts was analyzed, considering their thermal, textural and structural properties. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric), X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and N2-physisorption. The conversion to biodiesel using the different catalysts obtained was determined by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and 1H-Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, allowing us to correlate the effect of the catalyst composition with the catalytic capacity. The conditions for obtaining biodiesel were optimized by selecting the catalyst and varying the percentage of catalyst, the methanol/oil ratio and the reaction time. The catalysts reached yields of conversion to biodiesel of up to 96% in 20 min of reaction using only 2% catalyst. The catalyst that showed the best catalytic activity contains a mixture of predominant crystalline and amorphous phases of CoFe2O4 and NaxCoO2. The results suggest that cobalt is a determinant in the activity of the catalyst when forming active sites in the crystalline network of mixed oxides for the transesterification of triglycerides, with high conversion capacity and selectivity to biodiesel. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The bio-oil was largely produced by thermal pyrolysis of Jatropha-derived biomass wastes (denoted as Jatropha bio-oil) using a pilot plant with a capacity of 20 kg h-1 at Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR), Thailand. Jatropha bio-oil is an unconventional type of bio-oil, which is mostly composed of fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters, fatty acid amides, and derivatives, and consequently, it contains large amounts of heteroatoms (oxygen ~20 wt.%, nitrogen ~ 5 wt.%, sulfur ~ 1000 ppm.). The heteroatoms, especially nitrogen, are highly poisonous to the metal or sulfide catalysts for upgrading of Jatropha bio-oil. To overcome this technical problem, we reported a stepwise strategy for hydrotreating of 100 wt.% Jatropha bio-oil over mesoporous sulfide catalysts (CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiMo/γ-Al2O3) to produce drop-in transport fuels, such as gasoline- and diesel-like fuels. This study is very different from our recent work on co-processing of Jatropha bio-oil (ca. 10 wt.%) with petroleum distillates to produce a hydrotreated oil as a diesel-like fuel. Jatropha bio-oil was pre-treated through a slurry-type high-pressure reactor under severe conditions, resulting in a pre-treated Jatropha bio-oil with relatively low amounts of heteroatoms (oxygen &lt; 20 wt.%, nitrogen &lt; 2 wt.%, sulfur &lt; 500 ppm.). The light and middle distillates of pre-hydrotreated Jatropha bio-oil were then separated by distillation at a temperature below 240 °C, and a temperature of 240–360 °C. Deep hydrotreating of light distillates over sulfide CoMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was performed on a batch-type high-pressure reactor at 350 °C and 7 MPa of H2 gas for 5 h. The hydrotreated oil was a gasoline-like fuel, which contained 29.5 vol.% of n-paraffins, 14.4 vol.% of iso-paraffins, 4.5 vol.% of olefins, 21.4 vol.% of naphthene compounds and 29.6 wt.% of aromatic compounds, and little amounts of heteroatoms (nearly no oxygen and sulfur, and less than 50 ppm of nitrogen), corresponding to an octane number of 44, and it would be suitable for blending with petro-gasoline. The hydrotreating of middle distillates over sulfide NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst using the same reaction condition produced a hydrotreating oil with diesel-like composition, low amounts of heteroatoms (no oxygen and less than 50 ppm of sulfur and nitrogen), and a cetane number of 60, which would be suitable for use in drop-in diesel fuel. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - For bio-H2 fermentation, the progress and H2 yield were significantly affected by culture pH. Our previous research found peanut shell powder (PSP, as supplementary substrate) having a buffer effect on the fermentative time prolongation and H2 yield enhancement. The acid buffer action (ABA), cation exchange capacity (CEC), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) were employed to explore the mechanism and structure changes of PSP. The superior ABA (57.44 ± 0.65 mmol/pH-kg) and CEC (112 ± 2.0 cmol/kg) of PSP, which provided high specific surface area and amorphous content, prolonged the fermentative time. The acidification of volatile fatty acids on PSP was effective to release reducing sugar and enhance hydrogen yield through breaking hemicellulose and amorphous components of cellulose, and enlarging specific surface area. The results indicated that buffer effect and acidification on PSP made positive effects on prolonging fermentation time and enhancing hydrogen yield. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) using an acidic catalyst is known to be effective for reducing lignocellulosic biomass recalcitrance. Post-hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater (PHW) from hydrothermal liquefaction of swine manure contains a large fraction of organic acids and thus was introduced to improve the HTP of cornstalk in this study. The response surface methodology was performed to optimize operating parameters of HTP for preserving structural polysaccharides while removing the barrier substances. A remarkable co-extraction of cell wall polymers was observed during PHW-catalyzed HTP at 172 °C for 88 min. The analysis of particle size, crystalline cellulose, the degree of polymerization (DP), mole number (MN) and SEM suggested that the co-extraction effect could distinctively alter lignocellulosic structures associated with recalcitrance and thus accelerate biomass saccharification. Additionally, the biodegradability of PHW was improved after HTP as a result of balanced nutrients and increased acids and sugars suitable for biogas production via anaerobic fermentation. © 2019

AB  - This work describes the characterization of esters derived from waste frying oil, sewage scum, and domestic fat trap residue. The innovative aspects of this work include the use of domestic fatty residues, study of the influence of the gas chromatography injection conditions on correct determination of the esters content, and the use of deactivated silica to purify esters from alternative sources in order to be able to classify them as biodiesel. Thermogravimetric analyses of the samples showed mass losses characteristic of evaporation and ester decomposition, which could be correlated with the esters content. Infrared spectra showed no significant OH, indicative of low acid values. The esters contents were determined by gas chromatography, with C17:0 and C18:1 esters as external standards, in accordance with the EN 14103:2003/2011 and NBR 15764:2015 methodologies. Better responses for the quantification of esters content were achieved using a PTV injector, rather than an isothermal injector, and heptane as the solvent in the analysis. The initial esters contents of the materials were between 86 and 98%. Deactivated silica was used as an adsorbent to remove undesirable contaminants, so that the esters contents of the samples complied with the minimum value required by legislation (&gt;96.5%). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The synthesis of biodiesel using rubber seed oil by a transesterification reaction using cement clinker catalysts was studied. The mineral composition and morphology of both the catalysts were analysed using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance studies were used to find the Fatty acid methyl ester content and various compounds of esters in the synthesised biodiesel, which showed an efficient conversion of rubber seed oil to biodiesel. The highest yield of 80% was obtained from calcium oxide catalyst (1.5 g) activated at 50°C with a methanol-to-oil ratio of 6:1. The highest yield of 70% biodiesel was obtained using a cement clinker catalyst (0.5 g) activated at 50°C with a methanol-to-oil ratio of 6:1. The significant physical properties of biodiesel flash point, acid value and saponification value were found, and the results are within the American standard test method (ASTM D6751) limits. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Various research works are being undertaken around the world on the subject of thermal efficiency improvisation and emission reduction from diesel engines. This research work analyzes the performance and emission characteristics of a thermal barrier coated diesel engine which used palm biodiesel. The piston and cylinder liners were coated with equal percentages of alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) and yittria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powder using plasma spraying coating method. The piston was coated with 100 μm thickness and the two cylinder liners were coated with 150 and 200 μm thicknesses and were used to analyze the performance and emission characteristics. Test results of the thermal barrier coated engine using palm biodiesel were compared with the results derived from the base engine. The tests revealed an increase of 3.8% specific fuel consumption (SFC) as an average when neat palm biodiesel was used in the base engine. Interestingly, the palm biodiesel used in the 150- and 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine was responsible for a significant decrease of the SFC by an average of 4.18% and 8.05% respectively. The brake thermal efficiency was found to decrease on an average of 1.02% when tests were run using the neat palm biodiesel in the base engine. But an average proportionate increase of 0.72% and 2.19% was visible when palm biodiesel was used in the tests conducted on the 150- and 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine. There was also an understandable brake specific reduction of 0.991 g/kWh carbon monoxide (CO) emission and 0.025 g/kWh unburned hydrocarbon (HC) levels. The nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emission was observed as 14.06 g/kWh in the 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine which was slightly higher when the results were compared with that of the uncoated engine. The novelty of this research investigation is based on the usage of yttrium-stabilized zirconia and alumina thermal barrier coating on the cylinder liner and piston head of engine. This is justified due to the fact that most of the previous investigations undertaken focused on the thermal barrier coating in the piston, valve, and cylinder head alone. The utility factor of the palm biodiesel (B 100) in the low heat rejection engine has also proved to be another significant and novel factor in the present investigation outlined in this paper. This is mainly due to the fact that the ongoing investigations in this realm concentrated only on blends of 20 to 30% of palm biodiesel with diesel fuel in the low heat rejection diesel engine. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper was to study whether un-preheated blends of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) with commercial high speed diesel (CHSD) without adding any solvent to improve cold flow property could be used as a diesel substitute. In this work, PFAD-CHSD blends, 0–100 wt.% with 10 wt.% interval, were prepared by simple splash blending; their long-term phase behaviors at room temperature were observed; and, for the blends of interest, their important fuel properties were tested and their comparative use in a single cylinder diesel engine without preheating was evaluated at 2200 rpm with loads of 1.28–5.09 kW. Although PFAD had poor cold flow property, long-term stable liquid blends of PFAD ≤10 wt.% could be prepared. According to Thai standards, almost properties of these blends were suitable to use as a diesel substitute except acid values but their copper strip corrosions were similar to that of CHSD, No. 1a. The 5 and 10 wt.% PFAD blends were able to operate the tested engine in the same manner as CHSD with comparable performance, significantly lower smoke, slightly lower carbon monoxide, and significantly higher nitrogen oxides. In conclusion, the blends (PFAD ≤10 wt.%) are recommended to use as a simple cost-effective diesel substitute. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current study investigates the combustion performance of straight algae oil (AO) in a 7-kW lab-scale gas turbine burner enabled by a novel twin-fluid injector, named Swirl-burst (SB) injector. The chemical structure (fatty acid profile), the physical, and chemical properties of AO are acquired to understand the combustibility of the oil as a potential biofuel. Effects of equivalence ratio (ER) and atomizing air to liquid mass ratio (ALR) across the injector on the global combustion characteristics are investigated at a constant heat release rate for the oil. The features of interest include visual flame images, product gas temperature, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the combustor exit. Results show that mono-unsaturated fatty acid is predominant in the composition of the oil, suggesting possibly short ignition delay. AO has a heating value comparable to that of diesel but with a high kinematic viscosity (approximately 16 times more viscous than diesel). Clean combustion highly depends on fine sprays that lead to fast fuel pre-vaporization, thorough fuel-air mixing, and thus clean premixed combustion. Conventional injectors such as air blast (AB) atomizers cannot finely atomize viscous oils for clean combustion due to the low viscosity tolerance. Fortunately, with the SB injection, clean, complete, and lean-premixed combustion of straight AO has been successfully achieved without fuel preheating at most of the investigated cases, reasonably reflecting the fine atomization capability of the SB injector even for the viscous oil. The blue flames, overlapping temperature profiles, and low emissions of CO and NOx consistently show the clean lean-premixed AO flames. Stable and clean flames are obtained at ERs of 0.60–0.75 (with the optimum ER identified at 0.65, in terms of flame stability and low emissions), and a blow-out limit at the ER of about 0.55. At the ER of 0.65, clean and lean-premixed flames are also acquired for all the tested ALRs (2.0–5.0). Increase in ALR varies the SAA and spray behavior of the SB injection as well as the aerodynamic interaction between fuel and oxidizer. The increasing ALR results in dominantly blue flames and decrease in CO and NOx concentrations, less than 10 ppm at ALRs > 2.5, due to finer atomization and better fuel-air mixing at the higher ALRs, and thus enhanced premixed combustion. Overall, clean and stable lean-premixed combustion of straight AO is achieved without fuel preheating using the novel SB injector despite the high fuel viscosity. The SB injection potentially enables AO itself as a cost-effective and near-zero-emission biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is an important platform chemical and a sustainable choice in the field of biofuels and bioplastics. The past decade has witnessed significant advancements in the production of 5-HMF using edible feedstocks, like glucose and fructose, with good success. In this investigation, we discuss ‘green’ synthesis of 5-HMF from chitosan using a combination of homogenous and heterogeneous catalyses. Catalysts were screened and the effect of various parameters such as concentrations of chitosan and the catalysts, concentration of acetic acid, reaction temperature and reaction time were studied to identify the process conditions giving maximum yield of 5-HMF. It was found that H-β-zeolite in combination with a minimal concentration of acetic acid resulted in maximum yield, which ranges from 15.27 to 28.22% of 5-HMF, depending on the molecular weight of the parent polymer. Our investigation involves usage of solid acid catalysts, environmentally benign solvents and crustacean waste as the starting material making the process ‘green’ and sustainable.

AB  - Alkaline Ca-bentonite, obtained upon acid activation and base load of natural bentonite, has a good anion exchange capability. Glu-modified alkaline Ca-bentonites were further prepared by covalent binding with glutamic acid for the immobilization of lipase OF from Candida cylindracea. The obtained immobilized lipase demonstrated a significantly higher catalytic activity than that of unmodified alkaline Ca-bentonite, giving a specific activity of 62.1 U mg −1 protein, twice that of the unmodified carrier, and a total activity of 391.2 U g −1 support, retaining ~ 82.3% of the activity after being reused five times for olive oil emulsion hydrolysis. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy assays demonstrated the successful immobilization of the lipase on the surface of the bentonite. Upon immobilization, the thermostability of the lipase improved remarkably. At 50 °C, free lipase retained only 6.0% of its initial activity at 6 h, in comparison with 15% for Ca-Bent-lipase and 50% for Glu-Ca-Bent-lipase after 8 h. The Glu-Ca-Bent-lipase is proved as an effective biocatalyst for the biodiesel preparation, improving the transesterification reaction conversion from 52.8% in the condition of free lipase to 99.9% and keeping at 56.2% after being reused five times, while the free lipase was inactive upon two reuses. The above results provide a new route in the use of inexpensive bentonite for the enzyme immobilization. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work evaluates the potential of a series hybrid vehicle concept that combines low temperature combustion (LTC)and biofuels as power source. To do this, experimental data from a previous work obtained in a single-cylinder engine running under ethanol-diesel dual-fuel combustion is used. Then, vehicle systems simulations are used to estimate performance and emissions of the LTC hybrid vehicle and compare them versus conventional diesel combustion (CDC). The vehicle selected to perform the simulations is the Opel Vectra, which equips the compression ignition engine used in the experimental tests. The results from the simulations used for the analysis are firstly optimized by combining design of experiments and the Kriging fitting method. The multi-objective optimization allows to determine some characteristics and controls of the hybrid vehicle. The comparison of the estimated performance and emissions of the LTC-hybrid concept versus CDC over the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC)and real driving cycle (RDE)revealed clear benefits in terms of energy consumption, CO2 and NOx and soot emissions. In this sense, the hybrid concept enabled a reduction of the final energy consumed of 3% in the RDE cycle and 6.5% in the WLTC as compared to CDC. In terms of engine-out emissions, the CO2 was reduced around 16% versus CDC, and engine-out NOx and soot were reduced below the levels imposed by the Euro 6 regulation. As a penalty, the engine-out HC and CO emissions increased to more than double than CDC. However, based on previous experimental results, it is expected that a conventional diesel oxidation catalyst can reduce the tail-pipe HC and CO levels below the Euro 6 limits. © 2019

AB  - Catalyzed hydrothermal carbonization (CHTC) was used to produce hydrochar biofuel from wood chips at 240 °C in 1 h batches that included recycling of the process liquid. Infrared spectra showed changes in the chemical structure consistent with dehydration and decarboxylation. The CHTC hydrochar had higher heating values (HHV) of 28.3 MJ/kg, energy yield of 64%, and hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) and oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios similar to those of coal. The same process without the catalyst (HTC) produced a hydrochar with HHV of 27 MJ/kg, energy yield of 57%, and H/C and O/C ratios similar to those of lignite. Partial recycling of the CHTC process liquid resulted in a 5% increase in the energy yield; elemental composition, HHV, and scanning electron microscopic images of the CHTC hydrochar for different recycles were indistinguishable. Densified CHTC hydrochar pellets were 97% durable and hydrophobic when compared with wood pellets and torrefied-wood pellets, which was shown by water ingress measurements using an electrochemical cell with pellet electrodes. The CHTC process with recycling has the potential to provide a green hydrochar biofuel with excellent handling, storage, and transportation properties, that could be a suitable direct replacement for coal. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Highly phenol substituted bio-oil–phenol–formaldehyde (BPF) adhesives were prepared via the phenolization-copolymerization method, in which furfural was used as a novel crosslinking agent to improve the bonding performance. The effects of bio-oil percentage, furfural content, curing temperature, and pressure on the performance of BPF adhesives have been studied in detail. A BPF adhesive with 75% bio-oil percentage and 15% furfural loading (named 75BPF_15) was synthesized, which was cured at 180 °C and 4 MPa. Compared to the conventional phenol–formaldehyde adhesive, the wet tensile strength of 75BPF_15 adhesive reached 2.84 MPa, which was significantly higher than the 1.54 MPa of PF. A possible mechanism of BPF adhesives crosslinked with furfural is proposed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2019, 136, 46995. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The fabrication of nanoparticles has been perused as a topic of critical importance in the present decades. Biosynthesis of nanoparticles employs plants extract instead of harmful chemicals. These plant extracts act as reducing and capping agents which is the most appropriate and eco-friendly method among all the preparative routs. In present study, the magnetite nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 -NPs) were fabricated using rapid, single step and benign biosynthetic rout by reduction of ferric nitrate nonahydrate solution with Ferocactus echidne aqueous extract containing ascorbic acid as a main reducing and capping agent. The structural and morphological properties of prepared iron oxide nanoparticles were investigated by Powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The size of the synthesized nanoparticles was approximately 15 ± 2 nm as determined by Scherrer equation. The biosynthetically fabricated nanoparticles were employed as catalyst for pyrolysis of nutshells to produce biofuel. Catalytic pyrolysis of biomass yields biofuel as an alternative source of energy and chemical feed stock. Effect of temperature, heating rate, and amount of catalyst were investigated on conversion percentage and product yields. Aniline point, carbon residue, and cetane number of prepared bio-oil were also determined. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The demand for bioenergy (biofuels, heat and electricity) is increasing steadily around the globe. Major policy-related interventions for adoption and promotion of bioenergy have also been realized by several countries over the past few decades. The biomass supply chain incorporates several components of bioenergy production, which in turn consist of several activities for which different alternative methods are available. Different components of the biomass supply chain include production of bioenergy feedstock (biomass), logistics of biomass, conversion of biomass to bioenergy, and distribution of bioenergy or bioenergy carriers for end use. The single largest limiting factor for the production of bioenergy is the unavailability of biomass. Dedicated, fast-growing and high-biomass-producing plantations on non-arable land and utilization of agro-industrial waste materials can overcome this problem. Holistic integration of different components of the biomass supply chain and activities involved therein along with judicious design are likely to enhance the quantum of energy return, improve the greenhouse gas balance and reduce the water footprint of the bioenergy production facility. Additionally, the emerging yet promising concept of lignocellulosic and algal biorefinery would require a careful and prudent design of the biomass supply chain to achieve one of the most attractive characteristic of bioenergy: environmental sustainability. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The lignocellulosic hydrolysate was used as the fermentation feedstock of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa Y-MG1 for the production of microbial lipids as the potential raw material for biodiesel synthesis. On synthetic media and under nitrogen-limiting condition, the Y-MG1 strain produces 2.13 g/L of lipids corresponding to 32.7% of lipid content. This strain was able to assimilate a wide range of substrates, especially C5 and C6 sugars as well as glycerol and sucrose. Fatty acid composition shows a divergence depending on the nature of used carbon source with a predominance of oleic acid or linoleic acid. An effective hydrolysis process, based on diluted acid treatment, was established for providing the maximum of fermentable sugars from different characterized lignocellulosic wastes. The highest yield of reducing sugars (56.6 g/L) could be achieved when wheat bran was used as the raw material. Hydrolysate detoxification step was not required in this study since the Y-MG1 strain was shown to grow and produce lipids in the presence of inhibitors and without the addition of external elements. Operating by controlled fed-batch fermentation yielded a dry biomass and oil yield of up to 11 g/L and 38.7% (w/w), respectively. The relative fatty acid composition showed the presence of increased levels of monounsaturated (66.8%) and saturated (23.4%) fatty acids in lipids of Y-MG1 grown on wheat bran. The predictive determination of biodiesel properties suggests that this oil may effectively be used for biodiesel production. © 2019 Ines Ayadi et al.

AB  - Electrochemical coupling of redox enzyme reactions, called bioelectrocatalysis, has been attracting great attention over the last four decades. It has become an important technology that can be applied to a wide range of bioelectrochemical devices including biosensors, biofuel cells, and bioreactors. This article presents an overview of the basic concepts of steady-state catalytic waves of mediated- and direct electron transfer (DET)-type bioelectrocatalysis. Several equations that can be used for the analysis of steady-state waves are introduced. The analysis may provide important thermodynamic and kinetic parameters that can be used not only for performance evaluation of the devices but also for fundamental research on the enzymes. Important progress made on how to tune electrode surfaces and enzymes for DET-type reactions are presented. Applications to bioelectrochemical devices are also summarized with emphasis on the achievements recorded in our research group. © The Electrochemical Society of Japan, All rights reserved.

AB  - In the current research study camelina non edible oil (CO) was used as renewable feedstock for production of jet fuel by hydroconversion processes. The vegetable oil was mixed with straight run gas oil (SRGO) at 10, 15 and 20 % ratio. The hydrotreating experiments were carried out in micropilot plant flow reactor over NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst at 350oC and 380oC, 80 bar pressure 1h-1 and 1.5 h-1 liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV). The research focuses on the influence of the SRGO-CO ratio, temperature and LHSV on the yields and the physiochemical properties of the biojet (160-300oC) obtained. The hydrotreating reactions which occur during the process, produce 36-45% wt jet yields but bad flow properties due to the n-paraffins with 13-20 carbon atoms in molecules obtained from hydrogenation of vegetable oil. These characteristics can be corrected by hydroisomerisation. The results show that the hydrotreatment of CO and SRGO-CO mixtures are an alternative for biofuel production with characteristics similar to jet fuel. © 2019 SYSCOM 18 S.R.L.. All rights reserved.

AB  - The production of biofuels and chemicals by hydrogenation of furfural has attracted much attention recently. Herein the effect of Na+ doping on the catalytic performance of Pd/SiO2 in hydrogenation and reductive-etherification of furfural in ethanol was systematically studied. Two Pd/SiO2 catalysts with and without the modification by Na+ were prepared by impregnation and calcination. Their catalytic properties were compared for the hydrogenation of furfural and furfural diethyl acetal under mild conditions. The silanol groups on Pd/SiO2 catalysed the acetalization of furfural and alcohol and the resulted acetal underwent hydrogenolysis on Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with an average particle size of 8 nm, leading to a moderate yield (∼58%) of furfuryl ethyl ether. Doping Na+ on Pd/SiO2 led to the diminishing of silanol groups as well as strong interaction between Na+ and Pd NPs. No acetalization occurred on Na+ modified Pd/SiO2 due to the exchange of H+ of Si-OH with Na+, thus the reductive etherification of CO group in furfural was completely inhibited. Meanwhile the hydrogenation of furan-ring over Na+ coordinated Pd NPs could proceed with very high selectivity (&gt;90%) forming tetrahydrofurfural in high yield. Kinetics study on the hydrogenation of furfural diethyl acetal over Pd/SiO2 and Na+ doped Pd/SiO2 suggested that the Na+ greatly impeded the hydrogenolysis of C-O-C bond of acetal, while the hydrogenation of the furan ring took place selectively.

AB  - The present research examined the feasibility of cultivating Chlorella pyrenoidosa in pickle industry wastewater for simultaneous nutrient removal and lipid production. The characteristics of microalgae growth, nutrient removal, lipid accumulation and composition of C. pyrenoidosa cultivated in pickle wastewater with different dilution ratios were investigated. The results showed the maximum algae biomass concentration of 1.57 ± 0.12 g L1 was achieved in non-diluted pickle wastewater with the highest biomass productivity of 170.65 mg L1 day1. Maximum nutrient removal efficiency was observed in 20.0% pickle wastewater with removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and NH4-N at 84.67%, 92.46%, 85.82% and 93.42%, respectively. The lipid content of C. pyrenoidosa growing in pickle wastewater ranged from 29.73% to 31.78%, with a highest lipid productivity of 57.23 mg L1 day1. The relative content of triolefinic acids (C16:3 and C18:3) decreased while the monoenoic acids (C16:1 and C18:1) increased synchronously with the pickle wastewater concentration. Unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters were the main components, ranging from 73.04% to 77.6%. The biodiesel properties satisfied the major specifications in US and European biodiesel standards. The results indicated that C. pyrenoidosa is a promising species for nutrient removal together with lipid production in pickle industry wastewater. © IWA Publishing 2019.

AB  - Biofuel cell (BFC) electrodes are typically manufactured by combining enzymes that act as catalysts with conductive carbon nanomaterials in a form of enzyme-nanocomposite. However, a little attention has been paid to effects of the carbon nanomaterials' structural properties on the electrochemical performances of the enzyme-nanocomposites. This work aims at studying the effects of surface and bulk properties of carbon nanomaterials with different degrees of graphitization on the electrochemical performances of glucose oxidase (GOx)-nanocomposites produced by immobilizing GOx within a network of carbon nanopaticles. Two types of carbon nanomaterials were used: graphitized mesoporous carbon (GMC) and purified mesoporous carbon (PMC). Graphitization index, surface functional groups, hydrophobic properties, and rate of aggregation were measured for as-received and acid-treated GMC and PMC samples by using Raman spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurement, and dynamic light scattering (DLS), respectively. In addition to these physical property characterizations, the enzyme loading and electrochemical performances of the GOx-nanocomposites were studied via elemental analysis and cyclic voltammetry tests, respectively. We also fabricated BFCs using our GOx-nanocomposite materials as the enzyme anodes, and tested their performances by obtaining current-voltage (IV) plots. Our findings suggest that the electrochemical performance of GOx-nanocomposite material is determined by the combined effects of graphitization index, electrical conductivity and surface chemistry of carbon nanomaterials. © 2019 Garcia-Perez, Hu, Wee, Scudiero, Hoffstater, Kim and Ha.

AB  - In this study, K/Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 nanocatalyst was synthesized and used in the transesterification of waste cooking oil for biodiesel production. The effects of three operating parameters–reaction time, catalyst concentration, and methanol-to-oil molar ratio –on the biodiesel yield were studied using response surface methodology (RSM). A reduced cubic equation was established as a suitable and best-fitting model to predict the response with high accuracy. The results showed that the catalyst loading significantly affected the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield. The highest biodiesel yield of 99% was obtained under the optimal conditions of reaction time 7.84 hours, catalyst concentration 4.60 wt.%, and methanol-to-oil molar ratio 9.73. The catalyst recyclability was evaluated in two successive cycles. Different characterization methods such as XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller), TGA (Thermogeravimetric Analysis), GC-MASS (Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry) were utilized for the synthesized catalysts and final biodiesel products. The synthesized heterogeneous magnetic catalysts were easily separated from the biofuel product. This ease of catalyst separation, in comparison with homogeneous catalyst, effectively reduces industrial biofuel production costs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In order to optimize the conditions for the biofuels production by a hydrotreatment process, three platinum catalysts supported on different zeolites were evaluated. The three zeolites used for the hydrotreatment of soybean oil were USY (CBV-780), H-β and ZSM-5, impregnated with a 1 % platinum salt solution. The functional groups of the catalysts were analyzed by infrared transmission spectroscopy, the condition of the pores by scanning electron microscopy and, it was employed X-ray diffraction to determine the crystal structure. Subsequently, these catalysts were employed to hydrotreat some soybean oil samples of 80 mL, in a 300 mL reactor, operating at 525 K, 2500 kPa, and a H2/N2 molar ratio of 30 % for 6 h. Some gas chromatography analyses carried out over the synthesized biofuels evidenced that Zeolite H-β presents the best characteristics for the production of a biofuel with most similar properties to the currently employed fossil fuels.

AB  - This paper investigates the spatial heterogeneity of landowners’ willingness to supply three bioenergy crops: switchgrass, Miscanthus, and willow, in the northeastern United States. Spatial heterogeneity might arise for several reasons. For example, landowners closer to bioenergy processing plants might be more likely to be willing to supply bioenergy crops, and landowners who are more willing to supply bioenergy crops may be spatially clustered because they share similar land attributes, demographics, experiences, and/or values. Using high-resolution GIS data related to the location of pellet plants utilizing bioenergy crops and survey data related to landowners’ characteristics including spatial location, we estimate a spatial probit model to explain the variation in individual-specific reservation prices (RPs)—the feedstock price at which landowners become willing to supply a bioenergy crop. We find that respondents’ RP is lower the closer they live to their nearest pellet plant and spatial dependency is only present for switchgrass supply. We also identify three economic hotspots (areas with high potential supply and low RPs) for each bioenergy crop. We believe that bioenergy supply chains could be developed around these hotspots. © 2019 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Sulfur recovery from organic molecules such as toxic sulfones is an actual problem, and its solution through the use of environmentally friendly and nature-like processes looks attractive for research and application. For the first time, the possible bioconversion of organic sulfones (benzo-and dibenzothiophene sulfones) to inorganic sulfide under anaerobic conditions with simultaneous biogas production from glucose within a methanogenesis process is demonstrated. Biogas with a methane content of 50.7%-82.1% was obtained without H2S impurities. Methanogenesis with 99.7%-100% efficiency and 97.8%-100% conversion of benzo- and dibenzothiophene sulfones (up to 0.45 mM) to inorganic sulfide were obtained in eight days by using a combination of various anaerobic biocatalysts immobilized in a poly(vinyl alcohol) cryogel. Pure cell cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria and/or H2-producing bacteria were tested as additives to the methanogenic activated sludge. The immobilized activated sludge "enhanced" by bacterial additives appeared to retain its properties and be usable multiple times for the conversion of sulfones under batch conditions. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In line with society's growing need for a more sustainable fuel economy, various biofuels and alternative fuel formulations are being proposed. In this work, the ignition quality of a novel tricomponent advanced biofuel is examined. Ethyl levulinate, diethyl ether and ethanol (EL/DEE/EtOH) result from the acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in ethanol. In this paper, derived cetane numbers are established for a wide variety of blend fractions, using Ignition Quality Tester measurements. EL/DEE/EtOH mixtures of ignition quality equivalent to market diesel and gasoline are identified. One mixture of Motor Octane Number (MON) 88.3 and Research Octane Number (RON) 95 is selected for detailed analysis in comparison to a FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) gasoline, as a representative of petroleum-derived gasoline, with a similar MON of 88.8 and RON of 94.4. Ignition delay times for the EL/DEE/EtOH gasoline fuel are measured using a rapid compression machine at equivalence ratios of 0.5 and 1.0, at 20 and 40 bar over a temperature range of 600-900 K. The data shows that at temperatures &gt;800 K, the EL/DEE/EtOH fuel behaves quite similar to the petroleum derived gasoline, FACE-F. However, the tri-component biofuel shows a dramatically truncated extent of ignition reactivity at lower temperatures, with a total absence of low-temperature chemistry or negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region; in this respect this biofuel blend is very different to conventional gasoline. To understand this differing behaviour, a detailed chemical kinetic model is developed. Analysis of this model shows that ignition of the EL/DEE/EtOH blend is inhibited by the dominance of alkyl radical elimination pathways, which leads to a heightened rate of production of HO 2 radicals. At high temperatures, while both fuels maintain a similar ignition delay time, the sensitivity analysis and the radical pool population shows that a different combustion mechanism is occurring for the EL/DEE/EtOH fuel, where ethyl and methyl radicals play a much more prominent role in the ignition process. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Finding renewable energy sources as alternatives to petroleum-based fuels is a current global challenge. One approach to address the energy shortage problem is through biofuels. A promising family of biofuels that has many of the needed fuel characteristics is terpenes. Herein we present a combined theoretical and statistical model for calculating inherent thermodynamic properties of several promising terpenes, which show high compatibility with many criteria of petroleum-based fuels. We use density functional theory and ab initio quantum chemistry methods to compute the enthalpy of combustion, enthalpy of vaporization, enthalpy of formation, cetane number, boiling point and vapor pressure for a range of terpenes with good accuracy. The current in silico study presents a promising strategy for finding suitable petroleum substitutes, while avoiding costly experimental trial and error approaches. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this paper, we report the catalytic cracking of soybean oil for biofuel over γ-Al2O3/CaO composite catalysts. The influence of catalysts, cracking temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on the products distribution were investigated. The maximum yield (70.0 wt.%) of biofuel with low acid value (6.7 mg KOH g-1) and oxygen content (5.6%), as well as high calorific value (44.2 MJ kg-1) was achieved over 35 wt.% γ-Al2O3/CaO at 480 °C and 3.72 h-1. The paper focused on the variation of biofuel composition and cracking pathway caused by γ-Al2O3/CaO composite catalysts via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. Calcium oxide would react with fatty acid to yield calcium carboxylates at 300-350 °C, which were subsequently decomposed into hydrocarbons (57.9 wt.%) and ketones (22.6 wt.%) at 415-510 °C. As for 35 wt.% γ-Al2O3/CaO, the addition of γ-Al2O3 was beneficial to generate alkenes (38.2 wt.%), arenes (10.6 wt.%) and alcohols (12.3 wt.%) with ketones decreasing (16.5 wt.%) via γ-hydrogen transfer reaction and disproportination. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Metal-induced microwave-assisted pyrolysis followed by ex-situ catalytic upgrading of vapors using a packed HZSM-5 bed was designed and investigated for the production of upgraded bio-oil from peanut shells. Effects of the pyrolysis method, catalyst bed temperature, and microwave power on both the product yield and the chemical composition of bio-oil were investigated. Results showed that compared with conventional pyrolysis, microwave-metal-assisted pyrolysis promoted the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons, which could be further enhanced by applying ex situ HZSM-5 bed. The catalyst bed temperature has a significant effect on the product yield, bio-oil chemical profile and coke deposits on catalyst. The bio-oil yield reached its maximum value (5.6 wt.%) at 600 °C, with the proportion of oxygen-free hydrocarbons of 67% and coke deposits of 0.6%. With the further increase of temperature to 700 °C, the proportion of oxygen-free hydrocarbons increased to 77%, that of coke deposits decreased to 0.5%, and that of the bio-oil yield decreased to 4.7 wt.%. Besides the catalyst bed temperature, higher microwave power led to higher bio-oil yield; however, the proportion of oxygen-free components decreased slightly owing to the reduction in contact time. Considering the outstanding performance in bio-oil deoxygenation, this work provides an important reference for bio-oil upgrading technology development. © 2018

AB  - The enzymatic route is a promising strategy to synthesize biodiesel essentially because of its moderate reaction conditions and easy product separation. Additionally, coupling the biodegradation of agro-industrial raw materials and waste products with the enzyme production has also had a significant impact on the development of industrial biotechnology. This is mainly due to the low-cost and the prevention of pollution they represent. In this work, different kinds of residues and wastes were used for tuning biomass-bound lipolytic biocatalysts from Aspergillus niger MYA 135 by submerged fermentation using the Plackett-Burman design. As a result, by a specific combination of medium components, two distinctive biocatalysts were obtained. Thus, the production of a mycelium-bound esterase was maximized in the presence of (in g l−1): CaCl2 0.5, FeCl3 1.0, corn meal 2.0, cerelose 10.0, peptone 10.0, and waste cooking oil 10.0. While, the production of a mycelium-bound lipase was selectively increased in the presence of (in g l−1): molasses 5.0, vinasse 5.0, CaCl2 0.5, FeCl3 1.0, milk serum 10.0, cerelose 5.0, peptone 5.0 and waste cooking oil 10.0. Besides, the biomass-bound lipase activity produced in the optimized culture medium was also prepared either free or immobilized in alginate beads, and then individually placed in small-scaled packed-bed reactors to produce biodiesel compounds in a solvent-free system using soybean oil and butanol as substrates. After a three-stepwise addition of butanol, a biodiesel conversion of 57.32 and 95.89% was reached in the presence of free and immobilized biomass, respectively. Biocatalysts morphologies were also analyzed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Deforestation and uncontrolled emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) through abundant use of fossil fuels result global warming. This serious threat to the atmosphere has deeply motivated the researchers to develop new strategies for chemical fixation of CO2 and biofuel synthesis. Here we report the sulfonated porous polytriphenylamine (SPPTPA-1, BET surface area of 664 m2 g−1, pore volume 0.386 cc g−1) as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via CO2 fixation into epoxides. SPPTPA-1 catalyst contains pores with dimension of 1.8-2.0 nm, which produced a H1 type hysteresis loop in N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm. The porous catalyst is thermally stable upto 196 °C. The synthesized SPPTPA-1 catalyst contains large amount of surface acidic sites. Further, it catalyzes the esterification reaction of levulinic acid, long chain fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids due to presence of its acidic sites. This solid acid catalyst SPPTPA-1 showed excellent recycling efficiency upto 5 times in all these demanding reactions. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Efficient conversion of renewable biomass platform chemicals into high-quality fuels remains challenging. A one-pot catalytic approach has been developed to synthesize various structurally defined biofuels by using Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C for selective tandem catalysis and 2-methylfuran (2-MF) as a renewable feedstock. 2-MF first undergoes Lewis acid-catalyzed hydroxyalkylation/alkylation (HAA) condensation with carbonyl compounds to afford intermediates containing the targeted carbon skeletons of hydrocarbon or ether products, and these intermediates then undergo hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation to afford the target products, catalyzed by metal triflate+Pd/C in the same pot. The present process can produce structurally defined alkanes and cyclic ethers under mild conditions. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Ni-loaded Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 catalysts were prepared by a co-precipitation method and subsequently employed in the deoxygenation of oleic acid under solvent-free conditions. Among the prepared catalysts, the 20 wt% Ni-Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity, i.e., 98.3% oleic acid conversion, with 33.9% C9-C17 selectivity, and a 95.7% oxygen removal rate. The basic fuel properties of the obtained products were then examined to determine their potential for use in a diesel engine. The product produced using the 20 wt% Ni-Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 catalyst exhibited a particularly high calorific value (i.e., 10213 cal/g, similar to that of commercial diesel, i.e., 10220 cal/g), the lowest viscosity (25.2cP), and the lowest solidification temperature (−15 °C). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of the present work was focused on optimizing the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Spirulina platensis catalyzed by Fe3O4 nanostructures to enhance the bio-oil yield and quality of bio-oil using response surface methodology (RSM). The structural morphology and crystalline nature of the synthesized catalyst was determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Three of the vital reaction parameters such as temperature, holding time and catalyst dosage were optimized through central composite design. A maximum bio-oil yield of 32.33% was observed for the high temperature at 320 °C, 0.75 g of catalyst dosage and 37 min of resident time. The maximum conversion was found at a lower temperature of 272 °C, the bio-oil yield of 27.66% was obtained with 0.45 g of catalyst dosage and 24 min of holding time which is an energy efficient optimum condition. The maximum bio-oil yield was influenced at a lower temperature due to the high catalytic activity. While compared to higher temperatures were not much influence was observed. It clearly states that the catalyst dosage playing a critical role in the lower temperature HTL reaction. GC-MS and FT-IR analysis of the produced bio-oil exhibits significant characteristics for biofuel applications. The Fe3O4 catalyst was recyclable for up to eight repeated cycles and constant bio-oil yield for the last four cycles. It shows the excellent reproduction ability towards HTL of Spirulina sp. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: The recent bio-based economy directions towards the renewable energy development result in an overwhelming compulsion to identify new environmental friendly processes for biomass conversion. Combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis have been identified as promising thermo-chemical conversion techniques for energy and biofuels production. However, many drawbacks need to be solved for developing their applications at large scale. Among the various problematics, the influence of inorganics on char gasification reactivity remains an open issue. Hence, the effect of alkaline and alkali earth metal (potassium and calcium) under different CO2 concentrations (20–100%) have been here investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis. Surprisingly, the presence of calcium did not improve the reactivity as expected, but a decrease in the gasification kinetics was observed, when compared to the gasification of the char obtained from washed biomass containing a lower amount of calcium species. On the other hand, K-species clearly act as activators, in particular at high char conversion ratios. The char gasification rate was higher at high CO2 concentration for all samples, and the effect of CO2 concentration was maximized for the K-enriched char.

AB  - Via the crosslinking of chitosan and sulfosuccinic acid (SSA), the acidic chitosan membrane (ACM) was prepared for biodiesel production from esterification of oleic acid and methanol. ATR-FTIR, TGA, XRD, SEM and EDX were applied to characterize the prepared ACM. The acidic site density and swelling capacity of the prepared ACM were investigated. The ACM possessed the 4.62 mmol/g of acidic site density, which was just a little less than 4.76 mmol/g of Amberlyst-15, meanwhile, ACM was proven to be much higher than Amberlyst-15 in swelling capacity. Under the same reaction, the 98.76% of conversion can be obtained while the Amberlyst-15 only reached 44.30%. The optimization of process variables was conducted by the combination of single factor experiment and Box-Behnken design (BBD) response surface methodology. The catalytic activity of ACM in different esterification of fatty acids and alcohols was also investigated. And the catalytic mechanism of esterification catalyzed by ACM was clarified. Based on the catalytic mechanism, the kinetic model was established to describe the esterification and obtain relevant kinetic parameters (Ea+, Ea−, A+ and A-), meanwhile, the kinetic results were compared to the same reaction with different catalysts in detail. Besides, the reusability of the prepared ACM was studied. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The approach of combining the microalgae cultivation with wastewater provides a cost-effective and eco-friendly perspective in the production of microalgae-based bio-products. In the present investigation, microalgae Scenedesmus rubescens KACC 2 isolated from catchment region of River Noyyal was found to be efficient in removing nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals from industrial and domestic effluents, which was optimized through central composite design matrix for higher biomass generation. Nutrient requirements for the growth were optimized and evaluated using Plackett–Burman design to check the effect of variables. Three variables, viz., nitrate, phosphate, and inoculums, were found to be significant among the 11 variables tested, and the interaction between these variables and its optimum concentrations were statistically studied using central composite design matrix. The optimized growth conditions of this strain were found to be as nitrate (0.2%), phosphate (0.018%), and inoculums (7.5%). These conditions yielded a higher biomass of 0.73 g/L from the optimized media which was 5.4 times higher than the regular growth media. FT-IR analysis showed the variations in the spectra and also in biomolecular composition with 2-fold increase in the lipid and protein region when grown in optimized culture conditions. Lipid profile showed the presence of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the biomass accepting it as a source of energy feedstock. This study concludes that nitrate, phosphate, and inoculums play a significant role in biomass production of S. rubescens with phycoremediation potential that can be exploited for simultaneous wastewater treatment–coupled biomass production. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The underlying structure in apparently “randomly-packed” packed beds is a subject of topical interest, particularly in the context of deep processing, such as deep hydrodesulfurization. Packed beds typically exhibit “packing defects”; for instance, surface abnormalities such as a slope, a bump (convex surface), a hollow (concave surface), or even donut-shaped rings on the top surface of a packed bed. While these defects are observed at the top free surface of the packed bed, there are concerns that this may continue to propagate down the height, and in turn, cause local flow variations and differential wetting, which affect reactor performance, catalyst life, and formation of local hot spots. These defects come because of different protocols that are followed for packing particles, which are mainly developed out of empiricism since the physics of granular flow in confinements (such as a vertical cylindrical reactor vessel) is as yet not well understood. Earlier work on the structure of packed beds relates only to the spatial distribution of voidage, and not on how the particles are arranged with respect to each other in the reactor. This work is an attempt in that direction. We present first the use of Sequential Ballistic Deposition (SBD) algorithm to model the packing process itself, i.e., how the method of packing (modeled in this work through some simple protocols) yields a certain structure of the bed. Second, we show the use of Voronoi tessellation and the use of two of the Minkowski tensors (the Volume Moment Tensor and the Surface Orientation Tensor) to characterize the packed bed structure. Further analysis is presented which shows that we are able to fingerprint the packed bed formed through different packing methods, hence creating a link between the two. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Corn kernels are good candidates for production of various value-added products such as gas biofuel, hydrogen due to the carbohydrate-rich composition. In this study, widely grown corn, field corn kernels were dissolved in subcritical water at different temperatures to determine optimal thermal hydrolysis condition. Organic-rich hydrolysate obtained from hydrolysis process was gasified by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) for hydrogen gas production. Since hydrolysis at 200 °C resulted in significantly more total organic carbon release than other temperatures and the lowest amount of insolubilized solid residue. Different concentrations of this hydrolysate (diluted with water at different ratios) were evaluated for high yielding hydrogen gas production. Gasification performance of corn kernels was also compared with lignocellulosic biomass using corn stover as a representative biomass material. The hydrolysate with 2486 mg/L TOC concentration showed the best performance for hydrogen gas production (130 mL H2/g corn) and left less amount of ungasified solid residue. Corn kernels produced 2.3 times more hydrogen gas compared to corn stover biomass. Thus, corn kernels are promising feed materials for APR process, and excess production of corn can be utilized for hydrogen gas production in higher yield and richer composition. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Gasoline compression ignition (GCI) engines have received more and more attention owing to their high thermal efficiency and low harmful emissions. However, GCI engines fueled by pure gasoline with low reactivity are limited to poor combustion stability at low loads and high pressure rise rate at high loads. To this end, a kind of second-generation hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel (HCB) from waste cooking oil with high reactivity is blended into the China 95#gasoline with different volume ratios, and the effect of blended ratio on the combustion and emission characteristics of a heavy-duty diesel engine was explored in the present study. The results indicate that ignition performance is significantly improved as the increase in HCB proportion, maximum combustion pressure can be effectively suppressed, and the combustion stability under low load conditions is much enhanced. Furthermore, HCB blended ratio should match combustion phasing controlled by the start of injection (SOI) to obtain better engine performance and wider operation range. In terms of emissions, the gas emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbon can be significantly reduced with increasing HCB fraction, however, the particulate matter emissions are increased slightly as a penalty. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigated the growth, harvesting, biocrude conversion, and recycling of the HTL aqueous phase for one self-settling (i.e., Chlorocystis sp.) and another non-settling (i.e., Picochlorum sp.) marine microalgae. Both the strains were grown simultaneously in 2 identical 25,000-L raceway ponds in the Qatari desert. The cell size of Picochlorum sp. was small (2–3 µm), and its biomass was harvested using a centrifuge. Cells of Chlorocystis sp. (6–9 µm) formed flocs that settled spontaneously in a sedimentation chamber. Harvested biomass of these two strains was then converted to biocrude oil, using a 500-mL Parr reactor. The biocrude yield of Picochlorum sp. and Chlorocystis sp. was 39.6 ± 1.15% and 34.8 ± 1.65%, respectively. The energy content of the biocrude oil was 32.78 and 33.38 MJ/kg for Chlorocystis sp. and Picochlorum sp., respectively. Both the strains were capable of efficiently utilizing more than 95% nitrogen of the HTL aqueous phase. Although lower biocrude yield was obtained from Chlorocystis sp., compared to Picochlorum sp., harvesting of Chlorocystis sp. would require much lower energy compared to Picochlorum sp. Therefore, a self-settling microalgae (e.g., Chlorocystis sp.) could potentially be a better candidate, over non-settling microalgae, for producing biofuel feedstock. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Nano-crystalline synthetic gismondine modified via cation exchange has been utilised as a highly active and selective catalyst for the production of biofuel. In comparison with low silica zeolites FAU and LTA, K-form of gismondine, based on the maximum aluminium P (MAP) zeolite, exhibited a significant improvement in catalytic performance in the methanolysis of bio-oil, which can be attributed to its nano-particle morphology and high basicity associated with the high Al content and high degree of ion exchange, as demonstrated by the TEM, XRD, TGA, NMR, XPS and CO 2 -TPD studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a successful catalytic application of basic K-MAP zeolite. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Background: Biomass fuel has been used to supply heat or crude materials in industry to replace the traditional fossil fuel which was one of the chief causes of climate warming. However, the large-scale utilization of biomass fuel was restricted due to the low density and high hydrophilicity of biomass, which causes the problem of transportation and storage. Therefore, pelletization of biomass was used to improve its fuel density. At present, the biomass pellet was widely used to supply heat, gas or electricity generation via gasification, which supplied clean and sustainable energy for industry. However, the energy consumption during pelletization and high hydrophilicity of pellets were still the problem for the large-scale application of biomass pellet. In this study, hydrothermal carbonization and surfactant played the role of permeation, adsorption and wetting in the solution, which was expected to improve the fuel properties and pelletization effectivity of corn stover. Results: In the article, surfactant (PEG400, Span80, SDBS) was chosen to be combined with wet torrefaction to overcome the drawbacks and improve the pelletization and combustion properties of Corn stover (CS). Especially, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) combined with surfactant improves the yield of solid products and reduces the ash content of solid product, which was beneficial for reducing the ashes of furnace during gasification. Meanwhile, surfactant promotes the formation of pseudo-lignin and the absorption for oil with low O and high C during HTC, which improves the energy density of solid product. Furthermore, the oil in solid product plays the role of lubricant and binder, which reduces the negative effect of high energy consumption, low bulk density and weak pellets strength caused by HTC during pelletization. HTC combined with surfactant improved the hydrophobicity of pellet as well as grindability due to the modification of solid product. Moreover, surfactant combined with HTC improved the combustion characteristic of solid product such as ignition and burning temperature as well as kinetic parameters due to the bio-oil absorbed and the improvement of surface and porosity. Conclusions: The study supplied a new, less-energy intensive and effective method to improve the pelletization and combustion properties of corn stover via hydrothermal carbonization combined with surfactant, and provided a promising alternative fuel from corn stover [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Biomass valorization to chemicals, biofuels or materials will be more and more important during this century. Production of γ-valerolactone (GVL) from the hydrogenation of levulinic acid is a good illustration of this tendency. GVL can also be produced from alkyl levulinates hydrogenation. Can we find a relationship between the structure and the kinetics of this reaction? Can we predict the kinetics of any alkyl levulinates by knowing the kinetics of another alkyl levulinate? This paper has studied these two questions by developing a kinetic model including the effect of gas-liquid mass transfer. We have demonstrated that the kinetics of hydrogenation of levulinic acid, methyl, ethyl and butyl levulinates to GVL using Ru/C follow the Taft equation, which is derived from Linear Free Energy Relationships. This equation measures the effects of polar and steric on a reaction series. We have demonstrated that polar effect of the reaction series is the most significant effect. This relationship can predict the values of kinetic constants just by knowing their structure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Canola (or rapeseed) oil and waste vegetable oil (WVO) are used commonly to make biodiesel fuels composed completely from these oils (B100) or as blends with petroleum diesel (B0). However, no studies have reported the mutagenic potencies of the particulate matter with diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) or the mutagenicity emission factors, such as revertants/MJthermal (rev/MJth) for these biodiesel emissions. Using strains TA98 and TA100 with the Salmonella (Ames) mutagenicity assay, we determined these metrics for organic extracts of PM2.5 of emissions from biodiesel containing 5% soy oil (soy B5); 5, 20, 50, and 100% canola (canola B5, B20, B50, B100), and 100% waste vegetable oil (WVO B100). The mutagenic potencies (rev/mg PM2.5) of the canola B100 and WVO B100 emissions were generally greater than those of B0, whereas the mutagenicity emission factors (rev/MJth, rev/kg fuel, and rev/m3) were less, reflecting the lower PM emissions of the biodiesels relative to B0. Nearly all the rev/mg PM2.5 and rev/MJth values were greater in TA98 with S9 than without S9, indicating a relatively greater role for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which require S9, than nitroarenes, which do not. In TA100 -S9, the rev/mg PM2.5 and rev/MJth for the biodiesels were generally ≥ to those of B0, indicating that most of these biodiesels produced more direct-acting, base-substitution mutagenic activity than did B0. For B100 biodiesels and petroleum diesel, the rev/MJth in TA98 + S9 ranked: petroleum diesel &gt; canola &gt; WVO &gt; soy. The diesel emissions generally had rev/MJth values orders of magnitude higher than those of large utility-scale combustors (natural gas, coal, oil, or wood) but orders of magnitude lower than those of inefficient open burning (e.g., residential wood fireplaces). These comparative data of the potential health effects of a variety of biodiesel fuels will help inform the life-cycle assessment and use of biodiesel fuels. © 2019

AB  - Pyrolysis of five poplar samples with differing degrees of recalcitrance was performed; the correlations between the poplar enzymatic hydrolysis glucose yields and the physicochemical properties of pyrolysis product were investigated in this study. Sugar release of five poplar samples varied from 48.1 to 112.3 mg/g for glucose, and 12.0 to 32.4 mg/g for xylose. The yield of pyrolysis products was calculated and the molecular weight distribution of pyrolysis oils was measured by GPC, ranging from 268 to 289 g/mol for its weight-average molecular weight. GC–MS analysis of the bio-oil exhibited a strong correlation between biomass recalcitrance and guaiacyl-type structures in bio-oils. The correlation between biomass recalcitrance and the ratio of syringyl-to-guaiacyl-type-related structures was also assessed. The results from quantitative 31P NMR indicated some correlation between biomass recalcitrance and the guaiacyl hydroxyl groups in bio-oils. These results illustrate correlations and differences between converting biomass to biofuels via the biological and thermal platform. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Small organic acids derived from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass represent a significant proportion of microbially accessible carbon in bio-oil. However, using bio-oil for microbial cultivation is a highly challenging task due to its strong adverse effects on microbial growth as well as its complex composition. In this study, the main small organic acids present in bio-oil as acetate, formate and propionate were evaluated with respect to their suitability as feedstocks for bacterial growth. For this purpose, the growth behavior of four biotechnological production hosts—Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis, and Corynebacterium glutamicum—was quantified and compared. The bacteria were cultivated on single acids and mixtures of acids in different concentrations and evaluated using common biotechnological efficiency parameters. In addition, cultivation experiments on pretreated fast pyrolysis-derived bio-oil fractions were performed with respect to the suitability of the bacterial strains to tolerate inhibitory substances. Results suggest that both P. putida and C. glutamicum metabolize acetate—the major small organic acid generated during fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass—as sole carbon source over a wide concentration range, are able to grow on mixtures of small organic acids present in bio-oil and can, to a limited extent, tolerate the highly toxic inhibitory substances within bio-oil. This work provides an important step in search of suitable bacterial strains for bioconversion of lignocellulosic-based feedstocks and thus contributes to establishing efficient bioprocesses within a future bioeconomy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: The quest for novel enzymes for cellulosic biomass-degradation has recently been focussed on lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs/PMOs), Cu-containing proteins that catalyse the oxidative degradation of otherwise recalcitrant polysaccharides using O2 or H2O2 as a co-substrate. Results: Although classical saprotrophic fungi and bacteria have been a rich source of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), we were interested to see if LPMOs from less evident bio-environments could be discovered and assessed for their cellulolytic activity in a biofuel context. In this regard, the marine shipworm Lyrodus pedicellatus represents an interesting source of new enzymes, since it must digest wood particles ingested during its natural tunnel boring behaviour and plays host to a symbiotic bacterium, Teredinibacter turnerae, the genome of which has revealed a multitude of enzymes dedicated to biomass deconstruction. Here, we show that T. turnerae encodes a cellulose-active AA10 LPMO. The 3D structure, at 1.4 Å resolution, along with its EPR spectrum is distinct from other AA10 polysaccharide monooxygenases insofar as it displays a "histidine-brace" catalytic apparatus with changes to the surrounding coordination sphere of the copper. Furthermore, TtAA10A possesses a second, surface accessible, Cu site 14 Å from the classical catalytic centre. Activity measurements show that the LPMO oxidises cellulose and thereby significantly augments the rate of degradation of cellulosic biomass by classical glycoside hydrolases. Conclusion: Shipworms are wood-boring marine molluscs that can live on a diet of lignocellulose. Bacterial symbionts of shipworms provide many of the enzymes needed for wood digestion. The shipworm symbiont T. turnerae produces one of the few LPMOs yet described from the marine environment, notably adding to the capability of shipworms to digest recalcitrant polysaccharides. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The effectiveness of O3, O3/Fe2+, and O3/nZVI processes on biomethanated distillery wastewater (BMDWW) was evaluated in terms of biodegradability index (BI) enhancement, biofuel production, COD, color &amp; toxicity reduction. A significant increase in biodegradability, COD, color and toxicity reduction was observed in O3/nZVI compared with O3, O3/Fe2+ due to more hydroxyl radical production. The O3/nZVI pretreated wastewater with enhanced BI (up to 0.71) showed 60% COD removal with additional biogas generation (64% methane content). From the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, 18 foremost organic compounds were predominantly detected in the raw distillery wastewater. The disappearance of the corresponding FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) &amp; GC-MS spectra during pretreatment processes signified the degradation or transformation of the recalcitrant present in the distillery wastewater. Subsequent (AnO + AO, AO) of pretreated BMDWW resulted in biodegradation rate enhancement by (1.83, 1.67), (3.5, 2.4) and (4.7, 2.9) times for O3, O3/Fe2+ and O3/nZVI processes respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae is a promising feedstock of biofuel for alternating fossil fuels. The major challenge of microalgal biofuels for commercial applications is in designing an efficient harvesting method with high economic feasibility. In this study, a rapid flocculation-sedimentation harvesting method induced by organosilane-functionalized halloysite flocculant was achieved for Scenedesmus dimorphus harvest. The harvesting efficiency was significantly influenced by the pH of microalgal dispersion and the dosage of flocculant. The optimized harvesting condition was pH 3.0 with flocculant dosage of 1.0 g·g−1 cell dry mass. Under the optimized harvesting condition, microalgae rapidly reached 93% harvesting efficiency within 0.5 min of settling time, and reached 98% harvesting efficiency within 2 min of settling time. The rapid flocculation was attributed to the charge neutralization of the negatively-charged microalgae cells by the positively-charged organosilane-functionalized halloysite flocculant and to the sweep flocculation by organosilane-functionalized halloysite flocculant. The organosilane-functionalized halloysite flocculant did not affect the lipid extraction of microalgae, and not contaminate the extracted residuals. The organosilane-functionalized halloysite flocculant is of high efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly, makes it be of promising application for commercial microalgae harvesting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Water Hyacinth biomass has been converted into bio-oil using waste Cu and Al catalysts. Parameters like temperature, time and particle sizes of biomass and catalyst were optimized. The temperature was used from 150 to 450 °C and the reaction time was in the range of 60–100 min. The amount of catalyst was kept constant as 5 wt% of biomass for all the reactions. The results showed a profound effect of the biomass and catalyst particles size on the overall conversion. A maximum of 31.6% bio-oil was produced using Cu catalyst at the optimized conditions. The Cu catalyst was found more effective in terms of the bio-oil yield. GC–MS and FTIR analyses were carried out in order to characterize the bio-oil. The composition of bio-oil reveals that the Al catalyst is more selective in gas and light hydrocarbons production.

AB  - Through a careful chemical and bioelectronic design we have created a system that uses self-assembly of enzyme-nanoparticle hybrids to yield bioelectrocatalytic functionality and to enable the harnessing of electrical power from biomass. Here we show that mixed populations of hybrids acting as catalyst carriers for clean energy production can be efficiently stored, self-assembled on functionalized stationary surfaces, and magnetically re-collected to make the binding sites on the surfaces available again. The methodology is based on selective interactions occurring between chemically modified surfaces and ligand-functionalized hybrids. The design of a system with minimal cross-talk between the particles, outstanding selective binding of the hybrids at the electrode surfaces, and direct anodic and cathodic electron transfer pathways leads to mediator-less bioelectrocatalytic transformations which are implemented in the construction of a fast self-assembling, membrane-less fructose/O2 biofuel cell.

AB  - During the process of preparing furfural by straw depolymerization with dilute sulfuric acid, large amounts of high temperature sulfate-rich organic wastewater were produced. It cannot be treated directly by anaerobic digestion and converted to bioenergy due to high concentrations of sulfate. In this study, anaerobic co-digestion of sulfate containing wastewater and corn stalk was performed at thermophilic conditions to investigate the influences of total carbon (TC)/sulfate (6, 16, 35 and 110) on methane production and sulfate removal. The results showed that the highest methane production of 260.14 mL g−1 volatile solid (VS) was achieved at TC/sulfate of 35, which was significantly higher than 12.53 mL g−1 VS obtained at TC/sulfate of 6. Moreover, the results of sulfate balance analysis showed a maximum sulfate removal of 93.43% was achieved at TC/sulfate of 16, and sulfate concentration in biogas slurry was less than 0.1 g/L regardless of TC/sulfate after 28 days of co-digestion. The microbial community was analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing technology, the results showed that methane was mainly produced by Methanoculleus and Methanosarcina, and sulfate was removed via Desulfotomaculum, and the relative abundance of methanogenic archaea (MA) and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) were significantly correlated with methane production and sulfate removal. It can concluded that higher methane production and sulfate removal can be obtained by anaerobic co-digestion of sulfate containing wastewater and corn stalk at properly TC/sulfate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, hydrocracking of coconut oil over Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was carried out in a batch reactor under different reaction temperature. Coconut oil is proposed as one of the potential feedstock for biofuel production. The Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The characterization of Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDAX), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The chemical composition of biofuel was analyzed by Gas-Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results from the GC-MS analysis showed that the hydrocracking reaction over 10 % (Ni-Fe)/HZSM-5 catalyst at temperature of 375 oC obtained the highest hydrocarbon content (contained 49.4% n-paraffin, 26.93 % isoparaffin, 3.58 % olefin) and the highest yield of bio-gasoil 38.6 % in the biofuel liquid hydrocarbon. Pentadecane (n-C15) and heptadecane (n-C17) were the most abundant hydrocarbon compounds in biofuel liquid hydrocarbon. Decarboxylation and/or decarbonylation was the dominant reaction pathways in this process. Based on the result, the reaction temperature had a significant effect on the distribution of biofuel composition and yield of biofuel from coconut oil. Copyright © 2019 BCREC Group.

AB  - Biofuels can be produced through a conventional catalytic cracking system and/or a hybrid catalytic-plasma cracking system. This paper was focused on studying effect of Na+ ion exchange to HY-Zeolite catalyst on catalyst performance to convert palm oil into biofuels over a conventional continuous fixed bed catalytic cracking reactor and comparing the catalytic cracking performance when carried out in a continuous hybrid catalytic-plasma reactor. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Bruneuer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area methods. The biofuels product were analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the hydrocarbons composition of biofuels product. From the results, ion exchange process of Na+ into HY-Zeolite catalyst decreases the catalyst activity due to decreasing the number of active sites caused by blocking of Na+ ion. The selectivity to gasoline ranges achieved 34.25% with 99.11% total conversion when using HY catalyst over conventional continuous fixed bed reactor system. Unfortunately, the selectivity to gasoline ranges decreased to 13.96% and the total conversion decrease slightly to 98.06% when using NaY-Zeolite catalyst. As comparison when the cracking reaction was carried out in a hybrid catalytic-plasma reactor using a spent residual catalytic cracking (RCC) catalyst, the high energetics electron from plasma can improve the reactor performance, where the conversion and yield were increased and the selectivity to lower ranges of hydrocarbons was increased. However, the last results were potential to be intensively studied with respect to relation between reactor temperature and plasma-assisted catalytic reactor parameters. Copyright © 2019 BCREC Group.

AB  - In-situ extraction of microalgal oil without cell destruction has been proposed as a cost-effective alternative solution for the production of algal biofuel. This study examines the viability and efficiency of n-dodecane in both column and shake flask systems for the continuous extraction of botryococcene from Botryococcus braunii (BOT-22). Botryococcene from B. braunii was found to be non-destructively extracted using n-dodecane without negatively affecting the growth and photophysiology of the microalgae. Recirculation of the culture (23 times per day)through a column system containing n-dodecane with a daily effective extraction time of 276 s resulted in 21% higher botryococcene extraction (25.1 mg g −1 biomass)when compared to a constantly stirred shake flask consisting of both algae culture and n-dodecane together in a vessel. Botryococcene extraction was highest in the first 24 h of extraction when compared to the rest of the extraction period. These results suggest that recirculation of B. braunii culture through a column system containing n-dodecane is efficient for the non-destructive extraction of botryococcene and less toxic compared to other previously tested solvents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research article aims to analyze the properties and characteristics of the products obtained from slow pyrolysis of wood barks of matured Calophyllum inophyllum (CI) tree. The bio-oil, gas and biochar obtained from the slow pyrolysis carried out at 550 °C in a fixed bed batch type reactor at a heating rate of 30 °C min−1 were characterized by different analytical techniques. Owing to the lofty volatile content of CI biomass (72.61%), it was chosen as the raw material in this current experimental investigation. FT-IR and GC–MS results of bio-oil showed the existence of elevated amount phenol derivatives, oxygenated compounds, acids, esters and furans. The physicochemical properties of the bio-oil sample were tested in accordance with ASTM standards which clearly showed that bio-oil is a highly viscous liquid with lower heating value as compared to that of diesel fuel. The chemical composition of pyrolytic gas was analyzed by using Gas Chromatography which revealed the presence of combustible organic components. The FT-IR results of biochar showed the presence of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons whereas the increased amount of carbon in biochar reveals its potential to be used as solid fuel for commercial purposes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) attracts much attention recently in fuel cell community because of its unique feature to enable the enzyme as a catalyst, rather than precious metal, to oxidize the fuel. However, the embedment of carbon nanotubes, commonly used in the anodic electrode of EBC to electrically wire the enzyme, suffers from their complicated synthetic procedure and fragile assembly. In this regard, we demonstrate a facile and low-cost route to achieve a desired immobilization of the glucose oxidase on a robust, flexible conducive carbon cloth. Our result indicates that the EBC using chitosan-modified carbon cloth via tripolyphosphate as anodic electrode exhibits a better performance than that via Nafion, leading to a 53% improvement of area power density. Such an enhancement can be attributed to the formation of the open porous structure on chitosan-modified carbon cloth, beneficial for the immobilization sites of the glucose oxidase and thereby facilitating more electron transfer in glucose oxidation reaction. The self-pumping EBC, driven by a capillary force of micro-fluidic channel plate, delivers an efficient area and volume power density of 0.549 mWcm−2 and 114.52 mWcm−3, respectively, enabling to open an alternative to the lightweight and portable applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a well-established method of converting biomass to different types of value-added products, such as high energy density biofuels and chemicals. In this work, chicken-litter waste and rice husk were pyrolyzed at different temperatures with the aim of investigating the thermal behavior and energy recovery potential of the feedstocks. Computer-aided thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis were employed to study the pyrolysis properties of each biomass in a temperature-controlled regime. The specific heats of chicken litter and rice husk samples during their pyrolysis and the energy content of their pyrolysis products were investigated to determine the energy required to complete the pyrolysis of each sample and the energy recovery potential of each pyrolytic product. Most of the volatile products were evolved at 350 to 450 °C with CO2, CO, and CH4 being the dominant gas products from both samples throughout the pyrolysis process. At 500 °C and at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, the gas, bio-oil, and biochar yields from chicken litter and rice husk were in the ranges of 18 to 19, 35 to 39, and 42 to 47 wt %, respectively, with a total recoverable energy value of 12.7 MJ/kg from chicken litter and 13.9 MJ/kg from rice husk. The energy consumed to heat the samples to the final pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C was also estimated to be 1.2 and 0.8 MJ per kilogram of chicken litter and rice husk, respectively. With the measured values, the efficiency of the pyrolysis of chicken litter and rice husk samples is estimated to be 84% and 89%, respectively, assuming the heat required to carry out the pyrolysis process is supplied by combustion of the evolved pyrolytic gas products. If the pyrolysis is instead driven by solar thermal energy, the overall efficiency will increase to 92% for the chicken litter and 94% for the rice husk pyrolysis. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A novel water-soluble Ru complex bearing phenanthrolinequinone ligands, diethyleneglycol linkers and pyrene anchoring groups was synthesized. Electrical wiring of NAD- and FAD-dehydrogenases is demonstrated via NADH oxidation and mediated electron transfer respectively. Bioelectrocatalysis is facilitated by the flexible and hydrophilic diethyleneglycol groups, and strong binding of pyrene groups with the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of the electrodes. Furthermore, owing to the surfactant properties of the PEG-modified complex, high quality CNT dispersions were obtained for homogeneous buckypaper preparation. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The objective of this study was to find the optimal condition for the extraction of rubber seed oil (RSO), using liquefied dimethyl ether (DME). Response surface methodology with a spherical central composite design model was employed to determine the optimal extraction condition, consisting of a seed moisture content (%wt), a solvent to solid ratio (g/g), and an extraction temperature (°C). A quadratic regression equation suggested the optimal extraction condition was a moisture content of 56.4%wt, a solvent to solid ratio of 6.7 (g/g), and a temperature of 33.3 °C. At this condition, the RSO yield predicted by the model gave a slight deviation of 0.68% from the experimentally validated results (41.48 versus 41.20%). RSO has a kinematic viscosity of 36.8 cSt, an acid value of 10.7 KOH/g oil, a fatty acid content of 5.1% and an unsaturated fatty acid content of 80%, resulting in the potential production of biodiesel, biolubricants, and biodegradable plastics. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this work, the thermal catalytic cracking of waste chicken fat on a coal fly ash catalyst was investigated. The objectives were to find the optimizing condition to produce the maximum biofuel using a 2k factorial level experimental design and to study the kinetics of the reaction. The experiment was performed in a laboratory scale 70-mL micro-reactor, and the obtained biofuel from the cracking process was analyzed by simulated distillation gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the fuel properties and elemental analysis of the biofuel were characterized. The effects of the temperature (420-460 °C), reaction time (45-75 min), catalyst loading (1-5% by weight; wt%) and an initial hydrogen (H2) pressure (100-500 kPa) on biofuel and gasoline yield were analyzed by analysis of variance. The main parameters were the reaction temperature and time. The optimum conditions, derived from using the design-expert software, was a reaction temperature and time of 444.4 °C and 45.50 min, respectively, with 1 wt% catalyst and an initial H2 pressure of 100 kPa to obtain a maximum yield of 76.2 wt% biofuel with 24.0 wt% gasoline. The acid value was decreased 3.9-fold to 13.5 mgKOH g-1, whereas the heating value was increased 1.10-fold to 42.92 MJ kg-1, which is slightly lower than that for commercial diesel. The kinetics were determined based on experimental data for temperatures from 410 to 470 °C and best fitted to a second order rate with an apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor of 86.0 kJ mol-1 and 181.3 s-1, respectively. The possible reaction pathway commenced from the hydrolysis of triglyceride to heavy oxygenated compounds followed by carboxylation, carbonylation and hydrogenation to become heavy linear hydrocarbons (HCs), then the heavy linear HC might be thermally and catalytically cracked into middle or small paraffins and olefins. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, conversion of Napier grass bagasse into biofuel was carried out through steady state process modelling and simulation using Aspen Plus software. An integrated thermochemical system consisting pyrolysis, gasification and combustion section for pyrolytic oil production and upgrading, non-condensable gas/syngas and bio-char valorisation was developed in a single flowsheet with capacity of 49 kg/h feedstock. Aspen process economic analyser was used to generate both capital and operating costs estimates, and other investment analysis following first quarter 2016 pricing basis. The simulation result showed that about 68 wt% of the feedstock could be processed into pyrolytic oil at 480 °C with corresponding liquid biofuel yield of 5.35 kg/h, which is equivalent to about 11 wt% of the initial feedstock through in-situ hydrodeoxygenation process. The result of economic evaluation of the entire process plant indicated that a total capital cost of $2.13 M and operating cost/year of $0.3 M is required for 25-year economic life of the project with net present value of $15.18 M at 8% internal rate of return. The standalone biomass refining plant is expected to produce fuel at minimum fuel selling price of $5.81/gallon ($1.45/L) gasoline equivalent, mainly driven by the capital cost. This work presents a systematic combination of process units that will be needed to produce advanced cellulosic biofuels in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable energy source that can be converted into various liquid fuels via thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is a thermal decomposition method, in which solid biomass are thermally depolymerized to liquid fuel called bio-oil or pyrolysis oil. However, the low quality of pyrolysis oil caused by its high oxygen content necessitates further catalytic upgrading to increase the content of oxygen-free compounds, such as aromatic hydrocarbons. Among the three different types of lignocellulosic biomass components (hemicellulose, lignin, and cellulose), lignin is the most difficult fraction to be pyrolyzed because of its highly recalcitrant structure for depolymerization, forming a char as a main product. The catalytic conversion of lignin-derived pyrolyzates is also more difficult than that of furans and levoglucosan which are the main pyrolysis products of hemicellulose and cellulose. Hence, the main purpose of this study was to develop a bench-scale catalytic pyrolysis process using a tandem catalyst (both in-situ and ex-situ catalysis mode) for an efficient pyrolysis and subsequent upgrading of lignin components. While HZSM-5 was employed as an ex-situ catalyst for its excellent aromatization efficiency, the potential of the low-cost additives of bentonite, olivine, and spent FCC as in-situ catalysts in the Kraft lignin pyrolysis at 500 °C was investigated. The effects of these in-situ catalysts on the product selectivity were studied; bentonite resulted in higher selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons compared to olivine and spent FCC. The reusability of HZSM-5 (with and without regeneration) was examined in the pyrolysis of lignin mixed with the in-situ catalysts of bentonite, olivine, and spent FCC. In the case of using bentonite and spent FCC as in-situ catalysts, there were no obvious changes in the activity of HZSM-5 after regeneration, whereas using olivine as in-situ catalyst resulted in a remarkable decrease in the activity of HZSM-5 after regeneration. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of Millettia (Pongamia) pinnata waste (PPW) was performed using a scaled-up 180-cm drop-tube pyrolyzer with fly ash (FA)-derived ZSM-5 (FA-ZSM-5) as a deoxygenation and denitrogenation catalyst to upgrade the liquid products. The oil from P. pinnata is typically extracted to produce bio-fuel leaving a large amount of PPW that has some 20% (v/v) oil content. Since the PPW is inedible, due to its toxicity from karanjin and di-ketone pongamol, it represents a potential non-food competing ‘green’ biofuel feedstock. The FA-ZSM-5 catalyst applied in this work was synthesized using alkali hydrothermal treatment of coal FA to yield FA-ZSM-5 with a 329 m 2 /g surface area and 37.18 Å pore diameter. Pyrolyzer-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to locate the optimal operating window prior to executing a scaled-up reactor operation at 400–700 °C). A maximum bio-oil yield of 43.1% by proportion was obtained at 500 °C, while the solid and gas products were 32.5% and 24.4%, respectively. Oleic acid was a major component in the bio-oil obtained from the non-catalytic condition, while ketones were prominent (79.4%) when FA-ZSM-5 was used, albeit with a low hydrocarbon (HC) selectivity. From the carbon chain length analysis, thermal cracking to smaller molecules was dominant in the presence of the FA-ZSM-5 catalyst, inducing a low HC yield in the liquid product. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, we have assessed the effect of mass transfer on the both steps of the zeolite catalysed oil hydroesterification to produce biodiesel (hydrolysis of the feed soybean oil producing free fatty acid and free fatty acid esterification). Both reactions were conducted over BEA zeolite in a batch reactor. Experimental results indicate the absence of internal and external mass transfer limitations on the overall rate of either reaction. A reversible, second order reaction was invoked in order to estimate the reaction rate constant, pre-exponential factor and activation energy of the esterification and hydrolysis reactions. Activation energy of 25.9 kJ/mol (soybean oil hydrolysis), 38.5 kJ/mol (ethyl acetate hydrolysis), 24.8 kJ/mol (oleic acid esterification) and 46.7 kJ/mol (acetic acid esterification) were calculated over H-BEA zeolite, illustrating the importance of reactant size and the fact that reactions take place on the pour mouth of the mesopouros zeolite in a case of large molecules reaction. Experimental results suggested that the relative hydrophobicity of the catalyst is a key parameter, which influences whether the reaction is under kinetic or diffusion control. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is scope to intensify the traditional adsorptive separation process which relies on packing a bed with adsorbent pellets. The hollow-fiber bed is one of the several structured configurations that have been proposed to overcome the high pressure drop and inefficient heat transfer of this random packing arrangement. While heat and mass transfer and pressure drop losses are improved in the hollow-fiber bed, the adsorbent packing density is reduced leading to a potential loss of capacity. In this computational study, we performed preliminary parametric comparisons of these bed properties, for equivalent cases in the packed bed and the hollow-fiber bed. Optimized five step single bed cycles for the separation of propylene and propane on zeolite 13X were also studied. For the same recovery and purity, the hollow-fiber bed was found to have a productivity that was five times higher than the packed bed. The hollow-fiber bed also showed higher productivity, when parameters such as the desorption pressure and the ratio of the purge to feed velocity were varied in both beds.

AB  - Biofuels have become an integral part of everyday life in modern society. Bioethanol and fatty acid methyl esters are a common part of both the production of gasoline and diesel fuels. Also, pressure on replacing fossil fuels with bio-components is constantly growing. Waste vegetable fats can replace biodiesel. Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) seems to be a better alternative. This fuel has a higher oxidation stability for storage purposes, a lower temperature of loss of filterability for the winter time, a lower boiling point for cold starts, and more. Viscosity, density, cold filter plugging point of fuel blend, and flash point have been measured to confirm that a fuel from HVO is so close to a fuel standard that it is possible to use it in engines without modification. The objective of this article is to show the properties of different fuels with and without HVO admixtures and to prove the suitability of using HVO compared to FAME. HVO can also be prepared from waste materials, and no major modifications of existing refinery facilities are required. No technology in either investment or engine adaptation of fuel oils is needed in fuel processing. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium can be used in lactobionic acid production, biosensor for lactose, biofuel cells, lignocellulose degradation, and wound-healing applications. To make it a better biocatalyst, CDH with higher activity in an immobilized form is desirable. For this purpose, CDH was expressed for the first time on the surface of S. cerevisiae EBY100 cells in an active form as a triple mutant tmCDH (D20N, A64T, V592M) and evolved further for higher activity using resazurin-based fluorescent assay. In order to decrease blank reaction of resazurin with yeast cells and to have linear correlation between enzyme activity on the cell surface and fluorescence signal, the assay was optimized with respect to resazurin concentration (0.1 mM), substrate concentration (10mMlactose and 0.08mMcellobiose), and pH (6.0). Using optimized assay an error prone PCR gene library of tmCDH was screened. Two mutants with 5 (H5) and 7 mutations (H9) were found having two times higher activity than the parent tmCDH enzyme that already had improved activity compared to wild type CDH whose activity could not be detected on the surface of yeast cells. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Over the past years, there were dramatic improvements in identifying and assessing various feedstocks for the production of biodiesel fuels. To promote a particular feedstock as a renewable source of energy, it is important to analyze their energy, economic, and engine performance characteristics. The current work attempts to evaluate the net energy and economic indices for both fossil diesel and coconut-blended diesel (B20) considering the diesel consumption by the Indian railways. Further, we present the experimental results of a multi-cylinder diesel engine operated with neat coconut biodiesel (B100) and fossil diesel at various load and speed conditions. The engine experiments reveal that the coconut biodiesel exhibits leaner combustion and shorter ignition delay than fossil diesel. Lower amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emission is observed in the case of coconut biodiesel, with higher levels of nitric oxide (14%) and fuel consumption than diesel. The coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure is within the range of better driveability zone for both the fuels at all test conditions. Overall the engine performance, emission and combustion results with neat coconut biodiesel are favorable with a penalty in NO emission at high load conditions. The techno-economical study highlights higher production cost per liter of B20 than the cost of fossil diesel. However, the net energy ratio (NER) for B20 is 1.021, favoring higher output than diesel and thus lowers the dependency on crude oil. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A catalyst is designed for use in radio frequency (RF) induction-based biofuel upconversion. Stainless steel spheres are functionalized with Pt-nanoparticles through the use of a silane linker. These spheres are characterized via XRD, FTIR, SEM/EDX and XPS followed by generation of heating profiles in an RF induction heater. The high electric conductivity of the steel balls results in rapid heating which creates a positive temperature gradient across the surface with temperatures of the steel balls reaching 300 °C in under 20 s. Using a minimum of 3% power (150 W), temperatures over 525 °C are achieved within 150 s in a single steel ball experiment. A steel bed experiment is performed to simulate an induction-based catalytic upconversion of biomass pyrolysis vapors which indicates that temperatures over 195 °C are achieved in as little as 300 s using 5% power (250 W). Melting and degradation of the Pt nanoparticles is evident with repeated heating at temperatures of 525 °C and above, fortunately, typical catalysts designed for upconversion of pyrolysis oils are operating well below these temperatures. This form of heating has a potential to mitigate the effects of coke deposition on catalyst surface, which is a pressing issue during up-conversion of pyrolysis oil and various petrochemical processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, multicopper oxidase (MCO) was immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at two different orientations, and the electrochemical properties of the resulting cathodes were investigated. Using N- or C-terminal His-tagged MCO and MWCNTs, we constructed two types of cathodes. We assumed that the distance between the type 1 (T1)Cu of the C-terminal His-tagged MCO and the MWCNT surface was lesser than that between the T1Cu of the N-terminal His-tagged MCO and the MWCNT surface. In addition, in the C-terminal His-tagged MCO, T1Cu was expected to be closer to the MWCNT surface than the type 2/type 3 Cu site. The current density of the modified electrode with a C-terminal His-tagged MCO immobilized on an MWCNT surface was 1.3-fold higher than that of the electrode with an N-terminal His-tagged MCO immobilized on an MWCNT surface. In addition, the amount of H 2 O 2 produced by the N-terminal His-tagged MCO immobilized MWCNT modified electrodes was 2.3-fold higher than that produced by the C-terminal His-tagged MCO immobilized MWCNT electrodes. In direct electron transfer (DET)-type biocathodes, both the MCO orientation and the distance between the T1Cu of MCO and the electrode surface are important. The authors succeeded in constructing highly efficient DET-type electrodes. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Environmental and energy concerns have increased interest in renewable energy sources, particularly biofuels. Thus the fermentation of glucose from sulfuric acid-hydrolyzed corn stover for the production of bioethanol has been explored using a combined acid retardation and continuous-effect membrane distillation treatment process. This process resulted in the separation of the sugars and acids from the acid-catalyzed hydrolysate, the removal of most of the fermentation inhibitors from the hydrolysate and the concentration of the detoxified hydrolysate. The recovery rate of glucose from the sugar-acid mixture using acid retardation was greater than 99.12% and the sulfuric acid was completely recovered from the hydrolysate. When the treated corn stover hydrolysate, containing 100 g/L glucose, was used as a carbon source, 43.06 g/L of ethanol was produced with a productivity of 1.79 g/(L∙h) and a yield of 86.31%. In the control experiment, where glucose was used as the carbon source these values were 1.97 g/(L∙h) and 93.10% respectively. Thus the integration of acid retardation and a continuous-effect membrane distillation process are effective for the production of fuel ethanol from corn stover.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is an important technology in biological waste disposal. It can produce fuels (bio-gas and bio-oil) and high-value chemicals. In this paper, camphor wood powder was subjected to fast pyrolysis, and the influence of the pyrolysis and torrefaction pretreatment temperature on the pyrolysis product distribution was investigated. The results showed that camphor wood powder produced higher phenol, 2-methoxy, 2-methoxy-4-vinyl-phenol, and 1, 2, 4-trimethoxybenzene compared with corn straw, rice husk, and wheat straw. The temperature of torrefaction pretreatment and fast pyrolysis simultaneously affected the yield of bio-oil and the composition of the pyrolysis product. The yield of bio-oil was the highest at 500 °C. Additionally, the yield of different high-value chemicals was the highest at 500 °C. When the camphor wood powder was pretreated under conditions of torrefaction, the yield of 3-furfural decreased and that of phenol, 2-methoxy, 2-methoxy-4-vinyl-phenol, 2-furancarboxaldehyde, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and 1, 2, 4-trimethoxybenzene increased, especially phenol, 2-methoxy, and 1, 2, 4-trimethoxybenzene. The yields of bio-oil and high-value chemicals were the highest at 500 °C of catalytic pyrolysis and at 300 °C of torrefaction treatment during the fast pyrolysis of camphor wood powder. © 2019 North Carolina State University.

AB  - The role of three kinds of surfactant (by means of PEG, Tween 80, and SDS) on subcritical water (SCW) hydrolysis of coconut husk towards the reducing sugar production was studied comprehensively. The addition of Tween gave a significant escalation of sugar yield below the cloud point (around 130 °C). The simultaneous hydrophobic and hydrophilic interaction between lignin and SDS drove the highest delignification and solubilization of monomeric sugar during SCW process. On the contrary, adding PEG showed an adverse effect on the subcritical condition. The best scenario of surfactant addition producing higher sugar production was by the addition on SCW instead of enzymatic hydrolysis. The combination of SCW assisted by SDS and enzymatic hydrolysis generated the highest sugar yield and minimized the degradation compound and energy consumption, resulting in favorable fermentable sugar for subsequent biofuel process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Triterpenes are thirty-carbon compounds derived from the universal five-carbon prenyl precursors isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Normally, triterpenes are synthesized via the mevalonate (MVA) pathway operating in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes where DMAPP is condensed with two IPPs to yield farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), catalyzed by FPP synthase (FPS). Squalene synthase (SQS) condenses two molecules of FPP to generate the symmetrical product squalene, the first committed precursor to sterols and most other triterpenes. In the green algae Botryococcus braunii, two FPP molecules can also be condensed in an asymmetric manner yielding the more highly branched triterpene, botryococcene. Botryococcene is an attractive molecule because of its potential as a biofuel and petrochemical feedstock. Because B. braunii, the only native host for botryococcene biosynthesis, is difficult to grow, there have been efforts to move botryococcene biosynthesis into organisms more amenable to large-scale production. Here, we report the genetic engineering of the model monocot, Brachypodium distachyon, for botryococcene biosynthesis and accumulation. A subcellular targeting strategy was used, directing the enzymes (botryococcene synthase [BS] and FPS) to either the cytosol or the plastid. High titres of botryococcene (&gt;1 mg/g FW in T 0 mature plants) were obtained using the cytosolic-targeting strategy. Plastid-targeted BS + FPS lines accumulated botryococcene (albeit in lesser amounts than the cytosolic BS + FPS lines), but they showed a detrimental phenotype dependent on plastid-targeted FPS, and could not proliferate and survive to set seed under phototrophic conditions. These results highlight intriguing differences in isoprenoid metabolism between dicots and monocots. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Development of cross-linked, soft polymeric materials from biomass has been a focus of research. The aqueous phase of biomass pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) has been used as a precursor for monomer synthesis. Pine wood was ground and pyrolyzed to produce liquid bio-oil which was further separated into organic and aqueous phases. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), 31 P-nuclear magnetic resonance ( 31 P NMR), 1 H NMR, and Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used for the characterization of bio-oil and its derivatives. Methacrylation reaction was carried out on the concentrated aqueous phase to yield methacrylated aqueous bio-oil. Acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) and methacrylated aqueous bio-oil were blended in different proportions and were polymerized by free radical polymerization. The polymer samples were evaluated by FTIR, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Soxhlet extraction, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tensile modulus, storage modulus, active chains density, and mass retention increased with higher AESO content. The polymers displayed sub-ambient glass transition temperatures (-30 to -21 °C). The impact of plasticizing and cross-linking effects of polymer chains on the glass transition temperature was studied with the theoretical Fox and Loshaek models. Utilization of the low-valued aqueous bio-oil and soybean oil renders the cross-linked polymers potential replacement of conventional polymers and helps to improve the overall sustainability. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this paper methodologies are described for the analysis of the porous structure of cylindrical and annular packed beds consisting of spheres when the coordinates and sizes of the spheres are known. Methodologies to determine the overlap between adjacent spheres and between the spheres and the walls of the container; axial variation in the porosity and hydraulic diameter; and the radial variation in the porosity are described. The determination of the overall bulk porosity, as well as the average porosity of selected regions, from the results are also discussed. The methodologies are based on analytical geometry and Simpson's rule is used to perform the numerical integration of the relevant integrals. The validity of the methodologies is demonstrated and the application of the methodologies to analyse the porous structure of selected packed beds is illustrated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae have been largely considered for biofuel production; however, further research focusing on its wide potential also in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries is still scarce. It is a promising raw material for several bioproducts, due to high growth rate, CO2 biofixation, and nutrient assimilation from wastewater and does not require large areas for cultivation compared to conventional crops. This study characterized six microalgae (Chlorella sp., C. vulgaris, Desmodesmus sp., D. brasiliensis, Botryococcus braunii, and B. terribilis) regarding growth parameters, total protein, carbohydrate, lipid, ash, and chlorophyll contents. The focus was lipid composition; thus, detailed results of fatty acid profile and polar lipid identification in total lipids are presented. The highest biomass productivity (42.6 mg L−1 day−1) and third highest lipid content (21.9%) were achieved by C. vulgaris, with 23.0% α-linolenic and 5.6% γ-linolenic in total fatty acids. Both are of interest for food and pharmaceutical industries and a vegan alternative to currently consumed fish oil. B. braunii showed higher lipid accumulation, oleic acid as the major fatty acid, but significantly low growth rate. B. terribilis presented intense lipid accumulation, at intra- and extracellular levels, but a high percentage of lipids should be hydrocarbons. Lipid and biomass characterization identified different bioproducts and high-value food additives that could be explored to establish a multi-product biorefinery instead of focusing exclusively on biodiesel production, which has been extensively studied but is not economic competitive in the current market. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the article, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of motor biofuels for water and land types of transport is carried out. In that context, the possibility of increasing their efficiency is demonstrated through the introduction of the rapid pyrolysis process, which allows up to 25% of renewable fuels to be used in a mixture with conventional diesel. It is established that the most effective way is the joint processing of bio-oil with oil products on existing production facilities, which does not require the construction of new plants, significantly reduces the dependence on fossil oil, and the obtained gasoline and diesel fuel have good performance characteristics and their use practically does not require changes in the fuel consumption infrastructure. © 2019, University of Dubronvnik.

AB  - The current experimental work focuses on the influence of adding multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) with waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCME) on the performance, emission and combustion parameters of compression ignition engine. The MWCNT was scrutinized using TEM and XRD analysis, and then it was blended with waste cooking oil biodiesel fuel at a fraction of 25, 50, and 75 mg/L using ultrasonicator. These blends were tested under different engine loads and a constant speed of 2000 rpm. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that by adding MWCNTs to WCME fuel, the cylinder peak pressure, peak pressure rise rate, and heat release rate were slightly reduced in comparison with pure WCME fuel. The innovated fuel blend significantly decreased NOx, CO, and UHC. Additionally, the brake thermal efficiency was amended remarkably, and the specific fuel consumption was reduced compared with pure WCME fuel. According to the comparisons of engine performance and emissions, the recommended dose level of MWCNTs with WCME fuel was concluded to be 50 mg/l, which gave a substantial improvement in all engine performance characteristics (where NOx was reduced by 40%, CO by 40%, UHC by 50% and bsfc by 18%). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A renewable clean energy is sine qua non for mitigation of toxic and greenhouse gas emissions, preservation of natural ecosystem, biodiversity and its sustainability. Hence, this research work focuses on the evaluation of biofuel potential characteristics of Salicornia plant’s oil (halophytes) that grows in arid and salt water environment devoid of suitable edaphic and ecological factors that could support the growth and development of normal vegetable plants. Two species of the Salicornia plants were investigated. These are Salicornia bigelovii and Salicornia brachiata. A supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) process using carbon dioxide (CO2) modified with ethanol as extraction solvent yielded 32.14% of S. bigelovii oil and an oil yield of 26.58% S. brachiata. The fatty acid compositional analysis was determined by Agilent, HP6890 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). A 30% concentration of Candida antarctica lipase catalyst that was immobilized on a macro-porous, acrylic resin particles was used for the transesterification process. While biodiesel yield of 92.80% and 81.30% were obtained with t-butanol solvent, a yield of 59.34% and 48.76% was obtained in solvent-free system for S. bigelovii and S. brachiata, respectively. Finally, S. bigelovii biodiesel exhibited better cold flow properties but with very poor fuel critical characteristics, such as low cetane number, high iodine value and low heating value, which when applied in diesel engine could result in abnormal combustion, performance and emission behaviour. Whereas, S. brachiata showed a superlatively promising biodiesel fuel characteristics that is typical of those recommended by American and European biodiesel standards, and thus a technically viable diesel alternative in compression-ignition engines. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

For HTL and EXT biocrudes, similar yields were obtained (52.87% and 49.06%, wt%) but with different fatty acid (60.53% and 66.92%), C (60.28% and 74.40%), H (9.55% and 10.96%), O (26.99% and 13.81%) and N (3.19% and 0.85%) contents (wt%), HHVs (29.19 and 38.33 MJ kg-1) and chemical constituents (fatty acids and triglycerides), respectively. After hydrotreatment, 0.45 g HTL and 0.42 g EXT biofuels were obtained from 1 g Scenedesmus, with different heteroatoms (9.14% and 1.01%) and HHVs (42.77 and 48.85 MJ kg-1), respectively. However, a certain number of heavy products, such as C30+ hydrocarbons and C31+ esters, were found in both biofuels. By adjusting the reaction conditions, including the temperature and catalyst loading, the content of heavy products decreased from a maximum of 26.24% to a minimum of 1.30% at 350 °C with a 50% catalyst loading. Based on the hydrotreating model fatty acids and esters, the proposed reaction mechanism demonstrated that the formation of heavy products could be inhibited using EXT biocrude instead of HTL biocrude as the feedstock. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this review problems related to design and performance of stable and efficient catalysts of biogas/biofuels transformation into syngas and hydrogen based on nanocrystalline oxides with fluorite, perovskite and spinel oxides and their nanocomposites promoted by nanoparticles of Pt group metals and Ni-based alloys are considered. Tailor-made design of these catalysts is based upon elucidation of the relationships between their synthesis procedure, composition, real structure/microstructure, surface properties, oxygen mobility and reactivity determined in a great extent by the metal-support interaction, which requires application of modern sophisticated structural, spectroscopic, kinetic (including in situ FTIRS and isotope transients) methods and mathematical modeling. Thin layers of these optimized catalysts supported on structured heat-conducting substrates, asymmetric supported oxygen or hydrogen separation membranes demonstrated high and stable performance in transformation of biogas and biofuels into syngas and hydrogen. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.

AB  - The buriti palm (Mauritia flexuosa) is a palm tree widely distributed throughout tropical South America. The oil extracted from the fruits of this palm tree is rich in natural antioxidants. The by-products obtained from the buriti palm have social and economic importance as well, hence the interest in adding value to the residue left from refining this oil to obtain biofuel. The process of methyl esters production from the buriti oil soapstock was optimized considering acidulation and esterification. The effect of the molar ratio of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to soapstock in the range from 0.6 to 1.0 and the reaction time (30-90 min) were analyzed. The best conditions for acidulation were molar ratio 0.8 and reaction time of 60 min. Next, the esterification of the fatty acids obtained was performed using methanol and H2SO4 as catalyst. The effects of the molar ratio (9:1-27:1), percentage of catalyst (2-6%) and reaction time (1-14 h) were investigated. The best reaction conditions were: 18:1 molar ratio, 4% catalyst and 14 h reaction time, which resulted in a yield of 92% and a conversion of 99.9%. All the key biodiesel physicochemical characterizations were within the parameters established by the Brazilian standard. The biodiesel obtained presented high ester content (96.6%) and oxidative stability (16.1 h). © 2018 by the Authors.

AB  - Electrocatalysis can be enhanced either by using more active catalysts or by means of external process intensifications exploiting different energy types. The improvement of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) efficiency by using an external magnetic field is technologically practical yet poorly scrutinized. An iron/nitrogen/sulfur-co-doped carbon gel (Fe-N-C/S) is studied as a non-precious metal catalyst for the ORR under an external magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet. The application of a magnetic field enhances the ORR process in both acidic and alkaline environments and yields higher selectivity towards 4e− electroreduction of O2. To elucidate the origin of the observed phenomena and show the role of the catalyst's components, samples either free of sulfur (Fe-N-C) or iron (N-C/S) are studied as references. Moreover, the highly porous carbon gel constitutes an attractive substrate for enzyme immobilization. Modification of the catalyst with laccase (a multicopper oxidase enzyme) additionally strengthens the efficiency of O2 electroreduction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this experimental work, the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a novel peppermint oil blends are evaluated at different load conditions in a direct injection diesel engine without any engine modifications. The peppermint blend proportions are named as P10, P20, P30 and P40 based on the ratio of the peppermint oil in the diesel fuel. Suitability of the selected novel peppermint oil blends is determined based on its physical and chemical properties. The number of experimental trials is conducted at different load conditions; from the results, it is found that Brake thermal efficiency of P20 (31.89%) is comparatively better than conventional diesel fuel at full-load condition. Considering the emission aspects at full-load condition, reduction in smoke emission values was observed for all peppermint blends compared to diesel fuel. The smoke emission values are 51.0, 49.1, 43.6, 41.9 and 52.8 HSU for P10, P20, P30, P40 and diesel, respectively. However, the oxides of nitrogen emission are higher than those of diesel fuel at full-load condition. Through combustion analysis, it was observed that all the peppermint blends exhibit higher ignition delay compared to conventional diesel fuel. From this study, it is evident that the selected novel peppermint oil has meritorious advantages over conventional diesel fuel in terms of performance and emission. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Electrochemical ethanol oxidation was performed at an innovative hybrid architecture electrode containing TEMPO-modified linear poly(ethylenimine) (LPEI) and oxalate oxidase (OxOx) immobilized on carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-COOH). On the basis of chromatographic results, the catalytic hybrid electrode system completely oxidized ethanol to CO2 after 12 h of electrolysis. The fact that the developed system can catalyze ethanol electrooxidation at a carbon electrode confirms that organic oxidation catalysts combined with enzymatic catalysts allow up to 12 electrons to be collected per fuel molecule. The Faradaic efficiency of the hybrid system investigated herein lies above 87%. The combination of OxOx with TEMPO-LPEI to obtain a novel hybrid anode to oxidize ethanol to carbon dioxide constitutes a simple methodology with useful application in the development of enzymatic biofuel cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work explores the use of advanced thermal technologies for the conversion of refuse derived fuel prepared from MSW into clean syngas suitable for catalytic transformation into light hydrocarbon products. In particular, the possibilities for the specific production of C1–C4 hydrocarbons utilising a good quality syngas produced by two-stage plasma assisted gasification method are investigated. A number of catalytic tests were prepared with modified chemistry to evaluate the preliminary component activities on real waste-derived syngas. C1–C4 paraffins formed in all cases as a main products, with different product distribution for different conditions examined (up to 95% bioSNG on hydrocarbon product for supported nickel, 40% bioLPG for Cu–Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts mix). CO2 was the main byproduct with outlet concentrations ranging from 10 to 50% in volume. When increasing H2:CO in the syngas by external addition of hydrogen, CO conversion increases, as well as paraffin selectivity and hydrocarbons yield. Projections on a 65 MW thermal input bioSNG plant show that if 40 MW of electrical output from renewable sources are used to power a PEM stack during high power availability, the production of bioSNG could be increased by more than 33%, with a simultaneous reduction in CO2 emissions of more than 43%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The procedures for the extraction and separation of lipids and nutraceutics from microalgae using classic solvents have been frequently used over the years. However, these production methods usually require expensive and toxic solvents. Based on our studies involving the use of eco-sustainable methodologies and alternative solvents, we selected ethanol (EtOH) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) for extracting bio-oil and lipids from algae. Different percentages of EtOH in CPME favor the production of an oil rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA), useful to biofuel production or rich in bioactive compounds. The proposed method for obtaining an extract rich in saturated or unsaturated fatty acids from dry algal biomass is disclosed as eco-friendly and allows a good extraction yield. The method is compared both in extracted oil percentage yield and in extracted fatty acids selectivity to extraction by supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2). © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The indirect steam gasification of biomass to olefins (IDBTO) coupled with CO2 utilization was proposed and simulated. Energy and exergy efficiencies, net CO2 emissions, and economic evaluation were performed against IDBTO as well as the direct oxygen-steam gasification of biomass to olifins (DBTO). The influences of unreacted gas recycling fraction (RU) and CO2 to dry biomass mass ratio (CO2/B) on the thermodynamic performance of the processes were also studied. The results showed that the yields of olefins of DBTO and IDBTO were 17 wt% and 19 wt%, respectively, the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the IDBTO were around 49% and 44%, which were 8% and 7% higher than those of the DBTO process, respectively. A higher RU was found favor higher energy and exergy efficiencies for both routes. Besides, for the IDBTO process, it is found that the addition of CO2 to gasification system led to an improvement in both energy efficiency and exergy efficiency by around 1.6%. Moreover, life-cycle net CO2 emission was predicted to be −4.4 kg CO2 eq./kg olefins for IDBTO, while for DBTO, it was −8.7 kg CO2 eq./kg. However, the quantitative economic performance of IDBTO was superior to that of the DBTO process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: In the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic material, biocrude plays a key role. The present work deals with the biocrude production through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of birch wood in supercritical ethanol over 5 wt% Fe-H-Beta-150 (SiO2 to Al2O3 ratio of 150) or 5 wt% Fe-SiO2 catalyst. Results: The liquid and solid products were characterized with various analytical techniques such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS), gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and solid-state carbon-13 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-MAS-NMR), respectively. The results revealed that 5 wt% Fe-H-Beta-150, a strongly Brønsted acidic catalyst, enhanced the biocrude formation when compared with a non-acidic 5 wt% Fe-SiO2 catalyst. Hemicellulose and lignin degradation occurred resulting in formation of mainly sugars, acids-esters and phenolic compounds in the liquid phase. The gaseous atmosphere of hydrogen also enhanced the degradation of biomass. The biocrude yield from birch was 25 wt% over 5 wt% Fe-H-Beta-150. The Brønsted acidic catalyst gave higher dissolution efficiency and its clear catalytic effect was observed in comparison to non-acidic 5 wt% Fe-SiO2. The degradation level of lignin in the presence of 5 wt% Fe-H-Beta-150 was high 68 wt% aromatic products were formed, while only 38 wt% was obtained with 5 wt% Fe-SiO2. Conclusions: Hydrogen atmosphere enhances the fractionation of birch wood when compared to argon atmosphere. The 5 wt% Fe-H-Beta-150 catalyst enhanced very strongly the degradation of hemicellulose and lignin in biomass to sugars and acid-esters as well as phenolic compounds, respectively, compared to the non-acidic 5 wt% Fe-SiO2 catalyst. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - A numerical study describes the conjugate unsteady natural heat convection of air on top of a non-Newtonian polymer-water solution characterized by a power-law model within a sealed vertical thick-walled cylindrical enclosure partially filled with a porous media in the lower section. Enzymes immobilized in an inorganic polymer, silica, used in synthesis processes constitute the porous media. Heating is by a constant high temperature at the bottom and at the vertical walls while the upper horizontal wall remains at the initial cold temperature. The Finite Volume Method allows the solution of the continuity, linear momentum and energy equations for a power law shear thinning fluid in a porous media with the Darcy-Brikman-Forchheimer model. The evolution of fluid mechanics of air and of the non-Newtonian fluid is described by the history of the streamlines. Transient heat transfer by conduction in the sealed tube walls and by natural convection of air and in the non-Newtonian fluid flow in the porous media is characterized by the evolution of isotherms. Experimental results are used to verify that the natural convective heat transfer conjugate computational model allows the prediction of temperature evolution in a thermal resistance challenge for free and immobilized enzymes. A difference of 1% is found between the experimental and the numerical results for the temperature history during the immobilized enzyme convective heating process. The applied numerical method has the capability of designing the enzyme temperature challenge test, by predicting the time needed to reach the uniform target temperature for biocatalyst processing, 500 s, in agreement with the experimental findings. The computational model contributes to the development of a technique to describe the kinetics of both immobilized and free enzyme during heating. This is a key issue for several industries, such as food modification, biofuel development, agroindustry and fishery waste valorization, that require enzymes operating at high temperature ranges in a reliable way for a long time. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oil from forage turnip (Raphanus sativus L) was investigated as a potential non-edible feedstock for ethanolic biodiesel production via transesterification using extrudate pellets of K2CO3/Sepiolite. The mechanical, structural and textural properties of the catalyst were measured using dynamometry, TGA, B.E.T and CO2-TPD. Catalytic performance during biodiesel synthesis in a volumetric glass reactor was evaluated after 2 and 4 h, for different catalyst mass (2, 3 and 5 wt%), oil/ethanol molar ratios (1:6, 1:9 and 1:12) and reaction temperatures (50 and 70 °C). A 99.9% biodiesel yield was obtained after 4 h at 70 °C, with a 1:12 oil/ethanol molar ratio and 2 wt% catalyst. Thus, the use of forage turnip oil for ethanolic biodiesel production using a heterogeneous catalyst (instead of the conventional homogeneous route) is viable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In East Asia, for thousands of years, the fruit of Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum) has been used for multiple purposes because of its chemical composition; the presence of high amounts of lipids is remarkable, showing potential to be used as substrate for biodiesel synthesis. Previously have been reported the use of alkaline and enzymatic catalysts, microwave technology and the use of ionic liquids as co-solvents with the lipids of this tree species to produce biodiesel. This study shows the results of the use of Burkholderia cepacia lipase as enzymatic catalyst for transesterification of Chinese Tallow Kernel oil (CTK), extracted from the fruit of Chinese tallow tree, into biodiesel, with the use of ultrasonic assisted technology and without the usage of solvents. The optimal operational parameters were determined and the reactions were developed in a batch reactor with the use of ultrasonic irradiation and emulsification to enhance the mass transfer. The scaled-up experiments, in an especially designed 3 L capacity reactor, showed promising results, obtaining 55.20% biodiesel and a kinematic viscosity of 10.31 mm2.s−1 in only 4 h, in comparison with previously published (in vitro) methods. The valorization of this non-edible source of oil represents an opportunity to use as an alternative source for bioenergy and also to tackle the uncontrolled expansion of this oleaginous tree species in some ecologically fragile ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Recently, exploring fermentative or chemical pathways that convert biomass-derived sugars to fuels/chemicals has attracted a lot of interest from many researchers. We are investigating a hydrocarbon pathway from mixed sugars via 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural intermediates. To achieve this goal, we must first convert glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural in favorable yields. Current processes to produce HMF/furfural generally involve the use of acid catalysts in biphasic systems or solvents such as ionic liquids. However, the yield from transforming glucose to HMF is lower than the yield of furfural from xylose. Results: In this study, we present an efficient chemical pathway simultaneously transforming glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural via ketose intermediates, i.e., fructose and xylulose, which were generated from glucose and xylose via enzymatic isomerization. In the enzymatic isomerization, by adding sodium borate to complex with the ketoses, xylose conversion reached equilibrium after 2 h with a conversion of 91% and glucose conversion reached 84% after 4 h. By enzymatically isomerizing the aldoses to ketoses, the following dehydration reactions to HMF and furfural could be performed at low process temperatures (i.e., 110-120 °C) minimizing the side reactions of the sugars and limiting the degradation of furfurals to humins and carboxylic acids. At 120 °C, pH 0.5, and 15 min reaction time, mixed ketose sugars were converted to HMF and furfural in yields of 77% and 96%, respectively (based on starting aldose concentrations). Conclusion: Taken together, our results demonstrate that this combined biological and chemical process could be an effective pathway to simultaneously convert biomass-derived glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural, for use as intermediates in the production of hydrocarbons. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells offer a new avenue of eco-friendly energy generation which is highly essential to establish a sustainable energy infrastructure. Herein, a hybrid fuel cell using an immobilised enzyme-based anode, a hydrogel-based separator and a glucose tolerant catalyst based cathode has been fabricated and demonstrated. Multiwalled carbon nanotube-pyrene carboxylic acid (MWCNT–PCA) nanocomposite based anode has been used for the electrostatic immobilisation of glucose oxidase enzyme. Agar-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel is used as the separator which supplies the fuel cell with 500 mM glucose solution. Reduced graphene oxide-ceria (rGC) acts as the glucose tolerant non-enzymatic cathode catalyst. A sandwiched construction is used to fabricate the device with which an open circuit potential of 140 mV has been recorded with a peak power density of 6.25 μW/cm2 at 60 μA/cm2. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Aviation industry has the challenge of halving CO2 emissions by 2050, as compared to 2005. An alternative are drop-in biofuels, which are sustainable and fully compatible with aircraft engines and also can be mixed with fossil jet fuel. Among the feedstock for biojet fuel production, licuri (Syagrus coronata) can be highlighted as most of its fatty acids are in the jet fuel range. Thereby, this work investigated the composition and physicochemical characterization of licuri oil and licuri biodiesel, both with satisfactory results according to international standards, with the purpose of obtaining hydrocarbons in the range of jet fuel from these feedstock, by catalytic deoxygenation. The semi-batch reaction, using a 5% Pd/C catalyst at 300 °C and 207 psi, produced n-alkanes with a conversion of up to 39.2%. The n-alkane selectivity was 80.7%, in addition to CO2 selectivity of 83.4% for biodiesel, indicating the preference for the decarboxylation pathway and also confirming licuri as a potential raw material for biojet fuel. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Non-edible seeds are not used in any commercial applications, which implies that they can be used for biofuel applications. The present study aimed to maximise the process conditions for oil extraction and sterculia biodiesel production from Sterculia foetida (poon oil). GC-MS identified the methyl esters of sterculia oil as sterculic acid (32%), palmitic acid (15.88%), oleic acid (10.00%), linoleic acid (9.95%) and malvalic acid (9%). Response surface methodology (RSM) based parametric optimisation of oil extraction was carried out by choosing process variables such as sample weight, volume of solvent to seed ratio and time. The optimum sample amount of 7.5 g and the volume of solvent to seed ratio of 40 mL/g resulted in a maximum oil yield of 45.27% at 3 h. The results were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) with a regression coefficient (R2) of 0.9988. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in an R2 value greater than 0.9, which validates the RSM. Conventional optimisation of the temperature (55 °C), feedstock to methanol ratio (1:12), catalyst proportion (1.5%) and transesterification reaction time (60 min) yield 90.87% biodiesel production. The physicochemical characteristics of oil and biodiesel complied with the requirements of the ASTM standards. The rate constant and thermodynamic variables at the optimum temperature (333 K) were calculated from the experimental data. The activation energy (Ea), activation enthalpy in transition state theory (ΔH++), activation entropy in transition state theory (ΔS++) and Gibbs free energy in transition state theory (ΔG++) were 37.91 kJ mol−1, 35.14 kJ mol−1, − 239.58 J mol−1 K−1 and 79.81 kJ mol−1 respectively.

AB  - Poplar biomass of nine different genotypes, from short rotation coppice, was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor using several solid catalysts. Pine bark was used as reference for uncatalyzed pyrolysis. Pyrolysis tests were performed for temperatures in the range 425–500 °C, selected from the thermal degradation profiles obtained by thermogravimetry under N2 flow. All the analyzed poplar genotypes showed similar pyrolysis behavior, with the highest bio-oil yield (53% average value) being obtained for the highest tested temperature (500 °C). In analogous conditions, the pine bark resulted in higher bio-char yields than poplar biomass, due to its larger lignin content. Catalyzed pyrolysis carried out at 500 °C using 10% of catalyst (Wcat/Wbiomass) for H-ZSM5 and FCC (spent catalyst from Fluid Catalytic Cracking unit) zeolites, and Mg and Na carbonates, showed improved gasification with slightly lower liquid production. The FCC catalyst promoted the lowest depreciation of bio-oil yield with the highest decrease of acid functional groups. All the used catalysts were effective to lessen the acidic components of the produced bio-oils thus having a beneficial effect on the pyrolysis liquid products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass has become an important approach to meet the current requirements of energy and oil alternatives. In recent years, extensive research has been carried out on the transformation of biological wastes into biofuels and biorefineries through pyrolysis, which may gradually be replacing the crude-oil resources. One promising pyrolysis route is intermediate pyrolysis, which opens the field to the valorization of a high variety of biological residues into biofuels including gases, liquid chemicals, and carbonizate. In the present work, the Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR) technology based on intermediate pyrolysis with integrated catalytic reforming is discussed, showing high productivity and higher quality biofuels compared to traditional pyrolysis systems. This paper illustrates the data from the upscaling of the TCR system from laboratory scale to pilot scale using sewage sludge as feedstock. The effects of the design differences are studied from the point of view of the qualities of products, mass, and energy balances of the laboratory unit upon the pilot unit. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An experimental study was carried out to evaluate an alternative disposal route for waste orange peels, which includes their upgrade into a solid biofuel and, possibly, the production of valuable liquid bio-chemicals via fluidized bed torrefaction. The influence of the torrefaction temperature (200 and 250°C), the reaction time (5 and 15 min) and the use of different bed materials (Ticino sand and γ-alumina spheres) on the distribution and composition of the main output products (torrefied solids, condensable volatiles and permanent gases) was investigated. Results show that the torrefaction at 250°C transforms orange peels from low-value residue to high-quality energy carrier by increasing their energy content (by a factor of 1.5) and reducing the O/C ratio (up to 67%). The temperature strongly influences the process performance and is the key process variable. Conversely, almost no effect were detected by changing the reaction time and the kind of granular solids on both the distribution and the composition of the main torrefaction products. Although γ-alumina does not exhibit a remarkable catalytic activity in the investigated temperature range, its use instead of sand is recommended as its lower density makes the bed smoother to be fluidized. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the present study, pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse, poppy capsule pulp, and rice husk were conducted in a fixed bed reactor at 550⁰C in nitrogen atmosphere. The moisture (5%–8%), ash (4%–17%), volatile matter (60%–76%), and fixed carbon analyses (11%–24%) of the utilized biomass were conducted. The decomposition behavior of biomasses due to the heat effect was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis. In the pyrolysis of biomasses separately, the highest bio-oil yield was obtained with sugarcane bagasse (27.4%). In the co-pyrolysis of the binary blends of biomass, the highest bio-oil yield was obtained with the rice husk and sugarcane bagasse blends. While the mean bio-oil yield obtained with the separate pyrolysis of these two biomasses was 23.9%, it was observed that the bio-oil yield obtained with the co-pyrolysis of biomass blends was 28.4%. This suggested a synergistic interaction between the two biomasses during pyrolysis. It was observed that as the total ash content in the biomasses used in the pyrolysis increased, the bio-oil yield decreased, and the solid product content increased. Characterization studies of bio-oils were conducted by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. Results of these studies revealed that, all bio-oils were mainly composed of aliphatic and oxygenated compounds. The calorific values of bio-oils were determined by calorimeter bomb. Based on the GC-MS, the bio-oils with high fatty acid and its ester content also had high calorific values. The highest calorific value was 29.68 MJ kg-1, and this was obtained by pyrolysis of poppy capsule and sugarcane bagasse blend. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The present work deals with the utilization of renewable energy (solar energy) with help of Fresnel lens solar concentrator (FSC) for the esterification of Palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). In the esterification reaction different reaction parameters like molar ratio, catalyst dosage, stirring speed, addition of molecular sieves and reaction time were studied using one factor at a time approach to get maximum percentage conversion of PFAD. The highest conversion of 96.81% was achieved at a molar ratio of 8:1, catalyst dosage of 1.25 wt %, stirring speed of 200 rpm, reaction temperature of 62 °C, molecular sieves of 6 wt% and reaction time of 30 min under FSC approach. The conventional hotplate heating method was also performed to show the advantage of the FSC method over the conventional method. In the conventional hotplate heating method the maximum conversion of 68.65% was achieved under similar reaction condition as applied for the FSC method. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of the process was also compared. It was found that the FSC method was highly energy efficient than the conventional hotplate heating method for the esterification reaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Black soldier fly (BSF, Hermetia illucens L.) can efficiently degrade organic wastes and transform into a high fat containing insect biomass that could be used as feedstock for biodiesel production. Meanwhile, the molecular regulatory basis of fat accumulation by BSF is still unclear; it is necessary to identify vital genes and regulators that are involved in fat accumulation. Results: This study analyzed the dynamic state of fat content and fatty-acid composition of BSF larvae in eight different stages. The late prepupa stage exhibited the highest crude fat, with lauric acid being the main component. Therefore, to provide insight into this unexplained phenomenon, the molecular regulation of rapid fat accumulation by BSF larvae was investigated. The twelve developmental stages of BSF were selected for transcriptome analysis, including the eight stages used for investigation of fat content and fatty-acid composition. By Illumina sequencing, 218,295,450,000 nt were generated. Through assembly by Trinity, 70,475 unigenes were obtained with an average length of 1064 nt and an N50 of 1749 nt. The differentially expressed unigenes were identified by DESeq, with 9159 of them being up-regulated and 10,101 of them were down-regulated. The several putative genes that are involved in the formation of pyruvate, acetyl-CoA biosynthesis, acetyl-CoA transcription, fatty-acid biosynthesis, and triacylglycerol biosynthesis were identified. The four vital metabolic genes that are associated with fat accumulation were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The molecular mechanism of fat accumulation in BSF was clarified in this investigation through the construction of a detailed fat accumulation model from our results. Conclusion: The study provides an unprecedented level of insight from transcriptome sequencing to reveal the crude fat accumulation mechanism in developing BSF. The finding holds considerable promise for insectival biodiesel production, and the fat content and fatty-acid composition can be altered by genetic engineering approaches in the future for the insect production industry. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Kappaphycus alvarezii is a red macroalgae generally used for industrial production of hydrocolloids. An alternative is to use the K. alvarezii for carrageenan production and its residue for the manufacture of bioproducts of commercial interest (biofuels, food, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and biofertilizers). This study reported the cultivation of K. alvarezii strains in different environmental conditions over a period of one year. The productivity, growth rate, and yield of refined carrageenan (RC) and residue (RE) of the studied crops were evaluated. Moreover, the efficiency of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the RE obtained in the carrageenan processing was evaluated. Considering the variations of productivity during different climatic seasons, three differentiated groups (A, B and C) were defined for each studied strain. The productivity and growth rates were more pronounced in the seasons of summer-autumn (group B). The average productivity of untreated biomass of different strains of K. alvarezii was 31.6 kg.m−2year−1. The average yield of the RC and RE of different strains of K. alvarezii were 14.4 and 7.4 kg.m−2year−1, respectively. RCs showed a galactan enrichment, same as commercial-grade carrageenan. REs showed a glucan enrichment, with average content (A, B and C) of 31.5%, 34.3% and 32.6%, respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the glucan fraction of the RE, resulted in a 100% conversion and indicated that the rate of glucose formation from glucan does not depend on the studied cultures or strains. Therefore, these results show that glucose from RE can be obtained throughout the year, reaching an average productivity of 2.7 kg.m−2year−1. © 2019

AB  - Production of liquid biofuels derived from vegetable oils in recent years significantly increased which causes surplus of by-product (waste glycerol) from this process. Therefore it is of great importance to find cheap and fast method of use its utilization. In this study, a possibility of the utilization of technical purity glycerin as an addition to wood pellets intended for heating purposes has been investigated. Usefulness of pellets contained glycerol additions has been compared in terms of applicable quality standards for wood pellets. Effects of waste glycerol addition on concentration of combustion products as well as temperature in heat exchanger have also been examined. The experimental results show that co-combustion of waste glycerol with wood sawdust does not worsen heating efficiency in a standard boiler. Moreover, 4.5 and 7% presence of glycerol in wood pellets correlated to a nearly twofold decrease of NOx concentration in flue gas. Therefore, the use of the waste glycerol as a binder for the production of pellets can be a simple and cost-effective solution of its utilization. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this work was to investigate the viability of a microalgae catalytic pyrolysis/hydrotreating plant to kerosene, diesel and gasoline using Aspen Plus. A series of 2000 dry tonne per day scenarios were simulated with the final goal of determine the price in USD per litre of the drop-in fuels produced and the economic feasibility of the technique at a large-scale. Different scenarios (mechanical, solar and thermal drying), microalgae (Nannochloropsis and Isochrysis)and catalysts (Li-LSX zeolite, Ni-Ce/Al2O3, Ni-Ce/ZrO2). For this work, a systematic design approach by Douglas was considered and the whole process was actualised with the Marshall and Swift Cost Index of 2016. The lowest minimum fuel selling price (1.418 $/L)was found for Isochrysis and Li-LSX-zeolite. Finally, the sensitivity analysis showed that the bio-oil yield was the most influent factor, leading to a variation of the fuel price between 1.158 $/L to 1.751 $/L assuming a 20% of variation. The techno-economic assessment and sensitivity analysis indicated that Isochrysis and Li-LSX-zeolites are promising for the production of drop-in fuels, but further research is required to further reduce the price of the feedstock production and drying to be competitive with lignocellulosic materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The acetalization of glycerol with acetone represents a strategy for its valorization into solketal as a fuel additive component. Thus, acid carbon-based structured catalyst (SO3H-C) has been prepared, characterized and tested in this reaction. The structured catalyst (L = 5 cm, d = 1 cm) showed a high surface density of acidic sites (2.9 mmol H+ g−1) and a high surface area. This catalyst is highly active and stable in the solketal reaction production in a batch reactor system and in a continuous downflow reactor, where several parameters were studied such as the variation of time of reaction, temperature, acetone/glycerol molar ratio (A/G) and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). A complete glycerol conversion and 100% of solketal selectivity were achieved working in the continuous flow reactor equipped with distillation equipment when WHSV is 2.9 h−1, A/G = 8 at 57◦C in a co-solvent free operation. The catalyst maintained its activity under continuous flow even after 300 min of reaction. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biofuels production from lignocellulosic biomass is hindered by high conversion costs in the generation of high-quality fuels, driving research towards the development of new pathways with less severe conditions, higher yields and higher-quality products. Here, we present a market-responsive biorefinery concept based on methanol as the key intermediate, which generates high-octane gasoline (HOG) and jet fuel blendstocks from biomass. Process models and techno-economic analysis are linked with both fundamental and applied catalyst development research to quantify the impact of catalyst advancements on process economics. By facilitating reincorporation of C4 by-products during dimethyl ether homologation, a Cu-modified beta zeolite catalyst enabled a 38% increase in yield of the HOG product and a 35% reduction in conversion cost compared to the benchmark beta zeolite catalyst. Alternatively, C4 by-products were directed to a synthetic kerosene that met five specifications for a typical jet fuel, with a minor increase in the fuel synthesis cost versus the HOG-only case. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - In this work, a computer-aided molecular design based technique has been developed to upgrade bio-oil properties via solvent addition by targeting both functionality and sustainability targets. The direct application of bio-oils as a fuel is often constrained by their inferior properties such as high water content, high viscosity, low heating values, low miscibility, and storage instability as compared to conventional fuels. One promising method to upgrade bio-oil is the use of solvents as additives to generate a solvent–oil blend capable of meeting both its fuel functionality and sustainability targets in health, safety, and environmental aspects from production to point of application. Suitable solvents were formulated using computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) techniques by solving a two-stage multi-objective optimisation problem based on the defined targets. In the first stage, an optimisation model for solvent–oil blend functionality was constructed to optimise solvent functionality. In the second stage, a fuzzy optimisation approach aimed to optimise environmental, health, and safety (EHS) aspects via an index-based method. By implementing a max–min aggregation approach, an optimised solution has been generated by determining trade-off points that allowed significant EHS improvements at minimal expense of blend functionality. Lastly, the optimal solvent–oil blend was evaluated against conventional diesel in terms of carbon savings. This allowed the quantification of environmental savings through utilising biofuels while ensuring minimal compromise on fuel performance. Altogether, this approach has enabled the identification of feasible solvents for bio-oil upgrade and design of blends for application while allowing multi-objective optimisation of EHS targets. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid (FA) are concurrently derivable from biomass sugars, and recognized as sustainable feedstock for producing biofuels and chemicals. Herein, a benign and eco-friendly approach using low-cost formamide (FAM) and FA as nitrogen and hydrogen source, respectively, was developed to be highly efficient for the synthesis of 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (MPLD, up to 93% yield) from LA under quasi-catalytic and solvent-free conditions in a relatively short reaction time of 90 min at 160 °C. Deuterium-labeled and control experiments with 2D NMR illustrated the occurrence of transfer hydroamination process, where FA acted as an acid as well as H-donor. The smooth proceeding of the initial C-N bond formation process mainly contributed to the rapid substrate conversion, while the concurrent amidation process was favorable for the subsequent cyclization to give the desired lactam, as proved by computational calculations and kinetic studies. In addition, this quasi-catalytic system was applicable to the synthesis of various N-unprotected lactams in 76-95% yields from keto acids under benign conditions, and the target product could be simply isolated by extraction. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The application of an effective removal treatment to minimize inhibitory compounds, present after hydrolysis treatment, might mean a great advance on renewable biofuel generation strategy since growth-inhibiting substances, such as phenolic compounds and furans, are one of the major problems in the development of fermentative step. Detoxification of olive-tree pruning hydrolyzates using NaBH4, as reducing agent, has had a positive effect on fermentative parameters using Pichia stipitis CBS 6054. Oxalic acid treatment conditions have been optimized (150 ∘C and 75 mM of oxalic acid in order to obtain the maximum fermentable sugar recovery without an excessive inhibitory compounds production) considering the combined severity factor, CSF, (CSF = 1.56 ± 0.05). Hydrolyzate characterization at optimal condition showed concentrations (in g/L) of 16.64 D-glucose, 15.05 D-xylose, 5.16 L-arabinose, 2.87 acetic acid, 3.18 phenolic compounds, and 0.96 furans. Sodium borohydride conditioning process has been studied using a response surface methodology. The use of NaBH4 (0.03 mol/L during 30 min at pH= 6.0) has been demonstrated to be a successful conditioning method for almost entirely furans elimination as well as 40% of phenolic compounds reduction. As a result, it has been possible to ferment sugary liquors which did not ferment without such treatment, obtaining a maximum ethanol yield of 27% (3.8 g/L) in treated hydrolyzates under optimum conditions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Algae species like Schizochytrium sp. are resilient photosynthetic factories that produce large quantities of fatty acids that can be converted to biodiesel. These lipids must be extracted from the raw biomass before they can be used as biofuel feedstocks or other bioproducts such as hydrogen. In this paper, hydrogen production by steam reforming of schizochytrium algae oil are studied. The effects of continuous microwave and intermittent microwave, freezing and thawing times of different mass fractions, time of alkali heat and other factors on the ratio of cell disruption and ultrasonic-assisted ethanol extraction are considered. The results show that the highest lipid yield can reach by ultrasonic-assisted ethanol extraction from the schizochytrium algae which are pretreated by alkali heat method. The hydrogen production from steam reforming of the lipids, which are extracted by ethanol with ultrasonic-assisted from algae after alkali thermal pretreated is proposed. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This study focuses on the evaluation of soybean hulls as an alternative to obtain biofuels and bioproducts through pyrolysis. The study was carried out in three stages: 1) The physicochemical characteristics of the raw material were determined, 2) Yields of different pyrolysis products were obtained at 350, 400 and 600 °C; 3) The different obtained products (biochar, bio-oil and non-condensable gases) were characterized. The results obtained revealed that the soybean hulls used in this study present a 76% volatile mater and 2.3% ash. The highest pyrolysis yields obtained for bio-oil (40%) and non-condensable gases (36%) were achieved at 600 °C. The main compounds identified in the aqueous phase of bio-oil were acetic acid, furfural, furfural alcohol, 1,2-cyclopentadiene, among others. The organic phase of bio-oil presented a calorific power of 23.7 MJkg−1. Calorific power in the ranges 19–21 MJm−3 and 26.6–28.1 MJkg−1 were obtained for the biogas and the biochar obtained at different temperatures, respectively. © 2019

AB  - Acidic hydrolysis process of wet microalgae is a worthy technique to reduce the processes and energy of the production. To aim the alternative fuel as a biofuel feedstock from wet microalgae, the Spirulina platensis containing high moisture, 88–95 wt%, was representative in this research. Microalgae cell disruption by acidic hydrolysis was investigated using various concentrations of sulfuric acid with the hydrolysis temperature in the range of 25–100 °C and hydrolysis time in the range of 30–120 min. The acid-hydrolyzed lipid was extracted from the mixture by solvent extraction using n-hexane. The maximum lipid concentration from acidic hydrolysis was 17.15 wt% that obtained at hydrolysis temperature of 100 °C for 60 min and then extracted with 700 mL of hexane for 30 min. The physical and chemical analyses of the lipid and microalgae solid residue were examined. According to the research results, the higher heating values of hydrolyzed lipid were found in the range of 32–40 MJ/kg and their main chemical components were hexadecane, heptadecane, and palmitic acid. The boiling point ranges of the hydrolyzed lipid were mainly indicated in the fractions of light and heavy gas oils which may be generated in term of biofuel feedstock for automobile fuels. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Lewis acid-catalyzed in situ transesterification/esterification of tigernut (Cyperus esculentus) was conducted in sub/supercritical ethanol. An L16 (44) orthogonal design with four factors at four levels was employed to investigate the influence of the process variables on the product distribution and the composition of crude biodiesel (CBD). The four factors were temperature (230–290 °C), time (0–90 min), ethanol to feedstock ratio (E/F) (4/3–16/3 mL/g), and catalyst type (ZnCl2, FeCl3, SnCl2, and H3PO4). The results showed that the catalyst type and E/F ratio were the two most influential variables affecting the yield and composition of the CBD. Of the Lewis acids tested, SnCl2 showed the highest performance in terms of the CBD yield and its esters content. Increasing the E/F ratio essentially led to a higher CBD yield and higher ester content of the CBD. A higher temperature and longer reaction time resulted in an obvious increase in the gas yield but had no significant effect on the yield and quality of the CBD. The produced CBDs had extremely low N and S contents (0.2–0.6 wt% and less than 0.1 wt%, respectively) and were abundant in fatty acid esters (∼70%), mainly ethyl oleate and ethyl palmitate, making it more suitable for subsequent biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the unstable nature of bio-oil, it becomes mandatory to analyze the changes in physical and chemical properties of the bio-oil during storage to appreciate its chemical instability, for developing stabilization strategies. The present study aims to investigate the oxidative and thermal stability of bio-oil extracted from pyrolyzing Calophyllum inophyllum (CI) deoiled seed cake in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C under the constant heating rate of 30 °C/min. Each stability analysis method involve an accelerated aging procedure based on standards established by ASTM (D5304 and E2009) and European standard (EN 14112). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry were employed to analytically characterize the un-aged and aged bio-oil samples. The results clearly depict that stabilizing Calophyllum inophyllum bio-oil with 10% (w/w) methanol improved its stability than that of the crude sample. Addition of methanol reduced the change in viscosity of bio-oil by 38.55% during accelerated aging process. The oxidation stability index of bio-oil stabilized with methanol was found to be 3.97 h which is in accordance with ASTM D6751. FT-IR and GC-MS results showed an increase in the relative concentration of C-O (carboxylic acids, ethers and esters) and C=O (carbonyl) functional groups in aged bio-oil samples. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - Fast pyrolysis biofuel is considered as one of the promising alternative fuels for future transportation. The authors’ research group has improved a pyrolysis biofuel production method for obtaining a biofuel from rice husk. Preliminary research published in Fuel reveals that it has the potential of being used as a gasoline blending component. Before this biofuel can be widely used in real combustors or engines at a large scale, its explosion characteristics should be investigated for the safety consideration during production, transport and storage. This paper quantitatively evaluates explosion pressure, deflagration index, maximum pressure rise rate and combustion duration of this biofuel in the constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC). At the same time, the effects of initial pressure, initial temperature and equivalence ratio on explosion characteristics of this biofuel was also qualitatively analyzed. Linear relationships between explosion pressure, deflagration index, maximum pressure rise rate and combustion duration versus initial pressure and explosion pressure versus initial temperature are given. Results show that explosion pressure is a linear relationship with the initial temperature. However, deflagration index, maximum pressure rise rate and combustion duration are insensitive to the temperature variation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chiral crystals were discovered due to spontaneous resolution when enantiomers of 4-phenyldiazenyl-2-[(R or S)-(1-phenylethyl)-iminomethyl]phenol and its racemic mixture were prepared. Using two ligands per molecule, optically active R,R and S,S enantiomers and meso R,S diastereomer of Cu(II) complexes were prepared. Strong chiral recognition was expected for them. Laccase has attracted attention as a catalyst that reduces oxygen to water in a cathode of biofuel cells, which can be effectively mediated by metal complexes. Furthermore, azobenzene can align perpendicularly to the polarization direction of irradiating linearly polarized ultraviolet light (Weigert effect) as well as to the conventional cis-trans photoisomerization accompanying the shift of redox potential. Thus, we also studied the photo-induced control of cis-trans forms and the alignment of these Cu(II) complexes as a mediator to fit laccase appropriately. We discuss photo-induced control on not only electronically but also sterically-favored redox conditions. The meso(R,S)-form of the Cu(II) complex in cis-form was found to be the best at increasing the current of cyclic voltammetry (CV) among the three R,R and S,S enantiomers and the R,S diastereomer of the Cu(II) complexes. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is regarded as the most promising renewable biofuel which can satisfy the worldwide energy demand through its robust net energy output with less impact on environment and also an effective alternative or supplement for existing diesel fuel for powering Compression Ignition engines. This present study aims to compare the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of beef tallow biodiesel with its dominant fatty acid esters and their influence on these characteristics. Ethyl stearate, ethyl palmitate and ethyl oleate were identified as dominant fatty acid esters available in a composition of 14.78, 37.36 and 25.17%, respectively. Two set of samples were prepared for testing purpose and were classified as (i) blend samples and (ii) ester samples, with plain diesel as base fuel. The maximum cylinder pressure was found to be in the range between 67 and 71 bar for all the samples and heat release rate was found to be highest for B20 blend. Slight decrease in efficiency along with marginal increase in fuel consumption was a result of long chained fatty acid esters (stearate and oleate esters) whereas increase in CO2 emission and decrease in NOX emission were because of higher oxygen content, cetane number and degree of unsaturation in the ester molecule. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In this study, the production of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of furniture sawdust, waste lubricating oil and their mixtures were investigated under certain operating conditions in the presence of lime and zeolites, by using a laboratory scale horizontal tubular reactor placed in a furnace. The main focus was to investigate the mutual effect of lime and commercial zeolite on the amount of the bio-oil production from furniture sawdust and waste lubricating oil. The selected operating parameters were pyrolysis temperatures and heating rate of 300°C and 650°C and flash heating or gradual heating rate (30°C/min). Additionally, three different additives were tested as catalysts; namely, lime (CaO), commercial zeolite (4A) and a natural zeolite (klinoptilolite). The amount of the produced bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography–flame ionization detector. The distribution of solid, liquid and gaseous products was determined for each operational condition. It was seen that the amount of the bio-oil was influenced by the amounts of sawdust and zeolite in the mixture. Experimental results showed that higher temperatures were more effective for the higher bio-oil amount. Additionally, heating rate was quite significant at 300°C whereas it has a minor effect on the bio-oil amount at 650°C. The highest bio-oil yield was obtained for the mixture of sawdust and waste lubricating oil in the presence of both lime and commercial zeolite with flash heating rate at 650°C. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Increase in fossil fuel depletion and increase in fuel price forced the researchers to find an alternate source to petro fuel. The scope of this research article is to give an insight into the synthesis and utilization of catalytically cracked bio-oil in a DI diesel engine. The catalyst selection and its characterization are playing a vital role in cracking of bio-oil. The aluminum oxide catalyst is used in this study, because of its availability and cost. The properties of the catalyst were analyzed before and after cracking using SEM, EDAX and XRD. The catalyst pellets are placed in a fixed bed catalytic reactor where the jatropha oil is introduced to get the cracked gaseous fuel. The cracked fuel was tested with FTIR, TGA and DSC for finding its properties. From the results, properties of the cracked fuel are nearly matched with diesel fuel. The catalytically cracked jatropha biofuel (CCJB) is fumigated into the inlet manifold in the proportion of 10, 20 and 30% in specific fuel consumption of the diesel engine. The maximum brake thermal efficiency was observed for 30% of fumigated CCJB compared with diesel fuel. The exhaust emissions such as CO and smoke were considerably reduced when compared with diesel fuel. A significant increase in NO x emission than diesel can be seen for all operating conditions. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Waste oils are becoming increasingly more important as feedstock for the production of fuels and glycerol as byproduct. Optimization of homogeneous transesterification of waste frying oil (WFO) to biodiesel over hydroxide potassium (KOH) catalyst have been investigated. In this respect, response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the relationships between methanol and WFO molar ratio (3:1-12:1), KOH concentration (0.5%-2%) and temperature (25-65 °C) on the conversion yield. Transesterification of WFO produced 96.33% maximum methyl ester yield at the optimum methanol/WFO molar ratio 7.3:1, KOH loading 0.5 wt. % and the reaction temperature was 58.30 °C. The physicochemical properties of optimized biodiesel met the requirements of the European Norm 14214, such as kinematic viscosity at 40 °C 4.57 mm/s2, the sulfur content 0.005 wt. %, and the density at 15 °C 889.3 kg/m3. This study also examined the accelerated oxidation of biodiesel and biodiesel/diesel blends under combined temperature and air effect at different periods of time while measuring their acidity. Results have shown that total acid number increased proportionally to the biodiesel content of the biodiesel/diesel blends from 0.5 mgKOH/g for B7 (7% (v/v) biodiesel and 93% (v/v) diesel) up to 2.8 mg KOH/g for B100 (100% biodiesel). The synthesized trans-esterified oil can be a potential alternative to petrodiesel, hence its application at an industrial scale. This work also reports some properties of crude glycerol (CG) derived from biodiesel from WFO. The glycerol yield (%), pH, water content (wt. %), density at 15 °C (g/cm3), and kinematic viscosity at 40 °C (mm2/s) was analyzed according to standard test methods. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Research into trees plays a very important role in evaluations of soil contamination with diesel oil. Trees are ideal for reclaiming contaminated soils because their large biomass renders them more resistant to higher concentrations of pollutants. In the literature, there is a general scarcity of long-term studies performed on trees, in particular European beeches. The aim of this study was to evaluate the responses of Scots pines and European beeches grown for 8 years on soil contaminated with diesel oil. Selected morphological and physiological parameters of trees were analyzed. The biomass yield of Scots pines was not significantly correlated with increasing concentrations of diesel oil, but it was more than 700% higher than in European beeches. Scots pines were taller and had a larger stem diameter than European beeches during the 8-year study. The diameter of trees grown on the most contaminated soil was reduced 1.5-fold in Scots pines and more than twofold in European beeches. The length of Scots pine needles from the most contaminated treatment decreased by 50% relative to control needles. The shortest needles were heaviest. The fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of needle length was highest in Scots pines grown on the most contaminated soil, whereas the reverse was noted in the FA of needle weight. Diesel oil decreased the concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids. The Fv/Fm ratio of needles and leaves was influenced by the tested concentrations of diesel oil. The results of the study indicate that the Scots pine better adapts (grows more rapidly and produces higher biomass) to long-term soil contamination with diesel oil than the European beech. In European beeches, growth inhibition and leaf discoloration (a decrease in chlorophyll content) were observed already after the first year of the experiment, which indicates that 1-year-old seedlings of European beech are robust bioindicators of soil contamination with diesel oil. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Biorefineries can be a good alternative to cover the current needs of energy, such as transportation fuels and also fine chemicals. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be obtained directly from biomass, and it is considered one of the most promising intermediate for the synthesis of biofuels. In this work the production of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), two particularly attractive compounds to be used as biofuels due to its similar characteristics to gasoline, has been studied. For this purpose, a continuous fixed bed catalytic reactor was employed using HMF as raw material. Zr-supported Cu, Ce–Cu, Ru–Cu and Ni–Cu catalysts were tested. Moreover, the catalysts textural properties were also measured - before and after the activity tesst - in order to get a deeper understanding of the relationships among the measured DMF yields and the catalyst characteristics. Final DMF, DMTHF and butanol separation was also evaluated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Castor is an important oil crop for bioenergy production and other valuable applications. NIAB Gold is first mutant variety of Pakistan developed by using gamma radiation. In this study, the oil was extracted from this new castor variety and was used for biodiesel production and as bio-pesticide. Due to high viscosity of castor oil, it was first refined with hot water degumming process. The degummed oil was used for biodiesel production in which important process parameters have been optimized. Maximum biodiesel yield (85%) was obtained by using 5:1 methanol to oil ratio, 3% catalyst dose, 70 ᵒC reaction temperature and 400 rpm stirring speed. The synthesized biodiesel was characterized by determining its important physico-chemical properties including specific gravity, viscosity, calorific value, acid value, iodine value, cetane number etc. Extracted castor oil was also tested as bio-pesticide against two insect species; Tribolium castaneum and Trogoderma granarium. By using 15% castor oil concentration and 72 h of exposure time, maximum larvicidal effect recorded against Tribolium castaneum was 32.17% and for Trogoderma granarium, it was found to be and 23.85%. LC50 values for Tribolium castaneum were also determined at different exposure times. The study results indicated that the NIAB Gold castor oil biodiesel meets the ASTM standards and NIAB Gold castor oil has good potential as bio-pesticide to control harmful insect pests. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research works are ongoing in mixing the biologically synthesized oil with the diesel for reducing the effect of global warming and climate change. From the review study, it is noted that the blended biodiesels require more assert about their practical viability. So, the non-edible Tamanu oil is synthesized and it is blended with diesel and its emission characteristics, engine performance and combustion characteristics are studied in our previous work. This paper attempts to model the diesel engine fueled with tamanu oil biodiesel blend. The proposed model exploits the context of neural network and the firefly algorithm is used to train it. After analyzing the various characteristics of the diesel engine, the acquired data is subjected to a proposed FF-NM method. The simulated results are statistically evaluated and the proposed modeling method is proved to be better than the other NM. © 2018

AB  - The aim of the present study was to propose two ways for calculating the final price to be paid to suppliers of forest biomass based on the energy content of the fuel. Moisture content (MC) and ash content (AC) were considered quality indicators for a co-generation plant located in Lages, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Two models are proposed for the three biofuels most acquired by the plant (wood chips, sawdust and bark): Model 1, based on the Net Calorific Value (NCV) estimated considering the moisture content (MC) and ash content (AC) of the biomass; and Model 2, with the AC discounted from the dry weight of the biomass and subsequent estimate of the NCV considering the MC. The final price corresponded to the calculation between the weight and estimated NCV, with the suggestion of a bonus and discount for materials of better or worse quality, respectively. A significant reduction in biomass weight occurred after the ash discount, especially in the case of bark, which had a high AC. The price paid for kJ of biomass proved to be more coherent than the price per ton, since the ash and water content of the material is taken into account. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For converting biomass into renewable fuel, fast pyrolysis and further upgrading processes have been a promising pathway for years. Catalytic deoxygenation of the oxygenate compounds in the pyrolytic bio-oil significantly improves the quality of bio-oil and increases the possibilities of directly using that as transportation fuel. In this study, two types of experiment, fluidized bed fast pyrolysis of Miscanthus and hydro-processing of the produced bio-oil, were conducted in sequence. The Miscanthus biomass was first pyrolyzed to produce the bio-oil in a fluidized bed and the oil product was then hydro-processed into upgraded fuel in a fixed bed reactor over Pd/C catalyst with various operating conditions including reaction temperature, reaction pressure, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), and H2-to-oil ratio. The chemical compositions, FTIR spectra and physical/chemical properties of the two products were demonstrated and compared. The degree of deoxygenation (DOD) was additionally presented with varying experimental conditions, showing that the maximum DOD of 95% was obtained. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Six different environmental samples were applied to enrich microbial consortia for efficient degradation of corn stalk, under the thermophilic and mesophilic conditions. The consortium obtained from anaerobic digested sludge under thermophilic condition (TC-Y) had the highest lignocellulose-degrading activity. The CO 2 yield was 246.73 mL/g VS in 23 days, meanwhile, the maximum CO 2 production rate was 15.48 mL/(CO 2 ·d), which was 28.75% and 52.27% higher than that under mesophilic condition, respectively. The peak value of cellulase activity reached 0.105 U/mL, which was at least 34.61% higher than the other groups. In addition, 49.5% of corn stalk was degraded in 20 days, moreover, the degradation ratio of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin can reach 52.76%, 62.45% and 42.23%, respectively. Microbial consortium structure analysis indicated that the TC-Y contained the phylum of Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the Pseudoxanthomonas belonging to GammaProteobacteria might be the key bacterial group for the lignocellulose degradation. These results indicated the capability of degrading un-pretreated corn stalk and the potential for further investigation and application of TC-Y. © 2018

AB  - Brønsted acidic ionic liquid (BAIL) functionalized hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbons (NHPCs) with interesting 3D interconnected macro-meso-microporous structure are successfully prepared by chemical bonding ‒[C3][SO3CF3−] (C3 = PrSO3H) groups throughout the NHPC supports that are obtained via a single step CaCO3 nanoparticle-directed nanocasting approach combined with K2C2O4 chemical activation and urea/melamine self-activation during the process of carbonization of glucose and urea/melamine. By changing initial urea-to-glucose weight ratio in the preparation systems, the macro/meso/micropore proportion of the resulting GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts are well-adjusted. The morphological characteristics, porosity properties and chemical structure of the prepared catalysts are well-characterized so that the contribution of the synergistic effect of CaCO3 nanoparticle and K2C2O4 to the formation of hierarchically porous structure is revealed. Owing to super strong Brønsted acidity and unique hierarchically porous structure of the catalysts, they exhibit excellent heterogeneous acid catalytic activity in raw pyrolysis biofuel upgrading via esterification of acetic acid with high boiling point benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in toluene media, and therefore high acetic acid removal efficiency and efficient production of value-added benzyl acetate or 4-methoxybenzyl acetate are obtained simultaneously. The catalysts also show good reusability in target reactions, attributing to chemical interactions between BAILs and NHPC supports. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, ionic liquids (ILs) containing the phosphonium cation and four different types of fluorous anions were synthesized and characterized with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analyser (CHNS) and thermogravimetric techniques. The catalytic transesterification properties of the prepared ILs were investigated through the synthesis of biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCO). The biodiesel synthesis was performed in two-step processes. Initially, the WCO was esterified with sulphuric acid to reduce its acid value (0.7 mg KOH/g). Later the transesterification reaction was carried out with the prepared ILs, and the process was optimized with respect to IL types, catalyst loading, methanol–oil ratios, temperature, agitation speed and time. Tetrabutylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([TBP][NTf2]) was identified as a promising catalyst with the highest yield of biodiesel up to 81% at 4.5 wt% of IL loading, 18:1 ratio of methanol:WCO, 10 h of treatment time, 60 °C heating temperature and 600 rpm of agitation speed. The obtained product of biodiesel was characterized and analysed by different techniques, and its physicochemical properties were further determined using the known standard methods of American Society for Testing and Materials and European standards (ASTM and EN). © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The effects of hydrothermal treatment (traditional and microwave-assisted) in the catalytic activity of hydrotalcite were studied in the soybean oil methanolysis for a biofuel production. The catalysts were produced by coprecipitation (pH ≥ 10) and then characterized by x-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, surface chemical composition, N 2 physisorption at 77 K and surface basicity. Reactions were carried out at 180 °C for 60, 120 and 180 min, molar ratio methanol:soybean oil of 12:1 and 5 wt% of the catalyst. The microwave treatment reduced the aluminum content of catalyst lamellae and increased the surface basicity. The best yield of methyl esters was 95.6% for the catalyst treated by microwave at 110 °C for 300 min. The high yield of methyl esters shows that the use of microwaves in the synthesis of hydrotalcite can reduce the preparation time and increase the industrial competitiveness of this material as a catalyst in the biofuels industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the potential of poultry wastes to be used as feedstock in non-catalytic and catalytic fast pyrolysis processes, which is a continuation of our previous research on their conversion into biofuel via slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal conversion. Both poultry meal and poultry litter were examined, initially in a fixed bed bench-scale reactor using ZSM-5 and MgO as catalysts. Pyrolysis of poultry meal yielded high amounts of bio-oil, while pyrolysis of poultry litter yielded high amounts of solid residue owing to its high ash content. MgO was found to be more effective for the deoxygenation of bio-oil and reduction of undesirable compounds, by converting mainly the acids in the pyrolysis vapours of poultry meal into aliphatic hydrocarbons. ZSM-5 favoured the formation of both aromatic compounds and undesirable nitrogenous compounds. Overall, all bio-oil samples from the pyrolysis of poultry wastes contained relatively high amounts of nitrogen compared with bio-oils from lignocellulosic biomass, ca. 9 wt.% in the case of poultry meal and ca. 5–8 wt.% in the case of poultry litter. This was attributed to the high nitrogen content of the poultry wastes, unlike that of lignocellulosic biomass. Poultry meal yielded the highest amount of bio-oil and was selected as optimum feedstock to be scaled-up in a semi-pilot scale fluidised bed biomass pyrolysis unit with the ZSM-5 catalyst. Pyrolysis in the fluidised bed reactor was more efficient for deoxygenation of the bio-oil vapours, as evidenced from the lower oxygen content of the bio-oil. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Levoglucosenone (LGO), furfural (FF) and levoglucosan are high value-added chemical components of bio-oil derived by thermal deconstruction of biomass. However, separation of these chemicals from bio-oil is challenging due to low selectivity. Impregnation of metal salts for catalytic pyrolysis or microwave treatment for altering chemical composition in biomass are potential methods to enhance selectivity of these high value-added chemicals. In the current study, Ashe juniper waste was pretreated with metal salts prior to vacuum pyrolysis and investigated the effects of metal salt type and its concentration on product yield and properties. The results showed that Levoglucosenone, which was attributed to dehydration of levoglucosan, was obtained only with the biomass pretreated with CuSO4 and ZnSO4. Metal salt type and concentration also affected the selectivity of levoglucosenone (LGO) and furfural (FF) by catalytic vacuum pyrolysis. Microwave-assisted organosolv treatment also affected biomass chemical composition, pyrolysis characteristics and promoted the selectivity of levoglucosan. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gasification of Short Rotation Forestry (SRF) poplar wood chips and anaerobic digestion of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris have been analyzed as alternative supply chains for the production of biomethane. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed from the biomass cultivation to the upgrading stages. Process simulation of gasification and upgrading was carried out, environmental impacts of the entire supply chains have been estimated and discussed. The highest CO2 removal has been reached by absorption on monoethanolamine. Electricity requirements heavily affect the SRF chain, while productions of carbon dioxide and fertilizers are the main sources of impact of the microalgae cultivation. The recycle of non-absorbed fertilizers, as well as integration of microalgae digestion in wastewater plants, are recommended. Capture and re-injection of the CO2 lost during the upgrading stages would result, simultaneously, in an 8.53% reduction of the atmospheric emission, and in a minor demand to promote algal growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, secondary solar action to biomass, focused on the conceptualized intersection of solar energy and biomass, is presented to illustrate how “breaking” of biomass to biofuels plus hydrogen can be utilized for the adaptation of Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) chemistry. This Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) system was designed and employed for the synergetic solar energy and corresponding chemistry to provide an action of biomass for efficient solar and biomass utilization - production of biofuels plus hydrogen. The control and modulation of solar fields and sub-chemical reactions were adopted to achieve a high utilization of solar energy, high chemical conversion rate, and high selectivity of the biomass to achieve rich biofuels and abundant hydrogen. The Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) temperature of the breakdown reaction was greatly lowered by using electrolysis, as compared with the conventional pyrolysis. Based on their structural complexity and thermal stability, cellulose and lignin are well-suited for the production of biofuel and hydrogen. Through the coupling of thermolysis and electrolysis, the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) hydrogen production from cellulose was 7.2 times higher under a current of 100 mA and 8.8 times higher at 400 mA compared with pyrolysis at 200 °C. The Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) lignin conversions were significantly improved by reaching 87.22%, 21.78%, 57.72%, and 7.22% (340 °C, 400 mA), while the pyrolysis achieved only 52.39%, 19.48%, 25.81%, and 7.10% (340 °C, 0 mA), respectively, for the total rate, solid, liquid, and gas fractions. With electrochemical synergy to help, the Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) process efficiently and selectively produced gas hydrocarbons, liquid biofuel, and hydrogen. The light hydrocarbons in the gas phase, such as methane, ethane, and n-pentane, became more abundant via thermo-electrolysis. The Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process (STEP) chemistry for converting biomass to biofuels and hydrogen was also elucidated in this paper. The simplified mechanism can best be described by a series of thermo/electro-induced free radical reactions. The system, built on solar energy and specific chemical reactions, features a perfect, green, sustainable, and recyclable operation to transform solar biomass to biofuels and hydrogen. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Typically, sludge palm oil (SPO) which discharged from the palm oil refining process, is a low cost material of potential value, due to its high free fatty acid content. Accordingly, there is potential for upgrading low grade oil into valuable biofuel. In this work, we present a novel method for biodiesel production from SPO. The process consists of two steps (i) free fatty acid (FFA) extraction (ii) enzymatic esterification. Firstly, SPO was saponified by hydroalcoholic solution into soap and glycerol. Secondly, the FFAs obtained were further converted into biodiesel via enzymatic esterification catalyzed by immobilised alginate-PVA lipase beads. • Biodiesel production from sludge palm oil could be completed. • A modified fatty acid extraction was used for SPO fatty acid preparation. • Immobilised alginate-PVA lipase beads were used as biocatalyst for esterification reaction. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Synthesis of liquid biofuels (C11-C13) from cellulosic ethanol is regarded as a promising and versatile protocol. In this study, oxide-supported nanogold catalysts exhibit good catalytic performance in ethanol conversion with cinnamaldehyde and finally give rise to the C11-C13 hydrocarbon. High selectivity (70%) for C11-C13 hydrocarbons is achieved over Au/NiO via a one-pot cascade reaction, viz. cross-aldol condensations in the presence of oxygen and base (K2CO3) and then full hydrodeoxygenation with hydrogen gas. EtOH-TPD and TGA analyses show that the ethanol is activated to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO∗) over the surface oxygen vacancies of the NiO support. The CH3CHO∗ then reacts with cinnamaldehyde at the interfacial perimeter of the Au/NiO composite during the cascade reactions, as evidenced by comparison of the catalytic performance with that over another oxide-supported Au NP, chemo-adsorption investigations, and in situ infrared spectroscopy investigations. This work may provide new guidelines for designing efficient catalysts to convert bioethanol into biofuels with high energy density. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Exploring both high-performance catalytic materials from non-edible lignocellulosic biomass and selective hydrodeoxygenation of bioderived molecules will enable value-added utilization of renewable feedstocks to replace rapidly diminishing fossil resources. Herein, we developed a scale-up and sustainable method to fabricate gram-quantities of highly dispersed cobalt nanocatalysts sheathed in multilayered N-doped graphene (Co@NG) by using a biomacromolecule carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a raw material. The ionic gelation of CMC, urea and Co2+ ions leads to uniform dispersion and chelation of different species, consequently resulting in the formation of highly distributed Co nanoparticles (NPs) (10.91 nm) with N-enriched graphene shells in the solid-state thermolysis process. The usage of urea as a non-corrosive activation agent can introduce a porous belt-like nanostructure and abundant doped nitrogen. Among all the prepared catalysts in this work, the optimized Co@NG-6 with the largest specific surface area (627 m2 g-1), the most and strongest basic sites, and the highest proportion of pyridinic-N (37.6%) and mesopores exhibited excellent catalytic activity (99% yield of 2-methoxy-p-cresol) for base-free transfer hydrodeoxygenation (THD) of vanillin using bioderived formic acid (FA) as a H source at 160 °C for 6 h. The poisoning tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra verified that the strong interaction between N atoms and encapsulated Co NPs provided synergistic effects, which were essential for the outstanding catalytic performance of Co@NG-6. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect study clearly demonstrated that the formation of Co-H-via β-hydride elimination and protonation was the rate-determining step, and protic N-H+ and hydridic Co-H- were considered to be active intermediate species in the THD reaction. Furthermore, Co@NG-6 was highly stable for recycling owing to the graphene shells preventing Co NPs from corrosion and aggregation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.

AB  - The aldol-condensation reaction of biomass-derived furfural and cyclopentanone coupled with hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation is a promising route for the production of renewable high-quality diesel or jet fuel. In this paper, we focus on the heterogeneously catalyzed aldol condensation of furfural with cyclopentanone, in order to maximize the yield of 2,5-bis(2-furylmethylidene)cyclopentan-1-one (F 2 C, a C 15 fuel precursor). Experiments were conducted over a series of solid-base catalysts and it was found that potassium fluoride impregnated alumina shown the highest catalytic efficiency. We further investigated the effect of different parameters on the performance of KF/γ-Al 2 O 3 , including KF loading amount, solvent, reaction time and temperature. Over KF/γ-Al 2 O 3 with a 33% KF loading amount, the aldol reaction achieved an F 2 C molar yield up to 95.4% at 333 K within 2 h. Under the nearly optimal condition, the separated solid product is almost F 2 C with a purity of 100%, providing a high-quality biofuel precursor for the next processing step. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The rapid growth of populations and vehicles has resulted in the rapid increase in the energy demand. Due to the energy demand and fast depleting of fossil fuels, researchers focus more on to find the suitable alternative fuel for diesel. The Azolla Algae oil biodiesel is appropriate to fuel for compression ignition (CI) engine. The biodiesel blends (B20) were prepared with and without Zirconium Oxide nano-additives. The fuel properties are tested as per the ASTM standard and presented in this report. A single cylinder diesel engine capable of developing a power output at 1500 rpm is used for this experiment. The experimental results reveal that the use of biodiesel blend with nano-additives in diesel engine has exhibited the better reduction in exhaust emissions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Acid-hydrolysis residual (AHR) offers significant potential for harvesting chemical energy with simultaneous reduction of environmental pollution, providing carbon neutral (or even carbon negative) sustained energy production, energy security and alleviating social concerns associated with the wastes. In this study, the different effects of intrinsic and extrinsic K and Na were compared firstly. In addition, the effect of different content of alkali metal chlorides doped into AHR and temperature on pyrolysis products were investigated, especially for the phenolic products in bio-oil, along with the grey relational analysis. The results showed that KCl and NaCl promoted the generation of char and gas at the expense of the bio-oil yield. While, addition of KCl and NaCl could increase the yields of total phenolic species. Specifically, the yields of phenols and hydroxy phenols increased, while the guaiacols and syringols content decreased. The effect of KCl on the distribution of pyrolysis products and phenolic species was somewhat greater than NaCl, especially for bio-oil yield. The increasing of pyrolysis temperature would increase gas yield and reduce the char yield. While the bio-oil yield was peaked at 650 ℃. Besides, higher temperature restrained the generation of syringols and promoted the generation of phenols and hydroxy phenols. The grey relational analysis of KCl and temperature showed that KCl content was the major factor in the generation of bio-oil in pyrolysis process, while temperature played more notable role on the yields of total phenolic species, phenols, hydroxy phenols, guaiacols and syringols. The addition of alkali metal chlorides could promote the pyrolysis process and enhance the maximum lower heating value (LHV) of pyrolysis gas, especially the addition of NaCl. The optimal value of addition amount of KCl and NaCl was found to be 2 wt.% and 0.5 wt.%, respectively. Besides, the addition of KCl and NaCl could improve pore quality and activation of AHR pyrolysis char. Based on the pyrolysis products from cellulose, it can be proposed that cellulose has two main pathway depending on the alkali metal chlorides content. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nowadays biodiesel usage is widely adopted in internal combustion engine because of availability and lower exhaust emissions. During the biodiesel production around 10% glycerol is obtained as a byproduct, and this can be efficiently used in CI engines. In this paper the crude glycerol obtained from the trans-esterification process of biodiesel is used to produce hydrogen enriched syngas, through water mixture by directly injecting it into a fast thermal cracking reactor at different temperature such as 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C and 750 °C. The yield of syngas at different temperatures and different glycerol-water proportions are analyzed. It is seen that the addition of water has improved the syngas yield and also increased the proportion of hydrogen in the syngas up to 80%. Further the performance and emission study of the syngas in a compression ignition engine showed significant reduction in smoke and NO emission simultaneously. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The simplified direct-transesterification (DT) process was compared to the conventional biodiesel production process based on a reported previous experimental work with economic standpoint. Based on the process flow diagram, capital and operating costs were itemized properly and then unit biodiesel production cost was calculated. The results show the biodiesel production costs were 18.2 $ kg−1 (conventional process) and 12.5 $ kg−1 (DT process), respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows the source of biomass and chemical consumption are the major factors to determine total biodiesel production cost. The affecting factors were a solvent recycling, yield of biodiesel, and plant capacity and these values were varied to evaluate the variation of unit biodiesel production cost. As a result, the maximized biodiesel production cost went down to 3.5 $ kg−1, which is cost-competitive with other reported values of production cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wheat straw (WS) was pretreated by ammonium sulfite (AS) for efficient acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) production by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Spent liquor containing the amides has the potential to be used for slow-release fertilizer production, and the solid fraction was readily for ABE fermentation. Compared to the results of separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), relative higher ABE titer and yield were achieved in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using different level of AS pretreated WS (6%, 7.5%, 9% and 10.5%, w/v). As biomass loading in SHF increased from 6% to 10.5%, ABE (butanol) titer increased from 12.28 (7.52) to 17.75 (11.25) g/L, with ABE (butanol) yield reducing from 161 (98) to 133 (84) g/kg raw WS. For SSF, the maximum ABE (butanol) titer was obtained from 9% biomass loading. As biomass loading increased from 6% to 9%, ABE (butanol) titer increased from 17.13 (9.50) to 19.83 (12.64) g/L, with ABE (butanol) yield reducing from 224 (1 2 4) to 173 (1 1 0) g/kg raw WS. This study suggested that ABE production by SSF is viable to be conducted using AS pretreated WS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Supported cross-linked enzyme aggregates were prepared by immobilization of Candida antarctica lipase B onto hydrophobic surface of octyl-modified mesocellular foams (MCFs-C8). Oxidized sodium alginate was used as a substitute for traditional glutaraldehyde. Supported cross-linked enzyme aggregates using oxidized sodium alginate (SA-CLEAs@MCFs-C8) exhibited significantly improved thermal stability and organic solvents tolerance compared to the free lipase, lipase adsorbed onto MCFs-C8 and supported cross-linked enzyme aggregates using glutaraldehyde (G-CLEAs@MCFs-C8). Then immobilized lipases were employed for biodiesel production by transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. In the optimization condition, SA-CLEAs@MCFs-C8 were quite stable and still showed high fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield after 5 repeated cycles (from 89% to 78%), whereas MCFs-C8-CALB retained 67% FAME yield (about 72% for G-CLEAs@MCFs-C8). © 2019

AB  - The identification of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) for efficient polysaccharide deconstruction is essential for the development of biofuels. Here, we investigate the potential of sequential HMM-profile identification for the rapid and precise identification of the multi-domain architecture of GHs from various datasets. First, as a validation, we successfully reannotated >98% of the biochemically characterized enzymes listed on the CAZy database. Next, we analyzed the 43 million non-redundant sequences from the M5nr data and identified 322,068 unique GHs. Finally, we searched 129 assembled metagenomes retrieved from MG-RAST for environmental GHs and identified 160,790 additional enzymes. Although most identified sequences corresponded to single domain enzymes, many contained several domains, including known accessory domains and some domains never identified in association with GH. Several sequences displayed multiple catalytic domains and few of these potential multi-activity proteins combined potentially synergistic domains. Finally, we produced and confirmed the biochemical activities of a GH5-GH10 cellulase-xylanase and a GH11-CE4 xylanase-esterase. Globally, this “gene to enzyme pipeline” provides a rationale for mining large datasets in order to identify new catalysts combining unique properties for the efficient deconstruction of polysaccharides. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The biofuels have great ecological advantages against the petroleum fuels, especially when they are obtained from residues with environmental pollution potential. So, the biodiesel was produced using oil from the fish processing residue collected in the Fishermen's Colony Z-3, Brazil, and the experiments were developed with two different methods for production of biofuels. The fish residue was thermally treated to extract the fatty material and the biodiesel was produced by the methods of heating, stirring, and heating and stirring assisted by ultrasonic waves. The best biodiesel was with heating and stirring method with yields of 92.37% and 97.95% with the reaction times of 30 and 60 min, respectively. The ultrasonic method provided the highest biodiesel yield at the sonication time of 2 min, at the frequency of 20 kHz. The biodiesel produced from the fish waste showed high concentrations of sodium, potassium and magnesium. Furthermore, the production of biodiesel from a potential residue that can contaminate the environment, such as fish residue, promotes a social and economic increment in a community like Fishermen's Colony Z-3. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study presented an innovative way to dispose and upgrade heavy metal (HM) contaminated biomass by solar pyrolysis. Pyrolysis of raw and HM (Cu and Ni) impregnated willow wood was performed in a solar reactor under different temperatures (600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400 and 1600 °C) and heating rates (10 and 50 °C/s). The combined effects of HM and heating parameters (temperature and heating rates) on solar pyrolysis products were investigated. The results indicated that a threshold temperature of 1000 °C was required in impregnated willow pyrolysis to make sure copper and nickel catalytic effects on promoting the cracking and reforming reactions of tar. It led to the gas yields from copper or nickel impregnated willow pyrolysis at 1200 °C increased by 14.76% and 34.47%, respectively, compared with that from raw willow. In particular, the H2 and CO production from nickel impregnated willow were higher than those from raw willow (10.30 and 12.16 mol/kg of wood versus 6.59 and 8.20 mol/kg of wood) in case of fast pyrolysis (50 °C/s). Under heating rate of 10 °C/s, H2 and CO yields from only nickel impregnated willow increased compared with that from raw willow. Solar pyrolysis of HM contaminated biomass is a promising way to produce valuable syngas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, Portulaca seed oil was studied as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Portulaca is a type of weed that is able to grow in most weather conditions. The process of transesterification reaction for biodiesel production was optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM) method. Moreover, quadratic polynomial equations were obtained for the transesterification reaction. The ultrasonic system was employed to reduce the reaction time. The effects of independent variables such as catalyst concentration, reaction time and molar ratio of methanol-to-oil were studied. The reaction temperature was considered to be 55 °C. Also, the amplitude and the pulse of the ultrasonic system were 70% and 0.4 s, respectively. The results of the research indicated that all independent variables and their interaction have a significant effect on biodiesel yield. The highest biodiesel yield was 97.81% for the following optimum conditions: catalyst concentration of 1.01% (w/w), methanol: oil molar ratio of 8.49:1, reaction time of 8.01 min, temperature of 55 °C, pulse of 0.4 s, and an amplitude of 70%. Furthermore, all the measured physicochemical properties are in accordance with the ASTM standard. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that Portulaca weed seeds are a suitable source for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The importance of microalgae as a potential source of biofuel and value-added products has led to the development of microalgae-based biorefinery in recent years. However, the downstream process including lipid extraction and the refining process remains one of the main problems for commercialization due to its low economic feasibility induced by high usage of organic solvents and energy consumption. To solve these problems, a high shear mixer (HSM) was applied to the downstream process in this study. We first demonstrated both lipid extraction and degumming process using a bench-scale HSM with concentrated wet biomass (360 g/L) of DHA-rich oleaginous Aurantiochytrium sp. The high shear-assisted lipid extraction process was developed based on key operating parameters, the solvent to wet cell (S/W) ratio, rotational speed (rpm), and temperature. Our results revealed that 90% lipid extraction yield was achieved with the lowest energy consumption (4.83 MJ/kg) and solvent usage (5.9 ml/g dry cell) at conditions of a 2:1 (w/v) of S/W ratio and 7000 rpm at 55 °C for 30 min treatment. In the degumming process, the impurities were removed from the crude oil by hydrating phospholipids. As a result, highly purified degummed oil with the negligible phosphorus content (5 ppm) was obtained. These results suggest that the HSM can be applied to the downstream process to obtain highly purified lipids with low energy consumption and solvent usage, thereby dramatically improving the overall economic feasibility compared to the conventional process. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - A novel approach for sustainability enhancement of jet biofuel production from palm oil and soybean oil is proposed. A comparative Well-to-Wake analysis was performed assuming a supply chain in two strategic regions of Brazil, according to each raw material. The functional unit was 1.0 MJ of energy, and impacts were quantified using Impact 2002 + and Cumulative Energy Demand methods. Two different situations, referred to as scenarios, for each vegetable oil were proposed. First conversion scenario (baseline case) included conventional jet biofuel production characteristics, regarding the use of fossil hydrogen. Second conversion scenario (enhanced case) explored renewable alternatives for hydrogen production, such as residual biomass gasification, in palm oil case, and water electrolysis, for soybean oil scenario. Results indicate significant reductions, ranging from 57% to 94%, in the global warming impact category of all scenarios as compared with conventional jet fuel. Moreover, palm oil and soybean oil improved scenarios reached the lowest carbon footprint of 4.8 and 33.9 g CO2 eq/MJ, respectively. Additionally, when considering Life Cycle Energy Efficiency an increase of about 65% and 63% for palm oil and soybean oil enhanced scenarios was observed, compared to baseline cases. In the case of Fossil Energy Ratio, an increase of 4.4% and 29.6% was determined in the same vein. Besides, in all scenarios, palm oil showed lower consumption of fossil and renewable energy than soybean oil. Some limitations of the present work can be described as: economic and logistic feasibility, due to immature technologies; geographic conditions which could affect agricultural performance; and technical aspects regarding hydrogen production technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We previously established a biomass pretreatment approach using acetic acid (which can be used as a carbon source for acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation) as the chemical catalyst, leading to comprehensive biomass utilization and enhanced solvent production (especially acetone production due to reassimilation of elevated fatty acids) using Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum. However, acetone is corrosive to engine parts and cannot be used as a fuel. Thus, acetone produced during ABE fermentation is considered as an undesirable byproduct. In this study, we metabolically engineer C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum for isopropanol-butanol-ethanol (IBE) production by introducing secondary alcohol dehydrogenase gene to convert acetone into isopropanol. With either plasmid-based or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated chromosomal-integration-based overexpression, efficient IBE production was achieved. To further enhance solvent production, we additionally overexpressed sol operon (ald-ctfA-ctfB-adc), expression cassette EC (thl-hbd-crt-bcd) or sol in combination with EC. All resultant mutants generated elevated solvents, with one mutant produced 34.2 g/L IBE with a yield of 0.48 g/g. Finally, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation was carried out with the mutant using acetic-acid-pretreated switchgrass, and 16.2 g/L IBE was produced. Our engineered strain produced the highest IBE that has ever been reported in a batch fermentation. Our results indicated that acetic-acid-pretreated biomass can be efficiently converted into biofuel using metabolically engineered Clostridium. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Efficient extraction of valuable products from microalgae and utilization of the residual biomass for biofuel production appear to bring economic benefits for the microalgae biorefineries. The pulsed electric field (PEF) method has been proposed as a promising pre-treatment for microalgae wet extraction. For conversion of microalgae biomass and residues, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is considered a suitable method. Here, a combination of PEF-assisted valuables extraction of microalgae and HTL of the residual biomass is studied for the first time. The microalgae Auxenochlorella protothecoides, Chlorella vulgaris, and Scenedesmus almeriensis were cultivated, harvested, treated by PEF, and then subjected to lipid extraction, protein extraction, or extraction of amino acids after enzymatic protein hydrolysis. The residual biomass obtained from PEF-assisted valuables extraction was subjected to HTL in micro autoclaves at a temperature of 350 °C and pressure of 25 MPa for 15 min holding time. Product yields and analytical results obtained by elemental content measurement, 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatography show that PEF alone has no significant direct influence on microalgae HTL. The harsh HTL conditions decisively determine the product yields and biocrude quality. However, PEF enhances the lipid extraction yield from 4 wt% to 33 wt%. Consequently, the biocrude yield decreases from 58 wt% to 43.2 wt%. Moreover, PEF boosts the protein extraction yield from almost zero to 41.6 wt% of the total protein, resulting in an increased biocrude yield by about 2 wt%. Finally, PEF accelerates the formation of amino acids by enzymatic hydrolysis, improving the extraction efficiency up to 150% in the first 60 min of the extraction. The extracted residue promises to produce a biocrude yield higher by 6 wt% and a better biocrude quality with lower nitrogen content. An overall mass balance of PEF-assisted valuables extraction and HTL is presented. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This is the first report on an ecofriendly process for producing FAMEs and β-farnesene via a two-stage biotransformation of waste cooking oils (WCOs), in which the FAMEs are referred to as biodiesel products and β-farnesene is used as a jet biofuel. First, the yield of FAMEs from untreated WCOs by Novozym 435 was 33% under the initial transesterification conditions with crude glycerol containing 46% (w/w) methanol. However, crude glycerol with highly concentrated methanol seriously inhibited fermentation for the production of β-farnesene by an engineered E. coli strain with a relatively balanced mevalonate (MVA) pathway that was constructed with the recombinant plasmids pMevT, pMBIS and pFiI. The pretreatment of WCOs and optimization of the transesterification process were successfully performed to completely eliminate fermentation repression, and the methanol content in the crude glycerol was reduced to zero. The production of β-farnesene (5.29 g/L) using this crude glycerol as a substrate was approximately 50% higher than that (3.56 g/L) produced under the initial conditions, which was more than 100% higher than that (2.62 g/L) produced using crude glycerol via chemical transesterification methods. Furthermore, the optimal transesterification process resulted in a sharply increased yield of FAMEs (96%) compared that (33%) obtained under the initial conditions. Therefore, this biotechnology achieved a high FAMEs yield and β-farnesene production and might be suitable for industrial-scale implementation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this modern era, an increase in urbanization causes the escalating trend of fuel demand as well as environmental pollution problems. Various biofuels research with the respect of climate change and emission reduction recently intensifies, particularly in biodiesel. In Indonesia, diesel oil currently in use contains 20% of biodiesel. Utilizing waste-based resources such as rendered chicken tallow as the feedstock could be the solution to both energy and environmental challenges. However, chicken tallow contains a significant amount of free fatty acid (FFA) which will obstruct the production yield of biodiesel. In this study, catalyst-free subcritical methanol has been employed to convert waste chicken tallow (WCT) with high FFA into biodiesel. Design of experiment was conducted to study the effect of temperature, time, and the molar ratio of methanol to fats on the purity and recovery of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Based on the optimization study performed by response surface methodology (RSM), all three independent variables gave a significant effect on the recovery of FAME. From the experimental results, the maximum FAME yield obtained was 98.43 ± 0.22% with the optimum condition as follows: 167°C, 36.8 minutes, and 42.7:1 (methanol/WCT, mol/mol), while the predicted FAME yield obtained using RSM was 97.76%. The methyl ester composition of WCT-based biodiesel ranges from C13 to C24. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Bi-oil, the liquid product from biomass fast pyrolysis, is a kind of clean and sustainable fuel. However, its physicochemical characteristics are not stable, which hinder its actual applications. In this research, bio-oil made from rice husk by a commercial-scale biomass fast pyrolysis plant was utilized to investigate the effects of long period storage (two years) under three different conditions: at 4 °C in a refrigerator, at 25 °C in a room, and at outdoors in the nature conditions. In each condition, three samples collected from the upper, middle and the bottom of the containers. The results showed that low temperature (4 °C) can slow down the process of degradation during storage. The bio-oils endure the most severe aging process at 25 °C in a room. The maximum value of the viscosity was obtained from the bottom layer of bio-oil stored at 25 °C (348.5 ± 2.9 mm2 s−1), which is 50.8 times higher than that of the original bio-oil. The alcohols, furans and hydrocarbons are prone to accumulate in the bottom layers. This research could give insight on degradation of bio-oils at the distinct storage conditions and will be useful for designing the storage system and maintaining the quality of bio-oils in transportation and storage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study explores the feasibility of Sr–Ce based mixed metal oxides for its performance in transesterification reaction of waste cooking oil. The catalyst synthesis was carried out through gel combustion route and was characterized through several techniques including thermal analysis (TGA-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), attenuated total reflectance based Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) assisted with EDX, BET specific surface area and Hammett indicator basicity. The enhanced activity of the catalyst was investigated at pH 7.0 with Sr–Ce atomic ratio of 3:1 at 900 °C of calcination temperature. Influences of various process parameters on transesterification efficiency were carefully investigated. The experimental results demonstrated that maximum transesterification efficacy of 99.5% was achieved under optimized reaction conditions with catalyst dose of 2.0 wt %, oil-to-methanol ratio 1:14, reaction time 120 min, reaction temperature 65 °C and stirring speed of 700 rpm. For better interpretation of the process, the reaction rate was computed by employing pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetics model at varying reaction temperature (50 °C–75 °C). The transesterification data agreed well with pseudo-first order model with highest rate constant value of 2.5 × 10−3 min−1 was evaluated at 65 °C. Activation energy and frequency of the reaction was quantified from the Arrhenius expression as 17.04 kJ/mol and 9.92 min−1, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis of the reaction system suggests that the transesterification of the waste cooking oil followed endergonic reaction pathway. Synthesis of biodiesel was ascertained from the H1-NMR and FTIR analysis of the transesterified product, further, the physicochemical properties of the biodiesel were also compared with that of diesel fuel and the resultant values were found to be within ASTM limits. Reusability study was also conducted and it indicated that the catalyst can be easily regenerated and could be effectively reused up to four runs. © 2019

AB  - Hydrogen (H2) production from sugarcane press-mud, a waste obtained from the non-centrifugal sugarcane agroindustry, was assessed by coupling hydrolysis, fermentation, purification, and ethanol steam reforming (ESR). Two culture media were employed on three different sugarcane press-mud samples to produce bioethanol by fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 30 °C. One culture medium was supplemented with nutrients and the other without supplementation. The supplementation did not have a significant effect over ethanol production (∼82.1 g L−1) after 70 h fermentation, but the concentration of the impurities was always lower under supplemented conditions. Among tested impurities, differences in 3-methyl-1-butanol showed the effect of the supplementation on the ESR over RhPt/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst at 700 °C, where the H2 yield decreased significantly in the presence of 3-methyl-1-butanol (p &lt; 0.05). The spearman correlation coefficient showed that the H2 yield was correlated with the 3-methy-1-butanol content (RHO = −0.929) and carbon deposits (RHO = −0.964). Therefore, supplemented bioethanol could deliver 3.0 g H2 kg−1 sugarcane press-mud, which is almost twice that of the non-supplemented samples, likely due to the reduction of harmful impurities in the bioethanol. Additionally, supplemented conditions allowed for energy savings in the process and improved catalyst stability. This study provides insights into the effect of supplementing culture media to produce purer bioethanol samples, which further deliver higher H2 yields by ESR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The oxidation of a Jatropha curcas-derived biodiesel was accelerated through the Rancimat method. High-frequency reciprocating friction, wear testing and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) were utilized to analyze the influence of composition changes during the oxidation of Jatropha biodiesel on its lubricating properties. This research indicated that: The polar functional ester group of Jatropha biodiesel could be adsorbed on a metal surface to form a physical adsorption membrane, while its carbon‑carbon double bond would enhance the electrostatic force among the adsorbed membrane molecules, to improve the lubricating properties of Jatropha biodiesel; the oxidation had a significant effect on the lubricating properties of biodiesel. The peroxides generated by the short-time oxidation would stimulate the decomposition of the fatty acid chain, destroying the stability of the lubricative adsorption membrane. The highly polar products and epoxy compounds formed at the later stage of oxidation contributed to the formation of a stable boundary film on the metal surface and enhanced the lubricity of biodiesel. © 2019

AB  - This study developed a novel in situ transesterification process by combining the solvent and catalyst functions of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) for biodiesel synthesis from spent coffee grounds (SCG). The influence of reaction parameters on the reaction was investigated. The maximum biodiesel yield of 96.13% was observed at DBU-to-SCG and methanol-to-SCG ratios of 20 and 10 mL/g, respectively; a reaction temperature of 130 °C; and a reaction time of 60 min. Notably, the polarity of DBU could be reversibly regulated, thus facilitating excellent product separation. Moreover, DBU could be effectively reused for 10 cycles to yield high biodiesel conversion. DBU-catalyzed in situ transesterification of SCG is a promising, ecofriendly, and economically viable biodiesel production process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes are widely applied in biofuel production, gasoline desulfurization, and wastewater treatment because of its excellent organophilic nature. However, curing of PDMS membrane usually lasts for hours to days. In this study, effects of temperature, catalyst, water, and ethanol on viscoelasticity of PDMS before and after coating were investigated. A mathematical model was proposed to describe the relationships between viscosity of coating mixture and time. The time window to coat PDMS coating mixture could be predicted by this model with errors below 2.7 min. Moreover, we proposed an imprint method to determine the time for membrane winding-up. Finally, a continuous fabrication procedure was established by controlling compositions of coating mixture and crosslinking conditions where the time window to coat PDMS and duration of winding up were 88.3 min and 11 min, respectively. The fast and continuous preparation procedure fits the requirement of producing large amounts of PDMS membranes. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Highest third worldwide production of the agricultural product namely rice causes a huge quantity of waste residues especially, rice bran concurrently with rice husk. It fabricates the residual wastes nearly of about 31.9 MMT annually throughout the world and owing to the thermal point of view they are not easily upgradable due to high silica content. Meanwhile, rice bran after extrusion in broilers have been used to extract oil containing free fatty acids (FFAs) (15–30%) such as cis–9–, &amp; cis–12–octadecadienoic and cis–9, cis–12 &amp; cis–15–octadecatrienoic oils. Rice bran fatty oil methyl esters are suitably converted into biodiesel for compression ignition (CI) engines via transesterification path in the presence of Ni/H2 heterogeneous basic catalytical environment along with 4–methoxy–2–hydroxybenzalidene–p–toluidine promoter. Owing to significant viscous and volatile nature drawbacks of potential alternative first and second generation biofuels, there occur some troubles in their long application in CI engines could effectively minimized by such a catalytical pathway. The literature has been found a very little research on this oil as a potential substitute for petro–diesel. Finally, the produced rice bran based biodiesel was analyzed for its appropriateness as a fuel for CI engines. The outcomes explored the characteristics for the biodiesel extracted, under the most promising circumstances are resembling those of the petro–based fuels. The observed yields are high when compared to other enzymatic transesterification and homogeneous catalysis. In addition, in vitro microbial and antioxidant potentialities of RBOB were tested and compared with standard controls. Alternatively, low value by–products for the biodiesel industries like glycerol were also obtained and it gave oil suitable to feed the power generators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An efficient solid base catalyst derived from waste borosilicate glass, by its reaction with sodium hydroxide, is used here for the production of biodiesel from used cooking oil. The active phase of the catalyst is found to be Na2SiO3 and the material is highly effective in the production of fuel grade biodiesel till 4 numbers of repeated cycles. The catalyst is found to be tolerant to free fatty acid and water content in the oil feedstock. The procedure is up-graded in pilot scale with the aid of a set up made of polypropylene vessels where the formation of high pressure is avoided in the reactors by the continuous condensation of methanol, making the process a safer one. We report the use of a solid catalyst derived from waste materials in a pilot-scale biodiesel production unit for the first time, which has the potential to have an easy and cost-effective industrial scale up. The performance of the prepared biodiesel and its blends with petrodiesel in diesel engine is investigated and it is found that the biodiesel blend (B10)showed the best performance at all engine loads. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The low-cost and environmentally friendly solid acid catalysts for the efficient synthesis of ethyl levulinate fuel additives were prepared from pine needles through the partial carbonization, followed by a hydrothermal H2SO4 sulfonation procedure. The resultant sulfonated carbon catalysts possessed an amorphous carbon structure and high contents of the sulfate groups. Other than that, they had good thermal stability and the total acid density was as high as 2.28 mmol g−1. In this work, noticeably, the parameters of both synthetic and catalytic reactions were optimized to enhance the conversion of levulinic acid (LA). The results showed that the LA conversion was as high as 96.1% over the catalysts carbonizated at 700 °C for 90 min and sulfonated at 160 °C for 15 h under the optimized conditions (5:1 ethanol/LA molar ratio, 5 wt% catalyst dosage, 80 °C reaction temperature, 8 h reaction time). Meanwhile, the recyclability experiments confirmed that the resultant catalysts exhibited satisfactory reusability and the corresponding conversion of LA was maintained as 63.0% in the fourth run. Remarkably, the reused catalysts can be easily activated again and the corresponding LA conversion could reach up to 90.1%. The results demonstrated that the catalysts had great potential in the synthesis of biofuels, which could be efficient and could have excellent recyclability. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - NiMo-alumina catalysts with a small quantity of Mo showed ordered mesoporous structure. For 4.3 mmol total metals content, mesoporous structure, however, became disorder for 1.7 mmol and higher Mo content. The C18 alkane was the leading product among hydrocarbons (C15–C22) formed during hydrodeoxygenation of karanja oil. The catalytically active NiMo complex and Mo oxide species with lower oxidation states were substantial in NiMo catalysts with the modest quantity of both Mo and Ni and relatively small for the other two extremes. The catalytic activity and selectivity to C18 alkane were thus enhanced with the rise in Mo content up to 3.4 mmol. The catalytic activity was also improved with growing total metals content and temperature. The optimum catalyst (0.9 mmol Ni and 3.4 mmol Mo) showed the complete conversion of oxygenates with 13 wt% &lt; C18, 75 wt% C18, and 12 wt% &gt; C18 alkanes at 340 °C and 4 h reaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Grape seeds were deconstructed in both hydrothermal and supercritical ethanol media with a combination of two metal chlorides (TiCl4:MgCl2)to produce bio-oils. The use of metal chloride additives in supercritical ethanol achieved the highest bio-oil yield of 49.2 wt% (300 °C, 30 min). Both the hydrothermal and supercritical ethanol deconstruction with the additives (TiCl4:MgCl2 = 4 mmol:4mmol)produced the bio-oils with a higher heating value (HHV)of 35 MJ/Kg. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)analysis of the bio-oils showed that the major products in bio-oils from the hydrothermal deconstruction were acids while the majority products in bio-oils form the supercritical ethanol deconstruction were esters. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)data of the bio-oils suggested that both hydrothermal and supercritical ethanol deconstruction with metal chlorides significantly reduced the non-condensed OH and oxygenated lignin sub-units in bio-oils; while only supercritical ethanol deconstruction with metal chlorides reduced the aliphatic OH and O-alkylated structures in bio-oils. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An in vivo, label-free, nondestructive, and quantitative visualization of the intracellular lipids concentration in individual microalgae cells under nitrogen stress was obtained by integrating Raman chemical imaging and multiple regression analysis. Lipids and biomass were significantly affected by nitrogen stress and induction time. Especially, in the first four days under stress, the higher the stress intensity, the faster the increase in the lipid concentration. A quantitative linear relationship between the Raman spectral response and the lipid concentration of colonial microalgae was established with satisfactory results (Rp2 = 0.925). Characteristic Raman bands for quantitative determination of lipids were then extracted based on competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS). Furthermore, the visualization of intracellular lipid concentration derived from the quantitative linear regression model outperformed that by integration of Raman intensity at a fingerprint band (1266 or 1445 cm−1). This quantitative visualization of intracellular lipids concentration could effectively provide the spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics of intracellular lipids in microalgae cells under nitrogen stress, which should be helpful in revealing intracellular lipid metabolism and accumulation for the utilization of microalgae biomass in biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the requirements for efficient biological conversion of lignocellulose to bioproducts is the compatibility of biological catalysts with the processes employed to solubilize and depolymerize the lignocellulosic components. The red yeasts Rhodosporidium toruloides and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were evaluated for their ability to assimilate sugars and aromatic compounds extracted from two engineered lines of Arabidopsis thaliana with modified lignin or the wild-type using ionic liquid, acid or alkaline pretreatments. Differential amounts of monomeric sugars, organic acids and, in the case of the engineered lines, either 4-hydroxybenzoic or protocatechuic acid were additionally released from the biomass and found to be tolerated and consumed by both microorganisms. Genetically-engineered strains of the two red yeasts successfully converted the depolymerized products into the biofuel precursor bisabolene when cultivated on hydrolysates or synthetic media containing specific sugars, acids and aromatics found in the hydrolysates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents a novel method for the production of a biomass-derived chemical platform, levoglucosan (LGA), from sugarcane bagasse via pretreatment with an organocatalyst (CX4SO3H)and fast pyrolysis. The effectiveness of this platform for producing LGA from sugarcane bagasse was screened using a microscale pyrolysis reactor coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The effects of CX4SO3H loading, temperature and pretreatment time were studied, and the best pretreatment conditions were 3 wt/wt%, 1 h and 23 °C. The yields of LGA from sugarcane bagasse in the presence and absence of CX4SO3H were 32.3 and 4.6%, respectively, compared to raw biomass. The presence of CX4SO3H for the treatment of biomass may make this process an interesting and very useful alternative for the production of a biomass-derived chemical platform, especially for levoglucosan production, as renewable feedstock for biofuels production and other bioproducts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pretreatment of biomass with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has been a popular method since it facilitates the generation of biofuels and mitigates the problems arising from the use of corrosive sulfuric acid that is otherwise commonly employed for pretreatment. However, variations took place in the structure of biomass through this treatment have not so far been investigated in detail. This paper focuses on the effects of aqueous H3PO4 treatment on the lignocellulosic residue of corn (CR) considering the fuel properties, ash fusion temperatures, combustion characteristics and kinetics, mineral phases, surface functionalities, and the morphology of the treated biomass. It was determined that interaction of biomass with 5% H3PO4 solution led to important variations from cellulose crystallinity to thermal reactivity of this lignocellulosic material. Although elements such as Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Fe could be effectively removed by treatment, formation of phosphorus containing new phases caused to increase in ash yield. Also, the change in mineral matter composition led to an increase in ash fusion temperatures along with reduction in the burning rates. Thus, the combustibility and combustion performance indices dropped. Copyright © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - Research has intensified toward the production of biofuels due to increased economic uncertainty and environmental issues associated with petroleum fuel production. A fifth of the global energy demand is derived from transportation fuels such as diesel, jet fuel, and gasoline. Most of the research in literature focuses on the production of biodiesel to supplement petroleum-based diesel. This review evaluates and compares three methods: (1) hydroprocessing, (2) pyrolysis (catalytic cracking), and (3) transesterification to determine the ideal, and simultaneous, biogasoline and biojet fuel production technique from castor oil, a nonedible vegetable oil. The methods are compared on the ability to produce biofuels using in spark-ignition engine or/and aviation. Edible oils have been thoroughly investigated as a biofuel feedstock, which competes with food sources, hence the requirement to switch the focus to nonedible oils. From extensive research, it is clear that transesterification is not adequate on its own. Hydrocracking is the ideal solution as it can simultaneously produce high-quality biojet fuel and biogasoline using one catalyst. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Catalytic fast pyrolysis of Pongamia residual cake (PRC)and the kinetics of this were evaluated using thermogravimetry and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses. The influence of the heating rate on the devolatilization process was studied to obtain corresponding kinetic information. Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS)and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO)model-free isoconversion methods were used to predict the kinetic parameters. The major thermal degradation of PRC occurred around 150–550 °C with an activation energy of 97.2–394.3 kJ/mol or 114.5–412.2 kJ/mol as determined by the KAS and FWO methods, respectively. Micro-scale pyrolysis trials were performed to determine the effects of the PRC particle size, reaction temperature and PRC: catalyst weight ratio on the pyrolytic product distribution and upgraded pyrolytic vapor properties for the 5 wt% Ni impregnated on activated carbon (AC), aluminium(III)oxide (Al2O3), kaolin and zeolite NaA supports. The results indicated that using a 1:5 PRC: Ni/AC catalyst weight ratio with medium-sized PRC particles (125–425 μm)was the most effective condition for the conversion of oxygenated (O)-compounds to hydrocarbons (HCs)through decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydration reactions, giving the highest decrease (99%)in O-compounds. Increased HC yields, to more than 58%, were also obtained with this catalyst. Similarly, using the other synthesized Ni catalysts resulted in a reduction in the O-compounds and production of favorable HC species, albeit to a lesser extent. Therefore, the catalytic pyrolysis process of this residue, especially with a Ni/AC catalyst, has the potential to be a viable option for producing upgraded pyrolysis oil, which may be applied as a quality alternative biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Today’s needs of energy are yet globally dominated by fossil energy sources, causing the depletion of non-renewable energy. Alternatively, a potential substitute is the energy of biomass. Spirulina platensis (SP) is a microalgae biomass which, if extracted, will produce solid waste called Spirulina platensis residue (SPR). This research explores the pyrolysis product, produced within the range of 300 – 600 ºC, from the pyrolysis of SP and SPR using fixed bed reactors. The influence of temperature on pyrolysis product’s yield and characteristics are investigated by using mass balance method and gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique, respectively. The results from mass balance method present an optimum pyrolysis temperature of 550 ºC to obtain the desired liquid product of bio-oil, presenting the percentage of 34.59 wt.% for SP and 33.44 wt.% for SPR case. Additionally, with the increasing temperature, the char yield decreases for about 30 wt.% and the yield of gas seems to sharp increase from 550 to 600 ºC. These tendencies are both applied for SP and SPR source pyrolysis product. Interestingly, the benefit use as fossil fuel substitute might be derived, thanks to high HHV at the bio-oil product (32.04 MJ/kg for SP and 25.70 MJ/kg for SPR) and also at the char product with of 18.85-26.12 MJ/kg for both cases. The additional benefit come from the high content of C in its char product (50.31 wt.% for SPR and 45.26 wt.% for SP) that might be able to be used as an adsorbent, soil softener or other uses in the pharmaceutical field. © IJRED.

AB  - A series of Pd-based catalysts was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation over different acidic supports: amorphous SiO2-Al2O3, ZSM5 and beta zeolites. In addition to the effect of the support, other variables like the metal loading (0, 1, 2 and 4 wt%) on ZSM5 were tested in the direct conversion of levulinic acid (LA) to valeric biofuels (valeric acid/ester). The best result, a 92% yield of valeric biofuels, was obtained for a 2 wt% Pd supported on ZSM5 catalyst (2PdZSM5) after 8 h of reaction at 240 °C. Characterization techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy (using deuterated acetonitrile and CO as probe molecules), TEM and XPS were employed to explain this catalytic performance. FTIR spectra with deuterated acetonitrile evidenced the moderate acidity (in terms of concentration and strength) of the 2PdZSM5 catalyst, a desirable feature for the proper realization of this reaction. It has been observed that the acidity of the support favors the Pd dispersion, but it is less relevant for its catalytic properties. Finally, the stability of a representative catalyst was demonstrated under flow conditions for over 90 h, obtaining moderate but stable yields for the 2PdZSM5 catalyst. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This research evaluates the possibility of using straight oils such as castor oil, which is not suitable for food use, and sunflower oil, used as a standard reference for waste cooking oils, in blends with gasoline as second-generation biofuels. To this end, a study of the rheological properties of biofuels obtained from these double blends has been carried out. The aim is to take advantage of the different properties of gasoline, i.e., its low viscosity and its high energy density to obtain blends whose rheological properties allow the substitution of fossil diesel in high extent. The incorporation of fossil diesel to these gasoline/oil mixtures produces diesel/gasoline/oil triple blends, which exhibited the suitable rheological properties to be able to operate in conventional diesel engines. Therefore, the behavior of these blends has been evaluated in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The triple blends allow the substitution of fossil diesel up to 40% with sunflower oil, and up to 25% with castor oil, with excellent power results achieved for blends in which diesel is substituted up to 40%, and also in fuel consumption at high demand in comparison to conventional fossil diesel. Besides, a significant reduction in the emission of pollutants has also been obtained with these triple blends. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Oil content from seed kernels of Xanthoceras sorbifolia from 13 areas in China was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry to determine oil characteristics and biodiesel properties. The seeds had a high kernel percentage (53.67% ± 7.51), oil content (52.21% ± 4.01), and biodiesel yield (99.77% ± 0.21). Among the fatty acids in the oil were high percentages of linoleic acid (41.66 ± 2.26)% and oleic acid (28.44% ± 2.03). Most of the fuel properties complied well with the ASTM D6751-10, EN 14214-08, and GB/T 20828-2014 standards. The 13 sampling areas were grouped into four clusters based on different kernel percentage, oil content, biodiesel yield, and fatty acid composition. The results showed that the quality of kernel oils from seeds from Ar Horqin Banner was the best, although kernel oils from seeds in all 13 areas were suitable for biodiesel production. This study provides a basis for selecting optimal sites to harvest seeds from X. sorbifolia. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As a biomass-derived platform molecule, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is a highly desirable feedstock for manufacturing of high value-added chemicals ranging from starting materials for polyesters to biofuels. In this work, we reported the fabrication of a series of multicomponent solid acid catalysts based on heteropolyacids immobilized ILs-modified organosilica hollow nanospheres (denoted as PW 12 -ILs-Cn-HNS), in which PW 12 (PW 12 =H 3 PW 12 O 40 ⋅ xH 2 O) provides Brønsted acid site, ILs show strong electrostatic interactions with PW 12 , Cn (Cn=alkyl chain) is attached for hydrophobicity and HNS represents organosilica hollow nanospheres. When applied for catalytic dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF, the PW 12 -ILs-C4-HNS catalyst with 15.2 % PW 12 loading exhibited the best dehydration activity to 5-HMF with 93.7 % yield in DMSO at 100 °C in 2 h. Compared with 2D hexagonal and 3D interconnected structures, the excellent porosity properties of hollow nanospherical structure can provide a high population of the PW 12 sites and enough confined nanospace for the dehydration of fructose. Moreover, the PW 12 -ILs-Cn-HNS catalyst showed excellent stability over six catalytic cycles without obvious loss of activity. Most importantly, careful identification of the observed intermediates revealed crucial information for the dehydration process of fructose to 5-HMF. As such, the proposed heterogeneous catalysts show great potential in biomass conversion processes. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - To clarify the conversion mechanism of methyl palmitate (C16:0) to produce jet biofuel over Ni/desilicated meso-Y zeolite catalyst, quantum chemistry calculation and verification experiments were conducted to evaluate three proposed competitive reaction pathways, in which hydrodecarboxylation pathway was more feasible than hydrogenolysis and decarboxylation pathways. It was found that overall enthalpy change to produce pentadecane (−130.2 kJ/mol) in hydrodecarboxylation pathway was lower than that to produce palmitic acid (−90.1 kJ/mol) in hydrogenolysis pathway and that to produce hexadecane (−68.6 kJ/mol) in decarboxylation pathway. The experimental results of hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking conversion of methyl palmitate into jet biofuel were consistent with quantum chemistry calculation, when conventional Y zeolite was modified into hierarchical mesoporous Y zeolite catalyst by desilication with NaOH and then loading Ni nanoparticles. The jet biofuel product selectivity reached a peak (64.8%) with reasonable composition distributions, when Ni/meso-Y zeolite was desilicated with 0.4 M NaOH to promote BET surface area (554.9 m2/g) and specific pore volume (0.340 cm3/g) with 2–10 nm mesopores. The relative content of pentadecane in liquid products was always higher than those of palmitic acid and hexadecane over Ni/meso-Y zeolite catalysts desilicated with various concentrations of NaOH. The main compositions of gas phase by-products in hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking conversion were CH4 with selectivity up to 25.2% and CO2 with selectivity of ∼10%, which agreed well with quantum chemistry calculation results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A mathematical model was developed based on data obtained on Fischer-Tropsch (FT) laboratory scale unit operated in steady state, belonging to BIOENERGY 2020+ GmbH, Austria to demonstrate alpha-parameter dependence on carbon number. The lab-scale unit processed the synthesis gas, obtained by the gasification of biomass (woodchips), to produce liquid fuels for transportation applications. The FT reaction took place in a slurry reactor filled with dispersed cobalt-based catalyst. The products were then separated by partial condensation depending on their boiling points. The final output of the FT laboratory scale unit comprised three product streams – wax, diesel and naphtha. The reaction and separation of products were simulated in Aspen Plus software. The mathematical model used kinetic description based on power-law rate equations. The modeled product selectivity was controlled using an alpha-parameter of the Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. Because of the significant deviation of products spectrum from typical Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution, a modified description of reaction selectivity was developed. The description introduces variable alpha-parameter, dependent on number of carbon atoms in the reacting molecule. The mathematical model developed using MATLAB software considered the production of aliphatic paraffins having a number of carbon atoms from C1 to C60. The mathematical model of simulated lab-scale unit comprised an ideally mixed reactor RCSTR and three FLASH2 separators for the separation of desired products. The results from mathematical model were validated by a comparison with experimental results from FT lab-scale unit. The modified polynomial dependency of alpha-parameter on carbon number showed significantly better description of composition and amounts of FT products, especially for wax stream where the description using constant alpha led to enormous deviations. Such better prediction of composition and amounts of acquired products is important for evaluating efficiency of further upgrading the FT products to liquid fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-edible oil such as Jatropha oil has high free fatty acids (FFAs) content. Therefore, acid esterification is a suitable route to reduce its FFA content to an acceptable limit (2 FFA%) before being subjected to further transesterification. In the present study, Jatropha seeds were utilized as the feedstock directly instead of Jatropha oil during ultrasound-assisted in situ esterification. The objective of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of in situ esterification of Jatropha oil seeds using sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) as catalyst with the aid of ultrasound. RESULTS: The reaction parameters (particle size, n-hexane to methanol volume ratio, H 2 SO 4 amount, reaction time and ultrasonic amplitude) were optimized and evaluated in term of extraction and esterification efficiencies as well as fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield. The highest extraction efficiency of 83.96%, esterification efficiency of 71.10% and FAME yield of 38.58% were achieved at particle size of 1–2 mm, n-hexane to methanol volume ratio of 3:1, 5 vol% of H 2 SO 4 and ultrasonic amplitude of 60% with reaction time of 150 min. CONCLUSION: Synthesis of biodiesel via ultrasound-assisted in situ esterification of Jatropha oil seeds was successful with considerable yield, which could provide improvement in terms of process intensification and more value added by-products. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The combination of water electrolysis and solid fuel gasification offers the substitution of Air Separation Unit, the reduction or elimination of water gas shift catalytic system and acid gas removal technology. Subsequently, the direct utilisation of CO 2 , which otherwise would be emitted during production and its conversion to valuable fuels in combination with energy storage are achieved. Steam gasification and steam-oxygen gasification in different operating conditions and scales are combined with electrolysers with the aim to define optimum efficiencies towards SNG production and reduction of direct CO 2 emissions. Modelling and comparison of 6 different cases for steam and steam-oxygen gasification process, gas cleaning and conditioning technologies focusing on tar removal, activated carbon, water gas shift, and acid gas removal technologies with potassium carbonate and MDEA are investigated. Capture ratios are balanced with and without water gas shift reactor according to the requirements of SNG synthesis. The efficiency of gasification and power to SNG ranges between 57.67% and 63.43% for the optimum cases with low pressure steam/oxygen gasification and electrolysers sized according to oxygen demand and according to the oversized electrolysers case respectively. The overall energy conversion resulted in an energy conversion efficiency of 72.83% and 73.51% with the production of steam. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, we study the gasification of pellets produced, after densification, by blending olive mill solid wastes, impregnated or not by olive mill waste water, and pine sawdust under different steam/nitrogen atmospheres. The charcoals necessary for the gasification tests were prepared by pyrolysis using a fixed bed reactor. The gasification technique using steam was chosen in order to produce a hydrogen-enriched syngas. Gasification tests were performed using macro-thermogravimetric equipment. Tests were carried out at different temperatures (750 °C, 800 °C, 820 °C, 850 °C and 900 °C), and at different atmospheres composed by nitrogen and steam at different percentages (10%, 20% and 30%). Results show that the mass variation profiles is similar to the usual lingo-cellulosic gasification process. Moreover, the increase of temperatures or water steam partial pressures affects positively the rate of conversion and the char reactivity by accelerating the gasification process. The increase of the gasification yields demonstrates the promise of using olive mill by-products as alternative biofuels (H2 enriched syngas). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Three types of biofuels derived from land, coastal zone, and marine were pyrolyzed in a thermogravimetric analyzer from room temperature to 1000 °C under different heating rates (50, 80, and 100 °C/min), and three isoconversional mathematical models were established to analyze the kinetic properties of biomass. The results show that the pyrolysis process of biomass derived from different distributions included three main stages: drying and preheating stage, volatile matter evaporation stage, and carbonization stage, whereas the pyrolysis behavior of the marine seawater Spirulina (Sp) biomass is somewhat different from that of land [corn stalks (Cs)] and coastal biomasses [reed (Re)], stemming from the inherent difference in their compositions. Cs and Re species have advantages over microalgae in terms of the difficulty of volatile matters releasing, whereas the pyrolysis process of Re and Sp is faster than Cs because of the catalysis of its high salt tolerance. The heating rate has a significant effect on the performance of devolatilization profiles and maximum weight loss rate, regardless of the biomass type from different regions. The dynamics analysis indicates that Sp species is preferable to Cs and Re in terms of thermochemical conversion because of the lower apparent activation energy for total conversion. From the verification test, we concluded that the simulations for Friedman models presented a good agreement with the experimental conversions calculated at three different heating rates for Cs, Re, and Sp pyrolysis, and that the kinetic simulation of the weight loss curve and kinetic parameters obtained by pyrolysis of three biomasses is reasonable and effective. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising replacement for petroleum based diesel in a number of different applications. Although biodiesel offers numerous advantages over petrodiesel, one of its major disadvantages is its inferior cold flow properties. Additives are often added to biodiesel to remediate issues with cold flow and other problematic properties. This work explored the feasibility of using compounds derived from bio-based sources as an additive for biodiesel. Specifically, the additive's efficacy in reducing the cloud point of model biodiesels was analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry. Each of the additives studied depressed the biodiesel cloud point, although most of the additives showed diminishing returns above a certain weight percent. For many of the additives, the mechanism of cloud point depression was found to be dilution. For these additives, their efficacy was hampered by self-association, a phenomenon confirmed by thermodynamic modeling. However, tripropionin and dimethyl azelate, molecules of similar size to the FAMEs in the biodiesel studied in this work, interfered with the development of a critical nucleus, causing more significant depressions in the cloud point. Overall, a thermodynamic model based on ideal solution theory was able to accurately predict cloud points for most mixtures studied. Large deviations were observed for systems with significant amounts of self-association and/or cocrystallization. © 2019

AB  - Biomass-derived di-ethers, 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs), are currently envisaged as promising biodiesel or additives. Herein, Zr-SBA prepared by a urea hydrolysis method (Zr-SBA-UH) is used as a highly active bifunctional catalyst for the reductive etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and offers the 2,5-bis(isopropoxymethyl)furan (BPMF) yield up to 93.6% using isopropanol as the solvent and hydrogen source. Zirconia is proved to be located mainly out of the mesoporous channels for Zr-SBA-UH, which leads to significant enhancement in the acid content of the catalyst, and then greatly promotes the catalytic performance of Zr-SBA-UH for the reductive etherification of HMF. The general soundness of Zr-SBA-UH in other monohydric alcohols is further confirmed in this contribution, guaranteeing that a family of BAMFs can be prepared by this catalytic system. In addition, Zr-SBA-UH is a robust catalyst that can be reused for at least five continuous runs without a significant loss of its catalytic activity. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This study evaluates the potential for making advanced biofuels from genetically modified (GM) lipid–producing sorghum. A biodiesel coproduction process is developed to extract, purify, and upgrade lipids to diesel fuel while carbohydrates are utilized for making ethanol through acid thermal pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. To assess the advantages of coproducing biodiesel from GM–sorghum, process economics are compared to a cellulosic ethanol biorefinery receiving non-GM sorghum. Minimum ethanol selling prices (MESP) that reach a breakeven point after 30 years of service life are calculated as an economic index to compare the two processes. Results indicate that biodiesel coproduction improves the economics by lowering the MESP from $3.08/gal for the ethanol-only process to $2.46/gal. Sensitivity analyses reveal that increasing sorghum's lipid content, increasing the lipid extraction efficiency, and reducing the solvent-to-solids ratio in lipid extraction columns are the most important process parameters to further enhance technoeconomics. Analyses indicate that a lipid content above 13 wt% (dry basis) or a biomass price less than $65/Mg (dry basis) will result in a 2014 ethanol wholesale price of $2.25/gal for the coproduction process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A green and efficient solid acid catalyst was developed for direct conversion of Jatropha oil into biodiesel over Ni modified phosphomolybdic acid (HPMo)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a fixed-bed reactor. Under optimal conditions (Temperature = 330 °C, Pressure = 3 MPa, H2/oil (v/v) = 800 N m3 m−3, Liquid hourly space velocity = 1 h−1), the yield of biodiesel (C15-C18 alkanes) was 86.7 wt%, and the conversion was 98.2%. The conversion was 86.1% during five runs of recycling. Comparing with the thermal cracking process, the catalytic cracking exhibited the same performance at a lower temperature. A possible reaction pathway to the reaction was suggested. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper proposed a novel method for the production of biodiesel from soy sauce residue under supercritical carbon dioxide for the first time. The effect of several parameters, such as the size of raw material, reaction pressure, temperature, time, and methanol/oil molar ratio were carefully optimized by single-factor experiments. The results showed that the optimized parameters were particle size 60 meshes, reaction pressure 16 MPa, temperature 100 °C, time 180min and methanol/oil molar ratio 35:1. Under this optimal conditions, biodiesel yield is as high as 96.21%. Furthermore, in order to better understand the advantages of this process, the mechanism and result of this process were compared with existing technology. The findings of this paper demonstrated that the soy sauce residue which was commonly considered as a waste can be efficiently converted to biodiesel by this method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioethanol, an important biofuel, obtained from biomass fermentation is dilute and unsuitable for direct use as fuel for transportation. Its recovery and dehydration to ∼99.5 wt% ethanol is energy-intensive because of dilute feed (∼10 wt% ethanol) and occurrence of ethanol–water azeotrope. From an energy efficiency perspective, hybrid separation processes consisting of a membrane-based module coupled with distillation are a promising alternative to conventional separation by distillation alone. RESULTS: The present article proposes the novel process of double-effect distillation with vapor recompression (DED) for bioethanol recovery followed by vapor permeation (VP) for bioethanol dehydration (to 99.8 wt% ethanol) from a ternary feed of ethanol (10 wt%), water (89.9 wt%) and CO 2 (0.1 wt%) and compares it with the process of simple distillation followed by vapor permeation (D-VP). Multi-objective optimization is performed for both processes, and the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions for minimizing fixed capital investment and annual operating cost are presented and discussed. Compared with the optimal D-VP process, the optimal DED-VP process is found to be better, with 17 and 11% savings in energy consumption and total annual cost (TAC) respectively. CONCLUSION: Specific energy consumption (SEC) of the DED-VP process is 5% lower than that of the hybrid process of distillation for recovery followed by pressure swing adsorption for dehydration (D-PSA) used industrially. Continued developments in membranes that can provide high permeance, selectivity and/or operating life can further reduce TAC and SEC of the DED-VP process. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Thermal degradation properties of stearic acid and its esterification derivants of methyl stearate and ethyl stearate are investigated through thermogravimetric analysis. Based on experiments, which are conducted at the temperature heated rates of 10, 15 and 20 K min−1, the iso-conversional methods of Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa are used to calculate the apparent activation energy. Further, the Avrami theory is used to estimate the apparent reaction order. Apparent thermodynamic parameters of the apparent enthalpy change, apparent Gibbs free energy change and apparent entropy change are calculated. Calculations of apparent kinetic and thermodynamic parameters illustrate that thermal activity of stearic acid is distinctly heightened after esterification and the derived derivants are more easily activated. Meanwhile, influences of alcohol type on esterification products are weak. Conclusions from this study make more comprehensive understanding of the thermal events of biodiesel to be favor for its commercial application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Bio-oil was produced from the pyrolysis of agricultural wastes (Eucalyptus sawdust) and discarded soybean frying oil. The temperature of the pyrolysis system was initiated at 28°C and increased to 850°C. Atmospheric distillation of crude bio-oil was performed and a fraction at a temperature range 160–240°C (pyrolysis oil) was separated and subjected to GC-MS, 1 H-NMR, TGA and FTIR analysis to identify the different properties and compounds present in pyrolysis oil. It was noticed that there was an abundance of oxygen and nitrogen containing compounds as well as other reactive species in pyrolysis oil. To reduce the amount of these species, the pyrolysis oil was subjected to hydrogenation in the presence of NiMo as a catalyst. After hydrogenation, the atmospheric distillation of hydrogenated bio-oil was performed and another fraction at temperature range 160–240°C (hydrogenated bio-oil) was separated and analyzed by the same techniques. It was noticed that during hydrogenation, more than 60% oxygenated and other reactive species were converted into hydrocarbons. Hydrogenated bio-oil showed very similar physico-chemical properties such as distillation curve, density, viscosity, freezing point, flash point, the presence of hydrocarbons and enthalpy of combustion as aviation kerosene also known as QAV-1. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a high-efficiency technology for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Heat and power production can be varied according to changes in heat and power loads, which affect the electrical and thermal efficiencies. This study analyzes changes in heat and power production rates of a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) and SOFC system. The variations in the stack-to-burner ratio (bio-oil split fractions), fuel utilization factor (Uf), and recirculation ratio (R) are investigated. The effect of heat-to-power ratio on the system performance and CO2 capture efficiencies is also studied. Moreover, the benefit of the implementation of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC system over a conventional operation to match the energy demand for an industrial case is evaluated. The results reveal that an increase in Uf decreases the operating range of the heat-to-power ratio. On the other hand, the anode gas recirculation ratio affects such a parameter when the system performs at the high stack-to-burner ratio. A higher heat-to-power ratio increases the stack electrical and thermal efficiencies, leading to a higher CHP efficiency. The heat-to-power ratio of the proposed system varies between 0.05 and 7.5. However, to attain a CO2 capture efficiency higher than 50%, the heat-to-power ratio should be lower than 1.5. By comparing the two operational strategies: fixed heat-to-power ratio, and variable heat-to-power ratio, it is found that the heat-to-power ratio is an important factor for energy management. The primary energy saving is enhanced when the system is operated to satisfy the rates of heat and power demand. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the next-generation structural materials is carbon foam. Porous materials have become an intriguing alternative material to traditional ones in many utilizations based on their light weight and incomparable properties. Coal or fossil oils are conventionally used to produce pitch, phenolic resin, and polyurethane as carbon foam precursor. Biomass liquefaction is a developing technique to convert biomass resources into the industrial chemicals. In this study, spruce tree sawdust was liquefied under mild conditions with different solvent type (phenol or phenol + bio-oil mixture). The unique aspect of this work is the synthesis of bio-polyol when pyrolytic oil is used as an alternative to phenol in the solvolysis reaction and its evaluation in carbon foam production with multilayer graphene sheets. Therewithal, the ratios of biomass to solvent were 1/3 as well as 1/5, and the comparison of product characteristics is another originality of the study. Slow pyrolysis of spruce tree sawdust was performed under static atmosphere and bio-oil was characterized with elemental analysis and various chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. The effect of mass ratio of biomass/solvent on the characteristics of porous resin foams synthesized from liquefaction product. Obtained resin foams were carbonized at 400 °C, and then activated at 800 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Structure evaluation of resin foams, carbonized foams, and activated carbon foams from liquefied spruce tree sawdust was investigated by using elemental analysis, x-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, scanning electron microscopy, true/bulk density, and compressive strength tests. Although the surface area values decreased when bio-oil was added as a solvent, it was determined that the compression strengths of the produced carbon foams (up to 1.080 MPa) were higher than that of conventional phenolic foams. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The demand for biofuels and biochemicals is expected to increase in the future, which will in turn increase the demand for biomass feedstock. Large gasification plants fueled with biomass feedstock are likely to be a key enabling technology in a resource-efficient, bio-based economy. Furthermore, the costs for producing biofuels and biochemicals in such plants could potentially be decreased by utilizing inexpensive low-grade residual biomass as feedstock. This study investigates the usage of shredded tree bark as a feedstock for the production of biomethane in the GoBiGas demonstration plant in Gothenburg, Sweden, based on a 32 MW th industrial dual fluidized bed gasification unit. The plant was operated with bark feedstock for 12 000 hours during the period 2014 to 2018. Data from the measurement campaign were processed using a stochastic approach to establish the plant's mass and energy balances, which were then compared with operation of the plant with wood pellets. For this comparison, an extrapolation algorithm was developed to predict plant performance using bark dried to the same moisture content as wood pellets, ie, 8% w.b . Plant operation with bark feedstock was evaluated for operability, efficiency, and feedstock-related cost. The gas quality achieved during the test period was similar to that obtained for operation with wood pellets. Furthermore, no significant ash sintering or agglomeration problems were observed more than 750 hours of operation. The calculated biomass-to-biomethane efficiency is 43% to 47% (lower heating value basis) for operation with wet bark. However, the predicted biomass-to-biomethane efficiency can be increased to 55%–65% for operation with bark feedstock dried to 8% moisture content, with corresponding feedstock costs in the range of 24.2 to 32.7 EUR/MWh; ie, a cost reduction of about 40% compared with wood pellets. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The work reports a comparative study on the pyrolysis of five agricultural crop residues (peanut straw, cotton straw, sorghum stalk, corn stalk and reed) using a gas-sweeping fixed bed reactor. The study aims at clarifying the role played by the neutral extractives and inherent active minerals in the pyrolysis characteristics, product distributions and bio-oil compositions. Among five crop residues, reed showed the highest bio-oil yield but with the highest oxygen content and the lowest HHV (higher heat value), in relation to the least alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in it. Peanut straw had a content of neutral extractives as high as 47.4%, which contributed to the formations of a significantly higher proportion of long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and liquid nitrogenous compounds, distinct from four other crop residues. Peanut straw was also highly enriched with AAEMs, which was responsible for a strong catalytic activity for the selective deoxygenation of bio-oil. Neutral extractives in sorghum stalk and corn stalk formed some long chain fatty oxygenates and less nitrogenous compounds. The bio-oils derived from these two biomasses contained oxygenates as dominant compounds, however, they had a lower fraction of heavy constituents, lower oxygen contents, and higher HHVs than those of reed and cotton straw. This result was attributed to the catalyzed bio-oil deoxygenation by the relatively abundant AAEMs in sorghum stalk and corn stalk. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study a conventional and an improved biodiesel production plants, have been simulated in Aspen Plus V8.2. Improved process converts waste cooking oil using a reactive distillation catalyzed by a heterogeneous catalyst in which catalyst removal and neutralization units are not necessary. Using pinch technology and exergoeconoic analysis, exergy destruction of each process are calculated and the best configuration in order to integrate biodiesel production process with a combined cycle power plant is presented. The results show that the produced electricity in the modified process is less expensive. Exergy destruction to generated power ratio and the net power generation in the conventional process are equal to 1.59 and 17936.6 kW, respectively, and the corresponding values for the modified process are 1.57 and 18346.1 kW, respectively. The costs of electricity are 19.145 $/GJ and 16.91 $/GJ for the conventional and improved cases, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The industrial conversion of biomass to high-value biofuels and biochemical is mainly restricted by lignocellulose solubilization. Consolidated bio-saccharification (CBS) is considered a promising process for lignocellulose solubilization depending on whole-cell biocatalysts that simultaneously perform effective cellulase production and hydrolysis. However, it usually takes a long time to reach a high saccharification level using the current CBS biocatalyst and process. Results: To promote the saccharification efficiency and reduce the cost, a Clostridium thermocellum recombinant strain â†pyrF::KBm was constructed as a new CBS biocatalyst in this study. The key CBS factors, including the medium, inoculum size and cultivation, and substrate load, were investigated and optimized. The saccharification process was also stimulated by adding free hemicellulases, suggesting the need to further enhance hemicellulase activity of the whole-cell catalyst. Under the optimal conditions, the CBS process was shortened by 50% with pretreated wheat straw as the substrate. The sugar yield reached 0.795 g/g and the saccharification level was 89.3%. Conclusions: This work provided a new biocatalyst and an optimized process of CBS and confirmed that CBS is a feasible strategy for cost-efficient solubilization of lignocellulose, which will greatly promote the industrial utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of temperature, ethyl acetate to palm oil molar ratio, residence time, and packing alumina balls on triglyceride conversion, ethyl ester, and acetin contents. The complete triglyceride conversion was observed at 1.35 ± 0.05 times of the transition temperature. The packed alumina enhanced the ester content up to 20%; but it had no effect on the acetin content. Furthermore, this study also intended to determine the effects of the acetin content and thermal cracking on 19 fuel properties of lipid-based biofuel samples synthesized by supercritical ethyl acetate. The optimal condition was found at 380 °C, 20 MPa and ethyl acetate to oil molar ratio of 30:1. First, the density and kinematic viscosity of the biofuels were slightly higher than the maximum values specified by standards because of the presence of triacetin and polymerized products. Second, packing alumina balls increase the mixing intensity and thermal conductivity inside the tubular reactor resulted in higher contents of sulfated ash and carbon residue. Third, the acid values of the biofuel samples were considerably higher than the standard value of biodiesel. However, copper strip corrosion testing resulted in slight tarnishing (level 1A). The corrosiveness of fuels mainly originates from their sulfur compound content, neither biofuel sample was classified as a corrosive material. Furthermore, the high acid values of the samples interfered with the testing of oxidation stability. Finally, beneficial effects of triacetin on cold flow properties were revealed in this study. The cloud point and cold filter plugging point of lipid-based biofuels strongly depended on the thermal stress of the reaction conditions rather than the triacetin concentration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study reports the reaction mechanism and kinetics of glucose hydrothermal decomposition in hot-compressed gamma-valerolactone(GVL)/water (HCGW) at 175–225 °C and various GVL concentrations (0–75 vol%) for the production of biofuels and value-added biochemicals. Increasing GVL addition tunes glucose decomposition from isomerization into fructose and mannose to dehydration into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and levoglucosan (LGA). Particularly, direct dehydration of glucose to 5-HMF is found to be a primary reaction during glucose decomposition in HCGW. With the GVL concentration increasing from 1 to 75%, the selectivities of dehydration reactions to 5-HMF and LGA at 175 °C increase from 22 and 12% to 30 and 33%, respectively, while the selectivity of isomerization reaction to fructose at 175 °C decreases from 46 to 20%. Kinetic analysis indicates that glucose decomposition in HCGW follows first-order reaction kinetics. Further analysis shows that the reaction rate constants of dehydration reactions almost increase linearly with the GVL concentration, while those of isomerization reactions almost decrease linearly with the GVL concentration. The activation energy of glucose decomposition in HCGW also reduces slightly from 117 kJ/mol in water to 96 kJ/mol in 75% GVL. This study demonstrates that GVL/water co-solvent is effective to tune the glucose decomposition reaction for the production of biofuels and value-added biochemicals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sunflower seed hulls are an abundant waste produced by the edible oil industry. Pyrolysis was assessed as a way of turning this material into a liquid rich in valuable products, as well as leading to densification of this voluminous waste. In pursuing this, raw and pre-treated hulls were subjected to fast pyrolysis in a vertical reactor, at 450 °C under 200 ml.min-1 of N2. Pre-treatments of sunflower seed hulls consist in washing the material with 15% m/v phosphoric, sulfuric acid solution and 15% m/v sodium hydroxide solution. Then the material undergoes a hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C. Raw and pre-treated hulls were characterized prior to pyrolysis by using Proximate and Ultimate Analysis and by TGA/DTG. Pre-treatments lead to substantial modifications in the characteristics of waste hulls producing different bio-oils with diverse compositions. A kinetic study of these pyrolysis reactions was performed in order to determine Ea and rate constants for biomass waste conversion. Hydrothermal pre-treatment leads to selective extraction of hemicellulose, which results in a bio-oil that is highly rich in levoglucosan. Sulfuric and phosphoric acid washing produce lower liquid yields when compared to raw hulls. The bio-oil from phosphoric acid pre-treatment shows a notably high concentration of furfural. NaOH pre-treatment results in an unstable bio-oil, which is rich in tar precursors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA), a renewable and valuable platform chemical from lignocellulosic biomass, has exhibited major potential in the production of biomaterials and biofuels. This study reports the production of LA from lignocellulose using a recyclable aromatic acid, toluene sulfonic acid (p-TsOH), and its reaction kinetics were investigated. The adoption of p-TsOH, which has a special hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure, dramatically improved the yield of LA to a competitive level (57.9±4.1%) at the optimum conditions (reaction temperature = 162 °C, catalyst concentration = 0.95 mol/L, and reaction time = 64 min). Meanwhile, the kinetics involving the simultaneous conversion of both glucan (the cellulose component) and mannan (the hemicellulose component) to LA were examined. The results indicated that the activation energy values in the reaction kinetics were lower than those in previous studies that used H 2 SO 4 as a catalyst. Consequently, the maximum yield of LA was easily obtained at a lower temperature (170 °C). The results of this study are important for process modelling applications and the production of LA from lignocellulosic materials. © 2019 North Carolina State University.

AB  - Direct biodiesel production from wet fungal biomass may significantly reduce production costs, but there is a lack of fast and cost-effective processing technology. A novel thin film continuous flow process has been applied to study the effects of its operational parameters on fatty acid (FA) extraction and FA to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) conversion efficiencies. Single factor experiments evaluated the effects of catalyst concentration and water content of biomass, while factorial experimental designs determined the interactions between catalyst concentration and biomass to methanol ratio, flow rate, and rotational speed. Direct transesterification (DT) of wet Mucor plumbeus biomass at ambient temperature and pressure achieved a FA to FAME conversion efficiency of >90% using 3 wt/v % NaOH concentration, if the water content was ≤50% (w/w). In comparison to existing DT methods, this continuous flow processing technology has an estimated 90–94% reduction in energy consumption, showing promise for up-scaling. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An integrated multistep catalytic process in a one-pot cascade model to realize conversion is preferred in terms of process economics and energy efficiency. Here, we present the noble-metal-free but highly effective catalytic transfer hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed conversion of biomass-derived furfural for direct production of biofuel alkyl levulinate using alcohols as the hydrogen donor and reaction medium. With optimization of the process variables, a high yield of alkyl levulinate at up to 85.3% could be captured under mild conditions in isopropanol medium with the combination of Zr-MCM-41 and Amberlyst-15 catalysts. The reaction proceeds via the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol over Zr-MCM-41, which is then converted to alkyl levulinate by an Amberlyst-15 acid catalyst. The spent hybrid catalysts could be effectively recovered from the resulting reaction mixture and reused 5 times with little deactivation after plain regeneration treatment. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of biomass produces a liquid with a diverse spectrum of compounds. This work describes impact of adding calcium oxide as a catalyst for fast catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse in a fluidized bed reactor at pilot plant scale. The product distributions, bio-oil physical characteristics, and elemental analysis of products were determined. Rapid aging tests were performed on the oils at 80 °C to evaluate the impact of the catalyst on long term storage properties. Results showed that the presence of the catalyst (10 wt% loading) reduced the bio-oil oxygen content by 14%. The catalyst decreased the total bio-oil yield by 17 wt%, but reduced the water content in that oil and increased the gas yield. The presence of the catalyst did not affect the char yield. Over 150 compounds were identified by GC/MS and the distribution of the main functional groups was analyzed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Ketonization of carboxylic acids provides an attractive way for upgrading biomass feedstocks into biofuels. Here, a series of Mg-Al hydrotalcite (HT) catalysts doped with different Ce contents were prepared and used for the ketonization of propionic acid. Mg3Al0.9Ce0.1 displayed the highest ketonization activity (90.6% conversion of propionic acid) under mild reaction conditions (350 °C). By applying SEM, TEM, H2-TPR, CO2/NH3-TPD, XPS, etc., the mechanism for the improvement of catalytic activity and stability was obtained. When the doping content of Ce is low, such as in Mg3Al0.9Ce0.1, cerium oxide is uniformly dispersed on the HT support. At the same time, the strong interaction between the CeO2 species and Mg-Al hydrotalcite led to the improvement of redox properties and modified acid-base sites, which is beneficial for the ketonization reaction. However, the structure of the HT support is destroyed by the agglomerated cerium oxide when a more doped Ce is employed, and the specific surface area and the surface Ce3+ ratio are remarkably lowered, thereby causing a significant decrease in the ketonization activity. By using the temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) technique, a deeper insight into the mechanism of reaction pathways over different catalysts is gained. The significant improvement in the reaction stability of the ketonization reaction over Mg3Al0.9Ce0.1 as compared to unmodified catalysts could be ascribed to the strengthening of the M-O bond of the catalyst after the introduction of Ce. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - There was a heightened global interest in large-scale Jatropha cultivation for the past few decades, and this incited investment toward the crop in many developing countries. Many saw Jatropha as a green fuel that could possibly be an alternative to fossil fuel, which has adverse implications to deal with the impacts of climate change. However, Jatropha investments failed to meet global expectations, leading to unexpected social, environmental, and economic transformations in the investment spaces. This paper reviews and synthesizes the transformations and complexities in failed Jatropha spaces in six previous major Jatropha investment destinations across the world-Mexico, India, China, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Ghana-by employing qualitative data analysis. The findings generally show that, in all of the countries studied, promoters of Jatropha investments, including the central government and private investors, subscribed to a "wait-and-see" approach with positive expectations. The review revealed that the intended goal of establishing global Jatropha investments to serve as an alternative source of fuel failed because of the unexpected complexities of the hype, which dwelled much on the deferment option of the "wait-and-see" approach for global Jatropha investments. Failure of the investments along with unmet expectations led to land-use changes from Jatropha to the cultivation of other crops (often food crops) or total land abandonment. Although we are not totally pessimistic about the economic and production viability of Jatropha as a biofuel feedstock, we emphasize the importance of paying considerable attention to other feedstocks that might have a better future as alternatives to fossil-based energy for the deployment of sustainable bioenergy. Furthermore, our findings provide meaningful justification for policy- and decision-makers in the development space to tacitly reflect and appraise new investment initiatives or interventions before endorsement. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Blazing of fossil energy resources generally changes the global climate. Speeding up of global temperate nowadays is an important aspect. Emission of greenhouse gases mainly from blazing of fossil energy resources is one of the most important sources. So, to carry the significant energy and to reduce air pollution, biofuels might be a substitute energy sources. The unnecessary utilization of fossil energy resources or fuels results deficient in the storage in underground earth then people naturally have to depend on biofuels. Consequently increasing demand for the manufacture of biofuels will put a huge burden on agriculture and food prices. Biofuels generally attributed as liquid fuels which are made from the biomass. This consists of mostly wood, vegetable oils, forestry products, agricultural crops, agricultural residues or municipal garbage, residues of domestic animal wastes and aquatic plants. In this review, we summarized the different types of biofuels including biodiesel and their comparative study, production and uses from an ecological perspective. © 2019 Chemical Publishing Co..

AB  - Steam reforming of biomass bio-oil is a technique of producing bio-hydrogen which is an important biofuel. Acetic acid is a major constituent of biomass bio-oil especially its aqueous phase. In this study, the thermodynamic analysis of the steam reforming of acetic acid was considered in conjunction with the utilising of a novel statistical approach. Response surface methodology was used to elucidate possible interactions of the process factors and be used to develop regression models for the prediction of percentage molar yield of each species given a known set of inputs. The correlations were validated for the prediction of % molar composition of the product chemical species in the product stream. These correlations are of great relevance as it affords quick predictions given a known set of factors. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - To achieve wider reactivity control, single-fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) through low temperature reforming (LTR) was proposed and experimentally explored. An LTR system was established on an optical compression ignition engine to investigate the impact of LTR on engine performance, where LTR products of the same fuel (n-heptane) as in-cylinder direct injection was routed into the intake port. The quantitative online gas chromatograph (GC) measurements indicate that LTR of n-heptane can produce numerous species with different chemical structures. The higher reforming temperature can lead to the higher fuel conversion rate. Optical engine experiments show that the ignition timing is retarded significantly via LTR. A two-stage low temperature heat release (LTHR) arises at the reforming temperature of 423 K (LTR-423 without LTR). CH2O-PLIF images suggest that the HCCI combustion of unreformed n-heptane cause the first LTHR because of its earlier occurrence time than in-cylinder direct injection and the homogeneous distribution of CH2O fluorescence. Meanwhile, the chemical calculation of CH2O formation manifests that the contributions of each reaction pathway to CH2O formation are different in each stage of LTHR. At the reforming temperature of 523 K (LTR-523 with LTR), prior to LTHR, weak PLIF signals were also captured, emitted by aldehydes and ketones LTR produced in the reformer. In the subsequent LTHR stage, formaldehyde develops at a relatively low speed due to LTR. In the HTHR stage, high-speed images show that LTR leads to a smooth combustion and reduces soot formation. The effect of LTR products on mixture reactivity was analyzed by the constant volume ignition delay model. The calculation results manifest that the reactivity of each LTR product is different, influenced by both thermal dilution effect and chemical effect. The combined impact of LTR products on mixture reactivity depends on both the chemical structure and the concentration in the mixture. The thermal dilution effect of LTR products contributes more for the final decline of mixture reactivity LTR caused. Finally, although the reactivity just decreased under current LTR conditions, it is believed that LTR has the potential to achieve further reactivity control of RCCI combustion to accommodate changes in the operating conditions of engines by changing LTR conditions (temperature, equivalence ratio, residence time, fuel type, feeding water, etc.). © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Density Functional Theory and canonical ensemble were used to investigate thermodynamic properties of Syngas and its mixture with natural gas. The following thermodynamic potentials were obtained: internal energy, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy for temperatures ranging from 0.5 K to 1500 K. It was observed that CO and H2 were the most stable Syngas components, possessing the ability to render Syngas less favorable to the temperature increase. Also, we verified that Syngas presents properties similar to an antiknock agent for natural gas, raising its resistance to temperature increases. Were determined the Poisson coefficients and Bulk modulus for Natural gas/Syngas mixtures and Shomate equation coefficients for some Syngas types, providing a more complete thermodynamic description for these gases. Additionally, thermodynamic potentials of combustion for Natural gas/Syngas mixtures were predicted, showing that this biofuel can reduce the calorific power of natural gas and makes its combustion less favorable due its antiknock behavior. However, a mixture with 30% of Syngas may be useful for natural gas combustion, since it present a calorific power between 73.41% and 79.49% of that of natural gas, which is a substantial fraction of energy released during combustion, showing good future prospects to the Natural gas/Syngas mixture to the renewable energy generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The catalytic co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and waste tyres for the production of high-quality bio-oils was studied in a pilot-scale Auger reactor using different low-cost Ca-based catalysts. All the products of the process (solid, liquid, and gas) were comprehensively analysed. The results demonstrate that this upgrading strategy is suitable for the production of better-quality bio-oils with major potential for use as drop-in fuels. Although very good results were obtained regardless of the nature of the Ca-based catalyst, the best results were achieved using a high-purity CaO obtained from the calcination of natural limestone at 900 °C. Specifically, by adding 20 wt% waste tyres and using a feedstock to CaO mass ratio of 2:1, a practically deoxygenated bio-oil (0.5 wt% of oxygen content) was obtained with a significant heating value of 41.7 MJ/kg, confirming its potential for use in energy applications. The total basicity of the catalyst and the presence of a pure CaO crystalline phase with marginal impurities seem to be key parameters facilitating the prevalence of aromatisation and hydrodeoxygenation routes over the de-acidification and deoxygenation of the vapours through ketonisation and esterification reactions, leading to a highly aromatic biofuel. In addition, owing to the CO2-capture effect inherent to these catalysts, a more environmentally friendly gas product was produced, comprising H2 and CH4 as the main components. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel appears to be a possible substitute for non-renewable fossil fuels; however, its production requires the presence of a catalyst to accelerate the reaction. Serving the purpose of finding effective, cheap and environmentally safe, heterogeneous catalysts, this research used the fig leaves in three different forms, calcined, activated by KOH, and activated by both K2CO3 and CaCO3. Their efficiency in biodiesel synthesis, from spent cooking oil, was examined and compared with that of activated carbon which has been previously investigated. The properties of different catalyst forms were specified using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Operating parameters studied for the three catalysts were reaction time (from 30 to 180 min), alcohol-to-oil molar ratio (from 4:1 to 10:1), catalyst loading (from 0.5 to 5% by wt.), and stirring speed (from 100 to 400 rpm). The increase in reaction time, molar ratio, and catalyst loading proved to have a favorable effect on % conversion to biodiesel but to a certain degree; increasing the stirring speed augmented the conversion. At optimum conditions (2 h of heating, 6:1 alcohol-to-oil molar ratio, 1% by wt. catalyst loading, and 400 rpm stirring), fig leaves activated by KOH provided the highest conversion to biodiesel (92.73%). The measured properties of the produced biodiesel (density, viscosity, flash point, cloud point, and pour point) yielded encouraging results.

AB  - Pretreatment is an important technological step for the lignocellulose conversion into fuels and biochemicals. Steam explosion (STEX) pretreatment is a fast method for affecting of plant cell wall architecture by a sharp pressure change at high temperatures. Here, eight different STEX conditions were applied to sugarcane bagasse (SCB) samples using auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid catalyzed processes under a range of combined severity factors (CSFs; from 0.37 to 1.34). Our results showed that STEX of auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid-catalyzed SCB led to the removal of 70–80 % and 82–92 % of xylose, respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis of auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid catalyzed bagasse was performed of washed and un-washed pretreated material to access the impact of soluble inhibitors on overall cellulosic sugars recovery. Auto-catalyzed bagasse after washing showed significantly higher glucan conversion (96%) than washed bagasse after pretreatment (62%). On the other hand, sulfuric acid-catalyzed bagasse after washing had 94% glucan conversion as opposed to unwashed material which again had significantly smaller conversion levels (73%). Physical properties and chemical composition were characterized using high performance liquid chromatography, X-ray diffraction, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The obtained results contribute to understanding of an influence of the morphological changes resulting from pretreatments on the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. We show that the changes in physical structure and chemical composition of the pretreated biomass might not be determined solely by combined severity factor of the pretreatments, but by the whole complexity of chemical modifications that different conditions of pretreatments introduce in the plant biomass samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The transesterification of Pequi (Caryocar brasiliensis Camb.) bio-oil was conduct with a heterogeneous acid catalyst prepared with the fruit's carbonized rinds. The newly-developed catalyst was characterized by TGA/DSC, XRD diffraction, and FTIR analysis. Experiments for process optimization of biodiesel production and catalyst reusability were carried out, also investigating the kinetics involved in bio-oil mass conversion. Crude FAME content was analyzed with GC-FID gas chromatographer and its fuel properties compared to worldwide standards. Main finds were a crude FAME majorly composed by methyl esters of palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and stearic acid, representing about 49.93, 13.24, and 10.16 wt.%, respectively. Optimized conditions for maximum FAME synthesis from Pequi bio-oil (99.4 ± 0.33%) were 18:1 M ratio of methanol to bio-oil, 60 °C of temperature, 100 min of reaction, catalyst load of 2.5 wt.%, and stirring speed of 600 rpm. Kinetics of the bio-oil mass conversion through transesterification presented reaction rates varying from 0.016 to 0.091 min−1, 63.07 kJ kg−1 of activation energy (Ea), and pre-exponential value (A) of 11.4E105. Catalyst efficiency decreased to 34.9% after 10 reuse cycles. Fuel properties of the crude FAME met worldwide standards of biodiesel quality, thus indicate that Pequi bio-oil is a viable, sustainable, and widely available feedstock option in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We demonstrated that the direct change of solvent could tune the highly selective synthesis of biofuels ?-valerolactone (GVL) or levulinate esters from the hydrogenation levulinic acid (LA) over magnetic Ni/C catalysts fabricated from a nickel-metal organic framework (Ni-MOF) precursor. Yields were 98.2% and 86.1% of GVL with almost perfect selectivity when 1,4-dioxane and isopropanol were used as the solvent, respectively. Levulinate esters (86.5% yield of methyl levulinate and 45.6% yield of ethyl levulinate) were synthesized in methanol and ethanol solvents under identical conditions. This work offers an attractive strategy for the selective production of biofuels in the process of biomass feedstocks. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The extraction of lipids from microalgae requires a pretreatment process to break the cell wall and subsequent extraction processes to obtain the lipids for biofuels production. The multistep operation tends to incur high costs and are energy intensive due to longer process operations. This research work applies the combination of radicals from hydrogen peroxide with an organic solvent as a chemical pretreatment method for disrupting the cell wall of microalgae and simultaneously extracting lipids from the biomass in a one-step biphasic solution. Result: Several parameters which can affect the biphasic system were analyzed: contact time, volume of solvent, volume ratio, type of organic solvent, biomass amount and concentration of solvents, to extract the highest amount of lipids from microalgae. The results were optimized and up to 83.5% of lipid recovery yield and 94.6% of enhancement was successfully achieved. The results obtain from GC-FID were similar to the analysis of triglyceride lipid standard. Conclusion: The profound hybrid biphasic system shows great potential to radically disrupt the cell wall of microalgae and instantaneously extract lipids in a single-step approach. The lipids extracted were tested to for its comparability to biodiesel performance. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Food and market waste (FMW) is one of the most abundant unrecycled products which poses waste management issues and negative environmental impacts. Thermo-catalytic reforming (TCR) is a pyrolysis based technology which can convert a wide range of biomass wastes into energy vectors bio-oil, syngas, and char. This paper investigates the conversion potential of FMW into sustainable biofuels. The FMW was processed using a laboratory scale 2 kg/h TCR reactor. The process produced 7 wt % organic bio-oil, 53 wt % permanent gas, and 22 wt % char. The bio-oil higher heating value (HHV) was found to be 36.72 MJ/kg, comparable to biodiesel, and contained a low oxygen content (&lt;5%) due to cracking of higher molecular weight organics. Naphthalene was detected to be the most abundant aromatic compound within the oil, with relative abundance of 12.95% measured by GC-MS. The total acid number of the oil (TAN) and viscosity were 11.7 mg KOH/g and 6.3 cSt, respectively. The gross calorific value of the produced biochar was 23.64 MJ/kg, while the permanent gas showed a higher heating value of approximately 17 MJ/Nm3. Methane (CH4) was found to be the largest fraction in the permanent gases reaching over 23%. This resulted either due to the partial methanation of biosyngas over the catalytically active FMW biochar or the hydrogenation of coke deposited on the biochar in the post reforming stage.

AB  - Solid acid catalysts are environmentally friendly alternatives to the use of mineral acids in a range of applications, including the esterification of carboxylic acids. Here, a phosphorus-and nitrogen-doped, carbon-modified, fully heterogeneous solid acid catalyst was prepared by pyrolysis of a mixture of melamine and tungstophosphoric acid at 250, 500, and 750 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere provided. The structure of the different catalysts was evaluated by surface area measurements, XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and electron microscopies. Pyrolysis at 500 °C created complex solid materials with larger surface area and significantly higher acidity, which can be attributed to WO3 formation on a heteroatomic (N,P)-carbon structure. The 500 °C-treated heterogeneous catalysts showed remarkably better activity for esterification of palmitic acid and were thus applied in the esterification of a broad range of carboxylic acids with good overall yields. Furthermore, the solid acid catalyst can be easily recovered and recycled up to eight times without significant loss of activity with no leaching of species to the reaction mixture.

AB  - Pyrolysis bio-oils contain significant amounts of carboxylic acids which limit their utility as biofuels. Ketonisation of carboxylic acids within biomass pyrolysis vapours is a potential route to upgrade the energy content and stability of the resulting bio-oil condensate, but requires active, selective and coke-resistant solid acid catalysts. Here we explore the vapour phase ketonisation of acetic acid over Ga-doped HZSM-5. Weak Lewis acid sites were identified as the active species responsible for acetic acid ketonisation to acetone at 350◦C and 400◦C. Turnover frequencies were proportional to Ga loading, reaching ~6 min−1 at 400◦C for 10Ga/HZSM-5. Selectivity to the desired acetone product correlated with the weak:strong acid site ratio, being favoured over weak Lewis acid sites and reaching 30% for 10Ga/HZSM-5. Strong Brønsted acidity promoted competing unselective reactions and carbon laydown. 10Ga/HZSM-5 exhibited good stability for over 5 h on-stream acetic acid ketonisation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is a potential technology for converting lignocellulosic biomass into bio-oil. Nevertheless, the high amounts of acid, oxygenated compounds, and water content diminish the energy density of the bio-oil and cause it to be unsuitable for direct usage. Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) is able to improve bio-oil properties so that downstream upgrading processes can be economically feasible. Here, calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), and zinc oxide (ZnO) were employed due to their potential in enhancing bio-oil properties. The results showed that overall, all three catalysts positively impacted the empty fruit bunch fibre-derived bio-oil properties. Among the catalysts, CaO showed the most favorable effects in terms of reducing the acidity of the bio-oil and anhydrosugar. Thermal stability of bio-oils produced in the presence of CaO was studied as well. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Castor plant (Ricinus communis)is a fast growing, perennial shrub also known as wonder tree from Euphorbiaceae family. India ranks globally first with production of 87% of the castor seed, while second and third largest producer countries, China and Brazil produced 5% and 1%, respectively. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)is one of the most promising thermochemical conversion process used to convert wet/high moisture biomass to biofuels and value-added hydrocarbons. HTL of castor residue (stem and leaves)was performed at 260, 280, 300 °C and 15, 30, 60, 90 min. Investigations on the effect of temperature and residence time on distribution of products (bio-oil, bio-char)indicated the maximum Total Bio-oil (TBO)yield of c.a. 15.8 wt% was obtained at 300 °C at 60 min. The major compounds observed by GC-MS were phenols and their derivatives, aromatic hydrocarbons, N-containing compounds, acids. In addition, the recovery of carbon and corresponding energy recovery with respect to castor residue indicated that the carbon and energy recovery for bio-oil 1 were 24.23% and 31.08% respectively. An increase in the carbon and decrease of oxygen content in bio-oil (BO)demonstrates that the castor residue can be used as a potential feedstock for bioenergy applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An integrated process for bioethanol production from Miscanthus sacchariflorus was used to construct a bench-scale plant constructed and an economic analysis was carried out to investigate the feasibility of its application to a commercial plant. The bench-scale plant was operated for 1 month and an economic analysis and sensitivity analysis was performed on the data acquired. In this study, 100,000 kL of bioethanol could be produced annually from 606,061 tons of M. sacchariflorus and the production cost was calculated to be US$1.76/L. However, the by-products of this process such as xylose molasses and lignin can be sold or used as a heat source, which can decrease the ethanol production costs. Therefore, the final ethanol production cost was calculated to be US$1.31/L, and is considerably influenced by the enzyme cost. The results and data obtained should contribute to the development of a commercial-scale lignocellulosic bioethanol plant. © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Algal systems have been proposed for treating wastewater while simultaneously recovering energy and nutrients. In this study, an integrated system with algal treatment of municipal wastewater followed by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conversion and upgrading steps was evaluated. Pilot-scale treatment of primary clarified municipal wastewater effluent was evaluated in different seasons (cold, warm, and a transitional period in between) with different strains of algae selected for each season, and the warm season strain successfully met all local discharge regulations. The collected wastewater algae biomass was subjected to HTL at 300 and 350 °C and both energy and nutrient recoveries were much improved at the higher temperature. The transitional batch was found to have the highest biocrude oil yields, and its co-products had the highest nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) contents. Economic analysis of conversion processes informed by the observed HTL product yields was conducted. While this revealed that targeting biofuel products alone was not profitable, adding nutrient co-products (e.g., ammonium sulfate fertilizer), adjusting algae harvesting time, and incorporating component-specific conversion processes could substantially improve system economics. Overall, this study highlights connections between treatment and conversion processes, and demonstrates how these connections can be leveraged for more efficient resource recovery without compromising treatment operations. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Used kitchen oil represents a feasible and renewable biomass to produce green biofuels such as biodiesel. Biodiesel production generates large amounts of by-products such as the crude glycerol fraction, which can be further used biotechnologically as a valuable nutrient for many microorganisms. In this study, we transesterified used kitchen oil with methanol and sodium hydroxide in order to obtain biodiesel and crude glycerol fractions. The crude glycerol fraction consisting of 30% glycerol was integrated into a bioreactor cultivation process as a nutrient source for the growth of Candida zeylanoides ATCC 20367. Cell viability and biomass production were similar to those obtained with batch cultivations on pure glycerol or glucose as the main nutrient substrates. However, the biosynthesis of organic acids (e.g., citric and succinic) was significantly different compared to pure glycerol and glucose used as main carbon sources. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Untethered actuation is important for robotic devices to achieve autonomous motion, which is typically enabled by using batteries. Using enzymes to provide the required electrical charge is particularly interesting as it will enable direct harvesting of fuel components from a surrounding fluid. Here, a soft artificial muscle is presented, which uses the biofuel glucose in the presence of oxygen. Glucose oxidase and laccase enzymes integrated in the actuator catalytically convert glucose and oxygen into electrical power that in turn is converted into movement by the electroactive polymer polypyrrole causing the actuator to bend. The integrated bioelectrode pair shows a maximum open-circuit voltage of 0.70 ± 0.04 V at room temperature and a maximum power density of 0.27 µW cm−2 at 0.50 V, sufficient to drive an external polypyrrole-based trilayer artificial muscle. Next, the enzymes are fully integrated into the artificial muscle, resulting in an autonomously powered actuator that can bend reversibly in both directions driven by glucose and O2 only. This autonomously powered artificial muscle can be of great interest for soft (micro-)robotics and implantable or ingestible medical devices manoeuvring throughout the body, for devices in regenerative medicine, wearables, and environmental monitoring devices operating autonomously in aqueous environments. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Nanostructure of soot particles from a small-bore compression-ignition engine was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Four test fuels namely conventional diesel, waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel, Jatropha biodiesel, and Karanja biodiesel were studied. Lacey carbon TEM grids were utilized to capture soot particles from engine exhaust gas. An in-house image processing algorithm was developed to measure primary particle diameter, fringe length, fringe tortuosity, and fringe spacing. The HRTEM image revealed the presence of thicker absorbed hydrocarbon layers surrounding biodiesel soot primary particles than those of diesel soot. The primary particle size of WCO biodiesel was smaller than diesel, on the other hand, Jatropha biodiesel and Karanja biodiesel showed slightly larger particles. In terms of nano-structure analysis, WCO biodiesel and Jatropha biodiesel particles exhibited shorter fringe length than diesel, while the Karanja biodiesel particles showed the longest fringe length of 0.91 nm. Fringe tortuosity of biodiesels was smaller than diesel because of relatively lower portion of core area, where highly curved fringes existed. The soot particles from biodiesels exhibited larger fringe spacing than diesel, especially the Karanja biodiesel showed the longest fringe spacing of 0.67 nm compared to 0.55 nm in case of diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrogen is seen as a key element of the future energy mix because it does not generate greenhouse gas emissions at the point of use. Understanding the technologies that can generate low carbon hydrogen is essential in planning the development of future gas networks and energy generation via fuel cells. One promising approach is hydrogen production by gasification of waste, referred to as biohydrogen. This paper summarises work undertaken to design a commercial Waste-to-Hydrogen (WtH2) plant, which includes an assessment of future markets for hydrogen, the identification of an appropriate scale for the plants, and development of specifications for process design and output streams. An experimental programme was undertaken to demonstrate bioH2 production from refuse derived fuel (RDF) at pilot scale and provided experimental data to underpin commercial designs. On this basis, a reference design for small commercial plants was developed for bioH2 production for heating and transport utilisation. A preliminary carbon assessment shows that carbon savings for biohydrogen in a commercial scale are more than four times greater than alternative technologies. © 2019

AB  - Lignin-rich digested stillage from second-generation bioethanol production is a unique biomass-derived feedstock, not only because it contains high amounts of lignin but also due to its residual amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose. In this study, catalytic hydrotreatment experiments were conducted on pyrolysis liquids obtained from the lignin-rich feedstock using sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts. The aim was to obtain a high conversion of the initial pyrolysis feed into a hydrotreated oil with a high phenolics and aromatics fractions. Experiments were carried out in a stirred batch reactor at 350 °C and 10 MPa of H2 (initial pressure). Product oils were obtained in about 60–65% w/w, the remainder being an aqueous phase (12–14% w/w), solids (7–8% w/w) and gas phase components (all on initial pyrolysis oil feed basis). The product oils were characterised in detail using various techniques (elemental composition, GCxGC-FID, GPC, and 2D HSQC NMR). The oxygen content was reduced from 23% w/w in the pyrolysis oils to 7.5–11.5% in the hydrotreated oils, indicative of the occurrence of hydrodeoxygenation reactions. This was also evident from the chemical composition, showing an increase in the amounts of low molecular weight aromatics, alkylphenolics, alkanes and cycloalkanes in hydrotreated oils. Performance of the two catalysts was compared, and a higher degree of deoxygenation was observed for the NiMo catalyst. The implications of the findings for the valorisation of second-generation bioethanol residues are also discussed. © 2019

AB  - In-situ catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-tar in supercritical ethanol for upgraded biofuel was investigated. Highly mesoporous KOH-treated AC (KOH-AC) was synthesized by chemical activation and used as the support for Ni-based catalysts. Among the tested catalysts (AC, KOH-AC, Mg-Ni-Mo/AC, and Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC), Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC with a high surface area of 1310.1 m2/g and a well-developed mesoporous structure exhibited much higher catalytic performance for the HDO of bio-tar. The effects of different reaction temperatures (300–400 °C) and residence time (0–120 min) on the HDO of bio-tar over Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC were also examined. Enhanced properties of liquid fuel with a higher heating value (HHV) of 36.2 MJkg−1, an oxygen content of 11.7 wt%, and a total acid number (TAN) value of 8.6 mgKOHg−1 were obtained from bio-tar over a Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC at 400 °C for 120 min. In these conditions, acids, aldehydes, and oxygenated phenols present in bio-tar (&gt;67 area%) were effectively converted to high value-added species including aromatics, hydrocarbons, and alkyl phenols in upgraded bio-tar (&gt;77 area%) via esterification, hydrogenation, deoxygenation, and ring-alkylation reactions. A series of Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC catalyst recycle test showed the deposition of coke on the catalyst, which became a major reason for the catalyst deactivation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of fuel from the hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils has been extensively investigated on account of the decline of petroleum-based fuels and increase of ecological problems. The conversion of jatropha oil over Al-MCM-41-supported Ni, W, and Ni-W catalysts was studied at 3 MPa and 360 °C. Over the monometallic Ni and W catalysts, the biofuel yield was low, about 19.3 and 12.5 wt %, respectively, whereas the highest biofuel yield reached 63.5 wt % over the Ni-W bimetallic catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM results suggested that the proper amount of Ni and W would form a Ni17W3 active phase, the particle size of which varied with the content of Ni and W or preparation methods. The crystalline Ni17W3 phase formed when the content of both Ni and W reached 10%. With further increase of the content of W or Ni to 15%, the crystal size of Ni17W3 grew from 7 to 14 nm or to 20 nm, whereas the biofuel yield decreased with the increase of the Ni17W3 crystal size. The 10Ni-10W/Al-MCM-41 catalyst with the Ni17W3 crystal size of 7 nm showed the best performance for the transformation of jatropha oil into high-grade biofuel. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Two sugarcane biofuels and mineral diesel fuel are tested under full load conditions, under the same values of performance and under the European Transient Cycle on an engine test bench, without any modifications to the ECU. The target is to compare engine performance and emissions. At full load, engine performance varies due to the variation in LHV. Under the same values of performance, the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 provides the lowest THC emissions. The higher CN and exhaust gas recirculation of the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 and the higher H/C ratio of the sugarcane diesel-farnesane compared to the diesel S50 provide a NOx reduction. Neither the increment in bsfc nor the increment of %EGR for the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 deteriorate the combustion, so its CO emissions are lower. The sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 leads to the lowest NOx and PM specific emissions under transient operation, followed by the sugarcane diesel-farnesane. The THC and CO specific emissions are higher for the biofuels in comparison to the diesel S50. The main reason for these results is the impact of the properties of the biofuels on the ECU response However, both biofuels produce less harmful emissions at idle conditions, which supports their usage to reduce exhaust emissions in urban areas. © 2019

AB  - Upgrading biochemicals to the high energy density intermediates is the promising way to produce renewable diesel and jet fuel range alkanes. In this work, K2O clusters containing N-doped microporous and mesoporous carbon materials were prepared by a one-pot method and used as base catalysts to produce the key biofuel intermediate derived from furfural through its solvent-free aldol condensation with acetone. It is found that K2O clusters, which are stabilized by nitrogen and carbon atoms of N-doped porous carbon materials due to their strong interactions, are located inside the micropores, existing in the form of extra framework K2O clusters. The presence of K2O clusters inside micropores endows N-doped microporous and mesoporous carbon catalysts exceptional catalytic activity and shape selectivity in aldol condensation, almost full furfural conversion and over 90% selectivity to the monomer aldol product 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one (FAc) can be achieved within 2 h reaction time at 100 °C over these two types of N-doped carbon catalysts, which can be attributed to the synergetic effect between strong basic K2O clusters and N-doped carbon materials, and the micropores, which hinder the second condensation step to form the dimer aldol product 1, 5-di-2-furanyl-1, 4-pentadien-3-one (F2Ac). In addition, all the catalysts exhibited excellent regeneration capability and their catalytic activities can be well recovered by calcination under N2. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Bio-oil upgrading by hydrotreatment has been considered as a renewable route for fuels production and potential substitutes for fossil oil distillates. Traditional hydrodesulfurization catalysts (sulfided CoMo and NiMo) used in petroleum refining have been evaluated in hydrodeoxygenation reactions with high selectivity to aromatics. However, significant deactivation has been commonly observed, due to the low sulfur content in bio-oil. Thus, the development of different active and stable catalytic materials is needed. In this regard, we have previously reported a synergetic effect between Ni and Ru bimetallic materials supported on Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 and ZrO 2 in phenol HDO with promising activity and selectivity results. In particular, materials supported TiO 2 on displayed the highest activities. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of calcination on dispersion and metal-support interactions and their impact on activity and selectivity for NiRu/TiO 2 catalysts in HDO of phenol as a model compound for bio oil. Catalysts were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, Temperature- programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, High resolution electron microscopy. Additionally, hydrogenation of benzene was used as a structure unsensitive reaction in order to obtain more information about metallic dispersion. A highly active NiRu catalyst was obtained when calcination was avoided prior to reduction. The calcination procedure induced the formation of metallic oxides and it provoked less dispersed NiRu species as compared with catalysts without this previous treatment. On the contrary, the formation of metallic species from direct reduction of precursor salts contributed to produce highly dispersed species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The one-pot production of a promising biofuel, 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) from corn stover with mixed acid as the catalyst, was investigated and optimized by using the response surface methodology. Catalyzed by the mixed acids comprised of 0.1% H2SO4 and 1.0% zeolite USY, a high EMF yield of 23.9% at 210 °C and 125 min can be obtained from corn stover. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of the zeolite USY had no obvious loss after five recycles. On the basis of the putative reaction pathway, the kinetics modeling for the EMF production directly from corn stover was developed, which coincided with the first-order reaction model. This study provides a promising strategy for EMF preparation from corn stover. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Spirulina platensis microalgae is one of the feedstocks used in the production of the third generation of biofuel. The extraction of its lipid for biodiesel leaves behind a residue, which can be treated by pyrolysis to create certain other value-added products. This paper discusses the effects of Spirulina platensis residue (SPR) with respect to grain size (0.105, 0.149 and 0.177 mm), temperature (300 to 600°C) and amount of catalyst (0, 10, 20 and 40 wt.%) on the characteristics of products (bio-oil, water phase, char and gas) obtained from pyrolysis in a fixed-bed reactor. The results of the study show that the higher the pyrolysis temperature, the higher the conversion. For the bio-oil product, the optimum temperature is 500°C, which produces a peak yield of 35.99 wt.%. The larger the grain size, the lower the bio-oil yield, gas water and gas, for all of the tested temperatures (300-600°C). The amount of catalyst and the pyrolysis temperature greatly influence the quality of bio-oil products, grouping them into the fractions of LPG (C ≤ 4), gasoline (C5-C11), biodiesel (C12-C18) and heavy naphtha (C ≥ 19). The tendency for LPG-Gasoline formation at optimum conditions, considering the use of a 10 wt.% catalyst at a temperature of 400-500°C, was reported. © IJTech 2019.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for the conversion of wet biomass into liquid fuels. In this study, the hydrothermal co-liquefaction (HTCL) of Spirulina platensis and α-Cellulose for bio-oil production was investigated. The bio-oil yield of HTCL was increased significantly by blending α-Cellulose with low-lipid content microalgae of Spirulina platensis in the absence of any catalysts supplementary which reduces the processing cost. The results showed that bio-oil productivity was increased drastically up to 40.33 wt % (28.53 wt % with pure Spirulina platensis and 14.47 wt % with pure α-Cellulose), with a positive synergistic effect (SE) of 16 wt % during the HTCL process. The composition of synthesized bio-oil was analyzed by GC-MS which revealed that HTCL of Spirulina platensis and α-Cellulose are to decrease of its heterocyclic compounds, increased esters and hydrocarbons contents than HTL of pure Spirulina platensis or α-Cellulose. The possible reaction pathways were derived by synthesized bio-oil composition. The maximum energy recovery rate 82% was obtained on HTCL process. The study concluded that, HTCL process is more favorable for the economic concern due to high convention of bio-oil efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In a quest of alternative energy source of fossil fuels, lignocellulosic biomass is intensively studying to produce different liquid fuels and chemicals. Both fuel (bioethanol) and chemical (furfural) were produced simultaneously in this study through two different production routes, biochemical and thermochemical route. Actually, this study firstly defined production pathway in details for each production route from extensive literature survey. Later details production pathway simulation was carried out in Aspen Plus simulation software for each production route individually. As well as heat integration was carried out within each production route to make overall production process as energy efficient and more profitable. Finally, an economic analysis of each production route ensured economic feasibility as well as annual profitability for bioethanol and furfural coproduction in individual route. Moreover, a comparative study between production routes in terms of annual profitability showed that heat integrated biochemical route is more profitable for bioethanol and furfural coproduction. Based on processing of 658201.14 ton dry lignocellulosic biomass (corn stover) per year, heat integrated biochemical production route can produce per gallon bioethanol by $2.0 and can make $49.95 million annual profit, whereas, the values were $3.07 and $20.07 respectively for heat integrated thermochemical route. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass gasification based electricity generation systems are emerging as an important component of the decentralised energy supply systems in rural India. Each type of gasifier has different reaction conditions, temperature, residence time, pressure, feedstock, reactor design, and therefore the tar and particulate matter (PM) compositions and concentrations are found to vary. A field study was conducted on a 35 kWe downdraft gasifier to measure and characterize the tar in producer gas using GC-MS, for rice husk and pine needles as the two biomass feeds. Use of water-based scrubbers for removal of tar and PM is prevalent, however it is often the case that such clean-up is not adequate for meeting the engine manufacturers’ requirements for the quality of intake gas. Limited attempts have been reported for the use of organic solvent based gas cleaning in small scale downdraft gasifiers in the range 15–50 kWe. In the present work, toluene, naphthalene and phenol were selected as representative compounds of tar, and methyl oleate was selected to represent biodiesel as an organic solvent. A bench scale packed bed scrubber was designed for 95% removal of toluene. An 86–97% removal of toluene from the gas stream was achieved, and similar results were obtained for phenol and naphthalene. Further experiments were carried out with actual producer gas from a 1 kWe downdraft wood gasifier. Pongamia pinnata based biodiesel was used as the solvent, and 88–92% of the tar removal from the producer gas stream was achievable. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A single flow helical coil reactor (SFHR) and reverse flow helical coil reactor (RFHR) were designed for continuous biodiesel synthesis from a mixture of oils using KOH. BBD (Box-Behnken design) coupled with RSM (Response Surface Methodology) was carried out to optimize reaction variables for the transesterification reaction in the continuous reactor. The R2 value for SFHR and RFHR were 0.97 and 0.98 respectively which indicate the accuracy of the model. The results indicated that RFHR gives highest biodiesel yield than SFHR. Residence time due to reverse flow mixing shows a positive effect on biodiesel yield. The optimum findings include residence time of 8.3 min, the process temperature of 57.6 °C, the catalyst concentration of 2.2 g and residence time of 5 min, the process temperature of 63 °C, the catalyst concentration of 2.1 g for SFHR and RFHR respectively. At the predicted optimized process parameters, the observed and predicted biodiesel yield was 99.0% and 99.2% for SFHR and 99.9% and 99.8% for RFHR, respectively. These values experimentally verified the model accuracy. The batch and helical coil reactor processes were also compared for biodiesel production and found that helical coil reactors are 8–9 times more time efficient as compared to the batch reactor. © 2018

AB  - MgAl-hydrotalcites (HT) containing 1–2% of the lanthanide ions La3+, Ce3+ and Lu3+ were evaluated as heterogeneous catalysts in the transesterification process for fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) synthesis in order to understand the effect of the high ionic-radii of these metals in the material structure and their catalytic activity. The addition of lanthanides to the catalysts resulted in a decrease of the thermal degradation temperature as well as the specific surface, but, on the other hand, it increases the basicity, crystallinity, and improve the yield in biodiesel production. In general, MMOs with 1% of lanthanides showed higher yields than those with 2%, and the oxide with 1% of Lu3+ reached the best catalytic result for ethanol biodiesel production (84%), about 4.5 times greater than the reference material. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The utilization of various solid biofuels in combustion plants often requires the application of secondary emission reduction measures in order to meet legal requirements. Since common multi-stage exhaust cleaning methods are too expensive for the application in decentral biomass combustion, new approaches have to be investigated which can be applied economically in small- and medium-sized plants. The combined removal of particulate and gaseous emissions in one unit can save investment and operation costs. In this context, a method for simultaneous reduction of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) was developed and tested. The investigations focused on the alignment of the system components and the determination of optimal operating parameters for use in decentralized biomass furnaces. Experiments with wood chips and different non-woody biomass pellets at a 120-kW pilot plant showed significant reduction of PM and NOX. There is still a need for optimization with regard to the NH3 slip and the degree of particle separation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel is a non-toxic and renewable fuel produced by a transesterification reaction between alcohol and vegetable oil. The objective of this paper is to optimize the ultrasound-assisted production of biodiesel. The central composite design method was used to optimize the transesterification reaction conditions of biodiesel production from peanut oil. The independent variables investigated in the course of the experiment include the catalyst concentration, the reaction time, and the ultrasonic amplitude. The reaction was done by employing ultrasound under set conditions of atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. A statistical model predicted the optimum conversion yield of peanut biodiesel to be 100.00% under the following optimum experimental conditions: ultrasonic amplitude equals 69.7%, catalyst concentration equals 0.88% weight percent catalyst, and reaction time of 39.38 s.

AB  - α-Amylase is an endo-acting enzyme which catalyzes random hydrolysis of starch. These enzymes are used in various biotechnological processes including the textile, paper, food, biofuels, detergents and pharmaceutical industries. The use of active enzymes at low temperatures has a high potential because these enzymes would avoid the demand for heating during the process thereby reducing costs. In this work, the gene of α-amylase from Pseudoalteromonas sp. 2–3 (Antarctic bacteria) has been sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The ORF of the α-amylase gene cloned into pET22b(+) is 1824 bp long and codes for a protein of 607 amino acid residues including a His6-tag. The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 68.8 kDa. Recombinant α-amylase was purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme is active on potato starch with a Km of 6.94 mg/ml and Vmax of 0.27 mg/ml*min. The pH optimum is 8.0 and the optimal temperature is 20 °C. This enzyme was strongly activated by Ca2+; results consistent with other α-amylases. To the best of our knowledge, this enzyme has the lowest temperature optimum so far reported for α-amylases. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lipids extracted from algal biomass could provide an abundant, rapidly growing, high yield feedstock for bio-diesel and other green fuels to supplement current fossil-based sources. Ultrasound pretreatment is a mechanical cell disruption method that has been shown to enhance lipid recovery from algae due to cavitation effects that disrupt algae cell walls. In this study, a locally grown mixture of Chlorella vulgaris/Cyanobacteria leptolyngbya was sonicated in an ultrasonic reactor with a clamp-on transducer prior to solvent lipid extraction. This configuration allows for a non-contact delivery method of ultrasonic energy with improved operational advantages (no fouling of transducer, continuous operation, and fully scalable design). A central composite design (CCD) was implemented to statistically analyze and evaluate the effect of ultrasonic power (350–750 W) and treatment time (5–30 min) on lipid yield. Lipid recovery was found to increase with both ultrasonic power and treatment time. Total lipid yields (on dry biomass basis) extracted via the Bligh and Dyer method from Chlorella vulgaris/cyanobacteria co-culture ranged from 8.3% for untreated algae to 16.9% for algae sonicated with 750 W power for 30 min, which corresponds to more than a doubling of lipid recovery due to ultrasound pretreatment. Increased power and treatment times were found to increase the degree of cell disruption as observed in the SEM and TEM images after ultrasonic pretreatment. Additionally, hexane (1:1 v/v) was evaluated as an alternative to the standard Bligh & Dyer (2:2:1.8 v/v/v chloroform/methanol/cell suspension) lipid extraction solvent system. On average, the Bligh and Dyer method extracted on average over twice the amount of lipids compared to hexane extraction. The lipid profile of the algae extracts indicates high concentrations of lauric acid (12:0), palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1), and linoleic acid (18:2). This particular configuration of an ultrasonic system proved to be a viable method for the pretreatment of algae for enhanced lipid yields. Future research should focus on identifying alternative extraction solvents and expanding the range of treatment conditions to optimize the ultrasonic power and treatment times for maximum lipid recovery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herein, a novel, low-cost, and readily available HB pencil graphite (PG), as bioanode for enzymatic biofuel cell, is presented. The surface area of the PG is substantially increased by coating carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotube through the dipping method followed by its covalent immobilization with glucose oxidase enzyme to fabricate the bioanode. The surface morphology of fabricated bioanode is characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and the electrochemical studies are performed through linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results reveal that the fabricated bioanode shows good direct electron transfer characteristics between the dynamic site of the enzyme and the terminal surface of electrode. Approximately, 1.23 \times 10^{-11}\,\,\text {mol}\cdot \text {cm}^{-2} of glucose oxidase is found to anchor on the fabricated bioanode with significant electron transfer rate of 3.2 s-1. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of fabricated bioanode is enhanced with increase in the glucose concentration, and a hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten kinetics is observed with K-{\text {m}} value of 5.5 mM and maximum current density of 4605 \mu \text {A}\cdot \text {cm}^{-2} at 40-mM saturated glucose concentration. Finally, the fabricated bioanode exhibits stability with reasonably good retention of biocatalytic activity, thus establishing HB PG as promising bioanode material for enzymatic biofuel cell. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biochemicals are interesting alternatives for biomass valorization owing to their much higher added value compared to biofuels and energy products. Several methods for the production of valuable chemicals such as levoglucosenone (LGO) via thermochemical processes over solid acid catalysts are being investigated due to their important advantages compared to conventional biomass acid impregnation techniques. The present work explores the synthesis of catalytic materials for the production of this platform molecule. RESULTS: Aluminum-loaded SBA-15 mesoporous silica and the corresponding solid phosphoric acid (SPA) catalysts were prepared, characterized by TEM, FTIR, MAS NMR, NH3-TPD, N2 adsorption, ICP-AES and titration of ‘free H3PO4’, and tested in cellulose fast pyrolysis. Post-synthesis Al deposition on the silica support produced an increase of bio-oil yield and LGO amount in pyrolysis products. The presence of Al in SPA catalysts led to the formation of aluminum phosphates, decreasing the concentration of H3PO4 species in the surface and therefore the LGO levels. The SPAs presented relatively high LGO levels in the GC–MS detectable liquid products (up to 85 peak area%) which was found to be correlated with the amount of free H3PO4 in the solid catalysts. CONCLUSION: Aluminum grafting over SBA-15 is an effective way to increase the selectivity to the target anhydrosaccharide. In SPAs, the presence of Al reduced the easily leachable H3PO4 amount, which is desirable from the point of view of catalyst stability because deactivation is mainly caused by H3PO4 leaching, but also led to lower levels of LGO in bio-oil. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The application of microalgal biomass for fermentation has been highlighted as a means of producing a range of value-added biofuels and chemicals. On the other hand, the microalgal residue from the fermentation process still contains as much as 50% organic contaminants, which can be a valuable substrate for further bioenergy recovery. In this study, a microbial fuel cell and automatic external load control by maximum power point tracking (MPPT) were implemented to harvest the electrical energy from waste fermented microalgal residue (FMR). The MFC with MPPT produced the highest amount of energy (1.82 kJ/L) compared to the other MFCs with fixed resistances: 0.98 (1000 Ω), 1.16 (500 Ω), and 1.17 kJ/L (300 Ω). The MFC with MPPT also showed the highest maximum power density (88.6 mW/m2) and COD removal efficiency (620.0 mg COD/L removal with 85% removal efficiency). The implementation of MPPT gained an approximate 12.9% energy yield compared to the previous fermentation stage. These results suggest that FMR can be an appropriate feedstock for electrical energy recovery using MFCs, and the combined fermentation and MFC system improves significantly the energy recovery and treatment efficiency from FMR. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Biofuel has benefits of reduction in CO2 and engine exhaust emissions, so it has been attracting more attention in the past few decades. In this study, the partial oxidation reforming of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, hereafter, FAME) and a new generation renewable hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) are evaluated using a thermodynamic analysis and an experimental investigation. The thermodynamic analysis is used to evaluate the effect of the O2/FAME and O2/HVO molar ratios on hydrogen-rich syngas production. The results show that under the best operating conditions at 800 °C and an O2/FAME molar ratio of 10, the concentration of the H2 is 21.96%, and the syngas yield is 45.50%; at an O2/HVO molar ratio of 10, the concentration of H2 is 23.01%, and the syngas yield is 45.14%. In the FAME experimental results, when the air to fuel ratio is 4.70, the H2 concentration is 18.80%, the CO concentration is 22.87%, and the reforming efficiency is 72.80%. Moreover, for HVO reforming under the air to fuel ratio of 6.30, the H2 concentration is 17.65%; the CO concentration is 17.67%, and the reforming efficiency is 62.87%. Because the composition of HVO is more complex than that of FAME, the reforming efficiency for HVO is lower than that for FAME. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of biofuel blends on the engine performance and emissions of agricultural machines can be extremely complex to predict even if the properties and the effects of the pure substances in the blends can be sourced from the literature. Indeed, on the one hand, internal combustion engines (ICEs) have a high intrinsic operational complexity; on the other hand, biofuels show antithetic effects on engine performance and present positive or negative interactions that are difficult to determine a priori. This study applies the Response Surface Methodology (RSM), a numerical method typically applied in other disciplines (e.g., industrial engineering) and for other purposes (e.g., set-up of production machines), to analyse a large set of experimental data regarding the mechanical and environmental performances of an ICE used to power a farm tractor. The aim is twofold: i) to demonstrate the effectiveness of RSM in quantitatively assessing the effects of biofuels on a complex system like an ICE; ii) to supply easy-to-use correlations for the users to predict the effect of biofuel blends on performance and emissions of tractor engines. The methodology showed good prediction capabilities and yielded interesting outcomes. The effects of biofuel blends and physical fuel parameters were adopted to study the engine performance. Among all possible parameters depending on the fuel mixture, the viscosity of a fuel blend demonstrated a high statistical significance on some system responses directly related to the engine mechanical performances. This parameter can constitute an interesting indirect estimator of the mechanical performances of an engine fuelled with such blend, while it showed poor accuracy in predicting the emissions of the ICE (NOx, CO concentration and opacity of the exhaust gases) due to a higher influence of the chemical composition of the fuel blend on these parameters; rather, the blend composition showed a much higher accuracy in the assessment of the mechanical performance of the ICE. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Tobacco stalk, a common agricultural waste derived from the harvest of tobacco, caused serious environmental pollution in China. In this study, the performance of biomethane production and characteristics of four varieties of tobacco stalk were investigated for the first time. The results showed that the highest cumulative methane yield of 130.2 mL/g-VS was obtained from Nicotiana tabacum L., Yunyan114, which had lower lignin content than other varieties of tobacco stalk. Moreover, different kinetic models were used to describe the biomethane production process, and it was found that the modified Gompertz model was more suitable to simulate the anaerobic digestion (AD) of tobacco stalk. The findings of this study not only showed a feasible method for minimizing the pollution issues of tobacco stalk waste but also gave fundamental information for future AD application. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The catalytic hydrogenation of lignocellulosic derived bio-oil was assessed from the thermodynamic simulation perspective, in order to evaluate its economic potential for the production of added-value chemicals and drop-in fuels. A preliminary economic evaluation was first run to identify the conditions where the process is profitable, while a full economic analysis evaluated how the operating conditions affected the reaction in terms of yield. The results indicate that the bio-oil should be separated into water-soluble and insoluble fractions previous hydrogenation, since very different process conditions are required for the two portions. The maximum economic potential resulted in 38,234 MM$/y for a capacity of bio-oil processed of 10 Mt/y. In the simulated biorefinery, the insoluble bio-oil fraction (IBO) was processed to produce biofuels with a cost of 22.22 and 18.87 $/GJ for light gasoline and diesel, respectively. The water-soluble bio-oil fraction (WBO) was instead processed to produce 51.43 ton/day of chemicals, such as sorbitol, propanediol, butanediol, etc., for a value equal to the market price. The economic feasibility of the biorefinery resulted in a return of investment (ROI) of 69.18%, a pay-out time of 2.48 years and a discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) of 19.11%, considering a plant cycle life of 30 years. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Heterogeneously biodiesel production from vegetable oils is recently concerned for reduction the environmental problems of its homogeneous production process. Therefore, synthesis an active and stable catalyst via simple, cost-effective and industrialization method must be proposed. For this purpose, a series of MgO impregnated on MgAlFe mixed metal catalysts with different Al/Fe molar ratio was prepared via solution combustion method for production of biodiesel from sunflower oil. The results of characterization presented that spinel type of MgFe2O4 was successfully synthesized by combustion method. Moreover, present of Al cation into mixture of precursors caused to the combustion reaction transfer from smoldering to flam reaction that is related to lower heat formation of MgAl2O4. This phenomenon prevents the insufficient growth of crystal and particles. Moreover, due to releasing huge amount of gases during combustion reaction, high reaction temperature and well bonding of active phases with the samples containing Al cations, they showed highly porous structure, high surface area, appropriate pore shape and high thermal stability. These advantages clearly increased their activity in the transesterification reaction. According the results, the MgO/MgAl0.4Fe1.6O4 nanocatalyst was selected as optimum sample that converted 93.2% of sunflower oil to biodiesel at the conditions of 110 °C, 12 M ratio of methanol/oil, 3 wt.% of catalyst and 3 h of reaction time. The sample also exhibited high stability for several uses such that preserved its activity at least for five times (conversion &gt; 85%). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of corn straw at different operation temperatures, reaction time and catalyst dosage were investigated, and the main product was heavy bio-oil. Results showed that CuO + NaOH have a synergistic effect in the HTL of corn straw. The product distribution and composition were also studied during the process, in which aromatic compounds achieved the highest proportion in heavy bio-oil. Moreover, the yield of aromatic compounds in hydrothermal products increased under simultaneous action of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The maximum ratio of aromatic compounds was 89.84% under condition of temperature 230 °C, reaction time 1 h, CuO content 3 g and NaOH 100 mL (1 mol·L−1). GC–MS analysis indicated that the major organic compounds in heavy bio-oil at temperatures between 210 °C and 270 °C were interestingly similar. SEM, XRD, H2-TPR and XPS analysis showed that CuO was completely reduced to copper in the process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass-derived lignin derivatives are significant biodegradable plant materials which produce a variety of value-added products by oxidation/oxidative cleavage methods. These value-added products constitute important materials for the sustainable production of biofuels. The ultralevel quantitative detection of feedstock carbonyls on metal surfaces is possible with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique. Considering environmental friendly protocols for activation of molecular oxygen in both valorization methods of biomass, the corresponding SERS detection protocols are rare. Here, for the very first time, RuO2-DNA nanochains aggregate as an efficient catalyst for oxidation/oxidative cleavage of biomass-derived lignin mimics and their subsequent in-situ SERS detection. Notably, both reactions are carried out in aqueous medium. For the controlled oxidation study, veratryl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol were used as lignin mimics, and the respective carbonyls were detected by the SERS method by activating molecular oxygen. Also, by changing the oxidant from molecular oxygen to peroxide, the respective acids were seen to be formed for veratryl alcohol. We extend this protocol to oxidative cleavage of lignin-derived olefins, and diols, such as cinnamyl alcohol and 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, and corresponding acids were formed and detected by SERS technique. This oxidation protocol could also be scaled-up for large-scale synthesis and recyclability experiments to prove the robustness of the catalyst under green conditions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study aims to harvest the hazardous algae from water using biologically synthetized magnetic nanomaterials with cheap, simple and environmentally friendly process to valorise it into biodiesel. The characteristics of obtained nanoparticles showed that it has 50 nm-sized hexagonal or round-shaped nanoparticles indicating its high adsorption capability due to its large surface area (78.4 m2 g−1) and suitable porous volume (0.3 cm3 g−1), and thus, proved to be effective to collect microalgae from water. The optimum conditions for harvesting efficiency (HE) were determined under a response surface methodology (RSM) using CCD approach (five-level, four-factor Central Composite Design) including various parameters; particle dosage, time, stirring speed and temperature while considering the HE (%) as the response. The optimized conditions for HE were found to be 56 mg L−1 particle dosage, 48 s, 310 rpm and 22.5 °C. The optimized algae HE was 82.4%. The lipid content of the harvested biomass was 5.6%. The produced oil was found to have high saturation level in which butyric (C4:0) (43.4%), heneicosanoic (C21:0) (22.4%), heptadecanoic (C17:0) (16.7%) and undecanoic (C11:0) (12.8%) acids were found as the dominant fatty acids. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) composition of obtained biodiesel was suitable comprising of 40.46% saturated fatty acids, 42.77% monounsaturated fatty acids and 16.77% polyunsaturated fatty acids. The physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel were characterized. All properties, except acid value, satisfy international ASTM D6751 criteria and can be used commercially with acid neutralization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the potential of the pyrolysis method to overcome the negative effects of Azolla-filiculoides in infected areas was thoroughly investigated. Non-catalytic pyrolysis experiments were conducted at a temperature range of 400–700 °C. The highest possible bio-oil yield (35 wt%) was attained at 500 °C. To achieve the best chemical composition of bio-oil and higher amount of synthesis gas the catalytic pyrolysis were conducted in a dual-bed quartz reactor at the optimum temperature (500 °C). Although, all three catalysts (pyro-char, modified pyro-char (MPC), and Mg-Ni-Mo/MPC) showed almost an impressive performance in promotion of the common reactions, Mg-Ni-Mo/MPC catalyst have illustrated the stunning results by increasing the percentage of furan compounds from 5.25% to 33.07%, and decreasing the acid compounds from 25.56% to 9.09%. Using GC–MS and GC-FID liquid and gaseous products were fully analyzed. The carbon-based catalysts were also evaluated via FTIR, FESEM, EDX, and BET analyses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are photosynthetically competent organisms that utilize solar energy to perform several metabolic activities. In this study, electrogenic microalga Desmodesmus sp. was isolated from discharge site of textile dyeing mill effluent and was explored for its potential for dye degradation and lipid production. Extracellular electron transfer (EET) by microbes displays their capability to associate with its surrounding environment. To attain an efficient alternative, a nanobiotechnological approach was applied, wherein; extracellular electrons of Desmodesmus sp. was coupled with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on its electron-rich draper region to form a GO/algae bionanocomposite. Electrochemical tests of the bionanocomposite revealed that amalgamation of GO sheets with Desmodesmus sp. enhanced its electron availability (redox potential) without affecting its viability, demonstrating a sustainable and efficient reduction of azo dye along with enhanced lipid production to be used for biodiesel generation. The current bionanocomposite, thus, offers an eco-friendly, reusable, economical and sustainable solution towards water remediation and subsequent biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents results on the research currently being carried out with the objective of developing new electrochemistry-based processes to produce renewable synthetic fuels from liquefied biomass. In the current research line, the gas mixtures obtained from the typical electrolysis are not separated into their components but rather are introduced into a reactor together with liquefied biomass, at atmospheric pressure and different temperatures, under acidified zeolite Y catalyst, to obtain synthesis gas. This gaseous mixture has several applications, like the production of synthetic 2nd generation biofuel (e. g., biomethane, biomethanol, bio-dimethyl ether, formic acid, etc.). The behaviour of operational parameters such as biomass content, temperature and the use of different amounts of acidified zeolite HY catalyst were investigated. In the performed tests, it was found that, in addition to the synthesis gas (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide), methane was also obtained. Therefore, this research is quite promising, and the most favourable results were obtained by carrying out the biomass test at 300 ◦C, together with 4% of acidified zeolite Y catalyst, which gives a methane volumetric concentration equal to 35%. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this work, corn cob was used as raw material to selectively produce acetonitrile via catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) in ammonia over Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst. A series of catalysts with different catalyst carriers (including HZSM-5, USY, MCM-41, HY, and γ-Al2O3) and active metals (including Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ca, Mg and Ga) were prepared and screened. The reaction conditions, such as temperature, ammonia flow rate and residence time were changed to investigate the effect on the product distribution and acetonitrile production. The results indicated that with the desired catalyst (2% Ga/HZSM-5) and optimal reaction conditions (Temperature 700 °C; ammonia flow rate 80 ml/min; residence time 2.4 s), the highest carbon yield of acetonitrile from corn cob with a value of 18.4% could be obtained, and the carbon selectivity in bio-oil was 83.5%. This study provides an economical and environmental-friendly method for the direct production of acetonitrile from abundant biomass. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aiming to investigate the synergistic effect of K+ and anions on the primary products of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) pyrolysis. MCC was impregnated with KHCO3, KCl, K2CO3 and KOH. The GC/MS and TG-FTIR were used to investigate the volatiles during pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, as well as the product distribution of pyrolytic bio-oil obtained from fixed bed reactor, respectively. It was found that the synergistic effect of K+ and anions could catalyze the pyrolytic decomposition of MCC through ring cleavage, catalytic cracking, cyclization and dehydration reactions, thus enhancing the liquid product yield and upgrading pyrolysis bio-oil. KHCO3 was the most effective in producing and upgrading bio-oil, the liquid yield increased from 44.29% (MCC) to 59.27% (0.10 KHCO3-MCC), and the yield of furanic compounds (5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural) and other O-containing compounds increased from 9.88% (MCC) to 19.84% (0.10 KHCO3-MCC), 18.54% (MCC) to 46.47% (0.10 KHCO3-MCC), respectively. The yield of levoglucosan decreased from 66.21% (MCC) to 22.95% (0.10 KHCO3-MCC). The formation of levoglucosan was inhibited through ring scission of pyran directly, leading to the cleavage of 1,4-glycosidic linkage, and low molecular weight compounds were produced as platform chemical for the production of a wide spectrum of sustainable bioproducts and biofuels. © 2019

AB  - Background: The bioethanol produced from biomass is a promising alternative fuel. The lignocellulose from marginal areas or wasteland could be a promising raw material for bioethanol production because it is present in large quantities, is cheap, renewable and has favorable environmental properties. Despite these advantages, lignocellulosic biomass is much more difficult to process than cereal grains, due to the need for intensive pretreatment and relatively large amounts of cellulases for efficient hydrolysis. Therefore, there is a need to develop an efficient and cost-effective method for the degradation and fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol. Results: The usefulness of lignocellulosic biomass from wasteland for the production of bioethanol using pretreatment with the aid of ionic liquids of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride was evaluated in this study. The pretreatment process, enzymatic hydrolysis and alcoholic fermentation lasted a total of 10 d. The largest amounts of bioethanol were obtained from biomass originating from agricultural wasteland, in which the dominant plant was fireweed (Chamaenerion angustifolium) and from the field where the common broom (Cytisus scoparius) was the dominant. Conclusions: The plants such as fireweed, common broom, hay and goldenrod may be useful for the production of liquid biofuels and it would be necessary in the further stage of research to establish and optimize the conditions for the technology of ethyl alcohol producing from these plant species. Enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass from agricultural wastelands results in a large increase in fermentable sugars, comparable to the enzymatic hydrolysis of rye, wheat, rice or maize straw.

AB  - Esterification of lauric acid with a new homogeneous acid catalyst, ammonium ferric sulphate (AFS), was used to get optimised reaction conditions in order to get the best methyl esters conversion by using the statistical modelling approach of response surface methodology (RSM). AFS acts as a new source of homogeneous acid catalyst and was optimised in this study to produce methyl ester. The Central Composite Design (CCD) and RSM were used to determine the relationship between reaction time, methanol to lauric acid molar ratio and catalyst loading to determine the optimum condition for the esterification process. This work reports the novel results of the optimum conditions obtained for esterification of lauric acid, which are 1.5 h of reaction time, 6:1 M ratio of methanol to lauric acid and 8 wt% loading of AFS catalyst to give the highest conversion rate of methyl esters at 99.8%. These reaction conditions were successfully applied and verified on the esterification of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) which demonstrated the ability of AFS to act as an acid catalyst in the esterification process with a conversion rate of 81.2% of methyl esters. Acid value of PFAD was also decreased from 185 to 41 mg KOH/g PFAD. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid increases in biodiesel use results in a surplus of its production by-product, glycerol, exceeding demand by traditional applications. In this study, Fe/C composites are prepared from glycerol-based precursors that include a dissolved iron salt via one-pot, two-stage pyrolysis. The first heating stage dehydrates, polymerizes, and carbonizes glycerol via acid-assisted pyrolysis while homogeneously dispersing a precipitated iron salt throughout the generated carbon matrix. The second stage develops porosity in the carbon support while reducing impregnated iron nanoparticles. Carbon supports with tailored physiochemical properties are generated by varying the dehydration acid (H2SO4 or H3PO4). Fe/C samples are predominantly mesoporous, with specific surface areas up to 560 m2/g and bulk iron contents up to 8.9 wt%, primarily as partially reduced Fe3O4. Cr(VI) removal follows the Freundlich model, reaching 107 mg/g at pH = 5. Mesoporous Fe/C composites are magnetic, allowing collection for reuse. After 4 use/recovery/reuse cycles, performance drops by &lt; 25% when the products are applied in an actual wastewater system. Overall, the magnetic mesoporous Fe/C composite materials are straightforward to produce from waste glycerol and exhibit potential for environmental application in aqueous systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, natural diatomaceous earth was utilized for the preparation of efficient lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) catalyst for biodiesel production via the transesterification of soybean oil and waste cooking oil. Lithium metasilicate was successfully synthesized from the hydrothermal reaction of natural diatomite in LiOH solutions at 150 °C for 24 h and, subsequently, by calcination at 500 °C for 6 h. Both fresh and spent Li2SiO3 catalysts were characterized by using XRD, 29Si NMR, BET, ICP-OES and acid-base titration. The acidity of the soybean oil and waste cooking oil used in this study was 0.54 mg KOH/g oil and 1.67 mg KOH/g oil, respectively. The yields of biodiesel from soybean oil reached ca. 80.3% in 1 h, respectively, in presence of catalyst at 3 wt% of oil used. Generally, more catalyst present would lead to a higher yield of biodiesel. With the mass loading of catalyst-to-oil at 0.05, the activation energy of the catalyzed transesterification using Li2SiO3 catalyst was 61.65 kJ/mol. The durability test of the Li2SiO3 catalysts was conducted in the same system. A high catalytic activity after being reused for 19 times was observed with a yield of biodiesel near ca. 85% after 4 h of the transesterification reaction at 60 °C. The deactivation mechanism of the Li2SiO3 catalyst was mainly attributed to the loss of surface base sites coincident with more Q4 and less Q2 Si atoms in catalyst after reaction, as found by 29Si NMR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel ionic liquid, chlorocholine hydroxide (CCH), was first synthesized and then stabilized on boehmite nanoparticles (BNPs-CCH). Variables such as weight percentage of catalyst, methanol to oil molar ratio and reaction time were evaluated to study the catalyst efficiency in the production of biodiesel from soybean oil and methanol. Results showed that the biodiesel yield maximum was obtained in 95.2% for optimal conditions of 11:1, 4.13 wt, 60 °C and 4.4 h for the molar ratio of methanol to oil, weight percentage of catalyst, temperature and reaction time, respectively. In addition, the prepared nanocatalyst was applied 5 times under optimal conditions in order to evaluate the catalyst efficiency. According to the results it still indicated as high efficiency as in the production of biodiesel. Therefore, the strength and durability of the resultant nanocatalyst were confirmed in this research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalyst plays a key role in the upgrading of fast pyrolysis bio-oil to advanced drop-in fuel, while the selectivity and deactivation of catalyst still remain the biggest challenge. In this study, three Ru catalysts with activated carbon, Al2O3 and ZSM-5 as supports were prepared and tested in bio-oil hydrotreating process. The physical properties and components of upgraded bio-oil were detected to identify the difference in catalytic performance of three catalysts. The results showed that furan, phenols and their derivatives in fast pyrolysis bio-oil could be hydrogenated to alkanes, alkenes and benzenes over Ru catalysts. The different components of oil phase over three catalysts may be resulted from the surface properties of three supports. Activated carbon supported Ru catalyst showed the best catalytic performance and was suggested to be the most promising catalyst for pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - Commercial palm oil-derived biodiesel fuels (palm BDFs) were thoroughly profiled based on the specifications of international fuel standards. Their main components were found to be fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) with different numbers of double bonds in the fatty acid tails in addition to small amounts of unreactive glycerides and impurities, the concentrations of which varied slightly among the regional producers in Thailand. The fuel properties of the as-received commercial palm BDFs met international fuel standards; unfortunately, the fuel degraded significantly over time, presumably due to the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (poly-FAME) and impurities. To prevent this degradation, the commercial palm BDFs were upgraded into partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters with outstanding oxidation stability (H-FAME, a new type of biodiesel fuel enriched in monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME)) over supported Pd catalysts with metallic Pd nanoparticles as the catalytically active sites in a batch-type glass reactor under mild conditions (80 °C and 0.5 MPa H2). In the upgrading process, the unwanted component poly-FAME, which had low oxidation stability, was selectively converted into the target component, mono-FAME with high oxidation stability. Although the impurities in the commercial palm BDFs poisoned the supported Pd catalysts, particularly the sulfur species, the homemade mesoporous silica-supported Pd catalyst with a high Pd dispersion of 47% gave higher activity and tolerance to the impurities in the synthesis of palm H-FAMEs than the commercial alumina-supported Pd catalyst, which had a low Pd dispersion of 16%. In the accelerated oxidation stability test, the B20 fuels formulated by blending petro-diesel with the palm H-FAMEs with enhanced oxidation stability produced almost no deposits or sludges, whereas the fuels formulated by blending petro-diesel with commercial palm BDFs were seriously degraded and acidified, and formed deposits and sludges. Moreover, the palm H-FAMEs could be further purified by selective removal of the monoglycerides (MG) and steryl glucosides (SG) through wintering and adsorption posttreatments, and were determined to be a reliable BDF source with high safety and security for use in high blend fuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Predicting enzyme function and enzyme subclasses is always a key objective in fields such as biotechnology, biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, physiology, and so on. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the largest information archive of biological macromolecular structures, with more than 150 000 entries for proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. Among these entries, there are more than 4000 proteins whose functions remain unknown because no detectable homology to proteins whose functions are known has been found. The problem is that our ability to isolate proteins and identify their sequences far exceeds our ability to assign them a defined function. As a result, there is a growing interest in this topic, and several methods have been developed to identify protein function based on these innovative approaches. In this work, we have applied perturbation theory to an original data set consisting of 19 187 enzymes representing all 59 subclasses present in the protein data bank. In addition, we developed a series of artificial neural network models able to predict enzyme-enzyme pairs of query-template sequences with accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity greater than 90% in both training and validation series. As a likely application of this methodology and to further validate our approach, we used our novel model to predict a set of enzymes belonging to the yeast Pichia stipites. This yeast has been widely studied because it is commonly present in nature and produces a high ethanol yield by converting lignocellulosic biomass into bioethanol through the xylose reductase enzyme. Using this premise, we tested our model on 222 enzymes including xylose reductase, that is, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of biomass into bioethanol. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Nigeria, being the world's largest importer of diesel-powered gen-sets, is expected to invest in bio-fuels in the future. Hence, it is important to examine the thermal properties and synergy of wastes for potential downstream resource utilization. In this study, thermal conversion as a route to reduce the exploding volume of wastes from sachet-water plastic (SWP) and oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) biomass was studied. Thermogravimetric (TGA) and subsequent differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used for the analysis. The effect of heating rate at 20 °C min-1 causes the increase of activation energy of the decomposition in the first-stage across all the blends (0.96 and 16.29 kJ mol-1). A similar phenomenon was seen when the heating rate was increased from 10 to 20 °C min-1 in the second-stage of decomposition. Overall, based on this study on the synergistic effects during the process, it can be deduced that co-pyrolysis can be an effective waste for energy platform. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Char is the solid by-product of biomass gasification. It usually represents a cost for plant owners, who have to dispose of it at a cost. However, its high carbon content and surface area could make it suitable for further applications, such as adsorption. In this work, we studied its potential for the adsorptive removal of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), a common pollutant present in the producer gas of gasification, as well as in biogas from anaerobic digestion. Different samples of char collected from commercial gasification plants in South Tyrol (Italy) were tested. The adsorption was reproduced in a lab-scale tubular fixed-bed reactor. The results highlight that all samples could capture hydrogen sulphide, showing different adsorption performances. The materials’ specific surface area and metal and oxygen content seem to affect the removal capacity. After these tests, we selected the best-performing char, and tested its adsorption performance in different operative conditions, i.e. at different inlet concentrations of H2S and temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the conversion of corn stalk to bio-oil by solvothermal liquefaction using ethanol as a solvent. Effect of reaction temperature, time and solvent to biomass ratio on the yield and the properties of bio-oil and biochar was studied. Analysis of corn stalk and bio-oil were done to determine the surface functional groups, existing bonds and molecular structure of specified compounds. Investigations were done to identify different compounds in bio-oil, the thermal stability, and weight loss kinetics of biochar. Study shows that percentage yield of bio-oil increases with increase in temperature and time, up to a specific level, and then starts declining. Further, the heating value, carbon content, and fixed carbon content of both bio-oil and biochar increased to 30.52, 22.8 MJ/kg, and 66.42 and 61.25%, 26.10 and 27.97% respectively from those (19.55 MJ/kg, 51.12 and 6.36%) of the corn stalk. This study suggests that the bio-oil contained mostly phenolic compounds and its derivatives. Two major DTG peaks were observed at 380 and 620 °C indicating the improvement in thermal stability of the biochar after solvolysis liquefaction process. Investigation results can be very useful in optimizing process parameters for solvothermal liquefaction. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A library of biofuel candidates, 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl) furans (BAMFs), was prepared from 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) by etherification in mild conditions using the acid catalyst Purolite. The purification of the BAMFs has been assessed, and gram-scale experiments have been carried out for two specific examples. The efficiency of this synthetic approach to BAMFs was ascribed to the BHMF-activated structure and its interaction with the aromatic acid catalyst. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Wood waste generated during the tree felling and processing is a rich, green, and renewable lignocellulosic biomass. However, an effective method to apply wood waste in anaerobic digestion is lacking. The high carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio and rich lignin content of wood waste are the major limiting factors for high biogas production. NaOH pre-treatment for lignocellulosic biomass is a promising approach to weaken the adverse effect of complex crystalline cellulosic structure on biogas production in anaerobic digestion, and the synergistic integration of lignocellulosic biomass with low C/N ratio biomass in anaerobic digestion is a logical option to balance the excessive C/N ratio. Here, we assessed the improvement of methane production of wood waste in anaerobic digestion by NaOH pretreatment, co-digestion technique, and their combination. The results showed that the methane yield of the single digestion of wood waste was increased by 38.5% after NaOH pretreatment compared with the untreated wood waste. The methane production of the co-digestion of wood waste and pig manure was higher than that of the single digestion of wood waste and had nonsignificant difference with the single-digestion of pig manure. The methane yield of the co-digestion of wood waste pretreated with NaOH and pig manure was increased by 75.8% than that of the untreated wood waste. The findings indicated that wood waste as a sustainable biomass source has considerable potential to achieve high biogas production in anaerobic digestion. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The Swietenia macrophylla wood used for the study was sun dried for about 48 h, pulverized using a hammer mill and then sieved to a particle size of about 425μm using Wiley milling machine. The prepared materials were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor in the temperature range from 425 to 500 °C. The product yields were collected at an interval of 25 °C. The maximum yield of bio-oil was recorded as 69.5wt.% at the pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C. The physicochemical properties and compositions of the feed materials and produced bio-oil were measured in order to quantify their potential for bio-energy use and industrial applications. The properties specifically measured include density, moisture content, ash content, pH, refractive index, cetane index, elemental composition, viscosity, and heating values. The ultimate analysis of the product showed that the contents of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur were 50.2%, 42.6%, 6.6%, &lt;0.4% and &lt;0.06% respectively. The viscosity, density, pH, moisture content, API gravity, ash content, HHV and LHV of bio-oil produced were found to be 4.6 mm2/s, 0.951 g/ml, 5.64, 21.4wt.%, 19.29, 0.15wt%, 29.52 MJ/kg and 28.08 MJ/kg respectively. These values were found to be in the ranges of values reported in the literature for bio-oils produced from biomass. The produced bio-oil had the much needed organic compounds typical of other woody biomass employed in commercial bio-oil manufacture. These compounds were classified into several groups; organic acids, ketones, phenols, alcohols, and aldehydes. The main components identified in the bio-oil are the aromatic and aliphatic compounds as well as carboxyl groups. The GCMS analysis of the product indicated the presence of 24 compounds which are useful as industrial chemicals and flammable gases: they include alkanes, alkenes, phenols, hydrogen, and levoglucosan. This study on bio-oil has demonstrated that mahogany wood is a useful biomass for the much sort potential fossil fuel substitute and finds vast application in the biofuel industry. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which can be synthesized from hexose sugars without rearrangement of their carbon framework, is a key platform chemical that is readily convertible into fuels and chemicals that are now derived from petroleum. Methods to convert glucose, which is readily accessible from cellulose, to HMF typically rely on toxic heavy metals or harsh acidic conditions and often give low yields or low selectivity. Here, we report on a mild, efficient, and metal-free process that uses an organocatalyst, 2-carboxyphenylboronic acid, along with small amounts of chloride ion to effect the selective transformation of glucose to HMF. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - MCM-41 is a mesoporous silicate with hydrophobic structure which is a good candidate as catalyst support in biodiesel production, with high specific area (more than 1100 m2/g) and high thermal stability. In this study the hydrothermal stability and acidic property of Al-MCM-41 were improved by addition of Ce element into its structure with various amounts of Si/Ce molar ratio. Then it was loaded by magnesium with two different procedures: customary impregnation and Sono-dispersion. The following techniques were utilized to characterize the synthesized nanocatalysts: EDX, FTIR, FESEM, DRS, BET and XRD. The catalytic performance of bifunctional nanocatalysts for biodiesel production from acidic oil was analysed, while four operational parameters were fixed as: catalyst charge equal to 5 wt%, reaction temperature equal to 70 °C, reaction duration equal to 6 h and methanol/oil molar ratio equal to 9. Generally, the obtained results revealed that the conversion and the quality of produced biodiesel were increased significantly by increasing Ce amount of catalysts up to Si/Ce = 25 and also the sonicated sample represented a better reusability compare to non-sonicated one. Among the prepared samples, Mg/ACM-U (Si/Ce = 25) achieved the maximum conversion and high reusability for biodiesel production reaction after fifth cycle. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Palm kernel shell was liquefied using sub- and supercritical water at 330–390 °C and 25 MPa for different reaction times. The overall kinetics of the liquefaction based on the conversion of biomass was analyzed using kinetic equation adopted from the literature, and the kinetic parameters were estimated from the evaluation of the kinetic equation. In this study, the rate constant (k) increased from 0.43 to 0.49 s −1 with reaction temperature from 330 to 390 °C. The relationship of rate constant (k) and temperature agreed reasonably well with the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy (E) and pre-exponential factor (A) values for the liquefaction process were estimated to be 6.70 kJ/mol and 1.65 s −1 , respectively. In addition, the experimental bio-oil yields with respect to reaction time were well-fitted using the modified Reverchon-Sesti Osseo equation. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - Background: The co-production of single cell oil (SCO) with value-added products could improve the economic viability of industrial SCO production. The newly isolated oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus podzolicus DSM 27192 was able to co-produce SCO intracellularly and gluconic acid (GA) extracellularly. In this study, the metabolic regulation of carbon distribution between SCO and GA through process optimization was comprehensively investigated. Results: The carbon flow distribution between SCO and GA was significantly influenced by the cultivation conditions, such as nitrogen sources, glucose concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration. It was found that organic nitrogen sources were beneficial for SCO accumulation, while GA production was decreased. Dissolved oxygen concentration (DOC) was found to enhance SCO accumulation, while high glucose concentration was more favorable for GA accumulation. Hence, a two-stage DOC or glucose concentration-controlled strategy was designed to improve cell growth and direct carbon distribution between SCO and GA. Moreover, C. podzolicus DSM 27192 could degrade its stored lipids to synthesize GA in the late stationary phase, although considerable amounts of glucose remained unconsumed in the culture medium, indicating the importance of fermentation time control in co-production systems. All these observations provide opportunity to favor either the production of SCO or GA or rather their simultaneous production. Conclusions: Co-production of SCO and GA by C. podzolicus DSM 27192 can improve the economical value for microbial lipid-derived biodiesel production. Moreover, the results of the proposed co-production strategy might give guidance for other co-production systems. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Renewable fuels are necessary energy sources as bio-based combustible fuels can be utilized in existing infrastructure while lowering the dependence on petrochemical based fuels. Current bio-fuels are predominantly crop-based which require tillable land, fertilizer, chemicals, irrigation, and fuel to cultivate the biomass feedstock. This study investigated the hydrothermal conversion of underutilized waste streams for biomass feedstock. This work blended municipal sewage sludge solids, poultry dissolved air flotation solids, and used cooking oil to form a waste slurry that was thermally converted to renewable fuel products. Blended waste processing provides flexibility and robustness in the future of bio-based fuels, and the authors believe this is the first documented hydrothermal processing of this specific blended waste. The waste slurry was heated under subcritical hydrothermal conditions, where solids were separated, and then heated in a second pressurized reaction to complete the thermal conversion process of wastes to recoverable products. Prior to processing, the blended waste slurry contained 8,490 kJ/kg (3,650 BTU/lb). Following processing, the recovered gas products contained 38,747 kJ/kg (16,658 BTU/lb) and 42% methane. The recovered renewable oil contained 40,468 kJ/kg (17,398 BTU/lb) and 0.012% ash. The effluent produced water was appraised for nutrient content and was found to contain 1,689 mg/L of nitrogen, which has potential as a liquid fertilizer product. The produced gas fuel, produced liquid fuel, solid char, and produced nutrient laden water were determined to be potential marketable products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bimetallic Pt-MoOx supported on ZrO2 exhibits higher catalytic activity than known catalysts for converting fatty acids into green diesel at as low as 200 °C. A change in selectivity from decarboxylation/decarbonylation to hydrodeoxygenation and enhancement in the deoxygenation activity of Pt were observed when MoOx was also present in the catalyst composition. In X-ray photoelectron spectra, Pt 4f lines of 4Pt-8MoOx/ZrO2 occurred at lower binding energies than those for 4Pt/ZrO2. Part of Mo was reduced from +6 to +5 oxidation state in the presence of Pt. There seems to exist some electronic interaction between the support and metal, making 4Pt-8MoOx/ZrO2 a highly efficient and selective deoxygenation catalyst. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Every year billions of tons of fish waste are produced by fish processing units. These wastes when dumped into the environment cause emissions which in turn degrade the land. An alternative solution for the problem involves their processing into biofuel, pharmacological components, fertilizer and fodder. Biofuel is a trending concept and an alternative for present day fuels. Biofuels are pollution free and thus are advantageous over current fuels. Biofuels are produced from organic waste, seaweed, and micro-algae. The current research on fish wastes for the production of biodiesel is mainly because of their nontoxic and biodegradable nature. Biodiesel produces less air toxins, CO2, hydrocarbons and other particulates when compared to the standard fuel or diesel. The conversion process involves extraction of fish oil from the waste of the fishing industry. The oil is cleaned and purified. With the addition of a catalyst, biodiesel and bio-gas are produced by transesterification and anaerobic digestion respectively. Various results such as Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) analysis, and best management practices (BMP) assay show the efficient conversion and working of biofuels. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the context of avoiding the use of non-renewable energy sources, employing lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol production remains a challenge. Cellulases play an important role in this scenario: they are some of the most important industrial enzymes that can hydrolyze lignocellulose. This study aims to improve on the characterization of a thermostable Aspergillus fumigatus endo-1,4-β-glucanase GH7 (Af-EGL7). To this end, Af-EGL7 was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were estimated and suggested a robust enzyme. The recombinant protein was highly stable within an extreme pH range (3.0-8.0) and was highly thermostable at 55 °C for 72 h. Low Cu2+ concentrations (0.1-1.0 mM) stimulated Af-EGL7 activity up to 117%. Af-EGL7 was tolerant to inhibition by products, such as glucose and cellobiose. Glucose at 50 mM did not inhibit Af-EGL7 activity, whereas 50 mM cellobiose inhibited Af-EGL7 activity by just 35%. Additionally, the Celluclast® 1.5L cocktail supplemented with Af-EGL7 provided improved hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse “in natura”, sugarcane exploded bagasse (SEB), corncob, rice straw, and bean straw. In conclusion, the novel characterization of Af-EGL7 conducted in this study highlights the extraordinary properties that make Af-EGL7 a promising candidate for industrial applications. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, biofuels production through thermal and co-pyrolysis of rubber seed cake (RSC) with waste polystyrene (PS) using semi-batch reactor was investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of RSC at heating rate of 10 °C/min showed that R50 value as 1.87%/min at about 361.84 °C. Effects of pyrolysis temperature (350 °C – 600 °C) and heating rate (10 °C/min–40 °C/min) on product distribution (liquid, gas and bio-char) were considered. During thermal decomposition of RSC, the temperature significantly affected the yield and properties of the products. The maximum yield of RSC pyrolytic bio-oil (21.58 vol/wt%), gas (25.58 wt%) and, carbon-rich RSC bio-char (26.18 wt%) were obtained at 500 °C temperature for heating rate of 20 °C/min. Furthermore, the bio-oil yield and its energy content were enhanced from 21.58 vol/wt% to 48.7 vol/wt% and 32.25 MJ/kg to 37.48 MJ/kg through co-pyrolysis of RSC (50 wt%) with waste polystyrene (50 wt%). Value-added organic compounds such as phenolic, amide, creosol, esters, 1-dodecyne and styrene compounds were identified in bio-oil sample using gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). In depth analysis of physico-chemical-thermal properties of RSC and obtained products (bio-oil and bio-char) using various analytical techniques suggested that RSC with WPS can be considered as a suitable feedstock for the production of value added chemicals including fuel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Developing a simple and efficient process for the conversion of biomass to petrol, diesel and jet fuels are our urgent mission due to the limitation of fossil fuels. Biobutanol is an important biomass-derived biofuel that can be converted to longer-chain petrol-range, diesel-range and jet-range fuels. Basing on the obtained concentrated acetone-1-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation broth through a prefractionator, we report a palladium-catalysed alkylation of acetone with ethanol and 1-butanol to more efficiently produce C5–C11 fuel precursors in a reactor, where all the precursors and reactants were separated simultaneously by the salting-out effect of K3PO4. The precursors include ketones and a small amount of alcohols that can be reduced to alkanes for use as liquid transportation fuels. Tuning the reaction conditions can obtain different proportions of C5–C7 products (monoalkylation) and C9–C11 products (double alkylation) and the overall product contents accounted for up to 82 wt%. More than 99.5% of water from the concentrated ABE fermentation broth was removed by the salting-out effect of K3PO4. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work explores the production of isopropyl levulinate from furfural by a two-step microwave assisted cascade process. Furfural is a versatile biomass-derived industrial feedstock with high annual production volume. Alkyl levulinates are promising bio-based molecules with several applications in many sectors, in particular, as biofuels, blended with transportation fuels including biodiesel, these compounds can significantly reduce the formation of soot in engines. Thus, in the first step, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was studied employing a simply “ad hoc” synthesized magnetically recoverable Cu catalyst and 2-propanol as H-donor. Subsequently, the alcoholysis of the previously obtained liquors rich in furfuryl alcohol or of neat furfuryl alcohol solutions to isopropyl levulinate was investigated using commercial solid acid catalysts such as niobium phosphate and Amberlyst sulfonic resins (A15 and A70). The cascade process resulted feasible leading to good furfuryl alcohol yields in the transfer hydrogenation process with Cu-Fe3O4 magnetic catalyst using much lower Cu to furfural molar ratios than commonly reported. The subsequent alcoholysis step of furfuryl alcohol-rich liquors was highly efficient with A70 resin even in presence of unreacted furfural from the first step. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, potassium iodide (KI) and graphene oxide (GO) were utilized to promote the selectivity of photocatalytic process for alkali lignin oxidation over ZnO. Different concertation of GO was added during the microwave synthesis procedure of ZnO, and the characterization results revealed that graphene can shift the conduction band to more reducing potential, resulting to higher production of superoxide anion radicals (O2[rad]−) compared to [rad]OH. Response Surface Methodology revealed the most suitable interaction among loading of GO, KI and irradiation time on lignin and total phenolic compound (TPC) degradation. Specifically, the optimal conditions (i.e. maximum lignin (52%) and minimum TPC (55%) degradation) were at [KI] = 0.64 mM; GO content into ZnO 1.2 mg/mL; 240 min of irradiation time. The results showed that higher addition of graphene into structure of ZnO could preserve more phenolics from degradation due to less production of [rad]OH. Furthermore, the addition of KI at optimized conditions could enhance the selectivity of degradation of lignin and phenolics via producing I[rad] radicals and quenching the excess amount of generated [rad]OH, respectively. The lower generation of [rad]OH at optimized conditions was quantitatively confirmed by a photoluminescence simplified technique. In addition, the effect of the photocatalytic process on substrate's anaerobic degradability was examined in order to evaluate the suitability of the pretreated solution for energy recovery. Indeed, besides the higher TPC concentration, the biogas production of treated straw at optimized conditions was increased by 35% compared to the untreated sample. © 2018

AB  - Increased use of 1st and 2nd generation biofuels raises concerns about health effects of new emissions. We analyzed cellular and molecular lung effects in Fisher 344 rats exposed to diesel engine exhaust emissions (DEE) from a Euro 5-classified diesel engine running on B7: petrodiesel fuel containing 7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), or SHB20 (synthetic hydrocarbon biofuel): petrodiesel fuel containing 7% FAME and 13% hydrogenated vegetable oil. The Fisher 344 rats were exposed for 7 consecutive days (6 h/day) or 28 days (6 h/day, 5 days/week), both with and without diesel particle filter (DPF) treatment of the exhaust in whole body exposure chambers (n = 7/treatment). Histological analysis and analysis of cytokines and immune cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) did not reveal adverse pulmonary effects after exposure to DEE from B7 or SHB20 fuel. Significantly different gene expression levels for B7 compared to SHB20 indicate disturbed redox signaling (Cat, Hmox1), beta-adrenergic signaling (Adrb2) and xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp1a1). Exhaust filtration induced higher expression of redox genes (Cat, Gpx2) and the chemokine gene Cxcl7 compared to non-filtered exhaust. Exposure time (7 versus 28 days) also resulted in different patterns of lung gene expression. No genotoxic effects in the lungs were observed. Overall, exposure to B7 or SHB20 emissions suggests only minor effects in the lungs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work is a study of tribo-corrosion and engine characteristics of Aegle Marmelos Correa biodiesel and its diesel blends. The tribology results revealed that B50 showed the lowest steady-state coefficient of friction (SSCOF) amongst all the other blends. SSCOF of B100 is 23.27% more than B50. Similarly, SSCOF of B90, B60, B20, B10, and diesel are 19%, 8%, 17.23%, 31.9% and 40.11% greater than the SSCOF of B50 respectively. Wear scar diameter (WSD) results also showed that B50, B60, B90, and B100 have lower WSD of around 0.6 mm. Diesel showed the highest WSD of 0.8 mm. Flash temperature parameter (FTP) is inversely related to WSD, and thus B50, B60, B90, and B100 exhibited higher FTP of around 80. On evaluating the corrosion characteristics, B50 exhibited lesser corrosion inducing capability compared to all the other blends. Experimental investigation of the engine showed that B100 yielded lesser thermal efficiency and higher specific fuel consumption than diesel. The CO, HC, NO, and smoke emissions were minimum for B100 when compared to diesel. Finally, all the results revealed that B100 is the ideal blend that can perform efficiently and be a sustainable energy source for diesel engines. © 2019

AB  - On-line chemical characterization of real-world particle emissions from 13 transit buses was performed using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) equipped with a filter inlet for gases and aerosols (FIGAERO). In addition to the fresh emissions the emissions were artificially aged using a potential aerosol mass reactor (Go:PAM). The buses studied were running on different fuel types (diesel, compressed natural gas, and rapeseed methyl ester) and exhaust after-treatment systems (selective catalytic reduction (SCR), exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and a three-way catalyst). When evaluating emissions from passing exhaust plumes using the FIGAERO ToF-CIMS, two technical features were highlighted from this work, the use of high mass calibrants and the factor enhancement method to be able to filter important compounds from mass spectra including hundreds of species. Here, acetate was used as the reagent ion to enable detection of highly oxygenated species in the exhaust particle emissions with potential high toxicity and/or secondary organic aerosol formation (SOA) potential. The acetate ionization scheme accounted for 4% to 46% of the total emitted particulate mass through identification of 61 species in the spectra. For aged emission the various fuel types provided overlapping species that could explain up to 19% of the aged emissions. This is hypothesized to come from the oxidation of engine lubrication oil, thus a common source for various fuels which was further supported by laboratory measurements. Specific markers from the SCR technology, such as urea oxidation products and further byproducts from hydrolysis were identified and attributed to reactions of isocyanic acid.

AB  - To make a beer there are four essential ingredients needed: water, malt, hops, and yeast. After brewing process, the main wastes are spent grains. These are often used as additions to fodders in animal husbandry. This study presents preliminary results of an investigation aiming to determine the feasibility of an alternative use of spent grains as a potential source of solid fuel. This source of energy could make breweries partly sustainable in terms of their energy supply. Such an approach may be feasible especially in large scale industrial breweries. This preliminary study presents encouraging results, showing improvements in terms of the fuel properties of the spent grain after its valorization through hydrothermal carbonization. Moreover, qualitative GC-MS analysis also indicates potential feasibility of the liquid byproduct of the hydrothermal carbonization of spent grain for biogas production. Results of proximate, ultimate, and DTG analyses show that hydrothermal carbonization of spent grain could improve its fuel properties and make it an especially suitable feedstock for fast pyrolysis and gasification. Improvement of HHV is also an improvement in terms of combustion. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Furfural has been considered a potential feedstock of biofuels and biopolymers. As a waste-to-resource opportunity, this study focused on the valorization of goat excreta to obtain furfural and recover energy in the form of pyrolytic gas that helps increase thermochemical process efficiency. Three feedstocks (goat excreta, rice straw, and corncob) were compared to verify whether goat excreta is a promising feedstock of furfural. The furfural concentration from goat excreta (3.2 g L -1 ) via acid-catalyzed dehydration was comparable to that from rice straw or corncob. To maximize energy recovery from goat excreta via pyrolysis, CO 2 was employed as a reactive medium (compared with typical pyrolysis with N 2 ). This study experimentally proved that CO 2 plays a pivotal role in shifting carbon distribution from pyrolytic oil to pyrolytic gas, thereby enhancing the generation of CO (the main component of pyrolytic gas). Based on the experimental results, it is suggested that goat excreta can be a promising initial feedstock for the production of furfural and energy recovery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The production of biodiesel using alternative feedstocks and green technologies has attracted increasing interest of researchers worldwide. In this study, the production of biodiesel through microwave-assisted esterification of Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) was studied experimentally as well by means of a simulation. The complex permittivities of PFAD and biodiesel were experimentally measured for the temperature range 25–120 °C. At the microwave frequency of 2.45 GHz, the dielectric properties of PFAD and its biodiesel were found to be 2.78–0.17j and 3.26–0.21j respectively. An optimal biodiesel yield (91.88%) was reported at 15 min of 300 W microwave irradiation, for a 1:9 PFAD to methanol ratio catalysed by sulfuric acid. The study revealed that microwave-assisted PFAD esterification has a second order reaction kinetics, with a frequency factor of 3.65 × 10−8 M−1 s−1 and an activation energy of −36 kJ. For the first time, a three-dimensional multi-physics model was developed for the microwave-assisted PFAD esterification process in this study. The simulated model included the effects of electromagnetic propagation, heat transfer, fluid flow, and chemical species conservation. The numerical predictions were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The study also found that the fluid flow and vaporisation of methanol and water are important for good model prediction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapors is an effective utilization technology of biomass energy. Based on the disadvantages of commonly used reactors, the V-shaped downer reactors were designed to increase gas-solid two-phase turbulent intensity, contact frequency and then increase the catalytic efficiency in short residence time. The catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapors in V-shaped downer reactors in terms of hydrodynamics, chemical reaction and residence time distribution were analyzed by CFD simulation and experiment. The results indicate that the solid concentration gradient decreases while flowing down. The overall mass fraction of the bio-oil vapors is around 50%. The mean residence time of catalysts in the V-shaped reactor is 2.0 s–3.0 s. The effects on product yield and residence time distribution were investigated for optimizing product selectivity and the performance of catalysts. In this paper the optimal flow rates of gas and catalysts are vg = 1.2 m s−1, vs = 0.4 m s−1. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report a prototype air-breathing carbon cloth-based electrode that was fabricated starting from a commercially available screen-printed electrode equipped with a transparent ITO working electrode (DropSens, ref. ITO10). The fabrication of the air-breathing electrodes is straightforward, shows satisfactory reproducibility and a good electrochemical response as evaluated by means of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3−/4− voltammetry. The gas-diffusion electrodes were successfully modified with the O 2 reducing enzyme bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria in a direct electron transfer regime. The enzyme modified electrodes showed a remarkable high current density for O 2 reduction in passive air-breathing mode of up to 5 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the enzyme modified electrodes were applied as O 2 reducing biocathodes in a glucose/air enzymatic biofuel cell in combination with a high current density glucose oxidase/redox polymer bioanode. The biofuel cell provides a high maximum power density of (0.34±0.02) mW cm −2 at 0.25 V. The straightforward design, low cost and the high reproducibility of these electrodes are considered as basis for standardized measurements under gas-breathing conditions and for high throughput screening of gas converting (bio-)catalysts. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In this work, activities of modified dolomite catalysts using calcium acetate in the heterogeneously catalyzed transesterification of microalgae oil with methanol were investigated. Modified catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation method and calcined 850°C for 2 h. Reaction conditions were examined as the catalyst type, amount of catalyst, methanol/microalgae oil molar ratio, and reusability of the catalyst using the dolomite and modified dolomite catalysts. When investigated reusability of the modified dolomite catalyst in the transesterification of microalgae oil with methanol, catalyst was reused three times with a small loss of activity. After fourth run, reused catalyst was calcined again and got similar activity to the first run. The highest fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield of 90% was obtained when the reaction was performed with methanol/microalgae oil molar ratio of 6:1, catalyst amount of 3%, and reaction temperature at 65°C for 3 h by using the 30% CaO/dolomite catalyst. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study investigates technoeconomic performance of standalone biorefinery concepts that utilize hybrid organic solvent and steam explosion pretreatment technique. The assessments were made based on a mathematical process model developed in UniSim Design software using inhouse experimental data. The work was motivated by successful experimental applications of the hybrid pretreatment technique on lignocellulosic feedstocks that demonstrated high fractionation efficiency into a cellulose-rich, a hemicellulose-rich and lignin streams. For the biorefinery concepts studied here, the targeted final products were ethanol, organosolv lignin and hemicellulose syrup. Minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) and Internal rate of return (IRR) were evaluated as economic indicators of the investigated biorefinery concepts. Depending on the configuration, and allocating all costs to ethanol, MESP in the range 0.53-0.95 €/L were required for the biorefinery concepts to break even. Under the assumed ethanol reference price of 0.55 €/L, the corresponding IRR were found to be in the range -1.75-10.7%. Hemicellulose degradation and high steam demand identified as major sources of inefficiencies for the process and economic performance, respectively. Sensitivity of MESP and IRR towards the most influential technical, economic and market parameters performed. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass catalytic pyrolysis has been investigated using wheat straw, previously subjected to acid washing to remove the mineral matter, as raw material with the goal of producing upgraded bio-oils with potential applications as liquid biofuels or as a source of bio-based chemicals. The catalyst employed consisted in zeolite ZSM-5 having nanocrystalline properties to enhance the accessibility towards the active sites, which was partially ion exchanged with K+ cations (KH-ZSM-5). Characterisation of this catalyst denoted that, although most of the strong acid sites were removed during the ion exchange treatment, it possesses a well-balanced combination of acid and basic properties. The biomass catalytic pyrolysis tests were performed in a two-step (thermal/catalytic) fixed bed reactor operating with temperatures of 550 and 450 °C, respectively, and different catalyst to biomass ratios (C/B). Compared with the parent acidic zeolite, the KH-ZSM-5 sample exhibited lower activity for the conversion and upgrading of the bio-oil. However, the removal of most of the strong acid sites by ion exchange with K+ resulted in a more efficient deoxygenation pathway, with lower contribution of decarbonylation. Moreover, the KH-ZSM-5 catalyst showed a reduced extension of cracking reaction into gases and of coke formation, whereas it promoted the conversion of the oligomeric species present in the bio-oil. As a consequence, the KH-ZSM-5 sample led to a more favourable relationship between the bio-oil oxygen content and the bio-oil yield when varying the C/B ratio in respect to the parent H-ZSM-5 zeolite. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - For the production of sustainable biofuels from lipid biomass it is essential to develop non-noble metal catalysts with high conversion and selectivity under inert gas atmospheres. Herein, we report a novel cobalt-based catalyst supported on zeolite NaX via ion-exchange synthesis. The resultant bifunctional cobalt-based NaX zeolite catalyst displayed high conversion of stearic acid to liquid fuels. In addition, the effect of reaction temperature and catalyst loading was studied to evaluate the order of reaction and activation energy. Decarboxylation and decarbonylation were the dominant deoxygenation pathways. Stearic acid was successfully deoxygenated in N2 atmospheres using Co/NaX catalysts with a conversion as high as 83.7% and a yield to heptadecane up to ~28%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher reaction temperatures resulted in competing pathways of decarboxylation and decarbonylation. Finally, the fresh and recycled catalysts were characterized showing modest recyclability with a ~12.5% loss in catalytic activity. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Alloying transition metals, such as Mo, into BiVO4 has emerged as the primary mechanism for improving carrier transport in this photoanode for solar fuels production. The present work establishes the generality of improving photoelectrochemical performance through co-alloying with a transition metal electron donor and a structure-modulating rare earth. Further improvement for all such alloys is obtained by annealing the oxide materials in H2, ultimately producing photoanodes with above 3 mA cm-2 photocurrent density under AM 1.5G illumination, in the top tier of compact BiVO4 films. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Two perennial tree species Pachira aquatica Aubl (PA) and Magonia pubescens A St-Hil (MP), both being endemic to Brazil, were studied as potential sources for biofuels production. The main benefits of those sources is the lack of competition with the food market and the preservation of native vegetation. The chemical composition and the physical-chemical properties of the oils extracted from both species were evaluated. Furthermore, their oils were processed to produce biofuels using two approaches: obtaining mixtures of methyl fatty acid esters (biodiesel) and mixtures of hydrocarbons (bio-oil). The physical-chemical properties of the biodiesels obtained from PA and MP are compatible with diesel engines. The bio-oils obtained from both sources, despite not being completely deoxygenated, displayed physical-chemical properties acceptable for diesel engines fuel. The possibility of obtaining two kinds of fuels with suitable properties is a good sign for the exploration of those trees. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fast pyrolysis of biomass with catalysts is a promising route for producing upgraded bio-oil as an alternative energy source. A CaO catalyst prepared from organic calcium compounds (Org-CaO) was first used to upgrade the pyrolysis oil of Jatropha curcas seeds in situ. Calcium d-gluconate monohydrate, calcium citrate tetrahydrate, and calcium acetate hydrate were employed as the organic precursors in this work. The results showed that Org-CaO exhibited better deoxygenation ability to produce more hydrocarbons than conventional CaO derived from Ca(OH) 2 (CH-CaO). Acids accounted for 83% of the oxygenated compounds in the raw bio-oil and were almost completely removed via CaO. For bio-oil catalyzed by Org-CaO, the fraction of esters in the oxygenated compounds was only ∼9%, which was 20% less than that in CH-CaO bio-oil. The relative content of ketones and alcohols in Org-CaO bio-oil increased by 16% versus that in CH-CaO bio-oil. Org-CaO exhibited a remarkably larger pore size and much smaller particle sizes. Thus, Org-CaO entered into the fuel through the pore channels, and this promoted the formation of chemical crosslinking points between CaO and oxygenated groups. In addition, the basicity and the amount of basic sites for Org-CaO increased versus CH-CaO. Thus, the adsorption forms of oxygen-containing groups in the bio-oil on the basic sites of CaO changed: the carboxyl groups were removed from the acids and were absorbed in a stable form of unidentate carbonate on oxygen vacancies (O 2- ). The stable form was bidentate carbonate on Ca 2+ -O 2- . In addition, oxygen vacancies on Org-CaO extracted more hydroxyl groups from the acids, resulting in dehydroxylation of acids to form ketones and alcohols.

AB  - The effects of traditional biodiesel (fatty acid methyl-esters, FAME) and a hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) were comprehensively investigated on a production Euro 6 diesel car, including fuel injection rate and timing, combustion analysis, emissions of regulated and unregulated pollutants, and regeneration of the diesel particle filter. The use of both biofuels is a part of the efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and health-relevant pollutants and to improve energy security and sustainability. HVO, albeit more expensive, offers benefits relative to FAME in terms of oxidation stability, injector fouling, energy content and cetane number. The car was fitted with an on-board instrumentation and subjected to a range of driving cycles on a chassis dynamometer. The fuel consumption calculated from instantaneous emissions data based on exhaust gas composition measured by an on-board FTIR and calculated exhaust flow matched directly measured fuel consumption within several percent on all fuels; differences in the consumption among the fuels correspond to different heating values. The combustion onset and maximum heat release rate were comparable for diesel and FAME but were advanced on HVO due to its higher cetane number, causing, at times, multiple distinct heat release peaks, suggesting that optimization of fuel injection timing for HVO might be beneficial. Emissions of methane and ammonia were negligible, of N2O were measurable and slightly lower for HVO than for other fuels, of formaldehyde were limited to cold engine accelerations and highest for FAME and negligible for HVO, of NO and NO2 were high on all fuels during all operating conditions except for the type approval test. The results confirm several relative advantages of HVO over RME, with penetration into engine lubricating oil during particle filter regeneration to be further investigated. The effects of HVO lubricity and other long-term effects were not evaluated here. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, a theoretical investigation of thermochemistry and kinetics of the oxidation of bifunctional 2-Methoxyethanol (2ME) biofuel using methyl radical was introduced. Potential-energy surface for various channels for the oxidation of 2ME was studied at density function theory (M06-2X) and ab initio CBS-QB3 levels of theory. H-atom abstraction reactions, which are essential processes occurring in the initial stages of the combustion or oxidation of organic compounds, from different sites of 2ME were examined. A similar study was conducted for the isoelectronic n-butanol to highlight the consequences of replacing the ϒ CH2 group by an oxygen atom on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the oxidation processes. Rate coefficients were calculated from the transition state theory. Our calculations show that energy barriers for n-butanol oxidation increase in the order of α ‹ O ‹ ϒ ‹ β ‹ ξ, which are consistent with previous data. However, for 2ME the energy barriers increase in the order α ‹ β ‹ ξ ‹ O. At elevated temperatures, a slightly high total abstraction rate is observed for the bifunctional 2ME (4 abstraction positions) over n-butanol (5 abstraction positions). © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, a 20-L spherical explosion vessel, hot plate apparatus, Godbert-Greenwald furnace apparatus, and TG-FTIR were used to investigate the explosion and combustion characteristics of three biomass dusts: dalbergia cochinchinensis (DC), pine sawdust (PS), and cupressus funebris (CF). DC with lower minimum explosible concentration (70–80 g/m3), larger maximum explosion pressure (0.742 MPa) and larger maximum explosion pressure rise rate (80.14 MPa/s) had the greatest explosion hazard in three biomass dusts. The apparent activation energy of DC and CF were lower than that of PS, and the main gas products of three samples included CO2, CO, CH3COOH, and H2O. The volatile matter content of DC characterized by the weight loss and the number of gas products of combustion process was higher than those of PS and CF, showing that the volatile matter content of biomass dust was one of the main factors affecting combustion and explosion hazard. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pretreatment is a vital process for efficient saccharification and utilization of lignocellulose. In this study, crude glycerol derived from biodiesel production was used for pretreatment to facilitate selective saccharification via fast pyrolysis. Due to the efficient removal of alkali and alkaline earth metals (>95.0%) and lignin (79.4%) by crude glycerol pretreatment, the yield of levoglucosan was evaluated to 25.2% as compared to those from pure glycerol pretreated (14.4%) and untreated sugarcane bagasse (8.4%). Meanwhile, the production of inhibitors (e.g. acetic acid, phenol) to biocatalysts was also obviously inhibited from crude glycerol pretreated biomass. Consequently, this work provided a cost-effective and eco-friendly pretreatment mode, which could not only make full utilization of crude glycerol, but also improve the fermentability of lignocellulosic pyrolysate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Department of Energy “Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines” initiative aims to simultaneously develop novel high-performance fuels with advanced engine designs to reduce petroleum consumption. To achieve commercialization, advanced engines running on alternative fuels still must meet emissions regulations. Warm three-way catalysts (TWC) are very effective at meeting the stringent emissions regulations on pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane organic gases (NMOG) and carbon monoxide (CO) from gasoline-fueled spark-ignition (SI) engines operating under stoichiometric conditions; thus, most SI engine emissions occur during cold-start, when the TWC has not yet achieved light-off. In the current study, the light-off behavior of novel high-performance fuel candidates has been investigated on a hydrothermally-aged commercial TWC using a synthetic engine-exhaust flow reactor system according to industry guidelines. Over 30 potential fuel components were examined in this study, including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, esters, aromatic ethers, and non-oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Short-chain acyclic oxygenates, including alcohols, ketones, and esters, tended to light off at relatively low temperatures, while alkenes, aromatics, and cyclic oxygenates tended to light off at relatively high temperatures. The light-off behavior of alkanes and alkenes depended strongly on their size and structure. In terms of the influence on CO light-off on the TWC, the fuels fell into two distinct categories: (i) non-inhibiting species including C2-C3 alcohols, alkanes, acyclic ketones, and esters; and (ii) inhibiting species including alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic oxygenates, and C4 alcohols. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oxygenated organic compounds derived from biomass (biofuel) are a promising alternative renewable energy resource. Alcohols are widely used as biofuels, but studies on bifunctional alcohols are still limited. This work investigates the unimolecular thermal degradation of 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) using DFT/BMK and ab initio (CBS-QB3 and G3) methods. Enthalpies of the formation of 2ME and its decomposition species have been calculated. Conventional transition state theory has been used to estimate the rate constant of the pyrolysis of 2ME over a temperature range of 298–2000 K. Production of methoxyethene via 1,3-H atom transfer represents the most kinetically favored path in the course of 2ME pyrolysis at room temperature and requires less energy than the weakest C α − C β simple bond fission. Thermodynamically, the most preferred channel is methane and glycoladhyde formation. A ninefold frequency factor gives a superiority of the C α − C β bond breaking over the C γ − O β bond fission despite comparable activation energies of these two processes. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - A steam explosion (SE) process was evaluated as a pretreatment method to achieve simultaneously the pretreatment and the decontamination of trace elements (TE) from woody biomass for bioethanol applications. The willow biomass used in this study was obtained from short rotation coppice phyto-managed plots harvested on a TE-contaminated soils (Zn, Mn). The inﬂuence of the SE reaction severity on the composition of the cellulosic pulp and on the TE extraction in the water effluent was investigated. SE performed at 220 °C after a 2% sulfuric acid presoaking allowed an extraction of ̴ 80% of Mn and Zn in the water effluent. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting pulps was examined. A cellulose-to-glucose conversion of ˜80% was obtained after 75 h of incubation of the pulp obtained after a SE treatment performed at 180 °C. The subsequent fermentation into ethanol using Saccharomyces cerevisiae was successfully performed. No significant influence of TEs on the action of the biocatalysts (enzymes and yeast) was observed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The application of lipases in liquid formulation instead of immobilized forms in the enzymatic biodiesel synthesis can make the process cost-efficient, more competitive, and sustainable. However, despite the benefits, the long reaction times required to achieve satisfactory yields is still a drawback of this biotechnological process. In this sense, employing the novel low-cost soluble NS40116 lipase, this paper proposes an innovative two-step hydroesterification reaction (TSHR) system as a technique of improving the reaction rate of an enzymatic biodiesel production. With the employment of two central composite statistical design to optimize the parameters of each of the reactions involved, the influence of the parameters “water concentration added to the reaction,” “methanol-to-oil molar ratio,” and “lipase load” on the process yield, besides the acid value of the samples, was investigated. After only 8 h of reaction, the highest fatty acid methyl ester yield reached was 97.1% with an acid value of 4.62 mg KOH g−1 utilizing a total of 8 wt% water, methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6.3:1, and 0.70 wt% of lipase. Furthermore, the statistical models for both reactions indicated to be significant with 95% of reliability. Considering that the papers published using soluble lipases in a one-step batch process normally reach similar yields to those obtained in this research after 16 h to 24 h of reaction, the proposed system demonstrated to be a promising option of process configuration for the enzymatic production of biodiesel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) in the beverage industry is a proven treatment technology. But adding dissolved organic matter to AD can increase the on-site output of renewable energy. In the tequila industry such waste-derived organic matter can be obtained from semisolid agave bagasse submitted to steam explosion as pretreatment. Vapor at pressure &lt;1.0 MPa is commonly available so that steam explosion can be integrated into extant production schemes. This study investigates the efficiency of agave bagasse hydrolyzation via steam explosion (applying severity factors between 2.4 and 3.7 with 0.98 MPa maximum pressure) as well as the efficiency of the bio-conversion in anaerobic batch assays. The best steam explosion yield was 14.3 ± 0.1 gCOD 100 g−1 (0.98 MPa vapor pressure during 22 min followed by fast pressure release). The average biochemical methane potential (BMP) was 290 mLN gCOD -1 with 74% of the biogas released within seven days. © 2019

AB  - The performance of lipase NS 40116, a novel and promising soluble enzyme obtained from modified Thermomyces lanuginosus microorganism, was investigated in the production of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters—FAME) by hydroesterification. In order to investigate the potential of the biocatalyst in its soluble form, this work reports the effect of water content and enzyme load, as well as the recovery and reuse of the biocatalyst. A FAME yield of 94.30% after 12 h was achieved at 35 °C by combining 0.50 wt% of lipase, 15 wt% of water, and a methanol:oil molar ratio of 4.5:1. The analysis of the time course reaction suggests that the triacylglycerides (TAGs) are hydrolyzed by the enzyme in a first step, generating free fatty acids (FFAs), followed by the esterification of these FFAs into FAME. In relation to the reusability assays, the lipase kept approximately 90% of its catalytic activity after five cycles of reuse. In this context, the findings of this study demonstrate that lipase NS 40116 can efficiently catalyze hydroesterification reactions under mild conditions, arising as a competitive alternative for biodiesel synthesis. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, waste clay oil was used as raw material to produce high quality biofuel via catalytic pyrolysis. The thermal decomposition and pyrolysis of clay oil were studied; whereas the effects of pyrolysis temperature, carrier gas flow rate, catalytic mode and catalyst to clay oil ratio on bio-oil compositions were investigated systematically. In addition, two kinds of catalyst (MCM-41 and CaO) were also used to catalyze pyrolysis of clay oil and their catalytic effects were also compared. The optimal conditions for producing high quality biofuel were under ex situ catalytic mode, carrier gas rate of 0.1 N L/min, pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C and the catalyst ratio of 1/5. Compared to MCM-41, CaO promoted the decarboxylation of waste clay oil and improved the quality of bio-oil effectively. The acid value of CaO catalytic bio-oil was much lower than that of non-catalytic bio-oil as well as that the calorific value is much higher than that of non-catalytic bio-oil and bio-diesel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The feedstock has been the most significant issue for promoting a sustainable and economical renewable aviation fuel in Taiwan. In this study, the potential feedstocks available for producing hydro-processed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel locally in Taiwan were evaluated economically through the process simulation and techno-economic analysis. The productivities, H2 consumptions, product distributions and properties of the produced fuel, which strongly depend on the fatty acid content within the oil/fat feedstocks, were demonstrated and discussed. The baseline economics, sensitivity analyses and pioneer plant analyses were also conducted in accordance with the simulation results. The minimum aviation fuel selling prices (MAFPs) of all feedstocks were calculated ranging from $0.91/L∼ $2.74/L. The feedstock costs, prices of hydrogen, prices of hydro-processing catalyst and plant capacities have influences on the selling prices of renewable aviation fuel by 54%, 18%, 12% and 11%, respectively. Furthermore, although the greases have the most economical benefits among the selected feedstocks, the feedstock pretreatment processes lead to the complexity of the production and result in higher pioneer plant costs compared to the ones of plant oils. This study provides the suggestions for the government to locally select an appropriate HRJ feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To improve jet biofuel quality with increased iso-alkane content, a bi-functional catalyst with strong acidity was proposed to promote hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking of microalgae biodiesel through loading heteropoly acid H3PW12O40 (HPW) on Ni-based hierarchical mesoporous zeolite Y (meso-Y). It was found by quantum chemistry calculation that hydrodeoxygenation process of microalgae biodiesel was inclined to the decarboxylation pathway other than the decarbonylation pathway, because the total enthalpy of pentadecane and byproducts obtained through decarboxylation of methyl palmitate (C16:0) was lower by 187.7 kJ/mol than that through decarbonylation. The selectivities of hydrocracking products with odd carbons (2n − 1, n = 5, 6, 7, 8) were higher than those with even carbons (2n), because the covalent bonds hydrocracked to remove even carbons were 0.001–0.149% longer in bond length and 0.012–1.697% lower in bond order than those hydrocracked to remove odd carbons. The experimental results of hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking conversion of microalgae biodiesel into jet biofuel carried out in a fixed bed reaction system agreed well with the quantum chemistry calculation results. The BET surface area of 10% Ni/meso-Y catalyst loaded with 4% HPW decreased by 14.3% to 453.9 m2/g, but its strong acid density increased by 30.6% to 1.62 mmol/g. Accordingly, the selectivity of jet biofuel in liquid products converted from microalgae biodiesel at 255 °C and 2 MPa hydrogen increased to 63.1%, in which iso-alkane selectivity markedly increased to 20.5% and arene selectivity was reasonable at 11.1%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of karanja fruit hulls by fast pyrolysis was investigated using a drop-type two-stage reactor. The ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of karanja fruit hulls over a silica-alumina catalyst was performed at 500 °C and at a catalyst loading of 0.1 g. The obtained bio-oil yield was 41.09 wt%. The bio-oil contained 84.38% carbonyls. The silica-alumina catalyst reduced the liquid yield to 39.73 wt%. The production of aromatics and hydrocarbons in bio-oil was enhanced, whereas the yield of carbonyls was reduced from 84.38% (non-catalytic) to 7.83% (catalytic). After catalyst regeneration, the aromatic yield was increased from 30.08% (1st run) to 52.18% (5th run), and the deoxygenation degree was increased from 35.15% (1st run) to 57.13% (5th run), thereby demonstrating that the silica-alumina catalyst had satisfactory reusability. The amount of catalytic coke was reduced after catalyst regeneration, because less hard coke was formed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, in most industrial units, biodiesel is produced through transesterification of edible oil and methanol using homogeneous basic catalysts in stirred-tank reactors. The drawbacks of this method include the high cost of feedstock, long reaction time, high energy consumption, and excessive wastewater production. The present study investigated an alternative process, in which biodiesel was produced from indigenous, inedible Norouzak (Salvia leriifolia) oil in the presence of choline hydroxide (ChOH) as an ionic liquid catalyst in a microchannel reactor. Taking into account catalyst concentration, methanol-to-oil volume ratio, and reaction time as the independent variables, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with a Box-Behnken experimental design was used to determine the optimal reaction efficiency as the response. An efficiency of 93.36% was predicted by the model for a catalyst concentration of 6.11 wt%, methanol-to-oil volume ratio of 0.37, and reaction time of 12.48 min. By conducting experiments under these conditions, an efficiency of 96.8% was obtained. In comparison with the results of previous studies in which ChOH was used as the transesterification catalyst, employing the microchannel reactor in this study reduced the reaction time to less than 0.1 that of a mechanical stirrer. Moreover, the energy consumption was 32 times lower than that of a mechanical stirrer. The use of ChOH instead of KOH in a microchannel reactor increased efficiency by 1.9–4.9%. Compared to heterogeneous catalysts, ChOH can reduce the catalyst and alcohol consumption by at least 29% and 30%, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a carbon-based solid acid was created through the sulfonation of carbon obtained from the hydrothermal pretreatment of glucose. Additionally, ethyl levulinate, a viable liquid biofuel, was produced from furfuryl alcohol using the environmentally benign and low-cost catalyst in ethanol. Studies for optimizing the reaction conditions, such as reaction time, temperature, and catalyst loading, were performed. Under the optimal conditions, a maximum ethyl levulinate yield of 67.1% was obtained. The recovered catalyst activity (Ethyl levulinate yield 57.3%) remained high after being used four times, and it was easily regenerated with a simple sulfonation process. Moreover, the catalyst was characterized using FT-IR, XRD, SEM, elemental analysis, and acid-base titration techniques. © 2019 by the authors

AB  - There has been a recent increase in both the production and consumption of ethanol due to the numerous environmental advantages that it offers, such as the fact that it can be produced from a variety of renewable materials, for instance corn and cellulose, or it can be obtained from sugarcane bagasse and biomass (2nd and 3rd generation ethanol). The result of this is that nowadays ethanol is widely seen as the dominant biofuel – or as a blend component in gasoline or pure fuel - in many countries. However, one disadvantage of the use of ethanol is the high corrosive behavior that occurs when its hygroscopic properties are exposed to a large number of materials. Xiaoyuan Lou and Preet Singh showed that the increase of water concentration in ethanol induces pitting and metal loss. Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) films may be a solution to this problem due to the fact that they can be deposited inside tubes, offer good protection levels against corrosion, and reduce the friction coefficient and wear. This paper shows the tribocorrosion and corrosion studies of DLC films deposited on stainless steel grade 304 (SS304) substrates in order to gauge its appropriateness usage in the construction of pipelines and fuel storage tanks. The surface morphology was analyzed before and after 14 days of immersion. The tribocorrosion, friction coefficient, and wear rate were studied in ethanol to see the effects of water concentration. The films showed good adherence to the substrates. Corrosion and tribocorrosion results showed that for bare Stainless Steel 304 the increase of the water content increases the corrosion and the friction coefficient. DLC coated samples presented few points of delamination, and the friction coefficient and open circuit potentials were very low compared with the bare sample which was water concentration independent. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

AB  - Metal-organic framework (MOF) assisted hydrothermal pretreatment and co-catalysis strategy based on UiO-66 MOF is developed for the first time. The Planetree exfoliating bark was pretreated with or without UiO-66 assisted hydrothermal method at a temperature ranging from 160 to 240 °C for 1–3 h residence. With the rise of pretreatment severity, the total reducing sugar (TRS) was increased till reached maximum, 180 mg g−1, in the presence of UiO-66. The fitting models validate the optimal hydrothermal condition was at 180 °C and 1 h, which was characterized with high TRS and very low yield of furfural and HMF. The TRS from enzymatic hydrolysis reaches maximum, 391 mg g−1, in the presence of MOF co-catalysis and the maximum ethanol yield achieved was 73%. Altered morphology, higher surface area and porosity are noticed after MOF assisted hydrothermal pretreatment. This study insights the MOFs’ application in lignocellulose biomass processing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A dual hybrid system, including an improved parabolic trough solar collector (CSP) and a biodiesel generator was designed and constructed in this study. The biodiesel was produced from 1st and 3rd generations of biofuel by means of the heat loss of CSP. In order to increase the efficiency of heat transfer of CSP with a working fluid, an optimization was performed with some nanoparticles in concentrate range of 1500–3500 ppm. The results showed that thermal conductivity coefficient of the fluid increased by enhancing the volume percentage. This led to an increase in the outlet temperature from the collector and caused better efficiency of CSP and therefore a better performance of the biodiesel transesterification reactor. However, the best working fluid was consisted of a water-based CuO nanofluid (efficiency of 66.42% and the rate of temperature of 1311.1 °C/min). Due to different outlet temperature, various experiments were conducted to produce fuel from rapeseed oil. The best efficiency results (74.54%) as well as the lowest finished costs (69 cents) occurred at temperature of 60 °C. Then, biodiesel was produced from chlorella oil at this temperature with an efficiency of 81.4% and total production cost of 143 ¢. © 2018

AB  - Increasing energy demands coupled with decreasing fossil fuel resources create an urgent need to switch over bio-based fuel, such as biodiesel. In a newly designed reactor, the production of biodiesel was conducted with soybean oil (SBO) in solvent-free system through transesterification by immobilized Burkholderia cepacia lipase under the influence of ultrasonic emulsification. Effects of operational parameters viz. methanol-to-oil molar ratio, water concentration, immobilized enzyme concentration, and temperature on fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield were investigated. Molar ratio and enzyme concentration showed a significant linear correlation with biodiesel yield (r = − 0.8 and 0.6; respectively). Linear regression analysis of both parameters later revealed a significant prediction ability for biodiesel with a yield of 78.8 and 31.7%, respectively. FAME yield was 30% at 7 h in the pretreatment reactor. Without ultrasonic emulsification, the yield was significantly enhanced to 64% for the same reaction time in the packed-bed reactor. However, the reaction time was further reduced significantly under the influence of ultrasonic emulsification coupled with immobilized lipase as a catalyst and resulted into higher biodiesel yield of 68.6% at 3 h. Clearly, ultrasonic emulsification-assisted immobilized lipase catalysis of SBO might be a potential alternative route to conventional methods of biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Furfural is a promising renewable platform chemical that is widely produced from lignocellulosic biomass and has received significant attention as a sustainable precursor for the production of chemicals and fuels. To date, one-pot conversion of furfural with cellulosic ethanol is mostly limited to the synthesis of C5-C7 hydrocarbons, poising a challenge for the production of high-energy density fuel from biomass-derived compounds. In this study, we present gold nanoparticles supported over nickel oxide (Au/NiO) as robust catalysts for selective conversion of furfural to hydrocarbons. The catalysts present ∼92% furfural conversion with ∼81% selectivity toward the production of C7 and C9 hydrocarbons through a one-pot cascade reaction, viz., cross-aldol condensations in the presence of ethanol, O2, and K2CO3, followed by a hydrogenolysis process using H2(g). Results indicate the unprecedented production of C9 from furfural and ethanol is yielded via in situ cross-aldol condensation of 3-(2-furyl)acrolein, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde that is evolved in the reaction medium. Analysis shows the promising catalytic performance of the Au/NiO composite for the furfural conversion can attribute with synergic effects at the interface of the Au nanoparticles and the NiO, offering potential active sites for the reaction. This study may provide new guidelines for design of efficient catalysts to transform bio-based platform compounds into biofuels with high energy density. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Soot emissions from aviation piston engines (APEs) are a major source of environment pollution in airport vicinity, stratosphere, and troposphere, and their nanostructure and surface chemistry play a critical role in determining the impact on human health and environment. In this work, the morphology and nanostructure of soot emitted from an aviation piston engine burning five different fuels including blends of promising alternative jet and biofuels were investigated via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The graphitic structures were observed by analyzing primary particles in the HRTEM images. Morphological analysis demonstrated that the separation distance of the graphene layers of soot particles from the kerosene-pentanol blend combustion was larger than that from kerosene-Fischer-Tropsch blend combustion, indicating that adding pentanol tended to generate particles with more loosely stacked layers and higher oxidation tendency. Raman results were in agreement with primary particle nanostructure analysis based on the HRTEM images. Furthermore, soot particles from different fuels exhibited different concentrations of amorphous carbon and structural defects. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Continuous fast microwave catalytic co-pyrolysis of Alternanthera philoxeroides and peanut soapstock was studied using HZSM-5 as catalyst. The effects of catalyst temperature, feedstock-to-catalyst ratio, and A. philoxeroides-to-peanut soapstock ratio on the yield and composition of bio-oil were studied. Experimental results showed that the optimum catalyst temperature was 400 °C. The catalyst increased the proportion of aromatics but reduced the bio-oil yield. The optimum feedstock-to-catalyst ratio was 2:1. A. philoxeroides presented a significant synergistic effect with peanut soapstock, which facilitated the production of aromatics in the bio-oil. The optimum A. philoxeroides-to-peanut soapstock ratio was 1:2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rubber wood waste (RW) requires due to its recalcitrance a pretreatment step before efficient biochemical conversion is possible. Non chemical steam explosion pretreatment was adopted to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion with severity from 2.70 to 4.35. RW treated at severity 4.35 (214 °C for 10 min) gave the highest 83.9 L CH 4 /kgVS effectiveness in anaerobic digestibility together with 45.2% hydrolysability in terms of glucan conversion. The intense pretreatment decreased particle size and degraded most of the hemicellulose, resulting in increased specific surface and better access for enzymes to cellulose. Additionally, the energy yield of steam exploded RW was enhanced by combined enzymatic hydrolysis with anaerobic digestion, in comparison to enzymatic hydrolysis or anaerobic digestion alone. This allowed for an efficient steam explosion pretreatment with co-production of sugar and methane. This study provides a technical approach for efficient biofuel production from RW after steam explosion pretreatment. Valorization of lignin-rich residue generated from the integrated process may increase value of RW, but assessing this requires further study. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Phytoremediation is one of the most encouraging options for the elimination of heavy metals from contaminated soil. However, the treatment and exploitation of hazardous harvested hyperaccumulator biomass is a challenge recently. In this investigation, we propose a novel microwave-assisted chemical looping gasification (MACLG) process for the disposal of hyperaccumulator biomass, and syngas fuel production and trace element emissions from MACLG over hematite is evaluated. Experimental results show that the addition of hematite as oxygen carrier (OC) favors the production of H 2 and CO. The elevated operation temperature induces a decay in CO 2 yield and an increase in H 2 , CO and CH 4 yields. Meanwhile, a higher temperature causes an increased heavy metal percentage in syngas. On the other hand, the augmentation of steam flow and hematite content stimulates an uptrend for CO 2 and H 2 production and downtrend for CO generation. The percentage of each trace element in char after MACLG reduces with increasing steam flow, and its change in syngas presents the opposite trend. In addition, the proportions of trace elements in spent hematite and syngas tend to increase with an augmented hematite content whereas their portions in char reduce gradually. Moreover, our results suggest that activated carbon is capable of effective adsorption removal of heavy metals in syngas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - γ-Valerolactone (GVL)/water/acid has been developed as a mild solvent system to pretreat biomass. In this study, Eucalyptus was pretreated with 80/20 GVL/water with the addition of H2SO4 (20–100 mM) at 120 °C for 30–60 min, and the resulting cellulose-enriched residual fractions were further enzymatically hydrolyzed. Results showed that the pretreatment of Eucalyptus with GVL/water/acid system led to a significant decrease in the contents of lignin and hemicelluloses, and the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of the pretreated sample was significantly improved. Meanwhile, the removal of lignin and hemicelluloses from the cell walls during the pretreatment process was monitored by the confocal Raman spectra. Under the optimum conditions (50 mM H2SO4 and 60 min), the delignification rate was up to 90.7% and the cellulose content in the residue was reached to 86.1%. The high cellulose content led to a high cellulose conversion rate and the glucose yield was 6.1-fold higher than that of the raw material without pretreatment. In short, this process provided an efficient approach to remove hemicelluloses and lignin from Eucalyptus to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis for bioethanol production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquefaction co-catalyzed by Raney nickel and NaOH in isopropanol (2-PrOH)/H2O is an efficient method for transforming lignocellulosic biomass into bio-oil. The present study investigated the effect of reaction temperature, residence time, and dosage of the catalysts on the yield and composition of bio-oil. To understand the liquefaction mechanism, the transformation of lignin and cellulose at the same conditions was investigated as well. The results indicated that 240 °C was the optimum temperature in terms of bio-oil yield. It was also found that residence time had a great effect on not only the bio-oil yield but also the composition and higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-oil. Increasing the dosage of the catalysts also improved the yield and HHV of bio-oil. Most phenols in bio-oil were originated from lignin, while most ketones and hydrocarbons were produced by cellulose. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid alcohols based on waste cooking oil (WCO) and other edible oils (butter or soybean oil) were synthesized by a simple one-step method. The effects of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dosage and type of oil on the combustion performances were explored. IR spectroscopy and micro-morphologies of the oil based solid alcohols were also studied. Results showed that, for oil based solid alcohol, use of an appropriate excess of NaOH and an oil with lower iodine value produced the solid alcohol with better combustion performance. Centrifugation produced the bottom waste cooking oil (B-WCO) with lower iodine value and the supernatant waste cooking oil (S-WCO) with higher iodine value. The B-WCO afforded solid alcohol with longer combustion time, higher melting temperature and relatively low combustion residue rate, whereas the S-WCO could be used for synthesizing biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to investigate environmentally sustainable sources of organic carbon and nutrients, four Nordic green microalgal strains, Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlorella saccharophila, Chlorella vulgaris, and Coelastrella sp., were grown on a wood (Silver birch, Betula pendula) hydrolysate and dairy effluent mixture. The biomass and lipid production were analysed under mixotrophic, as well as two-stage mixotrophic/heterotrophic regimes. Of all of the species, Coelastrella sp. produced the most total lipids per dry weight (~40%) in the mixture of birch hydrolysate and dairy effluent without requiring nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium-NPK) supplementation. Overall, in the absence of NPK, the two-stage mixotrophic/heterotrophic cultivation enhanced the lipid concentration, but reduced the amount of biomass. Culturing microalgae in integrated waste streams under mixotrophic growth regimes is a promising approach for sustainable biofuel production, especially in regions with large seasonal variation in daylight, like northern Sweden. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of using a mixture of wood hydrolysate and dairy effluent for the growth and lipid production of microalgae in the literature. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The development of devices capable of generating energy through biofluids, such as sweat, is an effort to integrate flexible devices that can be powered and used on the skin. A patch-type completely enzymatic biofuel cell (p-EBFC) is developed using bilirubin oxidase- and lactate oxidase-based electrodes as biocathode and bioanode respectively, where both enzymes are immobilized on flexible Toray carbon paper-modified. The evaluation of the half-cells shows that the bioelectrodes had good catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction and lactic acid oxidation reactions using natural human sweat. The wireless p-EBFC on the skin is capable to delivery an open circuit voltage of 0.55 ± 0.03 V and a short circuit current of 140 ± 4 μA cm−2. Also, the p-EBFC maintains its performance of 20 μW cm−2 and 30 μA cm−2 continuously for 30 min in a sweat delivery from the arm of a healthy volunteer during workouts. In addition, a wireless device is incorporated in order to monitor via a cell phone the energy produced in real time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presented experimental results to evaluate the optimization of production parameters through response surface methodology. These parameters significantly affected the yield of cottonseed oil methyl ester (COME). The input variables for the production of methyl ester from cottonseed oil were methanol/oil molar ratio, concentration of catalyst, temperature, and stirring speed. The response or output variable was the yield of methyl ester. The fatty acid methyl ester composition of COME (biodiesel) was obtained using a gas chromatography (GC) analyzer. BS EN 14103:2011 was the standard used to analyze the fatty acid methyl ester. The derived mathematical model was statistically accurate to predict the optimum value of COME. The optimized values to obtain a 98.3% yield of methyl ester were as follows: methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, catalyst concentration of 0.97% (w/w), temperature of 63.8 °C, and speed of 797 rpm. The physicochemical properties of COME were measured in accordance with ASTM D6751. The friction and wear properties of COME and its blends with petroleum diesel were tested using a four-ball wear testing machine. The tribological characteristics of COME as a new biofuel were assessed. COME displayed good lubricity with a low coefficient of friction and wear scar diameter. The coefficient of friction of pure COME (COME100) was lower than that of pure petroleum diesel (DL100) and COME blends with petrol diesel (COME10, COME20, and COME50). The average coefficient of friction of COME 100 was lower than that of DL100, COME10, COME20, and COME50 by 28.06%, 19.49%, 7.49%, and 3.65%, respectively. The wear scar diameter of COME100 for the tested ball was lower than that of DL100, COME10, COME20, and COME50 by 47.6%, 33.3%, 32.1%, and 21.42%, respectively. The worn surfaces of the tested balls were examined by scanning electron microscopy, and the results were presented in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of the calcination temperature on the textural properties, structure and acidity of niobium phosphate and the relationship between those properties and the catalytic activity for the continuous esterification reaction using oleic acid and ethanol. For this purpose, samples of niobium phosphate were prepared by calcination at 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 and 600 °C. Despite the good thermal stability presented by niobium phosphate, best results were achieved for samples pretreated at 300 °C, which presented higher acidity, surface area and catalytic activity. For this sample, the experimental conditions of temperature (from 220 to 290 °C), amount of catalyst (from 0 to 0.8 g) and ethanol:oleic acid molar ratio (from 2:1 to 14:1) were studied using design of experiments (DOE) and optimized with canonical analysis. The esterification reaction of oleic acid led to yields of esters up to 70% and conversion up to 90% at optimized conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agro-industrial wastes are abundant and low-cost sources of energy and chemicals. Biomass account for 14% of the world’s energy production. Industrial residues of production of soluble coffee (spent coffee grounds - SCG) have great potential due to its large-scale production and can be transformed by pyrolysis, in liquid, solid and gaseous products with applications from energy to chemicals. This work has the objective of producing bio-oil from the pyrolysis of industrial SCG, characterize it by chromatography and indicate its possible applications. As SGC contains a large amount of glycerides, they were extracted from SGC before the pyrolysis, aiming to obtain a better bio-oil from the residue. The yield in vegetable oil was 5.2% and its analyses showed that 50% are saturated acids (mainly palmitic 27.6%) and other 50% are unsaturated ones (mainly linoleic acid 35.3%). This composition qualifies this oil for biodiesel purposes. The residue (SGC after extraction) was submitted to pyrolysis, yielding 30% in liquid products, being 6% bio-oil. The bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography being identified free fatty acids, hydrocarbons, phenols and N-compounds. The heteroatomic compounds limit the use as biofuel but can be interesting for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine chemicals industries. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - In this study, hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol, a lignin derived model compound, has been studied experimentally via a combination of dielectric barrier discharge plasma and catalyst. Cracking of methyl groups in the chemical structure of bio-oil is used to provide the hydrogen which is required for hydrodeoxygenation reaction. In order to maximize the degree of deoxygenation and guaiacol conversion, the effects of operating and plasma parameters including applied voltage, guaiacol and argon flow rate have been examined. Furthermore, performance of plasma alone and catalytic plasma has been compared by filling the active volume of the discharge with different commercial catalysts including Ni, Co–Mo, Ni–Mo, Pt–Re and Pt–Cl supported on Al2O3. The highest guaiacol conversion of 92% and deoxygenation degree of 65% are achieved in the presence of Pt–Cl/Al2O3 and Pt–Re/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively. According to the results, the main products were BTX, phenol, methylphenols and dimethylphenols. Unlike previous studies in which catechol was produced as a major product, in our plasma system phenol can be produced selectively through direct demethoxylation rather than demethylation reaction. It is also evident from the results that the hydrogen challenges of hydrodeoxygenation reaction can be overcome by catalytic DBD plasma reactor. © 2018

AB  - In this work, a sustainable way for biodiesel production is presented. It consists in performing the transesterification reaction by a high shear mixing assistance at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The process involves the generation of a microemulsion between the reactants (methanol and soybean oil) in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst. The effect of the catalyst nature and amount, dispersion rate and time, and methanol:oil ratio were investigated. In order to verify a wide applicability, other vegetable oils such as canola, sunflower, corn and olive were evaluated as well. The required energy consumption using the high shear mixing assistance was smaller than that consumed in a traditional method. The results showed that this method is suitable for other vegetable oils using low quantities of methanol, catalyst, and short reaction times (less than 1 min). Moreover, the use of costly equipment and spacious facilities are avoided. Using the herein described methodology, a quantitative conversion was achieved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass-derived furanyl ethers, such as 5-alkoxymethylfurfurals (AMFs) and 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs), can be employed as promising biofuels or additives. The development of multifunctional catalysts for the efficient production of furanyl ethers from sugars through 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as an intermediate is highly desirable but challenging, because multiple reactions including dehydration, etherification and hydrogenation get involved and the side reaction of sugars and HMF to form humins is inevitable. In this contribution, we found that the introduction of CuO resulted in the generation of Lewis acid sites at the cost of Bronsted acid sites over CuO-USY catalysts through the formation of Al-O-Cu(II) species. The dispersity of CuO particles and the amount of Lewis acid sites could be manipulated by adjusting the loading of CuO. If 5 wt% CuO was supported on USY zeolite to give a CuO(5)-USY catalyst, CuO particles with a high dispersity (36.4%) afforded abundant Lewis acid sites (457.1 μmol/g). Lewis acid over CuO(5)-USY greatly promoted the acid-catalyzed dehydration of fructose to HMF and HMF etherification to AMFs, resulting in a HMF yield up to 86.2% from fructose and AMFs yields greater than 90% from HMF. Interestingly, a combination of CuO(5)-USY and a small amount of metallic Cu powder was able to offer desirable BAMFs yields by the reductive etherification of HMF under hydrogen atmosphere. As a result, 5-methoxymethylfurfural (MMF) of 79.6% and 2,5-bis(methoxymethyl)furan (BMMF) yield of 74.5% were achieved from fructose through HMF as an intermediate in the presence of CuO(5)-USY alone or with metallic Cu as a co-catalyst. Therefore, the above Cu-based catalyst system holds the promise to flexibly produce a family of AMFs or BAMFs from fructose via a facile two-step approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study demonstrates a sustainable process for production of bio-crude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction of microbial biomass generated through co-cultivation of microalgae and bacteria coupled with wastewater remediation. Biomass concentration and wastewater treatment efficiency of a tertiary consortium (two microalgae and two bacteria) was evaluated on four different wastewater samples. Total biomass concentration, total nitrogen and COD removal efficiency was found to be 3.17 g L−1, 99.95% and 95.16% respectively when consortium was grown using paper industry wastewater in a photobioreactor under batch mode. Biomass concentration was enhanced to 4.1 g L−1 through intermittent feeding of nitrogen source and phosphate. GC-MS and FTIR analysis of bio-crude oil indicates abundance of the hydrocarbon fraction and in turn, better oil quality. Maximum distillate fraction of 30.62% lies within the boiling point range of 200–300 °C depicting suitability of the bio-crude oil for conversion into diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel for stoves. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The catalytic (SBA-15, Ni/SBA-15, Al/SBA-15 and Ni-Al/SBA-15) hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of rice straw biomass was examined at different temperature with different amount of catalyst in the presence of different solvents. In comparison with water solvent liquefaction, the bio-oil yield significantly increased under alcoholic solvent (ethanol and methanol). The highest bio-oil yield was observed for water (44.3 wt%) with Ni-Al/SBA-15, while for ethanol (56.2 wt%), and for methanol (48.1 wt%) with, Ni/SBA-15 catalyst. The loading of Ni and Al on SBA-15, the acid strength of the catalyst enhanced. Bio-oils yield were analyzed with the help of GC–MS, FT-IR, NMR, GPC and CHNS. From the GC–MS analysis, the main monomeric phenolic compounds were produced, phenol, 4-ethyl-phenol, 2-methoxy-phenol, 2-methoxy-4-ethyl-phenol and Vanillin. It was observed by CHNS and GPC analysis of the bio-oil, compared to the non-catalytic liquefaction reaction, the catalytic liquefaction reaction promotes the hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation and produced lower molecular weight bio-oils. © 2019

AB  - An effort in contributing to the reduction of fossil resource dependence along with utilization of lignocellulosic wastes, will be a beneficial approach in biofuel production. These approaches will aid in sustainable waste management and will contribute to economic feasibility. This study probed the exploitation of abundant, non-edible lignocellulosic wastes such as sugarcane bagasse and rice husk as a low-cost carbon source for the cultivation of oleaginous yeast isolates and lipid accumulation, respectively. The hydrolysis of the lignocellulose was explored by steam explosion alone to reduce the inflation of toxic compounds like hydroxy methyl furfural (HMF), furfural, and acetic acid. This optimization study investigated the effects of carbon sources (sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate, rice husk hydrolysate, and commercial glucose), nitrogen sources, and pH on biodiesel production using central composite design (CCD), and achieved a full factorial design. All the three variables were found to have a positive influence on biodiesel production. Greater biomass production was achieved by SY2 (Pichia kudriavzevii) with a value of −8.37 ± 0.067 g/L when sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate was used. Maximum lipid content of 37.99 ± 0.003% was attained by the strain G5 (Meyerozyma guilliermondii) upon using sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate in the production medium and higher lipid accumulation of 2.39 ± 0.003 g/L was attained by SY2 (Pichia kudriavzevii) upon using rice husk hydrolysate. Analysis of the kinematic properties of FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) was obtained using Biodiesel analyzer V1.1. software, and affirmed the values similar to the biodiesel standard values (EN 14214, ASTM, IS 15607). The kinematic studies used to figure out the quality of the biodiesel, revealed that FAME produced by SY2 (Pichia kudriavzevii) strain showed greater oxidation stability (37.17 h) and better kinematic viscosity (1.3084).

AB  - The aim of the present work was to compare corn stalk (CS) and cow manure (CM) for hydrochar production at different reaction temperatures (180–260 °C) and retention times (1–4 h). CM and CS resulted in hydrochars with significantly different physicochemical properties; however, both led to similar yields (30–65%). CM-derived hydrochar had a lower carbon content but a higher nitrogen and ash content than CS-derived hydrochar. CM-derived hydrochar demonstrated potential as a soil amendment due to its higher content of nitrogen, the presence of surface functional groups and higher specific surface area in comparison to CS-derived hydrochar. In comparison, CS-derived hydrochar demonstrated suitability as a solid fuel due to its high heating value and low ignition temperature. This study revealed that the composition of lignocellulose significantly impacted the properties and thus potential applications of hydrochar. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ni nanoparticles inlaid in lignin-derived carbon constructing the “inlaid type” Ni/C-I was reported to improve stability and adjust metal-support interaction of lignin hydrogenolysis catalyst. The Ni/C-I was further heat treated in air to prepare Ni/C-R so as to re-expose the blocked active sites by carbon species. A lot of characterization techniques were carried out to confirm the “inlaid structure” of the catalysts. The lignin depolymerization results demonstrated that the Ni/C-R had better catalytic performance than traditional “supported type” Ni/C, 23.3% aromatic monomer yield and 82.4% bio-oil yield were achieved. Moreover, the mechanism studies with lignin model compound revealed that Ni/C-R had better bond breaking ability than Ni/C, even C[sbnd]C bond could be cleaved. The electron effect could be responsible for that, since the electrons could transfer from Ni0 to carbon support for Ni/C-R, which could improve the bond breaking ability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis of beech wood has been conducted in a fluid bed reactor at 450 °C with a sulfided CoMo catalyst followed by a fixed bed hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactor with a sulfided NiMo catalyst at hydrogen pressures between 3.0 and 35.8 bar. Using both reactors the condensable organic yield (condensed organic and C4+ in gas) varied between 18.7 and 21.5 wt% dry ash free basis (daf) and was independent of the hydrogen pressure. At 15.9 bar hydrogen or higher the condensed organic phase was essentially oxygen free (&lt;0.01 wt% dry basis (db)), but decreasing the hydrogen pressure to 3.0 bar increased the oxygen content to 7.8 wt% db. The char and coke yield was close to constant (11.0–12.7 wt% daf) at hydrogen pressures between 15.9 and 35.8 bar, but increased to 15.7 wt% at 3.0 bar hydrogen due to an increase in the polymerization of pyrolysis vapors. The measured carbon content on the spent catalysts from both the fluid bed and HDO reactor showed that coking of the catalysts increased when the hydrogen pressure was decreased below 15.9 bar. The increased coking at low hydrogen pressure (&lt;15.9 bar) was ascribed to the polymerization of the more reactive oxygenates produced in the fluid bed reactor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE)is one kind of renewable biodiesel, which has lower emissions of mono-nitrogen oxides, lower smoke opacity, higher energy contents, lower pour, and cloud points. In this work, phoenix (Firmiana simplex L.)tree seed oil (PTSO)from Sterculiaceae was used as the novel feedstock to produce FAEE. Ethanol was used as fatty acyl acceptor and sodium hydroxide was employed as a catalyst. Response surface methodology was used to evaluate and optimize the effect of transesterification variables on FAEE yield. The effect of reaction variables on the transesterification was as follows: catalyst concentration > transesterification temperature > substrate ratio. Transesterfication variables were optimized as follows: 0.3% catalyst concentration with 10.8:1 substrate ratio (ethanol to PTSO, mol/mol)at 52.7 °C for 20 min. Under these optimized transesterification variables, the maximum FAEE yield (97.4 ± 1.7%)was obtained. These can provide an efficient and effective information for biodiesel preparation using PTSO as the novel feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Depleting fossil fuel resources and related environmental concerns have focused the world's attention on finding sustainable and renewable energy resources such as biofuels. Biodiesel, produced from vegetable oil, animal fats, waste cooking oil, and greases, shows a promising alternative for petroleum-diesel. The conventional biodiesel production methods are time consuming and energy intensive due to mass transfer limitations. This limitation can be reduced by carrying out reaction at a bubble interface which supplies a “local” excess of alcohol to push equilibrium in the forward direction while simultaneously increasing the rate of reaction. During this process, methanol vapors, fed through a sintered borosilicate diffuser, react with the free fatty acids (oleic acid in this case)and catalyst. Owing to the lower flow rates of methanol and pore size of the diffuser (15–40 μm)used, the bubbles produced are significantly smaller 1 mm and lies in the range of 200–600 μm. Kinetic study shows that reaction follows first order kinetics w.r.t. oleic acid. The esterification reaction through bubble reactor achieved 97% conversion of oleic acid in 30 min as compared with 80% in 312 min using conventional methods. © 2019

AB  - The biofuel chemicals, 5-ethoxymethylfufural (EMF)and 5-methoxymethylfufural (MMF)have been prepared from various carbohydrates in alcoholic solvents. The porous polymeric material PSDVB-SO3H was employed as a heterogeneous catalyst in this investigation and the reaction parameters; time, temperature, catalyst/feedstock loading and co-solvent were optimized. As a result of the acid density and mesoporous structure, PSDVB-SO3H efficiently catalyzed the ethanolysis of fructose to EMF in a 67.5% yield (2 h, 393 K). Whereas MMF was obtained in a 31.6% yield from the catalytic methanolysis of fructose. Compared to commercial Amberlyst-15, less time was required for PSDVB-SO3H to obtain a comparable yield of EMF. Alkyl levulinates and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)were the main co-products in these reactions, with yields in the range of 0–67% obtained from the catalytic alcoholysis of fructose. Furthermore, by using a “two-step, one-pot” route with successive addition of zeolite zeolite and PSDVB-SO3H to a solution of glucose, EMF was achieved in a yield of 39.4%. © 2019

AB  - We report the performance of UiO-66 and its Brønsted acid functionalized derivative, UiO-66-(COOH)2, as heterogeneous catalysts for levulinic acid esterification with ethanol. Importantly, compared with UiO-66, UiO-66-(COOH)2 displayed superior catalytic performance (up to 97.0 ± 1.1% yield of ethyl levulinate) attributed to the synergistic effect between Lewis acidic Zr clusters and Brønsted acidic -COOH groups. Furthermore, UiO-66-(COOH)2 was stable and reusable without an appreciable loss in catalytic activity for at least five consecutive cycles. This study demonstrates that the interplay of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in zirconium metal-organic frameworks leads to more efficient catalytic conversion of a biomass feedstock to biofuel, and with further hypothesis driven research, additional materials that show promise as candidates for catalytic conversion of biomass feedstocks to biofuels and valuable chemicals can be developed. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignin is the most abundant natural resource of aromatic moieties and the second most abundant natural biopolymer. Analytical techniques that obtain as much information as possible on the exact structural content of lignin species are essential for developing efficient processes that transform highly complex lignin wastes into value chemicals and biofuels. For mass spectrometric analysis of lignin samples, usually electrospray ionization, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, or atmospheric pressure photoionization are used as ionization techniques. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is less frequently applied but offers a much more rapid screening option for lignin mixtures. In this study, we compared several common MALDI matrices for analysis of alkali lignin and discovered that different chemical matrices exhibited very different ionization efficiencies and selectivity with respect to the structures of the lignin-related compounds as well as the presence of heteroatoms. Importantly, the results highlight that the choice of matrix strongly determines the analytical coverage of molecular species in the complex lignin degradation mixtures.

AB  - Bioprocessing of synthesis gas (syngas) and waste gases from industrial streams has been developed as a potential option to produce biofuels and biochemicals. However, poor solubility and mass exchange of syngas, low cell biomass, and productivities are key bottlenecks for technology commercialization. All aforementioned hurdles are mainly the outcome of poor gas-liquid mass transfer (GLMT). Efforts have been devoted by employing different reactor configurations, improving gas delivery systems, and altering properties of the system. To date, all available options have not been critically reviewed and an optimal solution to get high GLMT is lacking to drive technology towards practicality and economic feasibility. Hence, aim of this article is to compare different options to increase GLMT in syngas fermentation. Comprehensive discussions are made on state of the art reactor configurations, gas delivery devices and supporting technologies. Finally, a reactor system for high GLMT, high cell concentration and productivity is proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of condensing temperature on composition of bio-oil obtained via fractional condensation was investigated by pyrolysis-condensation experiments of walnut shells at condensing temperatures from 290 K to 370 K. The condensing efficiency of the first stage condenser decreased from 0.59 to 0.12 with increasing temperature. Moisture of bio-oil decreased from 40% to 5%, but the C/O ratio increased from 0.50 to 1.50. Compared with contents observed at the lowest condensation temperature, the maximum content of each component increased by 50%–500%. Combined with variations in condensing efficiency and composition content, the optimum condensing temperature range for declining water in bio-oil was 340–350 K. The condensing temperature associated with the enrichment of acetic acid and furfural was 345 K. The 355 K optimum condensing temperature could be selected to achieve the maximum enrichment of guaiacol and its derivatives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study demonstrates that CO2 enhances the production of a syngas component and also hinders the formation of benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge. A thermogravimetric analysis and two lab-scale pyrolysis setups (single-stage and two-stage) were used to understand the role of CO2 in the pyrolysis of sewage sludge. The use of CO2 enhanced the thermal cracking of volatile species formed during the pyrolysis, resulting in the enhanced production of carbon monoxide (CO) at temperatures higher than 550 °C. In addition, less tar (e.g., 20% in N2; 17% in CO2) and more gas product (39% in N2; 44% in CO2) were formed in the presence of CO2 after the pyrolysis of sewage sludge, indicating that the use of CO2 shifts pyrolytic carbon distribution from tar to pyrolysis gas. In addition to the decrease in tar, the PAH content in the tar was also decreased, meaning that CO2 suppresses the formation of benzene derivatives and PAHs during pyrolysis. Solid residues formed following the pyrolysis (in the presence of N2 and CO2) were also characterized, which showed that Ca, K, and Mg are effectively immobilized in the solid product. These residues can potentially be used for soil amendment. This study suggests that utilizing CO2 increases the thermal efficiency of sewage sludge pyrolysis and suppresses the formation of harmful chemical species such as PAHs. A pyrolysis process operated using CO2 would be an effective treatment method for byproducts of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment processing (e.g., sewage sludge). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Authors conducted non-catalytic, catalytic, and hydropyrolysis at 550 °C temperature and 1 bar pressure to produce biofuels from an ignored algal biomass of Oscillatoria by thermo-chemical degradation study in a tubular reactor having an internal diameter of 25 mm and 300 mm of active length covered by a furnace of a single heating zone. The catalysts used for the catalytic pyrolysis and hydropyrolysis study are TiO2: ZnO on 1:1 basis. Characterization of bio-oils by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)shows substantial variation in functional groups of all three types of bio-oils. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS)gives a detailed list of available hydrocarbons in bio-oil samples and proton NMR confirms the functionality of bio-oil by available proton assignments. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)and X-ray Diffraction (XRD)shows morphology and the structural analogy of biochars with respect to biomass. Calorific values of three types of bio-oils ranges from 16.597 to 16.664 MJ/kg; and revealed that this particular biomass has potential as a resource of feedstock with an approximate yield of one-third of biomass on the dry weight basis. The pH of these bio-oils obtained from green algae varies in the range of 8.25 to 6.07 that indicates the less number of oxygenated compounds unlike very low pH bio-oils obtained from other types of biomass feedstock. Additionally, present results revealed that these bio-oils include formative compounds of most popular hydrocarbons, i.e., benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). Further, they also include furans, phenols, benzaldehyde, guaiacol, caprolactam, styrene, oximes, etc. which can be used as green chemicals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Olive mill wastewater sludge (OMWS) and waste tires (WTs), abundant wastes in Tunisia, were used as feedstock in a slow co-pyrolysis pilot reactor to produce upgraded pyrolytic oil as an alternative fuel. Despite the improvement of some properties of the pyrolytic oil when waste tires were added in the feed blend, a negative synergy was observed in the yield of the oil compared with that of char. The characterization of oil samples showed synergetic interaction between OMWS and WTs during co-pyrolysis which led to a partial deoxygenation and resulted in reduction of viscosity and increase in the calorific value of the co-pyrolytic oils. However, the co-pyrolytic oil properties did not meet the requirements of commercial diesel and will need further improvement by effective standardization to meet marketable specifications. Compared with catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) followed by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), OMWS/WTs slow co-pyrolysis showed some limitations but it can be considered as a simple, clean and cheap process upgrading technique for bio-oil production (∼40% lower in fixed capital investment and ∼30% lower in fuel selling price). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cell disruption and lipid extraction methods for macroalgae are not well reported. Therefore, we compared various lipid extraction methods and extraction efficiency of various solvents to improve lipid yields from Oedogonium fresh water macroalgae. Lipid extraction was done by 2 methods viz., modified Bligh and Dyer method and soxhlet extraction using either single solvents or mixtures. In soxhlet extraction method five solvents were used (1) Hexane commonly used solvent for lipid extractions, (2) chloroform: methanol (2:1), (3) Chloroform: hexane (1:1), (4) Chloroform: hexane (1:2), (5) Dichloromethane + methanol (2:1). To improve lipid extraction yields, various cell disruption methods were also compared during the present study. Impurities of chlorophyll and protein were also detected in the extracted lipids. Hydrothermal liquefaction of algal biomass with TiO2 was also conducted at 300 °C. HTL was more effective by which 23.3 wt% of bio-crude oil was obtained. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis of β-1,4-endoglucanase from family 5 glycoside hydrolase (CtGH5) from Clostridium thermocellum was performed to develop a mutant CtGH5-F194A that gave 40 U/mg specific activity against carboxymethyl cellulose, resulting 2-fold higher activity than wild-type CtGH5. CtGH5-F194A was fused with a β-1,4-glucosidase, CtGH1 from Clostridium thermocellum to develop a chimeric enzyme. The chimera (CtGH1-L1-CtGH5-F194A) expressed as a soluble protein using E. coli BL-21cells displaying 3- to 5-fold higher catalytic efficiency for endoglucanase and β-glucosidase activities. TLC analysis of hydrolysed product of CMC by chimera 1 revealed glucose as final product confirming both β-1,4-endoglucanase and β-1,4-glucosidase activities, while the products of CtGH5-F194A were cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharides. Protein melting studies of CtGH5-F194A showed melting temperature (Tm), 68 °C and of CtGH1, 79 °C, whereas, chimera showed 78 °C. The improved structural integrity, thermostability and enhanced bi-functional enzyme activities of chimera makes it potentially useful for industrial application in converting biomass to glucose and thus bioethanol. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The key challenge for the broad application of implantable biofuel cells (BFCs) is to achieve inorganic–organic composite biocompatibility while improving the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. We have fabricated nanoengineered red blood cells (NERBCs) by an environmentally friendly method by using red blood cells as the raw material and hemoglobin (Hb) embedded with ultrasmall hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) as the functional BFC cathode material. The NERBCs showed greatly enhanced cell performance with high electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. The NERBCs maintained the original biological properties of the natural cell, while enhancing the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through the interaction between −OH groups in HAP and the Hb in RBCs. They also enabled direct electron transportation, eliminating the need for an electron-transfer mediator, and showed catalytic inactivity for glucose oxidation, thus potentially enabling the development of separator-free BFCs. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Livestock production is among the most rapidly growing sectors of the agricultural economy driven primarily by growing demand for animal protein, but also posing significant waste disposal issues and environmental impacts. Moreover, opportunities exist for utilising animal waste at the farm level for heat and power generation (thermal conversion) which can contribute to economic sustainability and also provide a bio-fertiliser for soil amendment. The present study is focused on energy and nutrient recovery from poultry litter using a thermochemical conversion technology (fast pyrolysis). The formation of products (gases, biochar and bio-oil) during the fast pyrolysis of poultry litter was experimentally investigated in a laboratory-scale bubbling fluidised bed reactor. Pyrolytic gases accounted for 15-22 wt.% of the product. The carbon content in biochar increased from 47 to 48.5 wt.% with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature. Phosphorous and potassium recovery in the biochar were over 75%, suggesting that it could be used as an organic soil amendment. The high ash content in poultry litter (14.3 wt.%) resulted in low bio-oil and high biochar yield. The bio-oil yield was over 27 wt.% with a higher heating value of 32.17 MJ/kg (dry basis). The total acid number of the bio-oil decreased from 46.30 to 38.50 with an increase in temperature. The nitrogen content in the bio-oil produced from the poultry litter (>7 wt.%) was significantly higher compared to bio-oil produced from the wood (0.1 wt.%). © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - A series of high-performance cycloparaffinic fuels have been generated by [2+2] cycloaddition of the bio-derived alkenes 1-hexene, isoprene, and 1-pentene, catalyzed by a low-valent iron pyridine(diimine) complex [(MePDI)Fe(N2)2(μ-N2)] [MePDI=N,N′-(2,6-pyridinediyldiethylidyne)bis(2,6-dimethylbenzenamine)]. Reactions with 1-pentene and 1-hexene resulted in 85 % selectivity to 1,2-cyclobutanes, and 12 % selectivity to acyclic alkenes generated by β-hydride elimination. Self-dimerization of isoprene was sluggish and generated heavier oligomer products, but cross-dimerization of isoprene with 1-hexene afforded primarily a 1,3-cyclobutane product, along with isomers of acyclic C11 mixed dimers. Hydrocarbon mixtures were hydrogenated and fractionally distilled to yield finished fuel mixtures in overall yields of 83–93 % at the multigram scale. The fuels exhibited densities ranging between 0.767 and 0.783 g mL−1, and net heats of combustion (NHOC) of up to 120.6 kBtu gal−1 (43.8 MJ kg−1). These values are higher than conventional synthetic paraffinic kerosenes owing to the higher density and ring strain afforded by the cyclobutane rings. The fuel mixtures also exhibited extremely low viscosities ranging from 2.38 to 4.78 mm2 s−1 at −20 °C, due in part to the presence of the acyclic dimers. The excellent fuel properties of the product mixtures, selectivity for dimer products, high yields, and the ability to use simple bio-derived alkenes as substrates, make the [Fe]-catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition of unactivated alkenes a compelling route to the synthesis of sustainable high-performance fuels. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Three seemingly distinct directions of nanomaterials research, photovoltaics, biofuel production, and biological modulation, have been sequentially developed over the past several decades. In this Mini Review, we discuss how the insights gleaned from nanomaterials-based solar energy conversion can be adapted to biointerface designs. Because of their size- and shape-dependent optical properties and excellent synthetic control, nanomaterials have shown unique technological advantages as the light absorbers or energy transducers. Biocompatible nanomaterials have also been incorporated into biological systems including biomolecules, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells for a large collection of fundamental studies and applications. For the photocatalytic biofuel production, either isolated bacterial enzymes or the entire bacteria have been hybridized with the nanomaterials, where functions from both parts are synergistically integrated. Likewise, interfacing nanomaterials with eukaryotic systems, whether in individual cells or tissues, has enabled optical modulation of cellular behavior and the construction of active cellular materials. Here we survey different approaches in which nanomaterials are used to elicit electrical or mechanical changes in single cells or cellular assemblies via photoelectrochemical or photothermal processes. We end this Mini Review with the discussion of future nongenetic modulation at the intracellular level. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The specie Erianthus is a variety of sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) that can be used as "energy-cane" due to its high amount of fibers. The bagasse produced in the industrial processing of this biomass has not an appropriate use and tend to be inadequately discarded, causing negative environmental impacts. Sugarcane bagasse can be reused after be submitted to pyrolysis which is one of the best ways of obtaining high value products from lignocellulosic material. Bio-oil is the main liquid product of the pyrolysis and is a liquid complex mixture of organic compounds, highly oxygenated. By using a specific catalyst, it is possible to reduce de oxygenated compounds and generate hydrocarbons, which can be used as bio-fuel. In this work, the bagasse of Erianthus sp, was subjected to a catalytic pyrolysis process varying the amount of catalyst (HZSM-5) for producing bio-oil with reduced quantities of oxygenated compounds, aiming its application as biofuel for energy purposes. The use of 50% of HZSM-5 (in situ) produced a major number of aromatic hydrocarbons, reducing the oxygenated compounds. However, phenols remain as major compounds that indicate the need of an upgrading process to use this bio-oil as alternative fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cane molasses is one of the main by-products of sugar refineries, which is rich in sucrose. In this work, low-cost cane molasses was introduced as an alternative substrate for isomaltulose production. Using the engineered Yarrowia lipolytica, the isomaltulose production reached the highest (102.6 g L−1) at flask level with pretreated cane molasses of 350 g L−1 and corn steep liquor of 1.0 g L−1. During fed-batch fermentation, the maximal isomaltulose concentration (161.2 g L−1) was achieved with 0.96 g g−1 yield within 80 h. Simultaneously, monosaccharides were completely depleted, harvesting the high isomaltulose purity (97.4%) and high lipid level (12.2 g L−1). Additionally, the lipids comprised of 94.29% C16 and C18 fatty acids, were proved suitable for biodiesel production. Therefore, the bioprocess employed using cane molasses in this study was low-cost and eco-friendly for high-purity isomaltulose production, coupling with valuable lipids. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The present paper presents an assessment of the techno-economic performance of novel polygeneration concepts for bio-oil production. They are based on catalytic hydropyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation, and can be integrated with other processes for co-production of synthetic natural gas, molecular hydrogen and methanol. Thirteen system layouts were evaluated considering different technological alternatives and process pathways. Firstly, detailed thermodynamic and economic models were developed to calculate and compare the energy demands, capital and production costs of all plants, given a biomass input of 2000 dry metric tonnes per day. Sensitivity analyses using local approaches, Morris screening and multi-variable linear regression tools were then conducted to identify the essential parameters. Finally, uncertainty analyses were performed to estimate the minimum selling price of bio-oil for each case. The results show that the total capital costs range between $180 and $620 million, for a production cost between $17 and $24 per GJ of fuel. The feedstock and electricity costs represent the greatest share (up to 60% together) followed by the annualised investment costs (up to 18%). The sensitivity analyses suggest that the plant profitability is mostly impacted by the bio-oil yield, by-product characteristics, electrolysis costs, wood and power prices. The uncertainty analysis, through Monte-Carlo simulations, demonstrates that the minimum fuel selling prices may vary from $-3 to $240 per GJ. The most promising layouts are those with SNG and H2 production, whilst the riskiest ones are those with electrolysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transformation of sunflower oil (SO) and waste cooking oil (WCO) into green diesel over co-precipitated nickel–zirconia catalysts was studied. Two series of catalysts were prepared. The first series included catalysts with various Ni loadings prepared using zirconium oxy-chloride, whereas the second series included catalysts with 60–80 wt % Ni loading prepared using zirconium oxy-nitrate as zirconium source. The catalysts were characterized and evaluated in the transformation of SO into green diesel. The best catalysts were also evaluated for green diesel production using waste cooking oil. The catalysts performance for green diesel production is mainly governed by the Ni surface exposed, their acidity, and the reducibility of the ZrO 2 . These characteristics depend on the preparation method and the Zr salt used. The presence of chlorine in the catalysts drawn from the zirconium oxy-chloride results to catalysts with relatively low Ni surface, high acidity and hardly reduced ZrO 2 phase. These characteristics lead to relatively low activity for green diesel production, whereas they favor high yields of wax esters. Ni-ZrO 2 catalysts with Ni loading in the range 60–80 wt %, prepared by urea hydrothermal co-precipitation method using zirconium oxy-nitrate as ZrO 2 precursor salt exhibited higher Ni surface, moderate acidity, and higher reducibility of ZrO 2 phase. The latter catalysts were proved to be very promising for green diesel production. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A combined process coupling a Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction and an anaerobic biological technology was investigated in order to effectively treat amoxicillin-containing wastewater. With the increase in the pretreatment degree, the average COD removal rate correspondingly increased from 84.8% to 92.4% using the anaerobic biological treatment, and the biodegradability and COD removal efficiency was improved by the pretreatment processes. During the process of amoxicillin degradation, hydroxyl free radicals tended to attack the lactamide, amide and pentacyclic rings of amoxicillin. In the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra of soluble microbial products (SMPs), the absorption peak of humic acid gradually decreased with application of the pretreatment. The pretreatment products were more beneficial to the characteristics of anaerobic granular sludge. For the microbial community structure, the proportion of Methanothrix and Clostridia increased with addition the heterogeneous Fenton-like pretreatment, which favored conversion of organic contaminants to volatile fatty acids and biogas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A crab shell waste-derived carbon/CaO composite was synthesized by a facile one-step pyrolysis strategy. The composite was used as a solid base catalyst for isomerization of biomass-derived glucose to fructose, which is a key intermediate in transformation of cellulosic biomass into chemicals and biofuels. Physicochemical structure of the composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and CO 2 temperature programmed desorption. The composite showed a lotus rootlike porous structure with a surface area of 85 m 2 /g and contained as high as 22.4 wt % of CaO. The isomerization of glucose to produce fructose with the prepared solid base catalyst was investigated, and a maximum fructose yield of 29.2% was obtained from 5% glucose aqueous solution at mild conditions (80 °C and 40 min). A 25.0% yield of fructose still could be produced even when the initial glucose concentration was as high as 20 wt %. Finally, the mechanism of glucose isomerization by the synthesized solid base catalyst was studied. This work provided not only an alternative approach for utilization of crab shell waste but also a better understanding of cellulose-derived sugar transformations with solid base catalyst. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The synthesis of MgO/MgAl2O4 was conducted using hybrid microwave-impregnation with different glycine fuel ratios (1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5). To this end, the combustion synthesis (CS) and microwave heating were applied for the synthesis of MgAl2O4, and impregnation was used for the dispersion of MgO active phase on the given samples. The characterization of samples was done using TGA, XRD, BET, BJH, FTIR, FESEM, and EDX to reach the optimal glycine fuel ratio for CS. The best physiochemical properties were observed in 1.5 ratio. The pore size, the surface area, and the mean pore diameter of the mentioned nanocatalyst were respectively 0.358 cm3/g, 93.8 m2/g, and 5 nm. Finally, transesterification reaction was employed for the preparation of biodiesel to measure the nanocatalysts activity. The findings showed that the nanocatalyst produced by hybrid microwave-impregnation method with fuel ration of 1.5 (at the presence of glycine) is highly desirable for biodiesel production. Using optimal sample, transesterification reaction conversion reached 92.7%. Reusability investigation of the optimal catalyst showed that this sample possessed a relatively good reusability for biodiesel production. Regarding the simple and fast synthesis method (hybrid microwave impregnation), it can be said that the catalyst synthesized by this method is suitable for industrial biodiesel preparation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With increasing demand for biodiesel, crude glycerol as a by-product in biodiesel production has been generated and oversupplied. This study, therefore, explored the pretreatment and a subsequent two-stage microbial system to convert crude glycerol into high value-added products: 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). After pretreatment, long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) could be effectively removed from crude glycerol to eliminate the inhibition effects on subsequent microbial process. In the anaerobic fermentation, when fed treated crude glycerol increased from 20 g/L to 100 g/L, 1,3-PDO yield decreased from 0.438 g/g to 0.345 g/g and accompanied carboxylic acids shifted from acetate and lactate dominant to lactate overwhelmingly dominant. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of Clostridiales sustained around 50% but Enterobacteriales increased from 19% to 53%. Further fed glycerol increase to 140 g/L resulted in severe substrate inhibition, which could be relieved by intermittent feeding. In aerobic process, glycerol anaerobic digestion effluent (ADE) was fed to the consortium of Bacillus megaterium and Corynebacterium hydrocarbooxydans for selectively consumption of carboxylic acids and residual glycerol from 1,3-PDO to produce PHAs as a secondary high value-added product. The consortium accumulated maximum 8.0 g/L poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), and 1,3-PDO purity increased from initial 27.7% to almost 100% when fed with 100 g/L glycerol ADE. Overall, this study provided comprehensive and insightful information on microbial conversion of crude glycerol to high value-added products after pretreatment. © 2018

AB  - Three-step continuous process for producing biodiesel from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). PFAD has high content of free fatty acids (FFA) and is not suited for human consumption: normally it is used in soap or in animal feed. The key parts of the three-step continuous process took place in helical static mixers (HSMs) used as continuous reactors. The three-step process was optimized by RSM with 5 levels for each of three factors in central composite design (CCD). First step was esterification, then second step was esterification, and third was transesterification. Methyl ester purities of 71.01 wt.% from first step, 95.94 wt.% from second step, and 99.96 wt.% from third step were achieved with total chemical consumption of (115.1 wt.% MeOH, 13.5 wt.% H2SO4, and 5.0 g/L KOH), and total residence time 147 s in the 3 HSMs. In continuous processing the maximum yields were 109.5 wt.% first-esterified oil, 117.0 wt.% second-esterified oil, and 129.0 wt.% crude biodiesel, and purified biodiesel 86.4 wt.%, in the separated phases from first, second, and third steps, and after purification, respectively. Ester purity from three-step process meets the standard specifications for commercial biodiesel in Thailand, US, and Europe. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rare earths in Thai monazite ore were separated by chemical process following purification by an ion exchange process technique. They were utilized as raw materials to synthesize solid catalysts for the production of biodiesel. The novel solid catalysts were prepared by the simple oxalic acid precipitation method. The prepared CeO2, La2O3 and Nd2O3 catalysts were employed to catalyze transesterification of palm oil and methanol. They showed high catalytic activity with FAME content over 95%. The catalytic performance of the best available La2O3 catalyst was additionally investigated. It was found that the initial transesterification rate catalyzed by the synthesized La2O3 catalyst was three times higher than its commercial counterpart, which related to its basic strength, high crystallinity, large pore volume and great crystallite size. The highest FAME content of 95% was achieved within 45 min under the optimal conditions of 200 °C reaction temperature, 39 bar reaction pressure, 1:30 molar ratio of oil to methanol, 10 wt% catalyst loading and 600 rpm stirring rate. In addition, the novel La2O3 catalyst was observed to be stable even after four recycle runs with insignificant loss of catalytic activity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To deal with the corrosive property of bio-oil, laser-induced coatings were synthesized on the typical cylinder liner rubbing surfaces. Two nano-additives including MoS2 nanosheets and graphene were introduced into the coatings. The tribological performances of the coated surfaces were tested on a multifunctional cylinder liner-piston ring tribometer. The surfaces before and after sliding were characterized with modern surface analysis technology including Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and etc. The results show that the nickel-based coated surfaces can effectively prevent the corrosion of the bio-oil. In addition, the laser-induced coatings had better antifriction and antiwear performances than the corresponding traditional electroless plating coatings. With the introduction of MoS2 nanosheets or graphene, the tribological performances of the coatings were further enhanced. Laser irradiation increased the concentration of the nano-additives in the coatings and the thickness of the tribo-layers, which accounted for their outstanding tribological performances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Concerning the growing need for energy resources and reduction of fossil fuels, researchers seek for the use and development of biofuels. Among the biofuels, biodiesel has captured the attention of researchers since it deals with the oil cost and embraces environmental benefits. Aiming at continuous and optimal biodiesel production, the current study examines the effects of the residence time of hydrodynamic reactors, catalyst concentration, methanol-to-oil ratio, and ultrasound power on methyl esters yield. To optimize the transesterification reaction of the waste oil, the response surface method was used. Results of the study indicated that the increase of residence time results in an increase of the methyl esters yield, but following the time up to 90 s, the methyl esters yield decreases. The increase of catalyst by 1% leads to the increase of the methyl esters yield, and up to 1.25% the catalyst concentration, the methyl esters yield decreases by 7%. The increase of methanol-to-oil ratio up to 6:1 results in an increase of yield, and up to 8:1 methanol-to-oil ratio, the methyl esters yield follows an increasing trend with a slight slope. The optimal conditions in this study were 60 s residence time, 1% catalyst concentration, 6:1 methanol-to-oil ratio, and 250W ultrasound power, and that the methyl esters yield, as well as the consumed energy, were obtained 90.45% and 21.52 kJ, respectively. In conclusion, the suggested method is suitable for biodiesel production based on the methyl esters yield and energy consumption. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Amazon sailfin catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis) is considered one of the greatest threats to the biodiversity of continental aquatic systems, causing serious economic and environmental problems in the regions. In this work, the production of biodiesel from Amazon sailfin catfish biomass oil is studied. The physical and chemical properties of biofuel produced were evaluated under the specifications of the European standard EN-14214 by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and atomic absorption spectrometry analyses. The results show that the biodiesel complies with all the specifications of the standard, except the content of polyunsaturated methyl esters. The yields obtained from oil and biodiesel were 9.67 and 90.71% (m/m), respectively. The methyl ester concentrations study identified 17 components where 47.003% m/m corresponded to methyl esters with saturated chains, whereas 34.394% m/m was attributed to monosaturated methyl esters and the remaining (18.624% m/m) to polysaturated methyl esters. Finally, mineral analysis by atomic absorption showed the absence of heavy metals Cd, Ni, and Pb, as well as low concentrations of Ni, Fe, Cu, and Zn, demonstrating that the quality of the fuel is not compromised. The study indicates the feasibility of manufacturing biodiesel using Amazon sailfin catfish biomass oil as a low-cost raw material. It represents an environmental option to mitigate a global problem of atmospheric pollution, and at the same time, it shows a commercial alternative to reduce the ecological impact caused by this fish in the diverse ecosystems to which it has spread. In addition, the great adaptability of this fish provides the possibility of a profitable process to have very high rates of reproduction and growth, allowing the generation of large amounts of biomass for the production of biodiesel. © 2019 F.

AB  - In this work, we propose a one-step subcritical methanol extraction (SCM) process for biodiesel production from Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Therefore, the present study attempts to establish and determine the optimum operating conditions for maximum biodiesel yield from SCM of C. pyrenoidosa. A statistical approach, i.e. response surface methodology is employed in this study. The effects of three operational factors: reaction temperature (140–220 °C), reaction time (1–15 min) and methanol to algae ratio (1–9 wt.%) were investigated using a central composite design. A maximum yield of crude biodiesel of 7.1 wt.% was obtained at 160 °C, 3 min reaction time and 7 wt.% methanol to algae ratio. The analysis of variance revealed that methanol to algae ratio is the most significant factor for maximizing biodiesel yield. Regression analysis showed a good fit of the experimental data to the second-order polynomial model. With no requirement of catalyst nor any pretreatment step, SCM process is economically feasible to scale up the commercial biodiesel production from algae. © 2018

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOx) mutants with higher activity or stability have important role in industry and in the development of biosensors and biofuel cells. Discovering these mutants can be time-consuming if appropriate high-throughput screening (HTS) systems are not available. GOx gene libraries were successfully screened and sorted using a HTS system based on GOx activity dependent fluorescent labeling of yeast cells with tyramids and quantification of the amount of expressed enzyme by yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yGFP) tagging and flow cytometry. For this purpose, we expressed wild type and a mutant GOx as a chimera with the yGFP to confirm differences in catalytic activity between wild-type and mutant GOx. Fluorescence of yGFP is preserved during expression of chimera, and also after the oxidative enzymatic reaction. We have obtained a 2.5-fold enrichment in population of cells expressing active enzyme, and percentage of enzyme variants with enzymatic mean activity higher than wild type activity was increased to 44% after a single round of GOx gene library sorting. We have found two mutants with 1.3 and 2.3-fold increase in Vmax values compared to the wtGOx. By simultaneous detection of protein expression level and enzyme activity we have increased the likelihood of finding GOx variants with increased activity in a single round of flow cytometry sorting. © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Biofuels such as sewage gas and landfill gas, which can be used as fuels in solid oxide fuel cells, have suitable composition of CH4 and CO2 for dry reforming. We developed an Sr0.92Y0.08Ti1−xRuxO3−d material as an anode for solid oxide fuel cells that use biofuels as a direct fuel and show an excellent performance in dry reforming. The Pechini method was used to synthesize the material using ruthenium substitution in the titanium site of an Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3−d (SYT) material. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that the perovskite phase of the synthesized catalyst was maintained. Ruthenium-loaded catalysts were prepared by coprecipitating ruthenium onto SYT to compare with the Sr0.92Y0.08Ti1−xRuxO3−d. The differences between Sr0.92Y0.08Ti1−xRuxO3−d and ruthenium-loaded SYT materials during methane dry reforming and the thermal stability during long-term operation were evaluated. In particular, SYTRu10 exhibited higher methane conversion and carbon dioxide conversion than Ru10-loaded SYT at the temperature range of 600–900 °C and stable performance even in long-term operation. X-ray fluorescence and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurements were performed to measure the composition of the catalysts and the specific surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction were used to investigate the state and behavior of ruthenium. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy was performed to analyze the shape of the catalyst before and after the reaction. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Valorization of the aqueous phase produced by hydrothermal liquefaction of terrestrial feedstocks is a potential strategy to decrease the minimum fuel selling price of biofuels. In this work, three different strategies were developed focused on upgrading the major molecules present in the aqueous phase, carboxylic acids, via (1) catalytic upgrading into chemicals via condensed-phase ketonization reaction, (2) catalytic upgrading to H2 via direct steam reforming, and (3) catalytic upgrading to H2 via anaerobic digestion (to CH4) followed by steam reforming. Direct catalytic upgrading of the aqueous feed was unsuccessful as the catalyst deactivated, therefore, an aqueous phase cleanup process based on activated carbon absorption followed by liquid-liquid extraction was developed to reduce color and inorganic contaminants while simultaneously concentrating desirable organic constituents. Stable conversion of the cleaned aqueous phase was successfully demonstrated using both condensed-phase ketonization (for ≈100 h) and steam reforming. Steam reforming was also demonstrated by employing a dual-bed catalyst configuration in which carboxylic acids first undergo ketonization over CeO2 in the vapor phase followed by steam reforming of the ketone intermediates over Co/CeO2. The dual-bed approach reduced coke deposition and thus improved catalyst stability compared to the single-bed catalyst configuration. Techno-economic analysis was performed to assess the economic viability of the three different strategies and revealed that the condensed-phase ketonization strategy provided the lowest minimum fuel selling price (49/GGE) because of co-products (olefins) generated for sale. Both the steam reforming and anaerobic digestion processes benefited from onsite production of the H2 needed for biocrude hydrotreatment, thereby avoiding the need for natural gas; however, both processes resulted in similar, higher minimum fuel selling price, $4.23 and $4.25/GGE.

AB  - In this study, a simple and robust derivatisation-free method has been developed using a gas chromatograph (GC), which has been validated as a suitable analysis for free fatty acids (FFAs) of waste cooking oil (WCO). As biodiesel synthesis from high acid value WCO involves pre-treatment steps, a non-catalytic approach has been employed for biodiesel production. This work has focused on the esterification of FFAs of high acidity feedstock for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production. The effect of four independent controllable factors, i.e. methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio, temperature, pressure and time on FFAs conversion has been investigated. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) via Central Composite Design (CCD) has been implemented for designing experimental runs and optimising the process variables for maximum FFAs conversion. Four quadratic regression models have been developed representing empirical relationship between reaction variables and responses. The adequacy of the predicted models has been checked by numerous statistical validation techniques including analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 95% confidence level. The developed optimum conditions have been reported at 25:1, 256 °C, 110 bar and 16.6 min for M:O molar ratio, temperature, pressure and time, respectively. The predicted optimal conditions have been validated experimentally with 0.22% relative error. © 2019

AB  - Bacillus benzeovorans assisted and supported growth of ruthenium (bio-Ru) and palladium/ruthenium (bio-Pd@Ru) core@shell nanoparticles (NPs) as bio-derived catalysts. Characterization of the bio-NPs using various electron microscopy techniques and high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) analysis confirmed two NP populations (1–2 nm and 5–8 nm), with core@shells in the latter. The Pd/Ru NP lattice fringes, 0.231 nm, corresponded to the (110) plane of RuO 2. While surface characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed the presence of Pd(0), Pd(II), Ru(III) and Ru(VI), X-ray absorption (XAS) studies of the bulk material confirmed the Pd speciation (Pd(0) and Pd(II)- corresponding to PdO), and identified Ru as Ru(III) and Ru(IV). The absence of Ru–Ru or Ru–Pd peaks indicated Ru only exists in oxide forms (RuO 2 and RuOH), which are surface-localized. X ray diffraction (XRD) patterns did not identify Pd-Ru alloying. Preliminary catalytic studies explored the conversion of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) to the fuel precursor 2,5-dimethyl furan (2,5-DMF). Both high-loading (9.7 wt.% Pd, 6 wt.% Ru) and low-loading (2.4 wt.% Pd, 2 wt.% Ru) bio-derived catalysts demonstrated high conversion efficiencies (~95%) and selectivity of ~63% (~20% better than bio-Ru NPs) and 58%, respectively. These materials show promising future scope as efficient low-cost biofuel catalysts. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is an important source of oil for biodiesel production in Brazil. However, the traits related to oil content and fatty acid profile are not targeted by soybean breeding programs. Developing methods to increase oleic and reduce linolenic fatty acid content within soybean genotypes will increase the use of soybeans for food and feed, as well as biodiesel production. Biodiesel produced with high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content has a high tendency to undergo oxidation, making storage difficult and overall quality reduced. On the other hand, oils with high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are preferred for biodiesel production because oxidation is not increased, improve cold flow properties significantly and nitrogen oxide emissions are decreased. In addition, soybean oil with high concentration of PUFAs causes low oxidative stability, resulting in rancidity, a rapid decline of optimal flavor and reducing storage time of manufactured food products. 242 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were evaluated in six locations in Brazil for grain yield, oil content, oil production, and fatty acid composition. A multi-trait index based on factor analysis and ideotype-design (FAI-BLUP index) was applied to identify genotypes best related with the ideotype for biodiesel production. This method is based on mixed models, with genotype and environment effects being considered as random and fixed, respectively. In addition, the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) method was used to predict the genetic values. Six RILs outperformed both parents and can be selected as genotypes more suitable for biodiesel production. Genetic selection reduced linolenic fatty acid content by 14%. Results indicated the presence of genetic variability for fatty acid composition. The significant increases in oleic and reductions in linolenic contents may be easily achieved with the introduction of mutant FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B genes through breeding programs or biotechnological strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Synthesizing high performance jet fuel from biomass provides potential way to convert low-cost biomass to valuable fuels and meets the requirements of sustainable development. Here, we report a one-pot synthesis of high density and low freezing point jet-fuel-ranged blending from bio-derived phenol and cyclopentanol, which is with high yield, simple and low-cost for scale-up. With the co-presence of acid catalyst like Hβ and metal catlayst like Pd/C, the alkylation first happens to produce bi-and tri-cyclic compounds under N2 atomphere, then in H2 atmosphere the remained reactant is partly hydrogenated and takes part in alkylation again to produce cyclic compounds, finally hydrodeoxygenation happens to convert all the compounds to cyclic hydrocarbons. A jet-fuel-blending containing bi- and tri-cyclic alkanes is obtained at high molar yield of 83.9% from the starting reactant, which shows high density of 0.89 g/mL, freezing point lower than −75 °C. Especially, the major component, i.e. cyclopentylcyclohexane shows much better low-temperature properties compared with reported hydrocarbons with similar molecular structure. This result provides a simple, low-cost way to synthesize high performance jet fuel from biomass. © 2019

AB  - Syngas is an indispensable chemical raw material, which also can provide heat and power. Chemical looping reforming (CLR) with biofuels is one prospective method to produce syngas. MxOy of 20 wt% (CuO, NiO and Fe2O3) supported on dolomite were prepared by the wet impregnation method used as the oxygen carriers (OCs) for syngas production in the CLR process with toluene in the lab-scale fixed bed reactor. The effects of the reduced temperature in FR and mass of OCs on the fuel conversion, syngas production and OCs utilization were studied. The study found that CuO/dolomite (CD) tended to generate CO2, while Fe2O3/dolomite (FD) and NiO/dolomite (ND) were appropriate to syngas production. Although CD achieved the highest oxygen effective conversion of 95.90% at 950 °C and the best selectivity for CO2, it was not a suitable OC for syngas production in CLR process since the cold gas efficiency, syngas yield and syngas purity for CD remained lowest under different reaction conditions. FD manifested the best performance at 900 °C with 30.0 g, exhibiting the highest cold gas efficiency and syngas yield of 54.23% and 1.16 Nm3/L, and the corresponding syngas purity was 73.86%. The selection of temperature and mass of FD played a key role in the quality control of syngas. Low syngas purity and rapid deactivation in cyclic tests were main barriers for FD to behave as an excellent OC in the CLR process. Furthermore, ND was the most ideal OC of the three for syngas production with the optimum condition being at 900 °C with 20.0 g, the corresponding cold gas efficiency, syngas yield and syngas purity were 39.30%, 0.93 Nm3/L and 90.59% respectively. ND exhibited the highest syngas purity of the three, and the satisfied H2/CO ratios (around 2.0) were achieved under different reaction conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focuses on the potential of four lipogenic yeasts to produce lipids using glycerol as carbon substrate; Candida molendinolei MH267796, Meyerozyma caribbica MH267795 and Rhodotorula minuta MH267794 were isolated from olive oil mill wastewater, while Cryptococcus curvatus ATCC20509 was used as control strain. Lipid production with crude glycerol was higher than that provided with pure glycerol. Fed-batch bioreactor cultures with M. caribbica MH267795 led to the production of 42.12 g L−1 of total dry weight with a microbial oil content of 48.14% (w w−1). In general terms, tested biodiesel properties meet all the limits set by European biodiesel standard UNE 14214:2013, excepting fatty acid methyl ester content. In addition, M. caribbica MH267795 oil biodiesel depicts a fatty acid methyl ester content (90.2% (w w−1)) higher than that of the most intensively studied C. curvatus oil biodiesel. Re-use of crude glycerol as raw material in biodiesel industry has been proven through fermentation, increasing potential full-scale application of such alternative. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cost efficient and environmental friendly carbon derived glycerol (CG)was prepared by insitu carbonication and sulfonation process. The synthesized CG was sulfonated with H2SO4 for 10 h denoted as SCG-(10) catalyst. The physico-chemical properties of the prepared catalyst were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), temperature programmed desorption-ammonia (TPD-NH3), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)surface area, variable pressure scanning electron microscope (VPSEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM)and CHNSO elemental analysis. The specific surface area and total acidity were increased significantly after being sulfonated at different time of reflux; whereas, the SCG-(10) catalyst showed the highest total amount of acidity (35117.14 μmol/g). Esterification of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD)was successfully obtained high fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)with yield 97.8% at optimum parameter of 18:1 methanol to PFAD molar ratio, 5 wt% catalyst loading and 90 °C reaction temperature within 1 h. The catalyst was successfully reused for 7 cycles and it was found that the catalytic activity maintained with &gt;96% of FAME yield for the first three run. The regenerated SCG-(10) catalyst has been used for another four consecutive of reusability run indicates the viability of utilizing carbon catalyst derived glycerol for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Formate converted from CO2 reduction has great potential as a sustainable feedstock for biological production of biofuels and biochemicals. Nevertheless, utilization of formate for growth and chemical production by microbial species is limited due to its toxicity or the lack of a metabolic pathway. Here, we constructed a formate assimilation pathway in Escherichia coli and applied adaptive laboratory evolution to improve formate utilization as a carbon source in sugar-free conditions. Results: The genes related to the tetrahydrofolate and serine cycles from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 were overexpressed for formate assimilation, which was proved by the 13C-labeling experiments. The amino acids detected by GC/MS showed significant carbon labeling due to biomass production from formate. Then, 150 serial subcultures were performed to screen for evolved strains with improved ability to utilize formate. The genomes of evolved mutants were sequenced and the mutations were associated with formate dehydrogenation, folate metabolism, and biofilm formation. Last, 90 mg/L of ethanol production from formate was achieved using fed-batch cultivation without addition of sugars. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the introduction of a formate assimilation pathway, combined with adaptive laboratory evolution, to achieve the utilization of formate as a carbon source. This study suggests that the constructed E. coli could serve as a strain to exploit formate and captured CO2. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - With the progress in technology and population, an enormous amount of agricultural and food waste is being generated throughout the world. In the past, food and agro-wastes were either burnt off or allowed to rot in fields, but this can be potentially hazardous to the environment. Therefore, approaches with respect to their utilization, reuse, and processing need to be developed to enable the sustainable utilization of feedstock and reduce pollution. Agricultural wastes mainly comprise of cellulosic fibres possessing high fixed carbon content and multifunctional groups. Agricultural waste shows considerable applicability due to its high strength, environmentally benign nature, low cost, and ease of availability and reusability. All these characteristics have been researched upon in the past, in the sector of waste water management for the removal of heavy metals and dyes. Similarly, a variety of food and agro-waste has been adopted as sources for new drug leads or important phytochemicals with different therapeutic benefits. Agro-waste can also be employed for enzyme immobilization after proper modification. Apart from this waste cooking oil comes under the category of food waste and can be processed to prepare alternate energy source such as biodiesel. This personal account summarizes the development, processing, and application of food and agro-waste in the production of biodiesel, environmental remediation, curative medicine, and in the development of biocatalysts, by researchers in our laboratory. © 2019 The Chemical Society of Japan & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - As a renewal energy source for bioethanol production, the residuum of apple wood likely offers a major benefit by having the lignin portion transformed into biofuels firstly. In this study, we used the residuum of Raney Ni and Ru/C catalyzed and hydro-deoxygenated (for jet-fuel production) apple wood as the start substrate to produce bio-ethanol. Cellulose content could reach 83.38% for residuum of Ni catalyzed substrates (Ni-cs for short), and the enzymatic hydrolysis rate increased to 88% which is in reasonable high scale. Lignin left in residuum showed more negative effect on cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis than cellulose II. Different catalysts (Ni or Ru/C) concentration influenced the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Using quasi-simultaneous enzymatic saccharification and combined fermentation (Q-SScombF), the inhibit effect from catalysts was obvious and the ethanol production efficiency were lower than 35%. But for separate hydrolysis and fermentation process (SHF), the ethanol conversion of raw material and catalyzed residuum improved from 33% to 75% (for residuum of Ni-cs) and increased from 25% to 73% for residuum of Ru/C catalyzed substrates (Ru/C-cs). This research provided a good basis for the feasibility of bio-ethanol production from residuum of bio-refined apple wood. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this work is to introduce a nanocomposite based bioanode for biofuel cell application. The as-prepared Kraton/MWCNTs nanocomposite was used as a current enhancer and ferritin (Frt) as a mediator between glucose oxidase (GOx) and the electrode surface. The hybrid anode achieved enzymatic oxidation of glucose by the nanocomposite reflecting an efficient energy conversion from glucose. The resulting Kraton/MWCNTs/Frt/GOx bioande exhibited good catalytic activity towards glucose oxidation along with excellent stability. The maximum current density attained by the bioanode is 1.14 mA cm−2 at the optimum glucose concentration of 60 mM. This enzymatic strategy can be employed to develop other polysaccharide or oligosaccharide fuel cells in which glucose oxidation is involved. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Continuous hydrothermal liquefaction and further upgrading of the algal biocrude are of great importance for algae biofuel process scale-up and improvement of fuel properties. In this study, two strains of microalgae were used for processing in a continuous stirred tank reactor at 350 °C and 24 MPa for 15 min residence time. An average of 36.2 wt% and 31.5 wt% biocrude yields were achieved for Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis gaditana, respectively. The obtained biocrude was further upgraded by hydrotreating using commercial NiMo/Al2O3 and NiW/Al2O3 catalysts at two temperatures (250 °C and 400 °C) in a batch autoclave reactor for 4 h. Products distribution, analysis by elemental content, gas chromatography (GC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) on upgrading products indicate that upgrading by both catalysts lead to improved physicochemical fuel properties, during 250 °C upgrading step, decarbonylation, decarboxylation and repolymerization are the dominant reactions while hydrodeoxygenation and cracking reaction are more promoted at 400 °C. The gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil components in the algal biocrude were increased from 18 wt% to &gt;30 wt% after catalytic upgrading. © 2019

AB  - This work firstly provides a thorough insight into the effects of the operating conditions (catalyst loading, initial H2 pressure temperature, reaction time, H2/guaiacol ratio and liquid reaction volume) on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol over a Mo2C/CNF catalyst. Under the operating condition tested, gas and solid formation was negligible and guaiacol was primary converted to different liquid products, including non-deoxygenated (0-oxy), mono-deoxygenated (1-oxy) and fully deoxygenated (2-oxy) compounds, together with high molecular weight soluble oligomers. An increase in the catalyst loading increased the guaiacol conversion and HDO efficiency, augmenting the proportions of HDO products. Among these species, the progressive transformation of 1-oxy compounds into 2-oxy species was kinetically and thermodynamically controlled by the catalyst loading and the amount of H2 dissolved in the liquid medium, respectively. Augmenting the H2 pressure increased the H2 availability in the liquid, which led to increases over time in the guaiacol conversion and HDO efficiency, thus promoting the production of HDO products and facilitating the transformation of guaiacol into fully de-oxygenated products. This increase depended on the reaction volume, with more pronounced variations occurring for a small than for a large volume due to the greater variations occurring in the H2/guaiacol ratio for the former than the latter. The temperature exerted a kinetic promoting effect together with a thermodynamic inhibitory influence, as some of the reactions involved were not thermodynamically favoured at high temperature. Therefore, the detailed analysis included in this work brings novel information on guaiacol HDO, which can help to establish the basis for catalysts development and reactors design to achieve a sustainable bio-fuels production from lignocellulosic bio-oils. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present work, Mobil Composite Material no. 41 (MCM-41) utilized as the catalyst support for biodiesel production from Waste Cooking Oil (WCO). Different amounts of Si/Ce molar ratios (5, 10, 25, 50 and Ce = 0) introduced to the MCM-41 structure to synthesize the bifunctional nanocatalysts and achieve a modified support of high stability and acidity. Then, ultrasound used to disperse MgO active phase on support surface. The prepared nanocatalysts were investigated using various techniques as follows: XRD, EDX, TEM, FESEM, FTIR and BET. The XRD patterns along with the results of FTIR and BET analysis revealed the MCM-41 framework destruction while increasing the Ce content. The FESEM images of the nanocatalysts illustrated a well distribution and uniform morphology for the Mg/CeM (Si/Ce = 10). The particle size and size distribution of the Mg/CeM (Si/Ce = 10) were subsequently determined by TEM and FESEM images. Biodiesel production carried out under following constant operational parameters to evaluate catalytic performance of synthesized samples: T = 70 °C, catalyst loading = 5 wt%, methanol/oil molar ratio = 9, and 6 h reaction time. Ce substitution in support framework considerably enhanced the biodiesel conversion. The Mg/CeM (Si/Ce = 10) nanocatalyst demonstrated the highest conversion of 94.3%. The reusability of the Mg/CeM (Si/Ce = 10) studied in seven reaction cycles and biodiesel conversion reached to 88.7% at the end of seventh cycle which demonstrated its significant stability. © 2019

AB  - Background: Algal harvesting is a major cost which increases biofuel production cost. Algal biofuels are widely studied as third-generation biofuel. However, they are yet not viable because of its high production cost which is majorly contributed by energy-intensive biomass harvesting techniques. Biological harvesting method like fungal-assisted harvesting of microalgae is highly efficient but poses a challenge due to its slow kinetics and poorly understood mechanism. Results: In this study, we investigate Aspergillus fumigatus-Chlorella pyrenoidosa attachment resulting in a harvesting efficiency of 90% within 4 h. To pinpoint the role of extracellular metabolite, several experiments were performed by eliminating the C. pyrenoidosa or A. fumigatus spent medium from the C. pyrenoidosa-A. fumigatus mixture. In the absence of A. fumigatus spent medium, the harvesting efficiency dropped to 20% compared to > 90% in the control, which was regained after addition of A. fumigatus spent medium. Different treatments of A. fumigatus spent medium showed drop in harvesting efficiency after periodate treatment (≤ 20%) and methanol-chloroform extraction (≤ 20%), indicating the role of sugar-like moiety. HR-LC-MS (high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) results confirmed the presence of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucose in the spent medium. When GlcNAc was used as a replacement of A. fumigatus spent medium for harvesting studies, the harvesting process was significantly faster (p < 0.05) till 4 h compared to that with glucose. Further experiments indicated that metabolically active A. fumigatus produced GlcNAc from glucose. Concanavalin A staining and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) analysis of A. fumigatus spent medium- as well as GlcNAc-incubated C. pyrenoidosa cells suggested the presence of GlcNAc on its cell surface indicated by dark red dots and GlcNAc-specific peaks, while no such characteristic dots or peaks were observed in normal C. pyrenoidosa cells. HR-TEM (High-resolution Transmission electron microscopy) showed the formation of serrated edges on the C. pyrenoidosa cell surface after treatment with A. fumigatus spent medium or GlcNAc, while Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed an increase in roughness of the C. pyrenoidosa cells surface upon incubation with A. fumigatus spent medium. Conclusions: Results strongly suggest that GlcNAc present in A. fumigatus spent medium induces surface changes in C. pyrenoidosa cells that mediate the attachment to A. fumigatus hyphae. Thus, this study provides a better understanding of the A. fumigatus-assisted C. pyrenoidosa harvesting process. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents a techno-economic assessment of three novel routes for the production of bio-based aromatics from lignin. It aims to provide insights into their feasibility and hotspots at an early stage of development to guide further research and development and to facilitate commercialization. The lignin conversion routes are: (non-catalytic) lignin pyrolysis, direct hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), and hydrothermal upgrading (HyThUp). The products generated are mixed oxygenated aromatic monomers (MOAMON), light organics, heavy organics, and char. For the technical assessment, conceptual design followed by process modeling in Aspen Plus was based on experimental yields. The models generated indispensable data on material and energy flows. An economic assessment was then conducted by estimating operating and capital costs. Return on investment (ROI), payback period (PBP), and net present value (NPV) were used as key performance indicators. Downstream processing was especially demanding in the HyThUp process due to the presence of a significant flow rate of water in the system, which significantly increased external utility requirements. Due to complex separations, the HyThUp process showed the highest capital cost (35% more than pyrolysis). Operating costs were the highest for the direct HDO process (34% more than pyrolysis) due to the use of hydrogen. Overall, the direct HDO process showed the highest ROI (12%) and the shortest PBP (5 years) due to high yields of valuable heavy organics (32%) and MOAMON (24%). Direct HDO was found to be feasible with a positive NPV based on prices used in the assessment. Among the three processes investigated, the direct HDO process therefore appeared to be the most promising, and consideration should be given to further development and commercialization of this process. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The denitrification of bio-oil remains an important challenge in bio-oil quality upgrading. Microalgae (MA) and sweet potato waste (SPW) were co-liquefied to investigate the denitrification of Mannich reaction. The influence of interaction reaction between MA and SPW on products qualities was explored. The results showed that the N contents of bio-oils from co-liquefaction (4.44–7.19%) were lower than that from microalgae (7.60%). Besides, the ester contents from MA&SPW (60.31–73.17%) were higher than that from MA (56.11%) and SPW (17.55%).The addition of SPW decreased the lubricating oil and fuel oil content. The experimental energy recovery efficiency (66.82–70.16%) was higher than the calculated energy recovery efficiency (65.68–66.69%) during co-liquefaction processes. Based on chemical compositions of products, a possible reaction pathway of Mannich reaction during co-liquefaction process was proposed. The current study suggested that co-liquefaction of microalgae and sweet potato waste was a feasibility way to improve the bio-oil quality and energy recovery efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to fast exploitation and consumption of fossil resources, efficient transformation of renewable biomass would be of vital significance for the production of biofuels and value-added chemicals. Here, we developed new alumina microsphere (AMS) supported bimetallic NiCu catalysts with a hierarchical flower-like architecture for highly efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation of biomass-derived ethyl levulinate (EL) to γ-valerolactone (GVL), which were derived from flower-like core-shell structured AMS@Ni-Cu-Al layered double hydroxide precursors (AMS@NiCuAl-LDH). Various characterizations demonstrated that the reduction of NiCuAl-LDH precursors in situ grown on the AMS could generate bimetallic NiCu alloy nanoparticles embedded into surface standing and intercrossed LDH-derived alumina nanoplatelets (ANPs), thereby forming a novel hierarchical multilevel AMS@NiCu@ANPs superstructure. As-fabricated bimetallic NiCu catalyst with 0.5 Cu/Ni molar ratio exhibited enhanced activity for catalytic transfer hydrogenation, in comparison with monometallic and other bimetallic ones, owing to the synergy between Ni-Cu species in highly dispersed bimetallic NiCu nanoparticles, i.e., the electronic effect, favorable surface acid-base property, and highly porous architecture. Moreover, the catalyst possessed good stability and recyclability, due to strong interactions between ANPs and AMS support, as well as between NiCu NPs and ANPs matrix. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of lignocellulosic biomass has been widely investigated for the production of renewable and alternative bio-crude oil. In this study, catalytic hydrothermal processing of two biomasses (larch and Mongolian oak) was performed using different K2CO3 concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 wt% of solvent) to improve fuel yield and properties. HTL oil, hydrochar, water-soluble fraction (WSF) and gas were characterized, and carbon balance was investigated. As a result, the maximum yield of HTL oil, 27.7 wt% (Mongolian oak) and 25.7 wt% (larch), and the highest carbon conversion ratio was obtained with 0.5 wt% of catalyst. The high catalyst concentration also resulted in an increase in higher heating values up to 31.9 MJ/kg. In addition, the amount of organic compounds in HTL oil also increased, specifically for lignin-derived compounds including catechol and hydroquinone which can be derived from secondary hydrolysis of lignin. On the other hand, formation of hydrochar was suppressed with the addition of alkali catalyst and the yield dramatically decreased from 30.7–40.8 wt.% to 20.0–21.8 wt.%. Furthermore, it was revealed that WSF had low organic carbon content less than 3.4% and high potassium content mostly derived from alkali catalyst, indicating that it may be reusable with simple purification. This work suggests that the addition of the proper amount of alkali catalyst can improve the production efficiency and quality of bio-crude oil, and another potential of WSF to be recyclable in further work. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The production of bio-fuels as a substitute for crude oil is steadily increasing. The reactions producing bio-fuels need detailed analysis concerning mechanism and reaction kinetics to increase yield. Standard analytical methods provide a way to monitor the reaction in real-time but detailing the mechanism through chemical shift fingerprinting is not possible using these methods. The reaction kinetics during biofuel production can be followed in real-time by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy by passing reaction mixture through the magnet. The present work reports the use of desktop NMR spectroscopy for a real-time study of the transesterification of triglycerides (vegetable oil) with methanol for formation of methyl esters (biodiesel) to detail catalytic activity, reaction mechanism and kinetics. The reaction was investigated for different catalyst concentrations, different molar ratios of reactants, and different temperatures. The changes in the chemical shift of the hydroxyl protons in the reaction mixture resulting from changing catalyst concentration and temperature provide information about the role of the catalyst in the aqueous and organic phases. The reaction was determined to be mass transfer controlled in the initial stage and kinetically controlled at later stage depending upon the reaction conditions. Analysis of the reaction for different molar ratios of oil and biodiesel and for increasing methanol concentration suggests the formation of dimers. The time variation of the methyl ester (bio-diesel) concentration was determined by partial least squares regression (PLS-R) using high-field NMR spectroscopy as reference. To obtain rate constants for each reaction the kinetics were modeled assuming fatty acid methyl esters as major product, and mono and diglycerides as intermediates. The 95% confidence intervals were derived by a Monte-Carlo analysis. The reaction kinetics are compared to those obtained by peak fitting of low-field spectra. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The CYP152 family member OleTJE from Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456 has been well-known to catalyze the unusual one-step decarboxylation of free fatty acids towards the formation of terminal alkenes. Efforts to tune up its decarboxylation activity for better production of biological alkenes have been extensively explored via approaches such as site-directed mutagenesis and electron source engineering, but with limited success. To gain more insights into the decarboxylation mechanism and reaction bifurcation (decarboxylation versus hydroxylation), we turned to an alternative approach to explore the natural CYP152 resources for a better variety of enzyme candidates. Results: We biochemically characterized three new P450 fatty acid decarboxylases including OleTJH, OleTSQ and OleTSA, with respect to their substrate specificity, steady-state kinetics, and salt effects. These enzymes all act as an OleTJE-like fatty acid decarboxylase being able to decarboxylate a range of straight-chain saturated fatty acids (C8-C20) to various degrees. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis to the lower activity P450 enzyme OleTSA revealed a number of key amino acid residues within the substrate-binding pocket (T47F, I177L, V319A and L405I) that are important for delicate substrate positioning of different chain-length fatty acids and thus the decarboxylation versus hydroxylation chemoselectivity, in particular for the mid-chain fatty acids (C8-C12). In addition, the three new decarboxylases exhibited optimal catalytic activity and stability at a salt concentration of 0.5 M, and were thus classified as moderate halophilic enzymes. Conclusion: The P450 fatty acid decarboxylases OleTJE, OleTJH, OleTSQ and OleTSA belong to a novel group of moderate halophilic P450 enzymes. OleTJH from Jeotgalicoccus halophilus shows the decarboxylation activity, kinetic parameters, as well as salt tolerance and stability that are comparable to OleTJE. Site-directed mutagenesis of several key amino acid residues near substrate-binding pocket provides important guidance for further engineering of these P450 fatty acid decarboxylases that hold promising application potential for production of α-olefin biohydrocarbons. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuel production is seen in many countries around the world as an alternative fuel with less carbon footprint and GHG emission compared to the fossil fuels. Biofuel methyl ester is produced using transesterification process, a blend of triglycerides and alcohol that is made for running automotive engine. As the demand on biodiesel increased, more research studies needs to be done on the current diesel engine for replacing the diesel fuel by the biodiesel. Engine performance, emission, roughness are the major concerns for the automotive industry. An experimental combustion test was conducted on a Ricardo E6 single cylinder variable compression indirect injection engine, for three different liquid biofuels compared to baseline diesel fuel. The biofuels are Jojoba Methyl Ester (JME), Algae Methyl Ester (AME), and Chocolate Waste Methyl Ester (CME). Two main sets of experiments were conducted; in the first experiment, the engine load was varied from 0.5 to 15 Nm at a fixed speed, injection timing and compression ratio, while in the second fuel injection timing is varied from 20° before top dead center (BTDC) to 45° BTDC, at constant speed, load and compression ratio. The emission levels of CO, CO2, NOx, SOx and unburned hydrocarbons were measured, and the engine roughness, measured in (dP/dθ)max. JME showed an increase in pollution levels while AME decreased significantly the pollution levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL), a biofuel additive for petroleum and biodiesel can also be used as a 100% fuel to replace petroleum diesel with the existing diesel engine. The major problem to make the EL process economical is the lack of a proper conversion technology to convert C6 sugars such as glucose with higher yield of EL as well as process which can tolerate higher glucose concentration to increase productivity. The present study highlighted the catalytic synthesis of EL from glucose over synergetic combination of zeolite H-USY and Lewis acidic catalysts such as Sn-beta, TiO2, ZrO2, and SnO2. Because of the strong Lewis acidic nature and the subsequent enhancement in the isomerization rate from glucosides to fructosides, the synergetic combination of H-USY with SnO2 showed higher EL yield than the combination with other Lewis acidic catalysts. So far, the highest EL yield of 81% from glucose (50 g/L) at 180 °C in 3 h was achieved over the optimal combination of 95% H-USY and 5% SnO2 having strong/weak acidity and B/L ratios of 1.30 and 0.75, respectively. The study was further extended for establishing the proposed reaction mechanism without the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, levulinic acid, and formic acid which makes the overall process clean and green. © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pyrolysis is an efficient thermochemical route to obtain biofuels in the form of bio-oil, biochar and pyrolytic gas from the processing of biomass. Pyrolysis experiments were performed with teak sawdust to determine the yield and main characteristics of solid, liquid and gaseous products. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 400–700 °C in 100 °C intervals, nitrogen flow rate of 150–250 mL/min, packed bed height in between 2 and 8 cm and particle size in between 0.18 and 0.60 mm. The maximum bio-oil and biochar yield were observed at 600 °C (48.8%) and 400 °C (37.42%), respectively. Physical properties (viscosity, density, carbon residue, pH and HHV) of bio-oil were determined and the chemical properties were investigated using FTIR and GC–MS. Further, biochar was characterized with proximate, ultimate, HHV, FTIR, SEM-EDX, BET surface area and XRD analysis. Non-condensable gases coming out during pyrolysis were analyzed using gas chromatography and amount of H 2 , CH 4 , CO and CO 2 were determined. According to characterization results, bio-oil can be used as biofuel after up gradation or as source of valuable chemicals, biochar can be utilized as solid fuel or seems to be suitable in waste stream purification as it has very high BET surface area. In addition, pyrolytic gases have significant amount of methane and hydrogen that provides good combustion properties. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - How to exert the value-added superiority was a key link in the development of biomass valorization that heightens an appeal for a waste-minimized protocol. The fractional use of three building blocks in biomass became an urgent challenge to be faced. Herein, we report an autohydrolysis-aided biorefinery for the sequential conversion of wheat straw hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin into xylooligosaccharides (XOS), fermentable glucose and lithium-sulfur cathode at the end of the process, respectively. The yield of XOS (DP of 2–6) reached up to 24.06% (w/w) of xylan and 6.19% (w/w) of the initial biomass. The hydrothermal treatment removed the amorphous portion and disrupted the rigid structure, thereby improving the cellulose digestibility from 14.1 to 88.9%. The molecular weights, functional groups and structural features of residual lignin after enzymatic hydrolysis were thoroughly explored for the cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries via the carbonizing process. Because of the considerable surface area, the covalent linkage between the lignin-derived carbon (LC) and sulfur, and the uniform dispersion of sulfur particles, the developed LC@S cathode exhibited excellent rate capability, and the specific capacity of 1238, 1085 and 1035 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 C, respectively. The LC@S cathode retained 596 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C with a coulombic efficiency of 92%. The present study provides a systematic strategy that bears the primary responsibility for exploiting biomass into a potential feedstock with worthwhile functions in the thriving domains of chemicals, biofuels and energy storage devices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic co-pyrolysis process of Enteromorpha clathrata (EN) and rice husk (HU) was studied in a fixed bed reactor with ZSM-5 and MCM-41 catalysts at 550 °C. The yields and product distribution were compared when EN, HU and different mass ratios of EN and HU were pyrolyzed with or without catalysts. Bio-oil products were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and bio-char products were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Under co-pyrolysis conditions without catalysts, the experimental yield of bio-gas was higher than the theoretical. In contrast, the yield of bio-oil was lower than the theoretical. In the catalytic pyrolysis, ZSM-5 significantly improved the yield of bio-oil and reduced the bio-gas product. However, the effect of MCM-41 on the yield of the pyrolysis products was weaker than that of ZSM-5. In the GC–MS analysis of bio-oil with catalysts, ZSM-5 showed a catalytic effect on the decomposition of hemicellulose and protein. The protein was further cracked, and the relative content of hydrocarbon component also increased. With MCM-41 catalyst, there was significant catalytic effect on lignin and lipid, and the result showed that MCM-41 had a further catalytic influence in the synergetic effect of co-pyrolysis. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal is a serious environmental issue requiring immediate solution and good waste management strategy. Mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) plants offer the opportunity to reduce the amount of MSW that is, otherwise, disposed of in landfills. Up to 40% of MSW is converted to waste fuel, also called refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Gasification is a promising alternative of RDF processing. It can be defined as high temperature treatment of the feedstock with lower than stoichiometric amount of oxygen resulting mainly in a gaseous product (syngas). High hydrogen content, specific ratio of H 2 /CO, and low tar content are important parameters of syngas for its application in both energy production and chemical synthesis. Reduction of tar content in syngas can be achieved by catalytic tar cracking. In this work, a catalyst prepared from natural clay was characterised by thermogravimetric, specific surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. Catalyst activity was tested in two reactions, namely in decomposition of model tar constituent, p-xylene, and in cracking of tar produced in RDF gasification experiments. Influence of the reaction temperature and the amount of catalyst on the p-xylene conversion and products’ distribution was studied. The results proved high catalytic activity of the prepared catalyst in the decomposition of p-xylene. Coupled RDF pyrolysis and the produced volatiles gasification experiments were carried out in a two-stage laboratory scale reactor using a bed of tar cracking catalyst in the second stage. Tar decomposition experiments were carried out at the reactor temperatures of 700–850 °C applying different amounts of catalyst (0.75 g, 1 g, 1.25 g, 1.5 g, 2 g and 4 g) per 1 g of pyrolised RDF. Results indicate that the presence of catalyst had significant effect on both tar cracking efficiency and gas composition. Loss of the catalyst specific surface area was observed when the experiments were carried out at temperatures exceeding 800 °C. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Steam reforming of simulated bio-oil (ethanol, acetone, phenol, and acetic acid) and phenol has been studied on K-Ni-Cu-Mg-Ce-O/Al 2 O 3 composite catalysts. Complementary characterization techniques, such as nitrogen sorption, XRD, H 2 -TPR, H 2 -TPD, CO-TPD, CO-DRIFTS, and in situ XPS, were used to correlate surface structure and functionality to catalytic performance of potassium (K) doped catalysts. K doping of the Ni-Cu-Mg-Ce-O/Al 2 O 3 catalyst created a Ni°/Ni 2+ mixed active phase, which not only enhanced steam reforming activity, but also suppressed the methanation reaction. In addition, K doping changed the surface acid-basic properties of the catalyst, which instead favor the gasifcation and water-gas shift reactions. With the combination of these effects, K doping of Ni-Cu-Mg-Ce-O/Al 2 O 3 catalysts led to higher C1 yield and much lower methane formation, favoring hydrogen production in steam reforming of both phenol and simulated bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biodiesel production has led to a drastic surplus of glycerol and catalytic conversion of glycerol into value-added products is of great industrial importance. Thus, the acetalization of glycerol with ketone or aldehydes allows the glycerol transformation into bio–additive fuels. In this work, metals-containing vanadium oxides nanotubes (MeVOx NT in which, Me = Co, Pt or Ni) have been synthesized with additional internal porosity and tested in the acetalization of glycerol with acetone (AG) for valuable biofuels production. The catalysts showed remarkable performances in the AG reaction. Furthermore, by variation of the composition, catalyst loading and temperature and using distinct substrates (butyraldehyde, furfuraldehyde and benzaldehyde), NiVOxNT is active, being very selective to solketal and reciclable for 4 times in the AG reaction. On the contrary, pure VOx NT easily deactivated due to the structure agent removal during the reaction, which promote the collapse of the tubular structure. The CoVOxNT and PtVOxNT catalysts did not exhibit such a stable structure and easily deactivated in the reaction due to leaching of the metals oxides during the AG. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Organosolv lignin extracted from the four representative lignocellulose feeds of oil palm empty fruit bunch (agricultural waste), oak (hardwood), pine (softwood) and Miscanthus giganteus (grass) is depolymerized using Ru/H-zeolite β to produce phenolic hydrocarbons. The bulky methoxy functionality, which is rich in oak and pine, sterically hindered the ether bonds, decreasing the yields of phenolic monomers and improving the β–β coupling to repolymerize lignin fragments. Both depolymerization and repolymerization are improved at a higher reaction temperature. The structures and the reaction behavior of organosolv lignin are observed using NMR, GPC, N2-physisorption, SEM and DLS analysis methods. © 2018 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Oil palm biomass is a non-woody lignocellulosic biomass that has a high potential at the south of Thailand for biofuels and bioenergy applications. Pyrolysis of oil palm biomass to produce biofuels such as bio-oil, biochar, and pyrolysis gas is still challenging. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the yields and qualities of pyrolysis products obtained from oil palm trunk (OPT), oil palm fronds (OPF), and oil palm shell (OPS) using an agitated bed pyrolysis reactor. These biomasses were pyrolyzed at pyrolysis temperatures of 400, 450, and 500°C while the other operating parameters were fixed. The results showed that the different types of oil palm biomass and pyrolysis temperatures affected the product yields and qualities. The OPF pyrolyzed at 500°C provided the highest liquid yield. The liquid product contained a relatively high water content with a low pH value, leading to highly-oxygenated compounds as indicated by gas chromatography-electron ionization/mass spectroscopy technique (GC-EI/MS). The higher heating value (HHV) of the liquid product was 18.95-22.52 MJ/kg. The biochar had a relatively high HHV ranging from 25.14 to 28.45 MJ/kg. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the resultant biochar had a porous structure surface with a surface area of 1.15-4.43 m2/g as indicated by BET. The pyrolysis gas contained a low composition of combustible gases, leading to a low HHV. © 2019 BRTeam. All rights reserved.

AB  - A self-powered electrochemical sensing platform is fabricated to sensitively detect protein based on capacitor signal amplification and one-compartment glucose/O2 enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). SnS2 nanoflowers/Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and DNA-carbon nanotubes bioconjugate/AuNPs are prepared and modified on carbon paper as electrode substrates. The sandwiched structure to craft bioanodes is elaborately designed to dramatically enhance the open circuit voltage of the device, triggered by protein coupled with the DNA bioconjugate containing glucose oxidase and aptamer. The EBFCs-based aptasensor will subsequently catalyze glucose oxidation in the presence of the target thrombin (TB). More importantly, a commercial capacitor is also introduced into EBFCs to accumulate charge for a higher instantaneous current. This will result in a significantly amplified readout signal, which can be efficiently captured by digital multimeter. The open circuit voltage can be tuned with target TB concentration ranging from 0.02 to 5 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 7.90 pg/mL. Once the capacitor is charged by EBFCs, a sensitivity of 42.4 μA/(ng/mL) can be discharged with an increase of 18.4 times than that of pure EBFCs. Furthermore, this capacitor/EBFC hybrid device can be extended as a common platform for the quantitative determination of other proteins and has a great clinical analysis potential. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new cathodic catalyst is introduced for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs) by enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) consisting of the glucose oxidation reaction (GOR and partial ORR) and H2O2 reduction reaction (HRR). In this catalyst, glucose oxidase (GOx) and hemin are used for promoting both the partial ORR and HRR, respectively. The hemin is attached onto polyethyleneimine (PEI) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (CNT/[PEI/hemin]), while GOx is conjugated with poly acrylic acid (PAA) (PAA/GOx). The two structures are then connected to each other ({CNT/[PEI/hemin]}/{PAA/GOx}). According to electrochemical evaluations of this catalyst, the onset potential is positively shifted (0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and the current density increases considerably (522 μA cm-2) by the use of the PEI/hemin composite and PAA/GOx conjugate. The maximum power density of an EBC using this catalyst is 255 ± 2.8 μW cm-2, which is a comparable level to previously reported excellent results. This is due to the facile relay between the partial ORR and HRR by the (i) proper linkage between GOx and hemin through a cascade type preparation, (ii) four step redox reaction of Fe ions within hemin and (iii) use of water swellable PAA facilitating glucose mass transfer. It is observed that the upper water swellable PAA/GOx layer promotes smooth glucose mass transfer of glucose fuel and produces a sufficient amount of H2O2 by the partial ORR. The produced H2O2 is further reduced by the HRR at positive potential. The chemical structure and the degree of enzyme immobilization of the best catalyst are examined by EDS, XPS and glucose colorimetric assay. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this work, we report a selective and straightforward process to synthesize glycerol carbonate from urea and glycerol using a simple but commercially unavailable catalyst (Sn(OH)2). This catalyst was generated in situ from the reaction of Sn(ii) halides and urea during the glycerol carbonatation process. Effects of main reaction parameters (i.e., temperature, molar ratio of urea to glycerol, catalyst concentration) were investigated. Different tin halides were assessed as catalytic precursors, with SnCl2 being the most efficient. We found that Sn(OH)2-catalyzed glycerol carbonation reactions with urea achieved high conversion and selectivity (ca. 87 and 85%, respectively). The samples of Sn(OH)2 generated in situ or previously synthesized were equally active and selective catalysts toward glycerol carbonate were successfully reutilized without loss activity. This is a very attractive route based on two inexpensive and readily available feedstocks in a chemical cycle that, overall, results in the chemical fixation of carbon dioxide and, concomitantly, adds value to glycerol, a biodiesel byproduct. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - A mobile pyrolysis unit, designed to process biomass at a rate of 83.3 kg h −1 (two metric tons per day, MTPD) has been developed, constructed and its operation demonstrated for on-farm or in-forest production of pyrolysis oil (bio-oil). The trailer-mounted pyrolysis apparatus is based on the combustion reduction integrated pyrolysis system (CRIPS), a patented, dual fluidized bed, biomass pyrolysis design developed by USDA and the University of Pretoria. The mobile design goal was to demonstrate efficacy of on-farm production and coordinate station-to-station operation to simulate a collective system of several unit operations within a distributed/satellite system of pyrolysis biorefinery. Key design features that provide utility for remote operations including in-situ (on-trailer) generation of heat and electric power required for self-sufficiency were tested at this scale. Extensive trials on three feedstocks important to US agriculture, namely woody biomass, switchgrass and horse litter, were conducted. The results show that a processing rate of up to 40 kg h −1 (approximately 1 MTPD) was successful and easily achievable for the said biomass on the trailer; however, beyond this rate operational problems such as pressure imbalances between the dual-bed reactors were encountered, hampering process control. The operation of the CRIPS under catalytic pyrolysis conditions was also successful with catalyst regeneration readily achievable with the design. Bio-oil yield for neat/traditional and catalytic pyrolysis were in the 45% and 5–10% ranges respectively, similar to lab scale, demonstrating production of large volumes of bio-oil on-farm. Bio-oil quality for catalytic pyrolysis was consistent over several hours on stream due to continuous catalyst regeneration that the design affords yielding high levels of BTEX compounds; however, deactivation due to alkali contamination was noticeable at cumulative biomass to catalyst ratios of &gt; 6/1. Compared with laboratory scale results, non-catalytic pyrolysis product quality for the demonstration scale wavered between that of regular pyrolysis oil produced under nitrogen atmosphere and that of the tail-gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP) as partial recycle of effluent gas was possible with the mounted CRIPS design. With successful demonstration at 1 MTPD capacity the mobile system meets the technology readiness level for pre-commercial design suggested for blueprints (i.e. development of full-scale prototype), however more testing is underway to remove the bottlenecks impeding operation at the full-scale design. © 2018

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass offers a renewable carbon source which can be anaerobically digested to produce short-chain carboxylic acids. Here, we assess fuel properties of oxygenates accessible from catalytic upgrading of these acids a priori for their potential to serve as diesel bioblendstocks. Ethers derived from C2 and C4 carboxylic acids are identified as advantaged fuel candidates with significantly improved ignition quality (&gt;56% cetane number increase) and reduced sooting (&gt;86% yield sooting index reduction) when compared to commercial petrodiesel. The prescreening process informed conversion pathway selection toward a C11 branched ether, 4-butoxyheptane, which showed promise for fuel performance and health- and safety-related attributes. A continuous, solvent-free production process was then developed using metal oxide acidic catalysts to provide improved thermal stability, water tolerance, and yields. Liter-scale production of 4- butoxyheptane enabled fuel property testing to confirm predicted fuel properties, while incorporation into petrodiesel at 20 vol % demonstrated 10% improvement in ignition quality and 20% reduction in intrinsic sooting tendency. Storage stability of the pure bioblendstock and 20 vol % blend was confirmed with a common fuel antioxidant, as was compatibility with elastomeric components within existing engine and fueling infrastructure. Technoeconomic analysis of the conversion process identified major cost drivers to guide further research and development. Life-cycle analysis determined the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 271% relative to petrodiesel, depending on treatment of coproducts. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background: The development of renewable and sustainable biofuels to cover the future energy demand is one of the most challenging issues of our time. Biohydrogen, produced by photosynthetic microorganisms, has the potential to become a green biofuel and energy carrier for the future sustainable world, since it provides energy without CO2 emission. The recent development of two alternative protocols to induce hydrogen photoproduction in green algae enables the function of the O2-sensitive [FeFe]-hydrogenases, located at the acceptor side of photosystem I, to produce H2 for several days. These protocols prevent carbon fixation and redirect electrons toward H2 production. In the present work, we employed these protocols to a knockout Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant lacking flavodiiron proteins (FDPs), thus removing another possible electron competitor with H2 production. Results: The deletion of the FDP electron sink resulted in the enhancement of H2 photoproduction relative to wild-type C. reinhardtii. Additionally, the lack of FDPs leads to a more effective obstruction of carbon fixation even under elongated light pulses. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the rather simple adjustment of cultivation conditions together with genetic manipulation of alternative electron pathways of photosynthesis results in efficient re-routing of electrons toward H2 photoproduction. Furthermore, the introduction of a short recovery phase by regular switching from H2 photoproduction to biomass accumulation phase allows to maintain cell fitness and use photosynthetic cells as long-term H2-producing biocatalysts. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel production processes using soybean as feedstock generates soybean cake and crude glycerol as by-products. These by-product streams were used as sole feedstocks for the production of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) using two bacterial strains of Citrobacter freundii. Soybean cake has been converted into a nutrient-rich hydrolysate by crude enzymes produced via solid state fermentation. The effect of initial glycerol and free amino nitrogen concentration on bacterial growth and PDO production has been evaluated in batch bioreactor cultures showing that C. freundii VK-19 is a more efficient PDO producer than C. freundii FMCC-8. The cultivation of C. freundii VK-19 in fed-batch bioreactor cultures using crude glycerol and soybean cake hydrolysates led to PDO concentration of 47.4 g/L with yield and productivity of 0.49 g/g and 1.01 g/L/h, respectively. The effect of PDO, metabolic by-products, and sodium and potassium salts on bacterial growth was evaluated showing that potassium salts initially enhance bacterial growth, whereas sodium salts cause significant inhibition to bacterial growth. Soybean cake hydrolysate and crude glycerol could be utilized for PDO production, but the fermentation efficiency is influenced by the catalyst used during biodiesel production. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present study, three different solvents – ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran and petroleum ether – were used to extract bio-crude from a hydrothermal liquefaction product mixture obtained from canola meal and waste wheat flour. The bio-crude yields and the ease of extraction were compared for each of the solvents to evaluate the efficacy of the solvent-extraction process and to determine the most suitable solvent for the same. Among the three solvents, ethyl acetate was identified as the most favourable option for solvent-extraction. The extraction carried out using ethyl acetate yielded significantly large amounts (bio-crude yield: 31.8 wt%) of an easy-to-handle, high quality bio-crude that is most suitable for further upgrading processes and eventual bio-diesel applications. The bio-crude extracted using ethyl acetate had a higher heating value of 46.0 MJ/kg, an oxygen content of 9.2 wt% and an ash content of 0.1 wt%. The aforementioned bio-crude exhibited the highest oxidation stability at room temperature with an induction period of 86.5 days and had a significant percentage of its compounds in the C13-C24 carbon range. The amounts of nitrogen and sulphur were quite low in all the bio-crude samples. Silica polymorphs such as quartz and α-cristobalite, along with calcium mica, were the dominant phases in all the bio-residue samples. The bio-residue obtained using ethyl acetate had the highest specific surface area (249 m2/g) among the three bio-residue samples with an average pore volume of 0.37 cm3/g and an average pore size of 7 nm. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production from renewable resources is becoming an increasingly attractive option given the depletion of fossil fuels and the environmental problems caused by the excessive use of unsustainable energy resources. In this study, an efficient approach is provided for high-quality oxygen-containing fuel production from renewable lignin bio-oil. The results demonstrate that the calcination temperature has a remarkable effect on the catalyst structure, surface Ni content and physico-chemical properties of the Ni/MgO material, all of which result in significantly different performances in the upgrading of lignin bio-oil. At 160 °C for 4 h and 3 MPa of hydrogen, a 98% lignin bio-oil model compound of guaiacol is converted with 97% cyclohexanol selectivity in the presence of 15% Ni/MgO-850. Furthermore, the optimized catalytic system is reusable and shows good catalytic performance in the upgrading of both light and heavy lignin bio-oils, indicating that it is a promising strategy for renewable lignocellulosic biomass valorization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a rapid increase in the air pollution level of the earth atmosphere due to the extreme demand and usage of the petroleum products. The demand has accelerated the recent research to explore an environment-friendly fuels suitable for the performance on the diesel engine. The optimization of the engine parameters using RSM with combination of taguchi method is an important aspect which generates an important optimized model for the responses. In the present study, an investigation of optimum performance and emission parameters of an engine fuelled with jojoba biodiesel is presented. The study also includes the optimization of input parameters to attain corresponding optimal thermal performance of the engine. The input parameters are injection pressure, injection timing of fuel, percentage blends of jojoba based biodiesel and engine load whereas the corresponding output responses such as brake thermal efficiency, peak cylinder pressure, exhaust gas temperature, and hydrocarbon emission are considered for the optimization during the investigation. The experimental design used in the study is based on a central composite rotating design matrix. The best combination of input parameters is recorded at 25°bTDC injection timing of fuel, 21.52 MPa injection pressure of fuel, 24% mixing of jojoba biodiesel with diesel, and 80% engine load which maximum BTE and Pmax minimum EGT and UHC emission of the engine. Experimental and optimized results of the output responses at optimum input parameters are compared and they were found to be in the suggested error range. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the search for environmentally friendly solutions to produce clean fuels, the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis arises as a promising alternative when using syngas obtained from biomass to produce kerosene. Fe-based catalysts are typically used in this process. The addition of chemical promoters can improve the activity of these catalysts. Thus, in this work, Fe-based materials were prepared by precipitation of iron oxides and the subsequent addition of K (3% wt.), Mo and Co (6 wt%) by impregnation. Catalytic tests were carried out for 60 h at 250 °C and 20 bar in a fixed-bed reactor using syngas with a H2:CO:N2 molar ratio of 6:3:1. The addition of K and Co stabilized catalytic activity, while the selectivity to kerosene range hydrocarbon was increased up to 30%. In addition, Co and K co-promoted catalysts reached the highest CO conversion and kerosene selectivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, due to its low cost there has been increased attention on Animal Waste Fats (AWFs)as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Advanced microwave technology has also been reported by many researchers to enhance the transesterification in biodiesel production. However, esterification of free fatty acids in the feedstock reported here has not attracted so much attention. AWFs come with its challenges namely, high free fatty acid (FFA)content and high water content. This study utilizes AWFs (tallow)containing very large amount of FFA; (25 wt%, 18 wt%, and 9.4 wt% FFA/AWFs)as feedstock for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)production. A simple thermal pre-treatment technique followed microwave assisted esterification with methanol (MeOH)was conducted in a batch process to reduce the FFA content to as low as 1 wt% FFA, which is then suitable for the alkaline transesterification process. The pre-treatment of AWFs at 88 °C to first reduce water and decrease viscosity, followed by an operating microwave power of 70 W producing a power density 1.147 mW/m3, achieved a 15% increase in reduction of FFA over 30 W microwave power and conventional thermal method. Under optimum conditions, using 2.0 wt.wt% sulphuric acid catalyst/AWFs and 1:6 M ratio AWF/MeOH, the FFA conversion of 93 wt % was achieved. The results indicated that the pre-treatment and microwave application provided a faster route to high FFA reduction of AWFs during esterification process. The proposed technology is promising for the potential scale up industrial application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Low carbon emission has a major positive impact on our society. Due to the importance of reducing carbon emission levels, factors that contribute significantly towards reducing carbon emission levels have attracted the interest of academics and researchers in the field. In this paper, the author develops a multiple linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between renewable energy consumption, biofuel production, resources productivity, bioenergy productivity, the level of urbanization and population and their impact on total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Data was collected from the European Statistical Office (EUROSTAT) and four statistical hypotheses were validated through a regression model with panel data using the statistical software EViews 11. The study was conducted for 27 European Union (EU) countries during 2008 to 2017. The author's findings indicate that renewables have a direct and positive influence on the levels of CO2 emissions, as opposed to population growth and urbanization. These findings suggest that public policy should be directed towards increasing the use of renewables in EU countries, while the level of urbanization and the population growth add more restrictions in the modelling equation of the impact on CO2 emissions. © 2019 by the authors.

Particularly, ethyl levulinate (EL) shows great potential as gasoline additive and substitute of biodiesel fuels. RESULTS: Hyper-cross-linked organic polymer based carbonaceous materials with large surface areas and strong Brϕnsted acidity were synthesized and developed as highly efficient solid acids for the direct transformation of biomass derived carbohydrates into biofuel candidate ethyl levulinate (EL). Controllable Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and proper acid density of as-prepared carbonaceous materials were demonstrated to be crucial for the successful synthesis of EL. Among the catalysts, α,α′-dichloro-p-xylene derived hyper-cross-linked organic carbocatalyst (HDS-3.6) exhibited the best results for EL formation with the optimal yield of 70.3% at a temperature of 423 K, which was comparable with those of frequently-used solid acids such as commercial Amberlyst-15 and metal oxides. The presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the catalytic system facilitated the production of intermediates 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-ethoxymethylfurfural. Notably, the hyper-cross-linked organic polymers with abundant Brϕnsted acid sites were much more effective in the catalytic synthesis of levulinate esters from ketoses. CONCLUSION: The prepared hyper-cross-linked organic polymers were efficient and robust catalysts to produce various biomass derived alkyl levulinates with high activity and stability. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Lipid extraction from microalgae is maximized by defining the optimal operating conditions of the microwave pretreatment method. Using the experimental data, a robust model that describes the lipid extraction is generated using fuzzy logic. Then, the optimal extraction conditions of the lipid are determined using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Three different operating parameters influence on the recovered lipid from Microalgae. These parameters are power (W), heating time (min), and extraction time (h). Accordingly, during the optimization process, these parameters are used as a decision variables for PSO optimizer in order to maximize the recovered lipid that used as a cost function. The resulting plots demonstrated a well-fitting between the fuzzy model and the experimental data. Based on the built model, the optimization process achieved a significant increase in the lipid extraction by 22% compared to that obtained experimentally and using the ANOVA. © 2019

AB  - Sustainable approaches for the anaerobic digestion treatment of food waste to minimize environmental challenges and recover energy are some economic goals receiving global attention. Meeting global bio-energy demand from food waste and associated waste residues requires exploring alternative optimization routes. Pyrolysis process for the treatment and recycling of difficult biodegradable fractions in food waste processing facility, and the subsequent utilization of real syngas in anaerobic digestion as a food waste treatment were investigated to evaluate their effects on biofuel production via bio-methanation. Different proportions of syngas that are transformed into methane show that the carbon monoxide content in the reactors (G21, G23, G61, and G63) was completely degraded on 195, 195, 95, and 145 h. The higher hydrogen concentration in the simulated syngas expedites the carbon monoxide degradation rate. Application of two-stage pyrolysis to difficult biodegradable fractions treatment generated real syngas (Hydrogen 60: Carbon monoxide 20 vol%) for improved bio-methanation (100% methane) compared to the blank. The simulated syngas from the anaerobic digestion treatment of food waste generated methane (75–80%) than the control (45%). Results from both the simulated and real syngas show that high volume percent of hydrogen in the syngas positively influenced the degradation and transformation of carbon monoxide and promoted a higher rate of bio-methanation. Further study showed that pH values in the range 7.21–7.78, and low concentrations of volatile fatty acids and ammonia nitrogen indicated no toxicity from syngas bio-methanation with anaerobic digestion. This route is beneficial for enhancing the value of resources recovered from difficult biodegradable fractions pyrolysis, achieving a higher bio-methanation rate, and improving sludge stabilization with anaerobic digestion treatment of food waste. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A bifunctional Ni-HPMo/Fe3O4@Al-MCM-41 catalyst was prepared by impregnation method and used for the liquefaction of switchgrass in isobutanol/water mixed solvents. It was found that the introduction of Al species into MCM-41 could improve its catalytic performance of catalyst by enhancing the acidity and stability of mesoporous silica. The grafting of HPMo onto the Al-MCM-41 materials not only greatly increased the acidity but also enhanced the acid strength, with an optimal HPMo loading amount in the catalyst of 20 wt%. There was a clear effect of the catalyst on product yield and quality. A switchgrass conversion of 84.7% and a liquid yield of 55.0% could be obtained under the optimal conditions. Reuse of the catalyst indicated that it had a stable catalytic activity. Furthermore, the results showed that the isobutanol/water system was an efficient solvent for switchgrass liquefaction as well as the separation of higher heating value isobutanol phase products and lower heating value water phase products from the liquefaction mixture. This work thus offers an effective approach to improve the product yields and quality in biomass liquefaction by using metal-heteropolyacid bifunctional catalysts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Because H2O decreases the acidity of sulfonic acid-based catalysts and initiates catalytic side reactions, the catalytic activity and selectivity of these catalysts are often unsatisfactory in many reactions that generate H2O as a byproduct. Herein, for the first time, hydrophobic acid-functionalized biochar is prepared by a new route based on a two-step diazo grafting method using 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid as the sulfonated agent and 4-tert-butylaniline as the hydrophobic agent. The acid density and hydrophobicity can be easily regulated by the amounts of benzenesulfonic acid and tert-butylbenzene groups, respectively. The resulting catalysts have a large specific surface area of 400-700 m2/g, high acid density of greater than 2.0 mmol/g, and strong hydrophobicity with an H2O contact angle of up to 136°. Compared with Amberlyst-15 and H2SO4-sulfonated biochar, the hydrophobic acidic biochar exhibits higher activity and selectivity in the alkylation of 4-ethylphenol with phenylmethanol and of 2-methylfuran with cyclic ketones (cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone) for the production of high-density biofuels. The successful preparation of the hydrophobic acidic biochar not only results in an efficient catalyst for reaction systems in which H2O has a deleterious effect but also paves a way for the functional modification of carbonaceous materials. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel was synthesized from Schizochitrium limacinum microalgae with different methylating agents namely, methanol, dimethyl carbonate and methyl acetate. The reactions were conducted at 518–643 K at 20 MPa and methylating agent to algae ratio at 10:1. The reaction time was varied between 10 and 80 min. Conversions of >90% was observed within 40 min at 543 K for methanol system. However, the conversions were considerably lower for other systems and only 50% was observed with dimethyl carbonate after 30 min at 643 K, and 40% conversion with methyl acetate after 40 min at 643 K. The rate constants were obtained by pseudo-first order kinetic model. Based on the variation of rate constants with temperature, Arrhenius equation was used to determine the activation energy of all the three reaction systems. The reaction rates were the highest and lowest for the reaction with methanol and methyl acetate, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gasification is a very advantageous conversion process to obtain a fuel gas from organic wastes, however it also generates by-products, such as particulate and tar. These should be removed from the syngas for its smooth utilization in power generation devices and/or biofuels production. In this work, biomass gasification tests were carried out in a bench-scale fluidized bed gasifier with a ceramic filter candle filled with commercial Ni-catalyst pellets integrated in its freeboard, for the abatement of particulate and tar. The activity of catalyst was studied at different operating conditions (temperature and catalyst bed layout) and the results were analysed in terms of residual tar content and composition of the product gas. The catalyst resulted very effective, particularly in tests at higher temperature and with the partially filled candle configuration. Tars were reduced to 250 mg/Nm3 in the best case. The Ni-catalyst did not show deactivation during tests lasting 4 h. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glow-discharge plasma was utilized for treating the KOH/carbonated calcium aluminate synthesized by MCM. Treated and untreated nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, EDX-dot mapping, TEM, TGA/DSC, FTIR and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. Moreover, some analyses were performed on the catalyst after assessment its catalytic activity in the microwave-assisted transesterification reaction. Treated and untreated nanocatalyst presented Ca12Al14O33 structure as support which was covered by carbon groups. The plasma treating was significantly effect on the potassium component as surface active phase and interaction of potassium and calcium with aluminium cations such that no agglomeration of active phases with the highest crystallinity was observed. The plasma treated sample showed better textural properties than untreated nanocatalyst. The main advantage of plasma was clearly observed on the stability of the nanocatalyst that the reduction the activity of untreated sample was more than two times of those for treated nanocatalyst. The plasma treated KOH/Ca12Al14O33-C exhibited no deformation of support structure and leaching of calcium component in the reaction medium against of untreated sample. Therefore, the plasma–microwave hybrid synthesis method provides an excellent rout for preparation of surface modified nanocatalysts for biodiesel production with the highest activity and stability to decrease the production cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study reports the technical and economic feasibilities of converting sugar cane residue (bagasse) into biofuel by using novel zeolite (P) catalyst. Using silica gel, aluminum powder, and sodium hydroxide as a precursor material, zeolite (P) has been successfully fabricated by template free hydrothermal synthesis. The as-prepared catalyst is used for the conversion of sugarcane residue into valuable hydrocarbons by an autoclaving process. The effect of various parameters on catalytic and conventional (noncatalytic) pyrolysis was scrutinized and compared. It has been recognized that conventional pyrolysis (without catalyst) and catalytic pyrolysis (with Cat (I) and Cat (II)) produced 25.06%, 80.31%, and 55.26% of combustible liquid. The facial synthesis, high thermal stability, and economic and environmental feasibilities of the as-synthesized zeolite (P) makes it a promising catalyst for biofuel production from biomass. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biomass resources offer a very promising alternative to fossil fuels for the sustainable production of electricity, fuels, and chemicals. Nevertheless, the problem of deciding on the best use of biomass is highly complex, as many potential feedstocks and conversion pathways exist, each one displaying different economic and environmental performances. In this context, here we propose a network approach that combines economic and several environmental criteria together with resource availability and demand constraints to identify optimal biomass feedstocks and their conversion pathways into fuels, chemicals, and electricity. We apply this methodology to the European Union (EU) considering the biomass resources currently available and the main technologies for their conversion into valuable products. Our results show that annual savings of as much as 1.81 Gt CO2eq could be attained by exploiting biomass resources, although biomass cannot fully cover the total EU demand of ethylene, transport fuel, and electricity. The optimal environmental plan makes use of various biomass resources for power generation and biofuel production producing ethylene exclusively from naphtha. The approach presented generates valuable insight to aid policy-makers on how to sustainably use biomass resources. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Expression of d-xylose isomerase having high catalytic activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is a prerequisite for efficient and economical production of bioethanol from cellulosic biomass. Although previous studies demonstrated functional expression of several xylose isomerases (XI) in S. cerevisiae, identification of XIs having higher catalytic activity is needed. Here, we report a new strategy to improve xylose fermentation in the S. cerevisiae strain IR-2 that involves an evolutionary engineering to select top-performing XIs from eight previously reported XIs derived from various species. Results: Eight XI genes shown to have good expression in S. cerevisiae were introduced into the strain IR-2 having a deletion of GRE3 and XKS1 overexpression that allows use of d-xylose as a carbon source. Each transformant was evaluated under aerobic and micro-aerobic culture conditions. The strain expressing XI from Lachnoclostridium phytofermentans ISDg (LpXI) had the highest d-xylose consumption rate after 72 h of micro-aerobic fermentation on d-glucose and d-xylose mixed medium. To enhance LpXI catalytic activity, we performed random mutagenesis using error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which yielded two LpXI candidates, SS82 and SS92, that showed markedly improved fermentation performance. The LpXI genes in these clones carried either T63I or V162A/N303T point mutations. The SS120 strain expressing LpXI with the double mutation of T63I/V162A assimilated nearly 85 g/L d-glucose and 35 g/L d-xylose to produce 53.3 g/L ethanol in 72 h with an ethanol yield of approximately 0.44 (g/g-input sugars). An in vitro enzyme assay showed that, compared to wild-type, the LpXI double mutant in SS120 had a considerably higher V max (0.107 μmol/mg protein/min) and lower K m (37.1 mM). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that LpXI has the highest d-xylose consumption rate among the XIs expressed in IR-2 under micro-aerobic co-fermentation conditions. A combination of novel mutations (T63I and V162A) significantly improved the enzymatic activity of LpXI, indicating that LpXI-T63I/V162A would be a potential construct for highly efficient production of cellulosic ethanol. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, the use of phytohormones has been found to be expedient for improving biomass and lipid productivity for algal biofuel production. The comparative effect of phytohormones from different classes on biomass and lipid productivity, and the expression of the related genes under nitrogen-limitation is not yet explored. In the present study, the optimized concentrations of different phytohormones, auxin - indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin - gibberellic acid (GA)and cytokinin – kinetin (K)showed 45.55%, 35.94% and 37.37% increase in biomass productivity in Chlorella sorokiniana as compared to nitrogen-limited control (ON)respectively. The highest biomass productivity of 146.07 mg L −1 d −1 and relative rbcL gene expression was observed in IAA (7.5 mg L −1 )supplemented treatment. However, K (10 mg L −1 )supplementation under N-limitation showed highest lipid content of 35.85% and accD gene expression as compared to other treatments. Overall, highest lipid productivities of 50.24 and 49.43 mg L −1 d −1 were observed in optimized IAA and K supplemented treatments respectively. Findings from the present study illustrated the differential response of phytohormones from different classes on biomass and lipid enhancement, fatty acid composition and expression of related genes. These novel findings could be advantageous for the development of promising strategies for improving microalgal biomass and lipid productivity using phytohormones for sustainable biofuel production. © 2019

AB  - The main aim of this work was to assess a conceptual strategy of submerged pelletized growth of Mucor circinelloides in sugarcane vinasse under different conditions aiming at the production of lipids prone to be used in biodiesel syntheses. Industrial vinasse was characterized and then tested in its raw form as culture medium. Relatively high concentrations of lipids were observed (approximately 23%), and biomass accumulation can be enhanced by the addition of corn steep liquor (approximately 5-fold increase when compared to control). Phenolic compounds present in vinasse pose inhibitory effects in biomass and lipid accumulation. The pelletized hyphae then proceeded to a simple sieve separation, on which lipids were extracted in a microwave extraction system, with a resulting fatty acid profile that indicate a potential suitable feedstock for biodiesel production due to the balance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Emulsification is an economic route for the applications of pyrolysis bio-oil in diesel engines and industrial furnaces and heating. The oxidative reaction interaction of a number of bio-oil/diesel emulsified fuels at various bio-oil contents and bio-oil-to-emulsifier weight ratios (i.e. B/E ratios) is analyzed to provide a basis for the applications of pyrolysis bio-oil. The commercial Atlox 4914 is used as the surfactant, while a thermogravimetric analyzer is employed in the analysis. The interaction phenomena are obviously observed during the oxidative reaction of the emulsified fuels. The interaction can be partitioned into a weak antagonistic zone (≤210 °C) and a significant synergistic zone (≥210 °C). In the synergistic zone, the oxidation of the fuels is enhanced and the maximum interaction occurs at about 380 °C. A dimensionless parameter termed the synergistic index (SI) is introduced to measure the interaction degree. An increase in the bio-oil content intensifies the interaction up to around 11%, whereas increasing the B/E ratio lowers the SI value. Meanwhile, an opposite trend in the fuel reactivity and burnout temperature is exhibited. The obtained results are able to provide a strategy for the preparation of bio-oil/diesel emulsified fuels to intensify their fuel reactivity and applications in industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of biomass is one of the potential routes to convert lignocellulose material to high-value bio-fuels. In this paper, we explored the use of Zn-rich scrap tyre char, a low-value byproduct from the pyrolysis of waste scrap tyre as a catalyst for in-situ upgrading of crude bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of eucalyptus. Experiments were performed in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C with a catalyst loading of 0–80 wt% on the mass basis of biomass. The characteristics of catalyst and bio-oils were conducted extensively by different facilities, including Karl Fischer titration, XRF, CHNS, FTIR, solvent extraction, and synchrotron C K-edge XANES. A removal of 40.3% oxygen in the form of H 2 O, CO 2 and CO was confirmed upon the loading of 80 wt% scrap tyre char. Simultaneously, the bio-oil yield decreased from 33.4 wt% to 21.1 wt%. The acid-soluble inorganic species in scrap tyre char preferentially cracks the heavy hydrocarbons, thereby decreasing the yields of heavy pitch and coke. The catalyst loading is critical, triggering a rapid increase in the cracking/deoxygenation extent upon increasing the catalyst loading to 40 wt%. Afterwards, the change on the extent of deoxygenation is marginal. Based on the gaseous products, the content of CO 2 is the highest, confirming the preferential decarboxylation catalysed by scrap tyre char. In contrast, the amount of CO derived from decarbonylation reaction is nearly unchanged, suggesting an insignificant effect of scrap tyre char on this deoxygenation reaction. The catalytic performance of tyre char was also found comparable to and even slightly better than the zeolitic catalysts tested under the similar conditions in the literature. However, its catalysis mechanism is fully unknown. The abundant ZnS within tyre char has yet to be reported as a catalyst for bio-oil deoxygenation. This inorganic species is even deeply embedded and inaccessible to acid washing within the tyre char. Investigation on its detailed structure and transformation for the catalysis reactions with bio-oil are underway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of microalgae as triacylglycerides (TAG) feedstock for biodiesel is a widely researched field in the development of new technologies. In order to underpin the potential of microalgal biodiesel as a possible substitute in the biofuel industry, more detailed data is therefore required on these aspects. This study assesses the growth, TAG accumulation, kinetics of dissolved nutrients and the quality of biodiesel and its blends from the marine diatom Navicula cincta grown in a photobioreactor, using seawater enriched with nutrients and soil extract. Acid-catalyst transesterification was tested for biodiesel production. This species presented during nutrient depletion: 1) a total lipid content of 49.7% of ash-free dry weight (AFDW) with neutral lipid (mainly TAG) as the dominant fraction (ca. 81.5% of total lipids), and 2) favourable fatty acids for biodiesel, such as palmitic acid (28%) and palmitoleic acid (46%). The yield of biodiesel (B100) derived from diatom N. cincta (B NC ) and analysed by Gas Chromatography was 97.6% of FAME, being the FAME composition similar to the fatty acid profile of N. cincta neutral lipids. The fuel properties (including FAME percentage, cetane number, heat of combustion, color and sulfur content) of diatom blends prepared with petrodiesel in a 7% (B7 NC ) and 10% (B10 NC ) vol ratio were evaluated using a PetroSpec (PAC) and compared with commercial soybean blends (B7 S and B10 S ). B7 and B10 derived from N. cincta met the requirements of ASTM D6751 and presented improved cetane numbers (50.2 and 51.6, respectively) with respect to soybean blends. Furthermore, biodiesel derived from the studied species showed the lowest sulfur content (0.0056% w/w). The rapid accumulation of neutral lipids in response to natural nutrient deficiency in N. cincta and its capacity of autoflocculate are good selling points for the use of this microalga in the biofuel industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, the most important barrier in algal cultivation is growth nutrients cost. In the present study, the isolated alga Synechocystis PCC6803 was acclimatized under laboratory conditions using municipal wastewater and taken for large-scale cultivation in an open raceway pond. At the semi-continuous mode, the alga produced the highest biomass yield of 0.21 g L−1 d−1 and it was estimated that the algae could be able to produce 94.5 tones dry biomass ha−1 year−1. A low-cost study was conducted to harvest the maximum biomass recovery. The result shows that a combined use of iron (III) chloride and biopolymer enhanced the harvesting process and the maximum biomass recovery was achieved up to 98.7%. In addition, the biomass production cost was thoroughly explored, and it was estimated that the microalgae Synechocystis biomass production cost was approximately 2–3 US$ per kg of biomass. Meanwhile, to reduce the lipid extraction cost, a direct transesterification was performed using tungstated zirconia as a heterogeneous catalyst and the highest biodiesel yield of 90.5% was obtained. In addition, the biodiesel fuel properties were analyzed, and the results revealed that most of the fuel properties found within ASTM D6751 limits. Furthermore, the lipid extracted residues was explored for bioethanol extraction, and 0.186 g bioethanol/g residue was obtained. This is the first study to demonstrate the alga Synechocystis cultivation in an open raceway pond using municipal wastewater successfully and produced two potential biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) is one of the top 12 biobased chemicals, precursor of renewable monomers and biofuels. This key molecule can be obtained from the dehydration of monosaccharides and polysaccharides. In this work, the synthesis of HMF from fructose and inulin was investigated in the presence of a wide range of metal salts adopting a truly sustainable catalytic approach: water as reaction medium, appreciable substrate concentration (10 wt %), very low amounts of catalyst (1-3 mM) and microwave heating. Copper salts, in particular copper(II) nitrate, afforded the best performances in terms of both HMF yield and selectivity. The influence of the most important parameters (temperature, time and Cu(NO 3 ) 2 concentration) on the reaction performance was also investigated through a statistical modeling, which showed that the remarkable HMF yield of 54 mol % was reached at 188 °C after 9 min. Under these optimized reaction conditions, an analogous outstanding HMF yield was also achieved starting from the polysaccharide inulin. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study employs chicken manure as a feedstock to produce different forms of energy to abate environmental burdens. To achieve ultimate carbon management, the possible utilization of CO2 during pyrolysis of chicken manure was fundamentally investigated. The roles of CO2 in pyrolysis of chicken manure include enhanced thermal cracking and shifting of the carbon distribution via reaction between volatile organic compounds and CO2. The identified roles induced by CO2 were catalytically enhanced because of the inorganic content in the feedstock. The morphology of biochar created from the chicken manure pyrolysis was significantly affected by CO2. For example, a well-developed pore structure was observed in the biochar developed under a CO2 environment; this biochar was used as an effective porous material for biodiesel synthesis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This work studied thermal characteristics and product formation mechanism during pyrolysis of penicillin fermentation residue (PR). Results showed that PR pyrolysis proceeded in four stages. The kinetic triplet of each stage was calculated using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, and integral master-plot methods. The kinetic model for stage 1 was the three-dimensional diffusion model, the simple reaction order model for stage 2 and stage 4, and the nucleation-growth model for stage 3. FTIR analysis suggested that the intensities of absorption peaks of N–H, C[dbnd]O, C–H, C–N, and C–O in chars weakened gradually with increasing temperature, corresponding to the production of CH4, CO, NH3, and HCN. GC-MS results indicated that the high protein content in PR resulted in a high fraction of nitrogenated compounds (amides and amines, nitriles, and N-heterocyclic species) in bio-oil. The formation mechanism of these compounds was discussed. Besides, bio-oil also contained large quantities of oxygenated compounds and a few hydrocarbons. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The impressive chemico-physical effects observed in sonochemistry are a result of cavitation, as ultrasonic and hydrodynamic cavitation does not interact with matter at the atomic and molecular levels. Bubble collapse leads to the quasi-adiabatic heating of the vapour inside bubbles, giving rise to local hot spots in the fluid. Cavitation thus transforms a mechanical energy into high kinetic energy, which is released in very short bursts that are exploited for green process intensification. This paper reviews relevant applications of hydrodynamic and acoustic cavitation with the aim of highlighting the particular advantages that these phenomena offer to the intensification of green chemical processes. Emulsification, biodiesel preparation, wastewater decontamination, organic synthesis, enzymatic catalysis and extractions are discussed among others. As a comparison, hydrodynamic cavitation technique is more advantageous in dealing with process intensification at large-scale, as well as the enhancement of mass transfer and heat transfer, while ultrasonic cavitation technique is more convenient to operate, easier to control in the studies at lab-scale, and exhibits more efficient in producing active free radicals and inducing the cleavage of volatile compounds. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, the demand for naturally derived products has hiked with enormous pressure to propose or develop state-of-the-art strategies to meet sustainable circular economy challenges. Microalgae possess the flexibility to produce a variety of high-value products of industrial interests. From pigments such as phycobilins or lutein to phycotoxins and several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), microalgae have the potential to become the primary producers for the pharmaceutical, food, and agronomical industries. Also, microalgae require minimal resources to grow due to their autotrophic nature or by consuming waste matter, while allowing for the extraction of several valuable side products such as hydrogen gas and biodiesel in a single process, following a biorefinery agenda. From a Mexican microalgae biodiversity perspective, more than 70 different local species have been characterized and isolated, whereas, only a minimal amount has been explored to produce commercially valuable products, thus ignoring their potential as a locally available resource. In this paper, we discuss the microalgae diversity present in Mexico with their current applications and potential, while expanding on their future applications in bioengineering along with other industrial sectors. In conclusion, the use of available microalgae to produce biochemically revenuable products currently represents an untapped potential that could lead to the solution of several problems through green technologies. As such, if the social, industrial and research communities collaborate to strive towards a greener economy by preserving the existing biodiversity and optimizing the use of the currently available resources, the enrichment of our society and the solution to several environmental problems could be attained. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Efficient microbial production of the next-generation biofuel isobutanol (IBA) is limited by metabolic bottlenecks. Overcoming these bottlenecks will be aided by knowing the optimal ratio of enzymes for efficient flux through the IBA biosynthetic pathway. OptSSeq (Optimization by Selection and Sequencing) accomplishes this goal by tracking growth rate-linked selection of optimal expression elements from a combinatorial library. The 5-step pathway to IBA consists of Acetolactate synthase (AlsS), Keto-acid reductoisomerase (KARI), Di-hydroxy acid dehydratase (DHAD), Ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (Kivd) and Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh). Using OptSSeq, we identified gene expression elements leading to optimal enzyme levels that enabled theoretically maximal productivities per cell biomass in Escherichia coli. We identified KARI as the rate-limiting step, requiring the highest levels of enzymes expression, followed by AlsS and AdhA. DHAD and Kivd required relatively lower levels of expression for optimal IBA production. OptSSeq also enabled the identification of an Adh enzyme variant capable of an improved rate of IBA production. Using models that predict impacts of enzyme synthesis costs on cellular growth rates, we found that optimum levels of pathway enzymes led to maximal IBA production, and that additional limitations lie in the E. coli metabolic network. Our optimized constructs enabled the production of ~3 g IBA per hour per gram dry cell weight and was achieved with 20 % of the total cell protein devoted to IBA-pathway enzymes in the molar ratio 2.5:6.7:2:1:5.2 (AlsS:IlvC:IlvD:Kivd:AdhA). These enzyme levels and ratios optimal for IBA production in E. coli provide a useful starting point for optimizing production of IBA in diverse microbes and fermentation conditions. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - This paper concerns about bio fuel production from renewable biomass resource and its characteristics in diesel engines. In this research work, Free Fatty Acid Oils (FFAO) from oil refineries was considered as biomass renewable resource for the production of biodiesel. These free fatty acid oil are one of the waste by product in edible oil extraction refineries and its potential energy can be easily converted into useful biodiesel in bio fuel sector by the process of transesterification. Due to ethanol catalyst used in transesterification process, Ethyl esters of free fatty acid oils (EEFFAO) were extracted from FFAO. These EEFFAO were blended with diesel in different proportions (20, 40, 60, 80 and pure EEFFAO) to indentify the maximum possibility to use an biodiesel in diesel engines. From the results, possibilities of biofuel from free fatty acid oil can be replaced at 20 percentage in existing fossil fuel depletion. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Slow pyrolysis of neem press seed cake (NPSC) was carried out in a fixed bed batch reactor to study the effects of temperature, retention time, and nitrogen (N 2 ) flow rate on liquid and char yields. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design was used to determine the optimum operating conditions to maximize the liquid yield. The highest liquid yield of 52.1 wt% was obtained at 512.5 °C, after 60 min using 0.5 L/min N 2 flow rate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis, bomb calorimeter, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction techniques and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to determine the physicochemical properties of NPSC and char, and chemical properties of liquid. GC-MS analysis showed that the bio-oil was rich in 9-octadecenamide, 2-propenyl decanoate, heptadecanenitrile, and oleanitrile. The higher heating value of the bio-oil and NPSC were 32.8 and 16.05 MJ/kg, respectively at 575 °C. The FT-IR results showed a decrease in the number of O-H (hydroxyl), C-H (alkanes), C=O (esters), -C-H (alkanes), and C-O (primary alcohol) groups in NPSC with increasing pyrolysis temperature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The hemicellulose component of biomass can be efficiently converted into furfural, a well-known biofuel precursor, via a hydrothermal process, in which the reaction medium plays an important role. In this work, the renewable butanone-water solvent mixture was employed in the conversion of C5 carbohydrates for the first time. Experiments combined with molecular dynamics simulation were carried out to study the organic solvent effects on furfural production from xylose. The reaction was catalyzed by an ionic liquid catalyst with Lewis acidity. Results showed that butanone could strengthen the intermolecular attractive force between water and xylose, leading to accelerated protonation and dehydration of xylose as well as enhanced furfural yield. On the other hand, butanone had a shielding effect for furfural against water, and therefore furfural could hardly be involved in side reactions. Under the optimal reaction conditions, the introduction of 80% butanone into the solvent resulted in a significant increase in furfural yield from 9% to 56% at 140 °C. Furthermore, other common model compounds and raw biomass were also tested under similar conditions, from which decent furfural yields of 46% and 36% were obtained from xylan and corn stalk, respectively. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study examined the potential of nanocatalyst CuO-CeO2 and Fe2O3for efficient conversion of Sterculia foetida seed Oil into biodiesel. S. foetida contains 40% oil content and low free fatty acid value (0.18 mg KOH/g). The synthesized nanocatalyst was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques. The maximum conversion was achieved (92% yield) using CuO-CeO2 at 0.25% catalyst loading. The optimized reaction was carried out by experimental variables included molar ratio (1:9), temperature (70°C), reaction time (3 h) and stirring rate (600 rpm) using reflux transesterification method. The XRD results showed the size of crystals with order 54.4 nm for CuO-CeO2 and 31.3 nm for Fe2O3. The SEM images of CuO-CeO2 showed spherical structure having an average particle size of 32.3 nm. SEM images of Fe2O3showed the size ranges from 46.27 to 28.76 nm having regular morphology, including spherical shape. The FT-IR analysis of this nanocatalyst also reinforced the results of this study. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed the efficient conversion of S. foetida seed oil into biodiesel using prepared nanocatalysts. The prepared nanocatalysts are cheaper, readily available and can be used for industrial scale biofuel production assembly, making it economically feasible and more cost effective. © 2019 Akhtar, Ahmad, Shaheen, Zafar, Ullah, Asma, Sultana, Munir, Rashid, Malik, Saeed and Waseem.

AB  - We report a novel solid organocatalyst, a double-hydrogen-bonded sulfonated polymer catalyst (D-SPC), for the cascade conversion of fructose to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) with a highest yield of 68.8 mol% and good catalyst recyclability. We demonstrate that the treatment of a sulfonated nitrogen-containing polymer catalyst (SPC) with dihydroxy acetone (DHA) molecules generates new double hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds) between the ring-attached sulfonic acid groups and DHA by deconstructing the existing H-bonds between the sulfonic acid groups and imine/amine nitrogens of the SPC, which is confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, 1 H MAS and 13 C cross-polarization MAS NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and quantum chemical calculations. The 31 P MAS NMR, pH surface , and NH 3 -TPD of the catalysts reveal the weakening of acidity strength due to the stronger double H-bonding on the D-SPC. Notably, we figure out the inverse relationship between the acidity strength of the catalysts and the EMF yield in the one-pot fructose-to-EMF conversion, wherein the use of weaker acid catalysts accelerates the fructose dehydration while decelerating the side-reaction of furan ring opening, therefore avoiding the negative influence of water on the tandem reactions. Moreover, the existence of stable double H-bonds contributes to the good catalyst recyclability due to the stabilization of sulfonic acid groups. The acidic property of the solid catalysts could be adjusted by varying the DHA dosage and the preparation conditions of the SPC (i.e., monomer ratio and oxidant dosage), respectively. We show that the solid acid catalyst with weaker acidity strength and suitable acidity density (ca. 2.5 mmol g -1 ) is favorable for the one-pot synthesis of EMF directly from fructose. This work highlights the application of novel sulfonated polymer catalysts with adjustable acidic property for the highly selective production of EMF, a liquid biofuel candidate, from biomass-derived carbohydrates. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Solid waste disposal imposes worldwide environmental and economic hardships. To alleviate such issues, the present work uses coal fly ash to in situ catalyze the pyrolysis of wheat straw, an abundant agricultural biomass, and to simultaneously produce heterogeneous sorbents for water treatment. Coal fly ash mixed in varying proportions with wheat straw shows a catalytic effect by lowering the temperature at which many noncondensable gaseous species are released. As the weight fraction of fly ash in the wheat straw increased from 1 to 10 wt%, the overall conversion of biomass increased. 1–5 wt% fly ash favored conversion to the gas phase (especially CO 2 , CH 4 and C 2 H 4 ), whereas the 10 wt% mixture produced more condensable species with fewer detectable oxygenated components and increased furan concentration. For a more complete waste-to-byproduct transformation, the resulting heterogeneous wheat straw-fly ash biochars were used to removed methylene blue, a model organic pollutant, from water, at higher capacities and faster rates than biochar alone. Overall, the coal fly ash may be a potential inexpensive catalyst for in situ upgrading biomass pyrolysis, simultaneously producing heterogeneous sorbents with enhanced adsorption capacities for organic pollutants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Olive tree crops, extensively cultivated in Southern European countries, yield large amounts of olive tree pruning (OTP) biomass. This could be used within the framework of a bio-based economy that maximizes the utilization of biomass resources in a sustainable way. In the present work, the techno-economic feasibility of an OTP-based integrated biorefinery is evaluated by the process simulation software Aspen Plus, while the process is aimed at the production of ethanol, xylitol, antioxidants and electricity. Overall, the proposed plant could perform economically, and it is self-sufficient from an energy resource point of view. The plant as designed yields around 109 l of ethanol, 27 kg of xylitol and 43 kg of antioxidants per ton of OTP biomass, with an estimated production cost of 0.24 € l -1 , 1.48 € kg -1 and 5.12 € kg -1 , respectively. In a 10-year period, the economic profitability of the biorefinery plant is within a positive investment balance, with a net present value (NPV) of 32.1 M€ and a payback period of 5-6 years. These figures point out the opportunities for placing in the market several OTP-based products. Based on these data, the construction of small-scale OTP-based lignocellulosic biorefineries seems to be a realistic scenario. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - The current series of experimental trial was conducted to evaluate reduction in CO, NOx and UBHC of synthetic biodiesel based on waste cooking oil at various concentrations of CeO2 nanoparticles and Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide at full engine load. The comparative analysis indicated the significant reductions in gaseous emissions from burning of pure diesel, biodiesel and additives enriched biodiesel blends. The Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide performance was comparatively better than CeO2 regarding the reduction of exhaust emissions resulted from the combustion of various biodiesel blends. When compared with B20 blend, the observed reduction in CO, NOx and UBHC were 18.27%, 6.57% and 23.46%, respectively by using CeO2 (100 ppm), whereas 24.18%, 13.96% and 40.74%, respectively when Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide (100 ppm) was used as additive. Both the CeO2 and Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide were characterized by SEM, XRD and XPS techniques. The CeO2 and Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide may be considered as future additives in green renewable energy regime having potential to reduce CO, NOx and UBHC exhaust emissions associated with combustion of biodiesel and its blends. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To seek a way to valorize sewage sludge (SS), it was chosen as a raw material for biodiesel production. As such, non-catalytic transesterification of dried SS was carried out, to enhance its value. Note that picking a waste material such as SS as an inexpensive lipid feedstock for biodiesel production, without lipid extraction, greatly increases the economic viability of biodiesel. Also, to enhance biodiesel sustainability, ethanol (EtOH) was employed as the acyl acceptor, in this study, and this was experimentally justified by results showing that employing EtOH as an acyl acceptor provided an effective means for compensating for the lower heating value arising from the large amount of palmitic (C16) acid in SS. This study experimentally proved that the fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) yield at 380 °C reached up to 13.33 wt% of dried SS. Given that the lipid content of dried SS is 14.01 ± 0.64 wt%, the FAEE yield of 13.33 wt% implied that 95.14 wt% of lipid in dried SS had been converted into FAEEs. The introduced SS valorization in this study offered an excellent opportunity to address diverse environmental hazards arising from SS and associated emerging contaminants. Given that the optimal temperature for the non-catalytic conversion for biodiesel production from SS was found to be 380 °C, emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobials, were simultaneously degraded, due to their inferior thermal stabilities. Lastly, considering that the introduced biodiesel conversion process is thermally induced, the SS reside after the biodiesel conversion process can be further used in thermo-chemical processes as raw materials for gasification and pyrolysis (future work). © 2019

AB  - With increasing strict environmental laws, there is a need for operators to design a benign oil-based muds (OBMs). In this study, oil extracted from non-edible sweet almond seed (SASO) was used as the continuous phase to formulate biodiesel-based drilling mud (BBDM). Different properties of the BBDM including the economic viability were evaluated and compared with those of the diesel OBM to determine the applicability of these properties for drilling fluids and their level of toxicity to the environment. The results indicate that the rheology, filtration properties, electrical stability, thermal stability and shale swelling inhibition performance of the BBDM are comparable with those of the diesel OBM. The biodiesel has a significantly higher flash point of 169 °C than the diesel with 78 °C; demonstrating that it can supply better fire safety than the diesel. The data of the toxicity test indicate SASO to be safer and less harmful compared to diesel #2 type used. After the 28-day period of biodegradation tests, the BBDM and the diesel OBM showed 83% and 25.2% aerobic biodegradation with Penicillium sp., respectively. The low branching degree and absence of aromatic compounds in the BBDM contributes for its higher biodegradation. The economic evaluation of the BBDM indicates low cost of formulation and waste management. The general outcome of the tests illustrates that SASO has the potentials of being one of the technically and environmentally feasible substitutes for the diesel OBM. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gasoline compression ignition mode is one of the low-temperature combustion strategies using gasoline instead of diesel fuel and it is better than the other low-temperature combustion modes in terms of ignition controllability. Difficulty in the ignition at low loads and maximum pressure rise rate during high loads is the main problem in commercializing this engine. In order to solve this problem, hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel is blended with gasoline in different proportions and its combustion and emission characteristics under different working loads are investigated in a single injection mode. Stable combustion is achieved using this gasoline/hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel blends without any combustion assistance and increasing intake temperature. Results show that G70H30 blending fuel illustrates a comprehensively better combustion and emissions performance. However, the high maximum pressure rise rate at high loads and high particulate matter emission are the main problems. Hence, multiple injection strategies are applied for G70H30 to solve the above problem. It reveals that the particulate matter emission for 20% pilot injection ratio is lower than that of single injection mode. The maximum pressure rise rate of 20% or 30% pilot injection ratio can meet the engine limit. While the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emissions for double injection mode are higher than that of single injection mode and it increases with increasing pilot injection ratio. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work aims to analyze whether Indian mustard can be harnessed within a biorefinery system to generate energy carriers and high value-added products. Within this objective, two options of harnessing Indian mustard seed oil (IMSO) were investigated, the first for the production of ethyl biodiesel (IMSOEEs) and the second for the production of a biolubricant (IMSO2E1HEs) by transesterification of the unpurified IMSOEEs with 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (2E1H). Furthermore, low cost and environmentally-friendly conversion processes were targeted. The biofuel was obtained under mild conditions of ethanolysis (35 °C, atmospheric pressure, ethanol to oil molar ratio of 8, 1.1 wt% KOH, and 50 min) carried out in two-stages separated by addition of recycled glycerol, and followed by dry-purification with Indian mustard stems-based adsorbent. In order to enhance biolubricant yield, reactive distillation with optimized operating pressure was selected (0.05 bar, 70 °C, 2 wt% KOH, 2E1H to IMSOEEs molar ratio of 2, 65 min), followed by bubble-washing (assisted with citric acid) and then vacuum distillation (inferior to 0.01 bar). The produced IMSOEEs met the basic biodiesel properties with a satisfactory ester content (95.8 wt%). Similarly, a high conversion of IMOEEs (93 wt%) was reached for the biolubricant, leading to an IMSO2E1HE product that exhibited satisfactory properties, and thus has the potential to act as a biolubricant. Nevertheless, these results could be improved with a pre-treatment of the departure IMSO to remove species that are not glycerides, such as glucosinolates. Thereby, ensuring that the produced ethyl biodiesel conforms strictly to industry specifications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this research was to develop a direct artificial neural network with the ability to predict a corrosion rate of metals in different biodiesel. Experimental values were obtained by the electrochemical noise technique, EN, as well as, information reported in the literature. A backpropagation model was proposed with three layers; metal and biodiesel composition, blend biodiesel/diesel, total acid number (TAN), temperature and exposure time were considered as input variables in the model. The best fitting training data were acquired with 24:4:1, considering a Levenberg –Marquardt learning algorithm, a hyperbolic tangent and linear transfer functions in the hidden and output layer respectively. Experimental and simulated data were compared satisfactorily through the linear regression model with a correlation coefficient of 0.9885 and a mean square error, MSE, of 2.15 × 10−4 in the validation stage. Furthermore, the model agreed the requirements of the slope and the intercept statistical test with a 99% confidence. The obtained results indicated that the ANN model could be attractive as corrosion rate estimator. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Trace amounts of copper decrease significantly the oxidative stability of biodiesel while antioxidants, mostly tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), are commonly introduced to the biofuel to guarantee induction period values within regulatory limits. Hence, a simple method to monitor the most used antioxidant and the most deleterious contaminant in biodiesel can give a fast response on its quality. In this context, this work presents a simple, efficient, low cost and sensitive method for the simultaneous and direct determination of copper and the antioxidant TBHQ in biodiesel. The biodiesel samples were diluted in 90% (v/v) ethanol and 10% (v/v) water containing 0.1 mol L−1 HCl (final concentration) as the supporting electrolyte generating a homogeneous mixture in which Cu(II) and TBHQ were directly detected using the square wave voltammetry (SWV) on a gold working electrode. The presence of biodiesel in the selected electrolyte facilitated the separation of analyte peaks facilitating the treatment of data and quantification. The linear responses for the simultaneous determination were in the range between 5 and 100 μg L−1 and 4.2–81.5 mg L−1 for copper and TBHQ (R &gt; 0.997), respectively. High precision (RSD = 4.0% and 3.9%, n = 20) and limit of detection (LOD) values of 0.31 μg L−1 and 1.0 mg L−1 (0.030 μg g−1 and 0.102 mg g−1 in biodiesel) for Cu(II) and TBHQ, respectively, were obtained. Recovery values between 97% and 104% for both copper and TBHQ were obtained. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of biomass with abundantly available materials could be an economical method for production of bio-fuels. Pyrolysis behavior of rice straw (RS) and water hyacinth (WH) were carried out in fixed bed reactor at temperature ranging from 300 to 450 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. Co-pyrolysis of biomass with different reaction mixture were carried out at optimum condition 400 °C. The maximum liquid product yields for the pyrolysis of RS and WH obtained were 28.2 wt% and 24.7 wt%, respectively, whereas the maximum liquid product yield for RS+WH co-pyrolysis was 44.4 wt% at 400 °C with 5: 5 biomass mixture ratio. The bio-oils obtained from pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis was analyzed by using GC-MS, FT-IR, 1H NMR. The results of GC-MS and FT-IR analysis confirmed the interaction between RS and water hyacinth during co-pyrolysis, which resulted into increases the number of compounds and compound selectivity. The intensity of the peak enhanced at 1633 cm−1 in the case of bio-char due to an increase in the amount of aromatic carbon and decreased cellulose and hemicellulose contents in the biomass. This work aimed to summarize research progress on co-pyrolysis as well as their benefits on enhancement of bio-oils derived from biomass. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is a prerequisite for downstream bioconversion of its cellulosic components to second-generation biofuels. Acid hydrolysis pretreatment separates most of the hemicellulose and cellulose from lignin. However, the lignin-rich acid hydrolysis residue (AHR) may contain 20-50 wt % feedstock biomass. To improve the economics of LCB-based biorefinery, the AHR needs to be valorized. In this study, we have performed hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of AHR derived from the dilute acid treatment of pinewood for H2 and bio-oil generation. A slurry of AHR at a biomass-to-water ratio of 1:30 was hydrothermally liquefied in the presence of a homogeneous Ni(NO3)2 catalyst at 250, 275, and 300°C. About 16 wt % bio-oil and 51 mL of H2 were generated at 300°C and 60 min into the reaction. Based on elemental analysis, the higher heating value of bio-oil was found to be 29.8 MJ/kg. The aqueous coproduct generated during the HTL reaction was treated with activated carbon and subjected to the photocatalytic reforming (PR) process in the presence of a Pt/TiO2 catalyst that produced an additional 90 mL of H2 at NTP conditions. Preliminary calculations were performed to understand the energy recovery in terms of the products generated based on the total energy consumed for both HTL and PR processes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The valorization of organic waste through biodiesel synthesis was investigated to explore the concept of hazardous waste-to-energy. Fish waste (mackerel waste) was chosen as a case study because of the growing concern regarding the treatment of food waste, which is potentially hazardous to the environment. This study focused on the thermally-induced transesterification of fish waste for the production of biodiesel (i.e., fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)). This process requires a porous material that allows for the collision between reactants (fish waste and methanol) to increase inside its pores at high temperatures. Therefore, commercial clay (montmorillonite) was used as the porous material in this study. The optimal temperature for the thermally-induced transesterification of unpurified mackerel oil was 380 °C, and the FAME recovery reached up to ˜72 wt.%. This study also proved that thermal cracking of polyunsaturated FAME species was initiated at temperatures ≥390 °C, and that fish waste is a promising feedstock for biodiesel when it is produced via thermally-induced transesterification over clay as a porous material. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis oils produced over HZSM-5 at varying levels of catalyst of deactivation, and therefore exhibiting oxygen contents ranging from 6 wt% to 33 wt% (enabled due to catalyst deactivation) were subjected to mild hydrotreating over Ru/C at 140 °C. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of these catalytic pyrolysis oils in this process, which is often used as a stabilization step prior to exposure of the bio-oil to more severe hydrodeoxygenation conditions in pyrolysis based biorefinery concepts. This will help better define the desired deoxygenation rate during CFP, and inform decisions about yield/quality and cost tradeoffs during CFP. High liquid product recoveries were achieved for the mild hydrotreating in all samples with varying O-contents, meaning the yield of hydrogenated liquids from biomass was nearly exclusively dependent on the catalytic pyrolysis step. However, a trend was observed that the bio-oils were more responsive to the hydrogenation with increasing oxygen content. For example, no aromatic ring hydrogenation was observed for the bio-oils with <20 wt% oxygen content but ring saturation was observed for bio-oils with oxygen contents of 25–30 wt%. The bio-oils with about 25–30% oxygen content had the largest increase in H/C ratio upon hydrogenation. This trend may be attributed in part to a solvent effect, where the more polar bio-oils acting as their own solvents, helped promote hydrogenation. With regard to product stability an increase in the average molecular weight of the bio-oils with >25 wt% oxygen content was observed for exposure to the hydrogenation conditions, suggesting some oligomerization occurred prior to hydrogenation in these cases. Taken together, bio-oils with about 25 wt% oxygen content responded well to the mild hydrotreatment and were stable to the conditions, and offered a 2–3 fold increase in carbon yield from biomass over the bio-oils that were more severely deoxygenated during catalytic pyrolysis. This suggests that severe reduction of oxygen in the CFP step may be not needed to economically produce fungible, stabilized biofuel intermediates in high carbon yield. © 2019

AB  - One of the barriers for the extended use of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) as a diesel fuel component is the yield of raw glycerol as a by-product of the transesterification process. In fact, glycerol is considered as one of the most abundant waste feedstock in the world. A new fuel denoted as FAGE (Fatty Acid Glycerol formal Esters) produced from glycerol and waste oil has been developed. FAME is concomitantly obtained during the manufacturing process of FAGE in different proportions depending of the reaction conditions. Since FAGE cold flow properties are in disadvantage when compared to FAME, the influence of some cold-flow improvers in FAGE/FAME blends has been investigated. In this work, the use of some acetals, co-products of the FAGE production process, are proposed as cold-flow improvers, giving extra value to this new fuel since all the co-products obtained from the production process would have a new industrial use. These two acetals are GF (Glycerol Formal) and GFOMOM (Methoxy-methyl glycerol formal). The results obtained show that cold flow properties become poorer when the amount of FAGE increases in the FAGE/FAME blend, but such effect is very slight up to 50% FAGE. The use of the acetals improves cold flow properties of the blends up to 2 °C, with minor effect of the GF content in the GF/GFOMOM acetal blend. In addition, a commercial cold flow improver was tested, improving the pour point and the cold filter plugging point with only small effect on cloud point and crystallization temperature. The results obtained from the acetals and the cold flow improver are compared, and the value of the acetals as cold flow improvers has been proved. A combination of both, acetals and cold-flow improver, is proposed as an optimal method to improve cold flow properties. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, Euonymus maackii Seed oil (EMSO) was exploited and evaluated for the ﬁrst time as a new non-edible oil feedstock for preparation of biodiesel. The EMSO yield was 41.06 ± 2.68 wt%. The fatty acid compositions of EMSO involved palmitoleic acid (2.01%), palmitic acid (14.5%), stearic acid (3.1%), oleic acid (49.8%), linoleic acid (29.3%), 11-Eicosenoic acid (0.1%) and arachidic acid (0.07%). Microwave-assisted transesteriﬁcation with methanol provided a high conversion yield in short duration under low temperature. The 2.0 wt% of catalyst amount, 10:1 of methanol/oil molar ratio, 40 min of reaction time and 60 °C of temperature were found to be the optimum process conditions for the maximum biodiesel yield of 94.74 ± 2.09%. Using pseudo first-order kinetic model, the reaction rate constants were 2.145 × 102, 3.550 × 102 and 6.447 × 102 min−1 for 40, 50 and 60 °C, respectively. The thermodynamic property for biodiesel preparation was determined as activation energy = 47.67 kJ/mol. The fuel properties of the biodiesel product were evaluated and comparable to ASTM D-6751 and EN 14214 standards. Overall, this study revealed and confirmed the potential of Euonymus maackii seed oil as the appropriate alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This experimental study was conducted to explore the favorable and unfavorable conditions which promote or reduce the performance and emissions in a diesel engine, based on six engine loads (5% to 95% load) and five biodiesel contents including B0 (0% waste cooking oil biodiesel and 100% diesel, by volume %), B20, B50, B75 and B100 (pure biodiesel), at a constant engine speed of 1920 rpm. According to the results, the maximum brake specific fuel consumption was recorded at the lowest engine load (5% load) using B100; while the highest brake thermal efficiency was obtained at 80% load for B100. In regard to regulated emissions, the highest engine load (95% load) with diesel fuel was the condition for the formation of maximum CO, smoke opacity, PM mass, total particle number concentration and geometric mean diameter. The 95% load with B100 was the condition for maximum CO2 and NOX. The 60% load with diesel fuel was the condition for maximum THC. For unregulated emissions, low engine load with B100 was the condition for maximum formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, ethene and propene. The maximum 1,3-butadiene was observed for B100 at 80% load. The highest benzene emission was recorded at 40% load for B100. The maximum toluene and xylene emissions were found at 5% load for diesel fuel. In addition, the conditions which lead to produce the minimum emissions are also extensively discussed in the present study. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource in existence and is the only source of renewable fixed carbon. Biofuels produced from this source are promising because they do not contribute to extra CO2 emissions and they reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Presently, wheat husk has a distinctive potential as a renewable source of biomass, due to its global availability, which is advantageous for producing liquid and gaseous fuels by thermochemical processes. The Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR) process is excellent for generating energy vectors (solid char, liquid bio-oil and permanent gases) from agricultural wastes, such as wheat husk. These valorised energy vectors can be applied as transportation fuels and used in combined heat and power (CHP) plants. The aim of this work is to study the conversion of wheat husk into fuels, using TCR technology in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot scale reactor. Findings show that from 100 wt% of the feedstock, 29.6 wt% was converted into synthesis gas, 21.7 wt% to char, 5.8 wt% into organic bio-oil, 32.8 wt% into aqueous phase liquids and the remaining was attributed to losses (10.1 wt%). The organic bio-oil contains a higher heating value (HHV) of 26 MJ/kg, which represents a notable increase compared to the original feedstock (17.8 MJ/kg). Phenol was found to be the most abundant compound within the oil, with a relative abundance of 30.88% measured by GC–MS. Oleic acid (7.41%) was the most abundant long chain hydrocarbon detected. The total acid number of the oil (TAN) was (29.9 mg KOH/g) and viscosity measured (145.2 cSt). In order to use wheat husk oil as a direct engine fuel, it is necessary to carry out upgrading via hydro-processing; or blend with fossil crude oil for further refining. Overall, TCR is a promising future route for the valorisation of wheat husk to produce renewable energy vectors. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - A commercial equilibrium FCC catalyst of the octane-barrel type was subjected to lixiviation treatments with both acidic (HNO3) and basic (NaOH) solutions in order to modify its textural and acidic properties. The alkaline lixiviation doubled the mesopore volume in the commercial catalyst, while the acidic treatment increased the concentration of crystalline component in the catalyst. The catalytic performances of the parent and modified catalysts in the immediate conversion of vapors from pine sawdust fast pyrolysis were evaluated in a fixed bed reactor at 550 °C using mass catalyst to bio-oil and tar ratios from 3 to 8. The modified catalysts both produced more hydrocarbons and less coke than the parent commercial catalyst. In turn, comparing the modified samples, the one subjected to alkali treatment was more effective in deoxygenating the pyrolysis vapors, resulting in higher hydrocarbon yields (up to 13.2%) and lower coke yields than the acid modified catalyst, a fact assigned to the higher mesoporosity which improves the diffusion transport of bulky coke precursor molecules. The acid modified catalyst allowed a higher extension of the reaction pathway, the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbon products being much higher (up to 95.5% of hydrocarbons in the gasoline boiling range). © 2018

AB  - Adsorption technology has led to the development of promising techniques to purify biogas, i.e., biomethane or biohydrogen. Such techniques mainly depend on the adsorbent ability and operating parameters. This research focused on adsorption technology for upgrading biogas technique by developing a novel adsorbent. The commercial coconut shell activated carbon (CAC) and two types of gases (H 2 S/N 2 and H 2 S/N 2 /CO 2 ) were used. CAC was modified by copper sulfate (CuSO 4 ), zinc acetate (ZnAc 2 ), potassium hydroxide (KOH), potassium iodide (KI), and sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) on their surface to increase the selectivity of H 2 S removal. Commercial H 2 S adsorbents were soaked in 7 wt.% of impregnated solution for 30 min before drying at 120C for 24 h. The synthesized adsorbent's physical and chemical properties, including surface morphology, porosity, and structures, were characterized by SEM-EDX, FTIR, XRD, TGA, and BET analyses. For real applications, the modified adsorbents were used in a real-time 0.85 L single-column adsorber unit. The operating parameters for the H 2 S adsorption in the adsorber unit varied in L/D ratio (0.5-2.5) and feed flow rate (1.5-5.5 L/min) where, also equivalent with a gas hourly space velocity, GHSV (212.4-780.0 hour -1 ) used. The performances of H 2 S adsorption were then compared with those of the best adsorbent that can be used for further investigation. Characterization results revealed that the impregnated solution homogeneously covered the adsorbent surface, morphology, and properties (i.e., crystallinity and surface area). BET analysis further shows that the modified adsorbents surface area decreased by up to 96%. Hence, ZnAc 2 -CAC clarify as the best adsorption capacity ranging within 1.3-1.7 mg H 2 S/g, whereby the studied extended to adsorption-desorption cycle. © 2019 Zulkefli et al.

AB  - This work investigated the optimization of process parameters in the upgrading of the oil extracted from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae using a novel nickel-impregnated biochar catalyst. The effects of temperature, dodecane-to-oil mass ratio and pressure on the upgraded liquid-phase biofuel yield were evaluated and optimized by central composite design of the response surface methodology (RSM). The model equation generated from RSM showed that dodecane-to-oil mass ratio and pressure, as well as the quadratic effects of all the three factors, were significant model terms in predicting the yield of upgraded liquid-phase biofuel. Maximum liquid biofuel yield was attained at 246.89 °C, 3.72 (w/w) dodecane-to-oil mass ratio, 3.84 MPa hydrogen pressure and 6 h processing time. Validation runs resulted in an upgraded biofuel yield of 69.4%, which was in close agreement with predicted values generated by RSM. The upgraded biofuel comprised of 100% green liquid hydrocarbons containing 94% alkanes and 6% alkenes. Its main fuel properties, such as heating value (43.78 MJ kg−1), elemental composition, density, and viscosity, exceeded those of the fatty acid methyl ester standard and were found comparable to those of petroleum diesel. More importantly, the results of the ultimate analysis and confirmed by the findings from Fourier transform infrared and gas chromatography – mass spectroscopy analyses, showed significantly low oxygen and nitrogen content and absence of sulfur in the upgraded biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study was conducted on a partially stabilized zirconia coated single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled and direct injection diesel engine and was modified to use the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as the primary fuel and pilot spray of biodiesel with and without Di-Tertiary Butyl Peroxide (DTBP) additive as the secondary fuel. The primary fuel was mixed with air in intake manifold, compressed, and ignited by a pilot spray of secondary fuel. The biodiesel was prepared from palm oil by base catalyst transesterification method. The performance and emission characteristics of coated diesel engine were examined by operating on dual fuel mode (LPG-biodiesel and LPG-diesel) without additive and LPG- biodiesel with additive. The results were compared to uncoated engine running on diesel fuel. The study reveal that, a significant improvement in performance of coated engine operating on dual fuel mode (LPG-biodiesel) with additive by an increase in efficiency of 4.5% and decrease in brake specific fuel consumption of 4.2% at 80% of full load, HC and CO emissions are reduced between 9% and 12% at entire load spectrum compared to uncoated engine operating on diesel fuel. NOx emission is drastically reduced up to 32% for dual fuel with additive compared to without additive in coated engine operation and very close to diesel fuel in uncoated engine operation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, two molecular sieves with different pore sizes, namely HZSM-5 and MCM-41, were mixed using different ratios and used in the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of rape straw. The effects of different HZSM -5 and MCM -41 mixing ratios on the quality of the bio-oil were studied by physicochemical properties, product yields and compositions. Moreover, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) catalyst analysis was performed. The results showed that the liquid yield and organic phase decreased first and then increased, whereas the gas yield showed an opposite trend. The density, O/C and kinematic viscosity of the bio-oil organic phase decreased first then increased, whereas the H/C, pH values and higher heating values initially increased, then declined. The oxygen content, H/C, O/C, kinematic viscosity, density, higher heating value and pH value of the bio-oil organic phase obtained at 1:1 mixed ratio were 12.81%, 1.701, 0.126, 5.06 mm2/s, 0.94 g/cm3, 34.31 MJ/kg and 5.41, respectively. The organic phase included numerous organic compounds, such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers and esters. The hydrocarbon content in the bio-oil organic phase gradually increased and the carbonyl groups content gradually decreased as the MCM-41 content increased from 0 to 50%. In contrast, the hydrocarbon content gradually decreased and the carbonyl groups content gradually increased as the MCM-41 content increased from 50% to 100%. The hydrocarbon and carbonyl groups contents were 53.83% and 6.35%, respectively, at the MCM-41 content of 50%. The mixed catalyst activity increased with the increase in MCM-41 content (up to 50%), and tended to be stable once the MCM-41 contents surpassed 50%. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - The present work reports covalent immobilization of steapsin lipase (SL) on Immobead-350 support matrix (IMB) to make a robust biocatalytic system to work under supercritical carbon dioxide condition (Sc-CO 2 ). The developed biocatalyst (IMB:SL) was characterized in details and utilized to convert waste cooking sunflower oil (WCSO) into value-added energy chemical (biodiesel) in Sc-CO 2 . All reaction process parameters were optimized in detail which offered 86.33% yield of biodiesel from WCSO. The developed Sc-CO 2 protocol is compared with the solvent-free conventional synthesis, which indicates almost twofold higher yield of biodiesel in Sc-CO 2 media as compared to solvent-free condition. To extend the scope, we have tested fresh and waste cooking oils (WCO) from various sources, offering 81–94% yield of biodiesel. The biocatalyst activity was investigated in various parameters of supercritical condition to know the biocatalyst stability in Sc-CO 2 . Besides this, IMB:SL biocatalyst was effectively reused up to five recycle. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Three isostructural zirconium-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs), UiO-66, UiO-66(COOH)2 and UiO-66(NH2) were synthesized, fully characterized and efficiently used as active and recyclable catalysts for the esterification reaction of butyric acid to produce a green fuel additive, butyl butyrate. The catalytic activities of the used structures were comparable, and mostly better, than other heterogeneous acid catalyst reported in the literature. Moreover, 90% conversion was achieved by employing the most acidic member, UiO-66(COOH)2, which is close to the 95% conversion obtained by the conventional liquid catalyst H2SO4. Using the synthesized MOFs, large variations in the conversion to butyl butyrate were obtained which was the base of a detailed investigation on the origin of their catalytic activities. The analysis of the TGA results helped estimate the number of structural defects in each studied MOF. Interestingly, it was concluded that, for the MOFs with different organic linkers, the catalytic activity was not directly related to the number of defects. Further analysis was done to investigate the alternative parameters that could be behind this difference in catalytic activity, and the parameters included but were not limited to the surface area of the MOFs, their particle size, the linkers’ active sites, and their accessibility through effective mass transfer. Although a combination of these factors were found to contribute to the superior catalytic activity of UiO-66(COOH)2, however, its exceptional conversion was mainly attributed to the effect of the additional active acid functional groups grafted onto its organic linker, along with its smaller particle size which allowed for better mass transfer and accessibility of the active site Furthermore, two kinetic models were successfully developed and used to determine the different kinetic parameters of the esterification reaction and to study their dependence on the different characteristics of the MOFs. With this knowledge, catalytic activity of MOFs can be engineered from a laboratory prototype and optimized by tuning the functional groups of the organic linkers to serve as effective catalysts for the production of fine chemicals such as biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acidified [Bmim]Cl solution showed a great efficacy for the pretreatment of softwood, hardwood, rice straw, and sugarcane bagasse. The pretreatment resulted in 29 and 20-fold increase in cellulose digestibility of hardwood and softwood, respectively, and most cellulose in rice straw and sugarcane bagasse was converted into glucose. Fermentation of biomass hydrolysates produced 21.86–29.56 g/L ethanol, thereby achieving ethanol yields of 0.49–0.51 g/g. Ethanol was concentrated up to 79.8% from a fermentation broth containing 2.4% ethanol using four consecutive pervaporations. This work demonstrates the viability of biofuel production from diverse feedstocks and the feasibility of ethanol recovery using pervaporative separation. © 2018 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of agricultural straw residues based on ceramic ball circulation heating was studied by using an originally developed V-shaped drop tube pyrolysis unit. The yields of bio-oil, bio-char and pyrolysis gas from these straw residues were in the range of 41–46, 26–30 and 26–29 wt%, respectively, with maize straw giving the highest bio-oil yield. A quadratic model was developed to correlate the cellulose-to-lignin-ratio (CLR) and hemicellulose-to-lignin-ratio (HLR) with bio-oil yield. For a given HLR above 1.12, the bio-oil yield continued to increase as the CLR increased. However, when the HLR was between 0.86 and 1.12, it tended to decrease first and then increase with the increase of CLR. In contrast with CS, the proportions of acids and ketones in the bio-oils increased by 13.3% and 14.8% for MS and 9.2% and 30.5% for WS, respectively, while the proportion of phenols decreased by 9.9% and 14.3%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The esterification of furfuryl alcohol with 1-butanol was successfully tested at low initial butanol/furfuryl alcohol molar ratio values (4 and 8) in the temperature range 80–110 °C over different ion-exchange resins. The polymerization reaction of furfuryl alcohol also occurs, being more affected by the initial 1-butanol to furfuryl alcohol molar ratio than temperature under the conditions tested. The accessibility to acid centers conditioned the activity of ion-exchange resins. While for gel-type resins this can be related to the specific volume of the swollen polymer, for macroreticular resins there is a compromise between permanent porosity (for stiff resins) and the existence of a very flexible gel-phase zone for low crosslinked macroreticular resins. The maximum yield to butyl levulinate obtained was 63% at 110 °C and a molar butanol/furfuryl alcohol ratio of 8 on the macroreticular resin Amberlyst 39. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigates the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of harmful green macroalgal blooms at a temperature of 270 °C with, and without a catalyst with a holding time of 45 min. The effect of different catalysts on the HTL product yield was also studied. Two separation methods were used for recovering the biocrude oil yield from the solid phase. On comparision with other catalyst, Na2CO3 was found to produce higher yiled of bio-oil. The total bio-oil yield was 20.10% with Na2CO3, 18.74% with TiO2, 17.37% with CaO, and 14.6% without a catalyst. The aqueous phase was analyzed for TOC, COD, TN, and TP to determine the nutrient enrichment of water phase for microalgae cultivation. Growth of four microalgae strains viz., Chlorella Minutissima, Chlorella sorokiniana UUIND6, Chlorella singularis UUIND5 and Scenedesmus abundans in the aqueous phase were studied, and compared with a standard growth medium. The results indicate that harmful macroalgal blooms are a suitable feedstock for HTL, and its aqueous phase offers a promising nutrient source for microalgae. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Fabrication of superior and cost-effective cathodic materials is vital in manufacturing sustainable microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) for biofuels production. In the present study, a novel manganese dioxide (MnO2) coated felt cathode (Mn/CF) has been developed for MECs using electrodeposition method via potentiostat. MnO2 is considered to encourage exogenous electron exchange and, in this way, improves the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). MnO2, as a cathodic catalyst, enhances the rate of biofuel production, electron transfer, and significantly reduces the cost of MECs. A maximum stabilized current density of 3.70 ± 0.5 mA/m2 was obtained in case of MnO2-coated Mn/CF based MEC, which was more than double the non-coated carbon felt (CF) cathode (1.70 ± 0.5 mA/m2). The dual chamber Mn/CF-MEC achieved the highest production rate of acetic acid (37.9 mmol/L) that was significantly higher (43.0%) in comparison to the non-coated CF-MEC. The cyclic voltammograms further verified the substantial enhancement in the electron transfer between the MnO2 coated cathode and microbes. The obtained results demonstrate that MnO2 interacted electrochemically with microbial cells and enhanced the extracellular electron transfer, therefore validating its potential role in biofuel production. The MnO2 coated CF further offered higher electrode surface area and better electron transfer efficiency, suggesting its applicability in the large-scale MECs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alternative and Renewable Transport Fuels, grouping both Advanced Biofuels and Recycled Carbon fuels, are key routes for the decarbonisation of European Union (EU)and global transports: being sustainable transports a policy-driven area, the development and deployment of advanced biofuels and recycled carbon fuels will depend on well-designed regulatory frameworks. EU just ended the elaboration of the new Renewable Energy Directive (REDII), which includes specific provisions for sustainable fuels. In this context, air transport is among the most critical sectors to decarbonize, given the limited number of other options that can be adopted, such as optimization of flight routes, increase of jet engine energy efficiency, and few others. Overall, EU transports increased GreenHouse Gas (GHG)Emissions since 1990, while all other energy sectors succeeded in achieving a constant reduction over the same period. Aviation is steadily growing worldwide as well as in the EU, representing one of the most critical areas. This article investigates REDII and its implications on the different fuel production and utilisations sectors: opportunities and barriers from the new EU policy framework for these areas are identified and discussed. The large-scale deployment of these fuels will require large investments in new production facilities, to achieve considerable reductions in production costs (over the entire value chain, i.e. from feedstock production, collection and delivery, to conversion and supply). Moreover, in the specific case of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), significant investments in applying to and completing the ASTM certification for new jet fuels. In this respect, proper coordination between the REDII and the UN ICAO CORSIA programme will be essential to ensure large scale SAF market penetration. © 2019

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel pilot-scale system that combines pyrolysis and combustion processes, fed by a mixture of municipal solid waste (MSW) and wood chips (WC). The pyrolysis of MSW+WC (1:1) produces char and volatiles as fuels, which just the pyrolysis gas was used in a post-combustion chamber for heat generation. The gases evaluated were carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs). Initially, the pyrolysis was performed by laboratory experiments and the physicochemical characterization of MSW+WC. The MSW+WC showed a heating value of 23.93 MJ kg−1, which is higher than several bioenergy crops reported. The pyrolysis and post-combustion process were found to minimize the generation of hydrochloric acid (HCl), dioxins and furans as well as the volatile compounds. The gases concentrations emitted were (mg Nm−3): 35.83 of CO, 24.37 of SO2, 106.84 of NOx, and 4.88 × 10−3 of BTEX, with a low PAH content. These values are below the legal emission standards established by United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Danish Environmental Protection Agency (Danish EPA), German Federal Emission Control Regulations (17.BlmSchV) and National Council for the Environment of Brazil (CONAMA 316/02). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, there has been a strong global interest in developing technologies for converting renewable and low-cost raw materials into green diesel and bio-jet fuel, which are made of hydrocarbons. In this work, cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), which is an industrial waste, was used as a feedstock to produce green diesel. Different reaction conditions during the upgrading process (deoxygenation, hydrogenation and cracking) were evaluated using palladium over activated charcoal (Pd/C) as a catalyst. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction and specific surface area analysis. The influences of the reaction parameters, such as temperature (180, 250 and 300 °C), time (5 and 10 h) and pressure (10, 20, 30 and 40 bar), were investigated using 10% w/w Pd/C. The composition of the products was determined using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Higher pressures and temperatures led to a higher degree of deoxygenation and hydrogenation. In contrast, lower pressures or temperatures resulted in higher degrees of cracking. From the optimization experiments, a 98% yield of hydrocarbons corresponding to the diesel range was obtained under a 40 bar H2 atmosphere at 300 °C, 10 h, and 500 rpm (in a batch reactor). Of these hydrocarbons, 89% were saturated alkanes, 3% were aromatic compounds and 6% were oxygenated compounds. This new and sustainable route is promising because it involves the conversion of a low-value residue into green diesel using mild experimental conditions. Biofuel production from CNSL allows the total valorization of the residues in the cashew-nut agroindustrial chain and has potential industrial applications in many countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper is primarily a case study on transesterification of avocado oil for the synthesis of biodiesel. Many operational parameters and components were studied in an attempt to identify the optimal process for non-catalytic transesterification, and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), an acyl acceptor was identified as key to one very efficient methodology. Non-catalytic transesterification experiments using DMC and/or methanol (MeOH) were conducted under varied temperatures and varied amounts of silica loading. The maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of 92.96% was shown to be achievable at 380 °C. The miscibility of avocado oil and DMC was seen to be a key factor in providing a strategic means for delaying thermal cracking of FAMEs. Lastly, this study reported that the optimal mass ratio of silica to oil was over 8 at 380 °C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to low degradability and high risks of toxic emissions, thermochemical conversions of plastics and textile among industrial solid wastes (ISWs) into biofuels are more favorable compared with common waste treatment options such as landfilling and burning. In this study, pyrolysis and non-isothermal torrefaction characteristics of two representative ISWs including PVC and oil cloth wastes are investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer to understand their thermodegradation behaviors. The results show that the pyrolysis of the ISWs are characterized by three different decomposition stages. A high heating rate is more energy efficient for non-isothermal torrefaction of oil cloth waste, whereas PVC waste is more suitable for non-isothermal torrefaction at a low heating rate. An independent parallel reaction (IPR) model is developed to predict the non-isothermal torrefaction dynamics of the wastes. It is found that the thermodegradation can be well predicted with an assumption of two components. Furthermore, the extracted kinetic data show that the kinetic parameters of an ISW component are much higher than those of common woody and algal biomass. © 2019

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is a promising route to transform biomass into bio-oil for further refining into transportation fuels and chemicals. However, bio-oil applications suffer from several challenges due to its adverse properties. This study reports improving bio-oil properties through co-pyrolysis of biomass with methane over molybdenum/zinc (MoZn/ZHSM-5) and HZSM-5 catalysts that promote deoxygenation, decarbonylation, hydrogen transfer and aromatization reactions. The co-pyrolysis was conducted at 650 °C and 750 °C in a micro-scale reactor and a bench-scale reactor. The highest bio-oil yield, energy content, and energy yield of 53.4%, 10.2 MJ/kg, and 29.9%, respectively, were obtained with methane over MoZn/HZSM-5 at 650 °C. Acids, alcohols, aldehydes, benzene derivatives, BTEXs, furans, ketones, PAHs, and phenols were detected in bio-oils while phenols dominated under most conditions. Oxygenated compounds decreased using MoZn/HZSM-5 with methane at 750 °C. The results demonstrate that methane used with catalysts can reduce oxygenated compounds and improve properties and yield of bio-oil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of composite CaO-Ca3Al2O6 mixed oxides were investigated as potential catalysts for biodiesel synthesis from waste fish oil. Different Ca/Al ratios, in the range of 1.5–6 were studied, alongside pure CaO. The catalysts were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and CO2-Temperature Program Desorption (TPD). The catalytic activity of the materials was studied for the transesterification reaction of cod liver oil with methanol at 65 °C, with 1:12 oil to methanol molar ratio and 10 wt% of catalyst. Over 97% conversion of the triglycerides to methyl esters was achieved for the 6Ca/Al catalyst after 2 h reaction time. This was similar to the performance of CaO. However, 6Ca/Al catalyst was reused successfully for seven consecutive tests, in contrast to CaO that was reused for only five tests, before it deactivated. Therefore, by incorporating the Ca3Al2O6, it was possible to enhance the stability of the catalytically active species and improve the lifetime of the catalyst. Post-test catalyst characterisation showed the formation of an intermediate phase (calcium diglyceroxide) that enhanced the catalyst's performance and tolerance to air exposure and humidity. Finally, the catalyst deactivation, after seven cycles, took place due to the formation of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solar pyrolysis of cotton stalk was carried out in a molten salt reactor heated by 4 kW solar simulator. The effects of pyrolysis temperature and mass ratio of molten salt to biomass on pyrolysis products properties were investigated. The use of molten salt as pyrolysis media increased gas yield. At 850 °C, the gas yield (mainly of CO and H2)continued to rise from 41.35 wt% to 82.57 wt% when mass ratio of molten salt to cotton stalk increased from 0 to 10. Pyrolysis in molten salt significantly decreased bio-oil acids and phenols, while increased aromatics among pyrolysis temperature range of 450–850 °C. There was positive correlation between the increased content of aromatics and mass ratio of molten salt to cotton stalk (from 0.5 to 10). The bio-char carbon content showed a general decreasing trend while oxygen, BET surface area and pore volume increased with using molten salt as pyrolysis media. Bio-char obtained from CS1MS5 pyrolysis at 850 °C had the highest BET surface area of 972.57 m2/g and the biggest total pore volume of 0.6203 cm3/g. High quality pyrolysis products with more uniform chemistry suggest catalytic reactions occur inside the solar reactor due to the intermediates degradation with molten salt. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We have developed a three-dimensional (3D) graphene electrode suitable for the immobilization of human sulfite oxidase (hSO), which catalyzes the electrochemical oxidation of sulfite via direct electron transfer (DET). The electrode is fabricated by drop-casting graphene-polyethylenimine (G-P) composites on carbon papers (CPs) precoated with graphene oxide (GO). The negatively charged hSO can be adsorbed electrostatically on the positively charged matrix (G-P) on CP electrodes coated with GO (CPG), with a proper orientation for accelerated DET. Notably, further electrochemical reduction of G-P on CPG electrodes leads to a 9-fold increase of the saturation catalytic current density (jm) for sulfite oxidation reaching 24.4 ± 0.3 μA cm-2, the highest value among reported DET-based hSO bioelectrodes. The increased electron transfer rate plays a dominating role in the enhancement of direct enzymatic current because of the improved electric contact of hSO with the electrode. The optimized hSO bioelectrode shows a significant catalytic rate (kcat: 25.6 ± 0.3 s-1) and efficiency (kcat/Km: 0.231 ± 0.003 s-1 μM-1) compared to the reported hSO bioelectrodes. The assembly of the hSO bioanode and a commercial platinum biocathode allows the construction of sulfite/O2 enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) with flowing fuels. The optimized EBFC displays an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.64 ± 0.01 V and a maximum power density of 61 ± 6 μW cm-2 (122 ± 12 mW m-3) at 30 °C, which exceeds the best reported value by more than 6 times. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the present work, Ulva lactuca, a marine macroalgae was used for the production of biodiesel. The ultrasound assisted extraction of oil from autoclaved algal biomass was found effective with maximum yield. The maximum oil was extracted at optimal conditions of 5% moisture content of algal biomass, 0.15 mm size of biomass, 6:1 solvent: solid ratio, at 55 °C in 140 min. The n-hexane with co-solvent methyl tertbutyl ether has shown higher oil when compared to other co-solvents. The extracted oil was transesterified into biodiesel using silica doped with zinc oxide as novel heterogeneous nanocatalyst. The maximum biodiesel yield of 97.43% was obtained at optimized conditions of 800 °C calcination temperature, 8% catalyst concentration, 9:1 methanol to oil ratio, 55 °C reaction temperature and 50 min reaction time. The kinetics of the transesterification reaction was also studied. The Ulva lactuca was found as a potential source for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work explores the potential use of biochar as a microbial cell carrier enhancing the efficiency of alcoholic fermentations. Olive kernels, vineyard prunings, sewage sludge and seagrass residues were applied as biowaste for biochar production through pyrolysis at two different temperatures (250 °C and 500 °C), while a commercial type of non-biomass char was also employed for benchmarking purposes. Apart from vineyard prunings pyrolyzed at 250 °C, all other carbonaceous materials presented crystalline phases including halite, calcite, sylvite and/or silicon. Moreover, increase in pyrolysis temperature enhanced biochar's porosity and BET-specific surface area, which reached 41.7 m2 g−1 for VP-based biochar remaining at lower levels (0.15–5.3 m2 g−1) in other specimens tested. Elemental analysis demonstrated reduction in oxygen and increase in the carbon content of biochars produced at elevated temperatures, while biochar from seagrass included residues of chloride (0.3–5.14%). Three major yeasts were immobilized on materials exhibiting the highest surface areas and applied in repeated batch fermentations using Valencia orange peel hydrolyzates as feedstock. The biocatalysts developed using S. cerevisiae and K. marxianus immobilized on vineyard prunings-based biochar exhibited exceptional ethanol productivities as compared to the relevant literature, which reached 7.2 g L−1 h−1 and 7.3 g L−1 h−1 respectively. Although the aforementioned strains improved biofuel production by 36–52% compared to the conventional process, P. kudriavzevii KVMP10 was not efficient following immobilization on biochar. The approach constitutes an innovative method for bioenergy production, demonstrating a novel application of biochar in industrial biotechnology which incorporates important technological advances such as enhanced biofuel production and biomass recycling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work firstly explores the feasibility of using a novel microwave-assisted, catalysed, hydrothermal process for the valorisation of brewers’ spent grains (BSGs), examining the effects of the temperature (180–250 °C), pressure (50–130 bar), reaction time (0–2 h) and catalyst amount (Ni-Co/Al-Mg, 0–0.25 g cat/g biomass). This route turned out to be a very promising approach for the production of bio-fuels (bio-oil and bio-char) and platform chemicals (sugar rich aqueous solutions) in a single unit, helping the development of an innovative bio-refinery around BSGs. The overall conversion and the yields to gas, aqueous fraction and bio-oil varied by 31–68%, 10–33%, 9–48% and 4–14%, respectively. The bio-oil was made up a complex mixture of phenols (0–26%), ketones (0–80%), aldehydes (0–57%), carboxylic acids (0–18%) and nitrogen compounds (0–76%). The proportions of C, H, N and O in the bio-oil varied as follow: 15–61 wt%, 5–10 wt%, 1–6 wt% and 26–77 wt%, respectively, which shifted its higher heating value (HHV) between 9 and 27 MJ/kg. The liquid fraction comprised a mixture of DP > 6 oligosaccharides (67–98 C-wt.%), DP2-6 oligosaccharides (0–10 C-wt.%), saccharides (0.2–7 C-wt.%), carboxylic acids (0–7 C-wt.%) and furans (0–27 C-wt.%). The spent solid after the experiments resembled an energetic like bio-char product, whose proportions of C, H, O and N varied by 35–72 wt%, 4–8 wt%, 1–4 wt% and 18–57 wt% and its HHV shifted between 9 and 32 MJ/kg. The optimisation of the process revealed that using a temperature of 250 °C and a pressure of 125 bar for 2 h, it is possible to convert the original material into high-energy biofuels: (8%) bio-oil (26 MJ/kg) and (35%) bio-char (32 MJ/kg); together with a (31%) saccharide-rich (>99 C-wt.%) aqueous solution, thus converting this process into a very promising approach to achieve an environmentally-friendly and integral valorisation of brewers’ spent grains. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of Scenedesmus obliquus has been optimized in a micro reactor using response surface methodology. Temperature, residence time and feedstock concentration were studied through central composite design to verify the optimized conditions leading to the highest yield of bio-crude and energy recovery. Based on the non-catalytic studies, temperature, feedstock concentration, and their interaction were respectively determined as the most effective variables. In order to improve the quality of produced bio-crude, the one step upgrading procedure was carried out in the presence of synthesized heterogeneous catalysts including Ni/AC, Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods and Ni/CeO2 nanorods. Although, it was found that, more or less, all the catalysts were able to improve the bio-crude yield and quality based on their specific characteristics, however using Ni/AC-CeO2 hybrid like nanorods, not only the bio-crude yield would be improved by more than 9% but also the bio-crude could be upgraded to a green bio-based fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For biodiesel production from waste cooking oils with high acid values, an inefficient esterification pretreatment is always conducted to convert free fatty acids (FFAs) before alkali-catalysed transesterification process. In this paper, phosphotungstic acid based poly(ionic liquid) was prepared to catalyse the esterification of palmitic acid with methanol while the required catalyst dosage was much lower than commercial Amberlyst-15. And the catalyst was characterized by 31P CP-MAS NMR, FTIR, SEM, XRF and TG. Among the three poly(ionic liquid)s prepared in this paper, phosphotungstic acid based poly(ionic liquid) was selected to be the most suitable catalyst for esterification because the catalyst could be reused for more than 5 times without significant deactivation. According to single factor analyses, the esterification yield could reach 91.6% after 8 h while the reaction temperature, methanol to acid molar ratio and catalyst dosage were 65 °C, 6 and 3% wt, respectively. Afterwards, palmitic acid was proposed to be first adsorbed on the catalyst before reacting with methanol. Finally, a palmitic acid adsorbed Eley-Rideal model was employed to analyse the reaction and the adsorption mechanism was assumed as well. © 2018

AB  - Effect of copper (Cu) or cerium (Ce) as promoters for nickel-molybdenum/γ-alumina (NiMo/γ-Al2O3) catalyst on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol (GUA), a model oxygenated compound found in a bio-oil derived from woody biomass, was comparatively investigated. The addition of Cu- or Ce-promoters affected the physicochemical properties of the NiMo catalyst. The NiMo catalyst promoted by Cu showed the higher reducibility, whilst the Ce-promoter (2–8 wt% based on γ-Al2O3 content) provided the NiMo catalyst with a higher distribution of active metals and induced a greater difficulty in the reduction under hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. For the HDO of GUA at a mild reaction condition (10 bar initial H2 pressure and 300 °C) in the absence of solvent, the Cu-promoter enhanced the hydrogenation activity of the NiMo catalyst to convert GUA to phenol and methylphenols, one-atomic oxygen species. Whereas, the addition of Ce obviously inhibited the formation of coke on the catalyst surface after a long reaction period (6 h) and gave a higher GUA conversion level with increasing yield of phenols. For the HDO of real bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of cassava rhizome, the NiMo catalysts promoted by Cu or Ce at 4 wt% based on the γ-Al2O3 content showed a higher performance at eliminating the oxygenated compounds in the bio-oil, reducing the oxygen/carbon (O/C) molar ratio by over seven-fold from 1.75 to 0.24–0.25. Moreover, the gross heating value of the bio-oil was improved from 21.5 to ca. 29.0 MJ/kg after the HDO process. However, the addition of the Cu or Ce promoter did not inhibit coke deposition, possibly due to the acidic properties of the bio-oil that deteriorated the catalyst performance by metal leaching. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of lipid waste and red mud was investigated to achieve valorization of red mud by fabricating biochar composite. For the further sustainable approach, this study intentionally employed carbon dioxide (CO2) as reaction medium in the co-pyrolysis process. The use of CO2 on co-pyrolysis of lipid waste and red mud enabled manipulation of the carbon distributions between pyrogenic products. CO2 expedited the thermal cracking of lipid waste and further reacted with lipid waste during the thermolysis. These mechanistic roles of CO2 were catalytically enhanced by the presence of mineral phases (Fe2O3) in red mud, thereby resulting in the enhanced formation of CO (40 times more at 550 °C). However, CO2 suppressed dehydrogenation of lipid waste (∼ 50%), which resulted in the different pathway for reducing iron oxide in red mud. Moreover, as an aspect of valorization of red mud, catalytic capability of biochar composite was evaluated. As a case study, biodiesel (FAMEs) were synthesized, and all experimental findings suggested that biochar composite could be an effective catalyst for biodiesel synthesis. As compare to biodiesel synthesis using silica (92% yield at 360 °C), the equivalent biodiesel yield was achieved with the biochar at much lower temperature (130 °C). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An efficient and green conversion process of producing 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) from corn stover was developed. The solid zeolite USY provided the good catalytic performance in ethanol medium with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as co-solvent, which can promote the formation of EMF, reducing the formation of ethyl levulinate and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. The reaction conditions were optimized via response surface methodology leading to a maximum EMF yield of 21.8% in ethanol/THF (volume ratio 1:1) under the conditions of 168 °C, 1 wt% USY loading and 2.9 h. Meanwhile, USY can be reused in five consecutive reaction runs with high activity, upholding the same initial activity and structural integrity. A plausible reaction pathway for the conversion of corn stover to EMF in ethanol/THF medium was further proposed. This study showed that the improved catalytic system presents an efficient method for direct production of EMF from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is well known the effects and limitations of the use of fossil fuels, for that reason is necessary to establish alternative sources of energy. The 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a chemical compound that can be obtained from the carbohydrates present in the biomass. Is a key compound for the obtaining of several valuable chemicals, many of them have a promising application as biofuels. In the present work, Pd-Ru and Pt-Ru bimetallic catalysts with low metal content (0.5%) supported on commercial γ-Al2O3 and FAU zeolite prepared by hydrothermal method, were synthesized and characterized to transform HMF into valuable chemicals under mild reaction conditions. Two crystallographic phases were found to coexist in the zeolite synthesized as support, the FAU phase prevailing over the LTA when calcined at 550 °C. The system studied with formic acid as hydrogen donor, under mild reaction conditions, showed a partial hydrogenation of HMF molecule evidenced in the 5-MF and 2,5-DMF formation. Also, a partial oxidation and esterification is happening for the formation of 2,5-DFF and 5-A-2-F, respectively. The catalysts supported on FAU showed better conversion of HMF that catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3. Although all metals showed catalytic activity by separed, Pd-Ru combination was more selective to produce 5-MF, 2,5-DMF and 2,5-DFF than Pt-Ru combination, and showed production of valuable furan derivatives even in their second and thir use. Pd–Ru/FAU catalyst formed a PdRu alloy phase, which can be related to its better catalytic performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As renewable electricity sources emerge, the conversion of electricity and CO 2 to carbon-based fuels (e-fuels) arises as a complementary or competing option to biofuels. This work provides a systematic performance comparison of both bio-and e-fuel pathways to identify characteristic differences and optimal applications of both production types. We construct a reaction network that features biochemical and thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, transesterification of waste vegetable oil, and e-based routes (E-routes) using renewable H 2 . The network is optimized for economic and environmental criteria using two pathway screening tools, i.e., Reaction Network Flux Analysis and Process Network Flux Analysis. Furthermore, we apply a linear combination metric to analyze the advantages of bio-e-hybrid designs on a global fleet level. The results show that lignocellulosic-based fuels are relatively inexpensive but typically incur energy-intensive separations and high carbon losses. E-routes, on the contrary, result in only small carbon losses and global warming potentials as low as 5 gCO2,eq.MJfuel. However, they come at high cost due to the use of expensive renewable H 2 . When combinations are considered, biomass can be utilized by upgrading it with e-based H 2 . In the case of bio-e-hybrid ethanol plants, co-fermentation of sugars and utilization of CO 2 emitted during fermentation are identified as viable low-cost options for carbon loss reduction. These hybrid pathway designs outperform combinations of purely bio-based and purely e-based pathways at the fleet level. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Abstract: The emerging fuel crisis necessitates a shift in focus towards alternative renewable forms, so that sustainable development can be achieved. Bio-oil is a promising alternative renewable source of energy which is a third generation bio-fuel. Algae are a popular candidate for bio-fuel production due to their high lipid contents, ease of cultivation and rapid growth rate. In this study, Hydrothermal liquefaction of Scenedesmus obliques biomass cultivated in photo-bio-reactor (PBR) from wastewater was studied. The influence of process parameters on the bio-oil yield and bio-oil upgrading was analysed. Different S. obliques biomass to water ratios (0.025, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 g/ml) were liquefied at diverse temperatures ranging from 200 to 340°C under 5 MPa N2 gas atmosphere. The influence of catalyst on bio-oil upgradation was studied at varying catalyst loading of the range 1–5 wt %. Bio-oil was analysed using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Results showed a maximum bio-oil yield of 24.57 wt % at 300°C, 15 g/200 ml biomass load and 2.5 wt % NaOH at 60 min holding time. Also, it was found that the gas generated from liquefaction process contained 22 vol % Hydrogen gas, 18 vol % Carbon dioxide gas, 27 vol % Carbon monoxide gas, 22 vol % of methane gas and a small amount of other gaseous components (H2S). HTL bio-oil was upgraded and it resulted in 30.15 wt % yield with higher degree of C7−C21 range hydrocarbons in it. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, the waste generation increases more and more, especially of the municipal solid waste. The municipal solid waste reject fraction may be valorized from an energy point of view. With this aim, a conceptual design of a process was developed by considering material and energy integration, which mainly consists of three sub-processes: fast pyrolysis of municipal solid waste to produce bio-oil, supercritical water reforming of the bio-oil aqueous phase to produce hydrogen to be used in the third section, which is the upgrading of the organic phase of the bio-oil by hydrodeoxygenation. The overall system was simulated using Aspen Plus software to achieve the highest process performance and the lowest utilities requirement. The former was assessed by the biofuel production (liquefied fuel gas, gasoline and diesel) and the net electrical power. In addition, the potential economic profitability of the plant was performed by specifying the main process units. Thus, for a feeding of 50 t/h of municipal solid waste reject fraction, a generation of a net electric power equal to 10.65 MWe and a production of 5.2 t/h biofuels (21.1% of the carbon present in the municipal solid waste) may be achieved, thus obtaining a very low gate fee (16.7 €/t) using the same industrial selling prices that those of fossil fuels and electricity in a full plant. Therefore, the process seems to be technically and economically feasible. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A highly efficient and selective dehydration of xylose to furfural was achieved using a sulfonic acid-functionalized, mesoporous silica KIT-6 type catalyst in a water/toluene biphasic system. The catalyst was prepared by co-condensation between tetraethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropyl(methyl)dimethoxysilane, in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (Pluronic, P123, Mw = 5800). The catalytic performance was then investigated with respect to the molar ratio of tetraethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropyl(methyl)dimethoxysilane, as well as the reaction temperature and reaction time. The optimal catalyst was prepared using tetraethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropyl(methyl)dimethoxysilane in a molar ratio of 0.8:0.2, giving both high xylose conversion and furfural selectivity (greater than 94%) at 170 °C for 2 h. In addition, the catalyst had a high turnover frequency and could be reused without treatment for up to three cycles. The high turnover frequency in the xylose dehydration reaction was attributed to the three-dimensional structure of the KIT-6 mesoporous silica that facilitates the diffusion of both the reactant and products in the xylose dehydration reaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Homologation of bioethanol to butanol and higher alcohols by means of Guerbet reaction was performed with a novel ruthenium based bifunctional catalyst under homogeneous conditions in the presence of a basic cocatalyst. Reaction screening demonstrated that the new catalyst shows conversions and selectivity comparable with some of ruthenium based bifunctional catalysts recently reported in the literature. The reaction occurs in pure ethanol as well as in ethanol from wine waste furnished by CAVIRO distillery with up to 46% conversion of ethanol and an overall selectivity to higher alcohols of 91% and a minor carbon loss. Based on the laboratory results, an industrialization study was carried out in order to propose a viable technological solution. The experimental data consistency was verified, and the results were up-scaled to design a reactor working in a batch or, potentially, semibatch operation mode. Further analysis of the overall process, together with the introduction of dedicated figures of merit have allowed the estimation of the process performance both in mass and energetic terms, and the outcome was integrated into a life cycle analysis. Although preliminary, the multidisciplinary approach has converged toward complementary results; more specifically, the adoption of the base cocatalyst NaOEt has showed similar performance in terms of specific alcohols production and energy demand compared to the NaOH case. Moreover, this last case proves to be better from an environmental perspective (LCA). © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuel cells, which can convert chemical energy into electricity have been considered as one of the most promising candidates for powering implantable and microscale biomedical devices. However, most biofuel cells generate a low power output, limiting their practical applications. Here, we introduce a high-performance biofuel cell based on gold nanoparticle-modified carbon nanotube hybrid fibers. These hybrid electrodes could be converted into anodes through additional enzyme deposition and used directly as cathodes, allowing notable oxygen reduction reaction activity as well as high electrical conductivity (∼6100 S cm-1). The formed hybrid biofuel cell, composed of an enzymatic anode and a gold nanoparticle-coated carbon fiber cathode, provides an outstanding stationary power output of 1.2 mW cm-2 under a fixed external resistance (cyclic voltammetry measurement ∼2.1 mW cm-2) at 300 mmol L-1 glucose. Furthermore, these one-dimensional hybrid electrodes with extremely high electrical conductivity can be widely applied in various wire-type electrochemical devices. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The effect of the agglomeration of the ZrO 2 /n-ZSM-5 catalyst with two different clays (bentonite and attapulgite) on lignocellulose catalytic pyrolysis has been investigated. The reaction tests have been carried out with an "ex situ" configuration of the reaction system, which allowed the thermal and catalytic zones to operate at different temperatures (550 and 400 °C, respectively). The behavior of the agglomerated catalysts has been compared with those of the binder-free material and the pure clays. The catalyst samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, microscopy, chemical analysis and Ar adsorption measurements, as well as by FTIR of both adsorbed pyridine and CO 2 to probe their acid-base properties. The occurrence of synergetic effects between the different catalyst components in the agglomerated materials has been denoted in lignocellulose catalytic pyrolysis. Agglomeration caused opposite effects on the catalyst performance depending on the clay. With bentonite as the binder, the technical catalyst showed a reduced bio-oil deoxygenation activity due to a loss of most of its strong acidity by ion-exchange of Na + cations from the clay. However, the agglomerated catalyst incorporating attapulgite exhibited an enhanced activity leading to the production of a bio-oil with significantly lower oxygen content. For this system a migration of Mg 2+ occurs from the attapulgite towards both the zeolitic and ZrO 2 components of the parent catalyst. Although this fact partially decreases the concentration of the zeolite Brønsted acid sites, it also has a promotion effect on both Lewis acidity and basicity due to the interaction between the migrating Mg 2+ species and the ZrO 2 phase. As a result, the technical catalyst agglomerated with attapulgite exhibits a well-balanced distribution of acid and basic sites, which is responsible for the remarkable enhancement observed in the bio-oil deoxygenation activity in comparison with the binder-free material. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Improving the yield and methane content of biogas is of great concern for wastewater treatment by anaerobic digestion. Herein we developed a nanomagnetite-enhanced electromethanogenesis (EMnano) process for the first time, the sustainable utilization of which improved the biomethane production rate from dairy wastewater. The maximum CH4 production rate in the EMnano process is 2.3 ± 0.3-fold higher than it is in the conventional methanogenesis (CM) process, and it is accompanied by an almost delay-free start-up. The technical-economic evaluation revealed that an 82.1 ± 5.0% greater net benefit was obtained in the third generation of the EMnano process compared with the CM process. The improved methanogenesis was attributed to the formation of dense planktonic cell co-aggregates that are triggered by nanomagnetite, which facilitated the interspecies electron exchange during acetoclastic methanogenesis. Simultaneously, a cathode biofilm with high viability and catalytic activity was also formed in the EMnano process that decreased the biofilm resistance and facilitated the electron transfer during electromethanogenesis. This study is a worthwhile attempt to combine recyclable conductive materials with an electromethanogenesis process for wastewater treatment, and it effectively achieves energy recovery with high stability and cost-effectiveness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A very efficient chemical pre-treatment method that uses cheap and safe hydrated-salts as catalysts for the conversion of waste cooking oils and animal fats having a high Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) content into an oily feedstock convertible into biodiesel through a conventional route (basic catalysis) was investigated. These hydrated-salts allow FFAs to be efficiently (>99%) esterified with alcohols under very mild conditions (343 K, 2 h). At the end of this treatment, a very convenient separation of products was verified. Two different phases were eventually obtained: an upper alcoholic phase, which contains most of the unreacted alcohol, water obtained by direct-esterification (>95%), and the salt that was used as catalyst (recovery >99%); and a lower oily-phase mainly composed of glycerides, methyl-esters derived from direct-esterification of FFAs (residual acidity of about 0.8 mg KOH/g), and part of unreacted alcohol (7–10%wt). Such a separation was convenient because the oily-phase could be directly trans-esterified through conventional base-catalysis, without any further pre-treatments, thus avoiding production of salty-waste. Also, the alcoholic phase could be recovered and directly re-used for new pre-treatments cycles of fresh waste-oils. A final scheme of the proposed process was discussed and the relevant advantages with respect to conventional routes were highlighted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study an exhaust gas recirculation system was developed for a small single cylinder 4-stroke engine. Then the mathematical models to correlate responses as the engine emissions and performance characteristics to the factors, include engine load, engine speed, EGR rate and biodiesel fuel percent, were developed. Finally, by using the developed models and NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) method, the factors were optimized. The highest decrease in NOx emissions while using the biodiesel and EGR is 63.76% with B10 fuel blend (10% biodiesel fuel and 90% diesel fuel blend by volume) and 30% EGR rate. The highest reduction in HC emission levels while using EGR and biodiesel simultaneously, has been 54.05%. The adjusted R2 of the proposed model for the CO, HC, NOx, Power, BSFC and smoke were 0.94, 0.91, 0.88, 0.95, 0.89 and 0.94, respectively. Results of the optimization of the engine factors with NSGA-II method has been satisfactory and the pareto front for different test conditions was proposed. The outcomes of the study revealed that the optimization should be taken into account in the development of the new policy for using of the biofuel in the internal combustion engines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Real-time studies highlighting the actual bottlenecks of microalgae-based biofuels are needed to overcome the limitations of assumption-based approach. In the present study, an algal consortium consisting of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Phormidium, was cultivated in municipal wastewater under outdoor conditions in a pilot scale (100 L) attached biofilm reactor during January-February 2018. No energy was used to maintain the cultivation conditions (temperature, light intensity/duration). After 6 days of hydraulic retention time, the consortium showed 53–87% reduction in the nutrients’ concentrations of the selected wastewater. Consistent biomass productivity of 3.48 ± 0.44 g m−2 d−1 was observed, and its biochemical composition showed that it was rich in lipids (35.20 ± 0.63% of total solids). The wastewater grown algal biomass was subjected to anaerobic digestion at 37 °C for 30 days and hydrothermal liquefaction at 27 bars and 230 °C for 20 min to produce biomethane or biocrude, respectively. On performing the biomethane potential assay, a cumulative biomethane production of 346.59 ± 5 mL g−1 VS was observed. The theoretical methane production and stoichiometric methane potential calculated for the biomass was 504 mL g−1 VS and 591 mL g−1 VS, respectively, showing a digestibility of 58.5%. Hydrothermal liquefaction of the wastewater grown biomass gave biocrude yield of 43 ± 2% (dried biomass basis) rich in aldehydes/ketones/fatty acids. Net energy ratios for the two processes were compared. Net energy ratio for algal cultivation integrated with anaerobic digestion was found to be 0.007 and for that with hydrothermal liquefaction was found to be 0.08, proving it to be a more energy efficient process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate and optimize a pilot-scale microreactor to convert waste cooking oil (WCO) into biodiesel using kettle limescale. Box-Behnken design was used to determine the optimum conditions for producing biodiesel. Effects of main variables including reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, and alcohol/oil volume ratio were evaluated at a constant residence time of 10 min. Based on the results of analysis of variance, the quadratic regression model had the best coefficient of determination (R2=0.9930) and adjusted coefficient of determination (RAdj.2= 0.9804). After the optimization of temperature, catalyst concentration, and methanol/oil volume ratio, the residence time was optimized to achieve the maximum purity of the produced biodiesel. At a reaction temperature of 61.7 °C, catalysts concentration (oil based) of 8.87 wt %, methanol to oil volume ratio of 1.7:3, and a residence time of 15 min, we observed the optimal conditions for obtaining a maximum biodiesel purity of 93.41%. © 2019

AB  - We develop a framework for comparing carbon-neutral synthetic fuels (CNSFs) with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as alternatives to reducing CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles. CNSFs can be divided into fuels produced from biomass via gasification and electrofuels produced from CO2 and water using electricity. We develop CNSF cost estimates for first-of-a-kind plants operating at commercial scale. Although already competitive over short distances, we find that longer-range BEVs are likely to remain more expensive than CNSFs even if low (∼$125/kWh) battery costs are achieved, and all three options would require carbon prices in excess of $130/tCO2 or oil prices in excess of $100/bbl to become commercially viable relative to petroleum. The viability of electrofuels ultimately depends on access to low-cost, ultra-low-carbon power systems or sources of zero-carbon electricity with high annual availability. Priorities should include deploying a portfolio of CNSF technologies to help appraise decarbonization pathways, economies of scale, and learning by doing. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
Global energy demand for transport more than doubled from 45 EJ in 1973 to 110 EJ in 2014, increasing its share of total final consumption from 23% to 28%. As a result, sectoral CO2 emissions have more than doubled since petroleum products dominate (96% of transportation sector energy consumption in 2016). To be consistent with Paris Agreement targets, under the International Energy Agency (IEA) baseline projection, demand would need to fall from 160 EJ in 2050 to 102 EJ, or roughly current levels, but would need to be substantially less carbon-intensive. Decarbonizing transport will require a combination of sustainable fuels (advanced biofuels and electrofuels produced from electricity and CO2) and new powertrains (battery electric vehicles or BEVs). The greatest reductions will need to come from decarbonizing road transport, which is seen as the easiest sector for BEVs and the most challenging for synthetic fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are often seen as best suited to reduce emissions from light-duty vehicles, whereas synthetic fuels (whether advanced biofuels or so-called electrofuels) are touted as drop-in substitutes for more costly end uses such as aviation or heavy-goods vehicles. We provide a side-by-side comparison of biofuels, electrofuels, and BEVs using the data from recent projects to explore the conditions needed for these different options to become viable in decarbonizing passenger transport. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - La-Fe modified Si-MCM-41 (La-Fe/Si-MCM-41) catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method and used in catalytic cracking of soybean oil (CCS) for biofuel production. The catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, XPS, Py-FTIR and CO2-TPD. The results showed that the aromatics content increased with the increase in B/L value, while the content of oxygenated compounds decreased, indicating that Brönsted acid sites were the major active sites for deoxygenation and aromatization reactions. Compared with Si-MCM-41, the Brönsted acidity of LFM-6 sharply decreased from 22.49 to 5.86 μmol g−1. Accordingly, the aromatics content was reduced from 37.51 wt.% to 14.52 wt.% which was lower than the limitation (15 wt.%) according to the global environmental legislation. However, for the LFM-6 catalyst, the excessive loss of Brönsted acid sites and sharp decrease in BET surface area and pore volume led to the decrease in deoxygenation. As a result, the fatty acids content increased from 2.71 wt.% to 16.67 wt.% and the acid value reached 35.20 mgKOH g−1. When the La-Fe loading increased to 15 wt.%, part of fatty acids were converted into ketones by the active sites on Fe2O3/La2O3 and strong Lewis acid sites on catalysts. Besides, the new weak Lewis acid and basic sites on Fe2O3/La2O3 exhibited the synergistic effect on promoting the generation of alkenes. The CaO/LFM-6 composite catalysts prepared by the mechanical mixing of LFM-6 and CaO were used in CCS to reduce the acid value of biofuel. LFM-6-C-3 was proved to be an effective catalyst for CCS to produce biofuel with low aromatics (12.31 wt.%) and fatty acids (2.76 wt.%) content. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global warming concerns have driven developments in carbon neutral energy, pulling initiatives on biofuels production. However, the low bulk density and low specific energy of biomass refrain its widespread use due to logistic costs comprising harvesting and collection, storage, pretreatments and transportation. This work approaches increasing land energy productivity by thermochemical conversion of residual biomass to energy products, identifying the best options in terms of energy efficiency and economic indicators. Techno-economic performance of three corncob-to-energy pathways is investigated: gasification to methanol, fast pyrolysis to bio-oil and combustion to electricity. Fast pyrolysis allows higher energy recovery in its products (79%) than biomass gasification to methanol (53%), with biomass densification (volume reduction) of 72.7% and 86.2%, respectively. The combustion route presents net efficiency of 30.2% of biomass low heating value (LHV). All alternatives are economically feasible provided biomass cost is lower than US$75.5/t. The minimum allowable product prices for economic attractiveness of gasification, combustion and pyrolysis routes are US$305/t methanol, US$80.1/MWh electricity and US$1.47/gasoline-gallon-equivalent bio-oil. Despite its vulnerability to price volatility, gasification presents the highest net present value, seconded by the combustion route, which has lower medium-term payback and investment than gasification due to its process simplicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae offer promising and multifaceted solutions to the ongoing issues regarding energy security and climate change. One of the major bottlenecks in utilizing algal biomass is the excessive amount of moisture to be managed after harvest, which translates to costs in the dewatering step. Newer strategies have been developed to be able to convert algal biomass feedstock to biodiesel without the need for extraction and drying, such as in-situ transesterification. This process can be improved by concurrently subjecting the system under subcritical conditions, which could also potentially remove the use of catalysts as well as offer tolerance to free fatty acid content of the feedstock. A definitive screening design of experiment was utilized to provide an acceptable prediction on the effects of key process parameters – temperature, reaction time, and solvent-to-solid ratio to the obtainable fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)yield and process power consumption. The optimum operating condition, which combines the benefits of maximizing the FAME yield and minimizing the process power consumption was found to be at 220 °C, 2 h, and 8 ml methanol per gram of biomass (80 wt% moisture). This produces a FAME yield of 74.6% with respect to the maximum obtainable FAME. Sensitivity analysis discussed the implications regarding the weight of importance between the two responses of interest. The benefits of the proposed process can be observed when compared to its conventional transesterification counterpart in terms of energy savings and reduced environmental impact. Hence, this process offers a feasible alternative to produce biodiesel from microalgae. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using periodic density functional theory calculations combined with four dispersion-correction schemes, we have investigated the adsorption of phenol, toluene and water for various cation-exchanged faujasite zeolites. In the context of purifying the biofuels derived from the catalytic cracking of lignocellulosic bio-oils in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit, our aim was to find a suitable material with a higher affinity for phenol versus toluene and water, which are also present in the biofuel charge. In order to identify the most promising adsorbent materials, we have undertaken a full screening of monovalent cations which can be incorporated into the faujasite-type zeolite (FAU). We have evidenced that phenol can be adsorbed in two modes: O-interaction (where phenol is adsorbed via its oxygen) and π-interaction (where phenol is adsorbed via its aromatic ring). The screening of the interaction energies of the different exchanged zeolites showed that over HFAU the phenol is selectively adsorbed via O-interaction, contrary to what is observed over alkali and transition metal exchanged zeolites where the π-interaction dominates for the adsorption of phenol, leading to weaker interaction with the zeolite compared to toluene. On the Lewis modeled acid sites, namely the defect Lewis acid site (D-LAS) and the extraframework Lewis acid site (EX-LAS), the two interaction modes of phenol show almost equivalent interaction energies. In terms of selectivity, HFAU is the most selective to phenol adsorption towards O-interaction even in the presence of toluene and H2O molecules. Both adsorption modes of phenol present a higher interaction energy than those of toluene and H2O once adsorbed over an EX-LAS. The alkali and metallic cations have a high affinity for toluene molecules, which prohibit their use for the biofuel purification process. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Upgrading of pyrolysis bio-oil by a novel catalytic hydrotreating process, including hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) was found as an effective technical method for the improvement of biofuel characteristics. In this study, for the first time, the performance of a novel meso-microporous composite material, HMS-ZSM-5, as a support on the catalytic activity of NiMo-based catalysts in the bio-oil hydrotreating was evaluated. The experiments were carried out in a flow fixed-bed reactor at the temperature range of 300–360 °C, 30 bar pressure, and LHSV = 4 h-1. Also, the results were and compared with those of HMS, ZSM-5, and γ-Al2O3 supports. For all catalysts, the increase in temperature resulted in the enhancement of HDO and HDN reactions efficiency. NiMo/HMS-ZSM-5 possessed a high acid property which contributed to the removal of oxygen and nitrogen from bio-oil, with the conversion of 84.10% and 69.60%, respectively. Therefore, the novel catalyst of this study represented much superior upgrading performances compared with those of stand-alone NiMo/HMS and NiMo/ZSM-5 catalysts and also the conventional catalyst of NiMo/γ-Al2O3. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Two activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by physical activation of Maize Cob Waste (MCW) with CO2, during 2 and 3 h (MCW(PA)2h and MCW(PA)3h, respectively). Two other ACs were prepared by chemical activation: a) MCW(LD) – MCW was impregnated with anaerobic liquid digestate (LD) and carbonized under N2 atmosphere; and b) CAR-MCW(LD) – previously carbonized MCW was impregnated with LD and carbonized under N2 atmosphere. All ACs were fully characterized for textural and chemical properties, and then used in dynamic H2S removal assays from real biogas samples. Regarding H2S removal, the ACs that were physically activated behaved much better than the impregnated ones: MCW(PA)3h and MCW(PA)2h showed H2S uptake capacities of 15.5 and 0.65 mg g−1, respectively, while MCW(LD) and CAR-MCW(LD) showed values of 0.47 and 0.25 mg g−1, respectively. This may indicate that textural properties (surface area and microporosity) are more important than mineral content in H2S removal. Effectively, both surface area and micropore volume were much higher for the samples of MCW(PA)3h (SBET = 820 m2 g−1 and Vmicro = 0.32 cm3 g−1) and MCW(PA)2h (SBET = 630 m2 g−1 and Vmicro = 0.21 cm3 g−1) than for the ACs that were chemically activated (SBET = 38.0 m2 g−1 and Vmicro = 0.01 cm3 g−1 for MCW(LD); SBET = 8.0 m2 g−1 and Vmicro = 0.01 cm3 g−1 for CAR-MCW(LD)). High oxygen content in MCW(PA)3h favoured the catalytic oxidation reaction of H2S, promoting its removal. The use of MCW as precursor and LD as activating agent of the ACs may contribute for the integrated management of maize wastes and to diversify the applications of anaerobic digestate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis of macroalgae [Enteromorpha prolifera (EP)] and lignocellulosic biomass [rice husk (RH)] in a fixed bed reactor for maximum and enhanced biofuels yield has been investigated. The main and interaction effects of three effective co-pyrolysis parameters (pyrolysis temperature, feedstock blending ratio, and heating rate) were also modeled and simulated to determine the yield rates of bio-oil and bio-char, respectively. Optimization studies were, then, performed to predict the optimal conditions for maximum yields using the central composite circumscribed experimental design in Design Expert ® software 8.0.6. Analysis of variance was carried out to determine whether the fit of the multiple regressions is significant for the second-order model. Normal pyrolysis oils from EP, RH, and co-pyrolysis oils obtained from different feedstock blending ratios were examined using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify their compositions. Some vital properties of oils and bio-chars such as the heating value, water content, elemental compositions, and specific gravity were also determined, which unveiled that synergistic effect exists between EP and RH during co-pyrolysis, and this led to increase in products’ yields and improved co-pyrolysis products’ quality. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - More than 95% of biodiesel production feedstocks come from edible oils, however it may cause some problems such as the competition of land use between food production and biodiesel production. The waste cooking oils (WCO) are an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production; its usage reduces significantly the cost of biodiesel production and has environmental benefits, e.g., a waste recovery instead of its elimination. This work aims to produce a low-cost efficient solid catalyst for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production using mixtures of refined palm oil (RPO) and WCO. Four low cost catalysts were prepared (biomass fly ashes, natural dolomite rock, chicken eggshells and polyethylene terephthalate - PET), characterized (by SEM, EDX, XRD, BET, FT-IR and Hammett indicators) and tested regarding their performance in FAME production. The maximum yield of FAME achieved was around 96%wt. for biomass fly ashes catalyst at 60 °C, 9:1 (mol/mol) of methanol to oil mixture, 10%wt. catalyst to oil mixture, over 180 min in batch reactor. The results point out for promising bifunctional catalysts able to achieve also conversion of free fatty acids up to 100% using mixtures of RPO and WCO. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgradation of bio-based furans into chemicals and biofuels has received great interest recently. In this work, we reported selective synthesis of furan carboxylic acids from the corresponding aldehydes by recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing 3-succinoylsemialdehyde-pyridine dehydrogenase (SAPDH) from Comamonas testosteroni SC1588. The effects of induction and reaction conditions on whole-cell catalytic oxidation of furfural (FF) were studied. High temperature induction resulted in decreased activities of recombinant cells, likely due to improper protein folding. Nonetheless, recombinant cells induced under high temperature enable the byproduct furfuryl alcohol to be faster re-oxidized into 2-furoic acid (FCA) than those induced under low temperature. So the yield and selectivity of FCA were improved significantly by using high temperature induction, at expense of slightly longer reaction periods. The activities of recombinant cells highly depended on pH. The tolerant levels of this recombinant strain toward FF and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were approximately 100 mM. FCA and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) were obtained with the yields of 95–98%. FCA of up to 147 mM was produced by a fed-batch strategy, in a quantitative yield. In addition, most aromatic aldehydes tested were transformed into the target carboxylic acids by this biocatalytic method, with the yields up to 100%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The search of alternative plastics to replace the fossil-based ones has become an urgent matter in the last years. To contribute to this, the assessment of the incorporation of bio-oil into biodegradable PVA films was proposed in this work in order to obtain coating films with UV shielding properties. For this aim, organosolv-lignin-based bio-oil and PVA with different molecular weight and hydrolysis degrees were used for the film elaboration by solvent-casting method. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of different amounts of bio-oil in PVA film-properties as well as the addition of glycerol as a plasticiser. The chemical and mechanical properties of the obtained films were measured. Results showed that bio-oil interacted with PVA, modifying in this way the film properties. The effect of the bio-oil on the long-term mechanical stability of the PVA films was assessed through their exposure to accelerated testing using UV. This experiment resulted in a decline on the Young's modulus and in an increase on the elongation break and therefore, in a possible decrease on their degradation time. Hence, it can be concluded that bio-oil could be a potential functional additive to blend with PVA for tailoring films with specific applications, especially for UV protective ones. Moreover, the presence of bio-oil in the blends with PVA would improve their degradation decreasing their accumulation in the environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel solid Lewis acid catalyst F−-SO42-/MWCNTs was prepared by impregnating multi-walled carbon nanotubes with sulfuric acid and NaF solution. It was characterized by several techniques. Catalytic activity of F−-SO42-/MWCNTs was evaluated in the esterification reaction of oleic acid and methanol. It exhibited high catalytic activity, giving an oleic acid conversion of 90% when the reaction was conducted with 0.9 wt% catalyst and a methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1 at 65 °C over 6 h. A kinetic study of F−-SO42-/MWCNTs catalyzed esterification reaction of oleic acid and methanol was implemented after reaction conditions have been optimized, and it was described by the reversible pseudo second-order reaction rate law. Kinetic constant was correlated with the molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid, catalyst concentrations and reaction temperature. Pre-exponential factor (A) and activation energy (Ea) of the positive and reverse reactions of the F−-SO42-/MWCNTs-catalyzed esterification were obtained. The values of A and Ea of the forward reaction were 1.88 L mol−1 h−1 and 32.73 kJ mol−1, and the values of the reverse reaction were 1.90 L mol−1 h−1 and 32.61 kJ mol−1, respectively. The biodiesel product obtained in this study meet the requirements of the ASTM D6751 standard. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the increasing demand for formaldehyde as a building block in the chemical industry as well as its emerging potential as feedstock for biofuels in the form of dimethoxymethane and the oxymethylene ethers produced therefrom, the catalytic transformation of carbon dioxide to the formaldehyde oxidation state has become a focus of interest. In this work, we present novel ruthenium complexes with hetero-triphos ligands, which show high activity in the selective transformation of carbon dioxide to dimethoxymethane. We substituted the apical carbon atom in the backbone of the triphos ligand platform with silicon or phosphorus and optimized the reaction conditions to achieve turnover numbers as high as 685 for dimethoxymethane. The catalytic systems could also be tuned to preferably yield methyl formate with turnover numbers of up to 1370, which in turn can be converted into dimethoxymethane under moderate conditions.

AB  - The current study aims to investigate the effects of agricultural waste-derived activated carbon catalyst on the jet-fuel range hydrocarbons distribution from raw biomass pyrolysis under the hydrogen donor condition provided by a solid waste. Ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of lignin with and without soapstock was carried out using the corn stover-derived activated carbon catalyst in a facile fixed bed reactor. Results showed that the soapstock, as the hydrogen donor, exhibited a positive synergistic effect with lignin on enhancing the production of valuable aromatics in the obtained bio-oil. Additionally, biomass-derived activated carbon catalyst has the robust catalytic ability to convert pyrolysis vapors into high-density jet fuel-ranged aromatic hydrocarbons rather than phenols with the assistance of soapstock solid waste. Results indicated that the proportions of jet-fuel range aromatics increased monotonically with elevating pyrolytic temperatures from 400 to 550 °C, and the optimal lignin/soapstock ratio was 1:2 with regarding the yield of attained bio-oils. The maximum proportion of jet-fuel ranged aromatics (87.8%) and H 2 concentration (76.4 vol%) could be achieved with the pyrolytic temperature, lignin/soapstock ratio, and catalyst/feedstock ratio of 550 °C, 2:1, and 1:1, respectively. The current study may provide a novel route of converting solid wastes into value-added jet fuels and hydrogen-enriched fuel gases, which will advance the utilization of renewable biomass. © 2019

AB  - A sequential two-stage process comprising biological acidification followed by anaerobic digestion was proposed to enhance gaseous biofuel production from the mixture of rice residue and micro-algae after thermo-chemicial hydrolysis. The maximum specific hydrogen yield of 223.1 ± 8.8 mL/g volatile solids (VS) and production rate of 10.4 ± 0.4 mL/g VS/h were achieved from hydrothermal acid pre-treated biomass during biological acidification. Increase in hydraulic retention time of biological acidification from 12 to 144 h significantly affected the distribution of solubilised metabolic products and led to improved biological acidification rates (BARs) from 15.5% to 78.5%. Compared with single stage anaerobic digestion, the first stage acidification phase led to reductions in the lag-phase time and peak time of anaerobic digestion in such a two-stage process. The maximum specific methane production rate of 2.2 ± 0.03 mL/g VS/h was achieved with a deep acidification of 144 h yielding a BAR of 78.5%. Increasing the length of time in biological acidification from 12 to 144 h contributed to improved energy conversion efficiency of 25.4%–64% after 120 h of anaerobic digestion. These results demonstrate that biological acidification is feasible to improve bioenergy recovery in two-stage fermentation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Camellia oleifera shell (COS) and stillingia oil (SO) was performed in the temperature range of 400–600 °C. The effects of feedstock and pyrolysis temperatures on product yield and bio-oil composition were discussed in detail. The bio-oil yield from COS pyrolysis varied from 37.30 wt% to 40.27 wt%, which was 11.32 wt% to 21.62 wt% lower than that from SO pyrolysis. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis indicated that SO bio-oil was rich in hydrocarbons, whereas COS pyrolysis produced mainly oxygen-containing compounds predominantly comprising phenols and acids. Fourier transform infrared and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed significant differences in the chemical structure of bio-oils from COS and SO pyrolysis. Elemental-composition and physical-property analyses further revealed that SO bio-oils were similar to gasoline and heavy fuel oil. © 2018

AB  - Soaring demand for alternative fuels has been gaining wide interest due to depletion of conventional fuel, increasing petroleum prices and greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiesel, an alternative fuel, derived from oleaginous microbes has been promising because of short incubation time and easy to scale up. Oleaginous yeast Trichosporon sp. is capable of utilizing glycerol and agro-residues for enhanced lipid synthesis. Lipid extraction from Trichosporon sp. biomass showed highest lipid content with ultrasonic assisted extraction (43 ± 0.33%, w/w) coupled with process parameters than the conventional Soxhlet (30 ± 0.28%, w/w) and Binary solvent [choloroform:methanol, (2:1, v/v)] methods (36 ± 0.38%, w/w), respectively. The standardized process parameters of ultrasonic assisted extraction coupled with chloroform/methanol solvent system resulted 95–97% of conversion efficiency in 20 min at 30 °C with a frequency of 50 Hz and 2800 W power, respectively. Enzymatic transesterification of yeast biomass lipid obtained 85% of fatty acid methyl esters that are predominant with oleic acid methyl ester followed by palmitic and stearic acid methyl esters, respectively. These results substantiate that the ultrasonic assisted extraction is a potential green extraction technique that had reduced time, energy and solvent consumption without compromising on lipid quality. Deploying this green extraction technique could make the biodiesel production process inexpensive and eco-friendly. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) based bienzymes are entrapped in a polyethylenimine (PEI) matrix and then immobilized onto a substrate consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT) and pyrene boronic acid (PBA) (CNT/PBA/[HRP/PEI/GOx]). This structure is considered as the cathodic catalyst for the glucose biofuel cell (GBFC). According to the performance evaluations of the catalyst, the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is improved because of the bienzyme entrapped well in PEI, and also, because the CNT/PBA substrate promotes electron transfer by the formation of π–π stacking and the reduction of the electron transfer pathway distance. The high ORR reaction rate (38.7 μA cm−2 in the injection of 5 mM glucose) is clear evidence of an excellent catalyst. In addition, when the catalyst is adopted for the operation of a membrane GBFC, a high-power density (77.9 ± 2.3 μW cm−2) is achieved, as well as good storage stability (81% of its initial activity even after 4 weeks) and a high glucose consumption rate (8.7 ± 0.2% from its initial concentration during 7 operating hours). Alternatively, when the catalyst is used for the membraneless GBFC operation, a relatively high-power density of 18 μW cm−2 is also obtained. © 2018 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - The effects of microwave (MW) and combined alkaline-MW pretreatments on the co-digestion of TWAS:FOG mixtures with 20, 40 and 60% FOG were investigated. MW pretreatment at a high temperature of 175ᵒC was shown to be the most effective MW pretreatment option in solubilizing TWAS:FOG mixtures and boosting methane yield. MW pretreatment at 175ᵒC resulted in maximum solubilization (%) of 68.2% for the 20%FOG samples and a maximum methane yield that was 137% higher than the control for samples with 60%FOG. The combined alkaline-MW (NaOH-MW) pretreatment at pH 10 proved to be not an effective option for TWAS:FOG pretreatment before the anaerobic co-digestion. Despite the benefits of MW pretreatment on the TWAS:FOG samples, including a significant increase in solubilization, dewaterability improvement, high VS reductions, and high methane yield productions, the energy analysis resulted in negative net energy values for all MW-pretreated samples. © 2018

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for converting organic wastes into bio-crude oil, with organic-rich post-hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater (PHWW) as by-product. In this study, zeolite adsorption and anaerobic digestion (AD) were integrated to improve the methane production and energy recovery of PHWW from Chlorella 1067. A statistical design for maximum toxicants removal by zeolite was applied before AD process. Zeolite could mitigate the inhibition associated to compounds such as ammonia, N-heterocyclic compounds, etc. in PHWW and thereby shortening the lag phase and increasing methane production by 32–117% compared with that without zeolite adsorption. Zeolite adsorption also increased energy recovery efficiency (up to 70.5%) for this integrated system. Integration of HTL and AD brought higher energetic return from feedstock via oil and biomethane production, which may offer insight into industrial application of microalgae biomass in the circular economy. In addition, carbon and nitrogen flow for the integrated process was determined. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fundamental research on ignition and combustion characteristics of a new blended fuel (diesel/Hydrogenated Catalytic Biodiesel) was investigated in a constant volume combustion chamber. The ignition delay, initial ignition position and flame lift-off length were researched via natural flame imaging and broadband chemiluminescence under various ambient temperatures and oxygen concentrations. After that, the emissions characteristics of diesel and blending fuel of B20 were compared in a four-cylinder direct injection diesel engine. Results show that the ignition delay and flame lift-off length decrease with increasing blend ratio of Hydrogenated Catalytic Biodiesel in diesel fuel blends. The gap of flame lift-off length caused by different blend ratios became narrow when Hydrogenated Catalytic Biodiesel exceeds 20% under different oxygen concentrations indicating the effect of chemical properties of fuel on flame lift-off length is declining. Furthermore, the blending fuel of B20 has lower PM emission compared with pure diesel while fuel economy is quite similar. © 2018

AB  - The spent bleaching clays (SBC) of vegetable oil refining plants have residual vegetable oil contents ranging from 17 to 40 wt%. The common worldwide practice of landfilling such spent clays imposes inevitable environmental hazards. The extraction of oil from a spent clay will not only alleviate this problem, but can also provide an oil source for processes, such as transesterification for the production of alcohol-esters. In-situ transesterification of the residual oil within SBC is an even more attractive idea, as it can eliminate the extraction step from the process. In this study, in-situ transesterification on the spent bleaching clay of a local vegetable oil plant was investigated experimentally. Furthermore, optimum operating conditions were determined for a number of parameters influencing the conversions, including reaction temperature, ethanol-to-SBC ratio, alkali catalyst type, and catalyst-to-SBC mass ratio. The experiments were designed by the response surface method based on the central composite approach (RSM-CCD model). The results were analyzed using the analysis of variance method (ANOVA) to investigate the effect of the parameters on the efficiencies of the biodiesel produced and the oil removed from the initial SBC. Within the ranges investigated, the maximum conversion to ethyl-ester was 72.90% at the optimum conditions of a reaction temperature of 73.2 °C, reaction time of 4.5 h, ethanol/SBC ratio of 4.2 ml/g, while using NaOH alkali catalyst with a catalyst-to-SBC mass ratio of 4.33%. © 2018

AB  - The transesterification of sunflower oil with methanol, using immobilized lipase enzymes as catalysts, was studied. The process was carried out in a semi-continuous mode. Temperature (30–50 °C), methanol flow (0.024–0.04 ml/min), kind of enzyme (Lipozyme 62350, Lipozyme TL-IM, Novozym 435 and Pseudomonas cepacia Sol–Gel-AK) and enzyme concentrations (1.25–10% by weight) were the operating variables. The final product was characterized by the EN 14214 standard. All the parameters, except for cold filter plugging point, were similar to a diesel fuel. For low methanol flows, reaction rate was proportional to methanol concentration. High flows caused catalyst deactivation. Novozyme 435, Lipozyme TL-IM and Lipozyme 62350 showed similar maximum reaction rates, but Novozyme 435 was more resistant to deactivation. Pseudomonas cepacia hardly obtained 1% conversion. The catalyst concentration, up to 2.5%, had a positive effect on the reaction rate and conversion. The optimum temperature was 40 °C. The initial reaction rate was in line with the Arrhenius law, up to 50 °C. By differential and integral methods, the Michaelis–Menten, competitive inhibition and ping-pong bi–bi kinetic parameters were determined. The transesterification of sunflower oil in a semi-continuous regime of alcohol improved the results, compared to the discontinuous regime, and those were similar to the obtained ones in a discontinuous regime with step-by-step methanol addition. The lipase that showed the best yield and higher resistance to deactivation was Novozym 435. The kinetic models that forecast the deactivation of lipases by an inhibitor described the experimental behavior properly. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Camelina sativa is a cool-season oil seed crop that has been proven to produce various biofuels. The present study investigated the technical possibilities of using whole camelina biomass as a model feedstock in a biorefinery. This investigation examined the possibilities of using camelina seeds as a source of oil for biodiesel, sugars for ethanol, and meal for oneportfolio products. The camelina harvest residues (straw) can serve as the main source for green sugars. This study found that the energy input for the whole biorefinery process was 25.1 MJ/L ethanol, while the energy output was 54.3 MJ/L ethanol. The net energy ratio of 2.16 MJ/L ethanol was found to be competitive with other energy crops. The process was environmentally friendly, and it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 40% if the produced biodiesel replaced petroleum diesel. The seed meals and glycerin were found to be a good source of revenue as high valueadded products and can provide an additional revenue of $1/kg of produced oil. © 2018, BioResources.

AB  - Tandem bio-inorganic platform by combining efficient light harvesting properties of nano-inorganic semiconductor cadmium sulfide (CdS) with biocatalytic ability of electro-active bacteria (EAB) towards carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion is reported. Sulfur was obtained from either cysteine (EAB-Cys-CdS) or hydrogen sulfide (EAB-H2S-CdS) and experiments were carried out under similar conditions. Anchoring of the nano CdS cluster on the microbe surface was confirmed using electronic microscope. Bio-inorganic hybrid system was able to produce single and multi-carbon compounds from CO2 in visible spectrum (λ &gt; 400 nm). Though, acetic acid was dominant (EAB-Cys-CdS, 1.46 g/l and EAB-H2S-CdS, 1.55 g/l) in both the microbe-CdS hybrids, its concentration as well as product slate varied significantly. EAB-H2S-CdS produced hexanoic acid and less methanol fraction, while the EAB-Cys-CdS produced no hexanoic acid along with almost double the concentration of methanol. Due to easy harvesting process, this bio-inorganic hybrid represents unique sustainable approach for solar-to-chemical production via CO2 transformation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nickel catalysts supported on palygorskite of varying Ni content were synthesized following the deposition–precipitation method. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques and evaluated in a semi-batch reactor for the transformation of waste cooking oils (WCO) into green diesel at 310 °C and hydrogen pressure 40 bar. The nickel nanoparticles supported on palygorskite were proved to be very active. The conversion of the WCO was about 100%. The green diesel content of the liquid product depends mainly on the nickel surface exposed per gram of catalyst, following a volcano like trend and maximized (81.9 wt %) over the sample with 30 wt % Ni. Taking into account the very high ratio of WCO volume to catalyst mass (100 mL/g) and that the evaluation of the catalysts was performed under solvent free conditions, these results demonstrate the successful use of mineral palygorskite for developing promising “natural catalysts” for green diesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The impending restrictions on the sulfur content and greenhouse gas emissions of marine fuels represent a challenge for the maritime shipping industry and an opportunity for alternative fuels that may have lower environmental impacts but are not currently economically competitive. This study developed an integrated screening model to compare the technological, economic, and environmental performance of 33 “drop-in” marine biofuel blendstock supply chains, considering nine agroforestry residues and three thermochemical technologies. The biofuel production was modeled for 500 tonne per day “first-of-a-kind” biorefineries to reflect near-term production. Supply chains were modeled for biofuel production in both Brazil and Sweden to explore the impact of regional differences on the biofuels’ break-even prices and their life cycle emissions of greenhouse gases, SO2, and NOX. This study indicates that in the immediate term, marine biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks may have a minimum fuel selling price three or more times higher than current fossil marine fuel prices. Biofuels made from agricultural residues saw a 40–100 kg/GJ decrease in life cycle GHG emissions, but forestry residue emissions depended highly on biogenic carbon dioxide accounting. SO2, and NOX emissions were dominated primarily by combustion, which for SO2 were estimated to be much lower than fossil fuels, due to the negligible sulfur content of the biomass. Overall, no single biofuel was a clear winner in terms of economic and environmental performance in the model, but space is opened for deeper research, as the new regulations come into effect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, use of microalgae as a cheap feedstock and heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production has gained considerable interest as they mitigate environmental problems induced by the conventional process of biodiesel production using homogeneous alkali catalysts. However, separation of heterogeneous catalysts from tissues and carcass of microalgae is an important task. For this reason, a magnetic Fe2O3–Al2O3 nanocatalyst promoted by potassium groups was synthesized using a modified impregnation method and was profoundly studied and compared with nanocatalysts without ferric oxide using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses. The results revealed that the magnetic nanocatalyst with a core-shell structure had suitable surface area, pore size, and particle size and also had no impurity on its structure. The nanocatalyst was used for biodiesel production from microalgae cultivated in a wastewater medium via in-situ transesterification reaction. The nanocatalyst converted 95.6% of microalgae lipids to esters at optimum conditions of 65 °C, 12 mL g−1 of methanol-to-dry biomass, 4 wt% of magnetic catalyst and 6 h of reaction time. The magnetic K/Fe2O3–Al2O3 core-shell nanocatalyst was reused for several times and presented high stability with less reduction in its activity until six runs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - At this time biodiesel appears to be a viable proposition as a renewable energy source and an alternative to fossil-based fuels. Following many years of research, the use of process intensification techniques for the production of biodiesel is well documented. This work has focused more on a study of biodiesel production using continuous flow systems assisted by acoustic cavitation (ultrasonic or hydrodynamic)or microwaves. The target end user is the small or medium farm where such equipment could provide sufficient fuel for on-site agricultural machinery using renewable or waste green materials produced on site. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, modeling and optimization of the microwave-assisted solvent extraction (MASE) of sandbox seed oil (SSO) were investigated. D-optimal design with two numeric (extraction time (5–15 min), heating power (180–540 W)) and two categoric (solid/solvent ratio (1:10–1:40) and solvent type (ethyl acetate, n-hexane and acetone)) factors was used to model and optimize SSO yield. The model developed had coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9821, indicating it can be used to adequately describe the MASE process with high accuracy. Optimum SSO yield of 72.20 ± 0.35 wt% could be obtained using extraction time of 5 min, microwave heating power of 180 W, solid/solvent ratio of 1:40 and ethyl acetate as solvent of extraction. Performance evaluation of the solvents in terms of oil yield showed that ethyl acetate was the most efficient (72.20 ± 0.35 wt%) followed by acetone (57.90 ± 1.27 wt%) and n-hexane (56.25 ± 1.77 wt%). Physicochemical properties of the SSO varied depending on the solvent of extraction. Fatty acids profile of the SSO showed that it had more unsaturated (79.7–84.5%) fractions than saturated (15.5–20.2%) fractions. Therefore, SSO could serve as feedstock for biodiesel and other oleochemical production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) doped highly conductive ternary graphene @polyaniline-TiO2 (GN@Pani-TiO2) was synthesized chemically. The conducting polymers incorporated with metal oxide have good electrical conductivity and large pseudo capacitance which have been utilized as a potential electrode material for biofuel cell electrode preparation. The redox mediator ferritin (Frt) and enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) was immobilized successfully. The oxidation of glucose by the prepared bioanode was increased with the increase in glucose concentration in the range of 4–24 mM. The electrochemical performance of the bioanode was satisfactory at 20 mM glucose in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of pH 7.0 analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 20 mM of glucose at different scan rates (20–100 mVs−1), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry. A saturation current density of 6.77 ± 0.2 mAcm−2 was achieved at a 100 mVs−1 scan rate for 20 mM of glucose oxidation. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The catalytic cracking of high–density polyethylene pyrolysis waxes under fluidized catalytic cracking conditions has been investigated with the aim of producing fuels at large–scale from waxes obtained in pyrolysis plants located nearby collection and segregation points. Additionally, preliminary information about the capacity of these units to valorize waste polyolefins has been obtained. The catalytic cracking runs have been performed in a riser simulator reactor under industrial conditions: 500–560 °C; catalyst to oil mass ratio, 3, 5 and 7 gcat goil −1; and, contact time, 6 s. The product distribution has been quantified determining the yields of different fractions, which have been defined according to their boiling point range: dry gas, liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and coke. The concentration of the families of compounds has been also determined, which are n–paraffins, iso–paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics. For the shake of comparison, the results of catalytic cracking of a common stream fed to the industrial units, i.e., vacuum gasoil, have been included. Globally, promising results have been obtained in the valorization of waste polyolefins by means of this combination of pyrolysis–cracking stages that expose, at the same time, the capacity of this unit to manage waste plastics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fuelling biodiesel derived from Eichhornia crassipes in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes water hyacinth biodiesel (WHB) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in freshwater, marine, and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. WHB was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single-cylinder diesel engine at constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion, and emission characteristics. Test results projected that the characteristics of 20% WHB + 80% diesel fuel blend were in par with neat diesel fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, HC, CO, and smoke emissions. However, WHB blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO2 and NOx emissions. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of WHB were comparatively lower than diesel fuel. Ignition delay is lowest for B100 blend and therefore the diffusion burning phase of biodiesel phase is found to be dominant in comparison with diesel fuel. For biodiesel blends, the combustion starts earlier due to higher cetane number, lessened delay period, and lowered calorific value followed by lowered HRR.

AB  - The large scale production of biodiesel has increased interest in glycerol transformation into higher value products. This study evaluated catalysts supported on HZSM-5 containing Fe, Mo, and Nb, in the glycerol conversion to olefins. The samples were prepared by wet impregnation and characterized by XRD, SBET, NH3-TPD, and TPO techniques. Catalytic experiments were performed in the range of 450–600 °C in a fixed-bed tubular reactor. The gaseous products were analyzed by online gas chromatography. It was observed that the modification in the acidic properties of ZSM-5 plays an important role in the selectivity to olefins. The highest selectivity for olefins was obtained for the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst in the 450–500 °C range and for Nb/ZSM-5 in the range of 550–600 °C. Fe/ZSM-5 presented the highest selectivity to propylene at lower temperatures due to the higher acidic strength of the strong acid sites. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The recent increasing amount of energy from different renewable sources is connected to several challenges like flexible availability, secured energy supply, energy storage and its distribution. A suitable method is the sector coupling via conversion of excess renewable energy into natural gas by electrolysis followed by biological methanation of H2 and CO2. Gas quality, stability, controllability as well as low internal energy consumption and low technical effort of the process are of higher significance. Therefore, the biological methanation and methane enrichment by conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen were investigated in an anaerobic trickle bed process. In continuous long-term operation of 1200 days, a stable and significant high methane concentration of cCH4,∅ = 96.6% at methane formation rate of MFRmax = 3.1 Nm3CH4/(m3·d) could be achieved. Process disturbance like interrupted availability of the input gases was examined and discussed. Methanation could be terminated and restarted almost immediately. Even after an interruption for a short (hours) or long (weeks) period, a performance at the same level was achievable. Therefore, process control is feasible. In a second and uncoupled investigation, the inner pressure was increased up to pabs = 25 bar. A pressure of pabs = 5 bar led to a maximum of MFR = 5.75 Nm3CH4/(m3·d) and cCH4,∅ = 97.7%. The higher pressure was harmful. Apart from pure carbon dioxide, biogas could also serve as a source of carbon, which enables an ex-situ methane enrichment of cCH4,∅=50% to cCH4 &gt; 94% and MFRmax = 2.1 Nm3CH4/(m3·d) using the same process design without increased inner pressure. In particular, the high gas quality and process controllability cannot be found in comparable processes for biological methanation. Biogas for methane enrichment and CO2 for methanation were accepted as carbon source. The high gas quality in the product reduces further effort of gas conditioning before injection into the natural gas grid. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast pyrolysis oil is an attractive second-generation bio-fuel. However, due to its high oxygen content, upgrading technologies are necessary to improve the properties of bio-oil. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of nickel phosphides supported on carbon-covered alumina (CCA) in hydrotreating of a commercial bio-oil. The effect of two different phosphides phases was investigated. The results showed that the stoichiometry of the nickel phosphide can be controlled by the weight ratio of sucrose/Al2O3 used in the synthesis. Two distinct catalysts can be produced: Ni12P5/CCA-0.7 (weight ratio of 0.7) and the Ni2P/CC-1.4 (weight ratio of 1.4). The performances of these catalysts were compared with a commercial Ru/C. Catalytic evaluation was carried out at 250 °C and 75 bar in a batch reactor and the effect of two-step HDO (150–250 °C) was also investigated. The use of two-step HDO produced bio-oils with higher H/C ratios, indicating a higher occurrence of hydrogenation mechanisms. In addition, more thermally stable bio-oils were generated due to the significant reduction of compounds such as ketones, acid acetic and furfural. Nickel phosphides supported on CCA formulations presented similar performance to commercial Ru/C catalyst in terms of, degree deoxygenation (DOD) and O/C bio-oils ratios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has been renowned as potential and alternative fuel for years. In order to improve the quality of the conventional fossil fuels, biodiesel, and air pollution from combustion, additives are essential to exploit. In this study, the uses of cerium oxide (CeO 2 ) nanoparticle additive for B20 fuel in a diesel engine are investigated. The CeO 2 nanoparticles with cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide are doped into the B20 fuel by using ultrasonicator. The purpose of the experimental work was adopted to enhance engine combustion and reduce the emissions with an approach of CeO 2 nanoparticle additive. The experiment was conducted on a diesel engine using different propagation of CeO 2 nanoparticle in blended mahua methyl ester fuel such as B20 + CeO 2 50 ppm, B20 + CeO 2 100 ppm, and B20 + CeO 2 150 ppm. The obtained results are compared with the diesel and B20 fuels. The minor changes are obtained in B20 fuel properties due to the addition of CeO 2 nanoparticles. The performance of brake thermal efficiency and combustion of pressure data is observed to be enhanced by the addition of a metal-based additive. The CO, HC, and smoke are decreased for B20 fuel with nanoparticles. The NO x is reduced by dosing the CeO 2 due to the oxidation of unburned CeO 2 in the exhaust. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents the overall performance, emission and combustion characteristics of the engine, when fuelled with biodiesel blends of Calophyllum Inophyllum methyl ester as injected fuel and babul wood chip derived producer gas as inducted fuel at constant injection timing (230bTDC), injection pressure (230 bar) and speed (1500 rpm). To improve overall performance, combustion and reduced emission characteristics of the engine, the combustion chamber was varied with 5 different geometries. Experimental results revealed that Toroidal re-entrant combustion chamber had higher Exhaust Gas Temperature and Brake Thermal Efficiency by 20.75% and 6.37% than that of HCC, while Brake Specific Fuel Consumption was reduced by 4.49% at optimal loading condition. However, engine overall performance of TrCC was found to be comparable with Hemi-spherical chamber and other designed combustion chambers. Similarly, comparing exhaust emissions, Oxide of Nitrogen and Carbon dioxide were on its higher side by 19.90% and 27.20% than normal HCC. On the contrary, carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbon and Smoke opacity for TrCC were found to be 76.12%, 33.71% and 38.67% lower than HCC. From the above study, it is finally concluded that converted renewable fuels with TrCC might be utilized as an alternative fuel without any exhaust related problems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To promote catalytic performances of Ni-based mesoporous Y (meso-Y) zeolite in the hydrocracking conversion of microalgae biodiesel to jet fuel range hydrocarbons, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane was utilized as sulfonating agent to improve the acid density of meso-Y zeolite. The physiochemical properties of sulfonated meso-Y zeolite were characterized via temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and N 2 physisorption. It was detected that sulfonic acid groups (-SO 3 H) composed of S–O and S[dbnd]O bonds were successfully grafted onto meso-Y zeolite framework. The strong acid density significantly increased from 0.31 mmol/g to 1.21 mmol/g when meso-Y zeolite was treated with 0.38 mL/g sulfonating agent. The crystalline interplanar spacing of meso-Y zeolite expanded with a shifted position (2θ) of X-ray diffraction peak from 15.72° to 15.70°. The enhanced hydrocracking capacity of 10% Ni/sulfonated meso-Y zeolite catalyst resulted in improvements in microalgae biodiesel conversion (from 82.1% to 99.7%) and jet fuel range alkane selectivity (from 31.2% to 52.3%). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - A highly efficient bimetallic nanoparticles (BMNPs) catalyst was reported, Pd1Ni4/AC, consisting of Pd1Ni4 BMNPs supported on active carbon, shown excellent catalytic performance and stablity in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vanillin. HDO of vanillin and various aldehydes with high efficiency and selectivity could be achieved at low H2 pressure (2 bar) under mild conditions in the presence of the BMNPs catalyst, no obvious decrease on catalytic performance was observed after eight cycles. The superior catalytic performance of the Pd1Ni4/AC catalyst was mainly attributable to the synergetic electronic effect between Pd and Ni, which showcased the great potential of BMNPs in the catalysis field. © 2018

AB  - Two bentonites from Paraíba (Northeastern Brazil) were impregnated with heteropoly phosphomolybdic H3PMo12O40 (HPMo). The materials produced were characterized by various techniques such as N2 adsorption-desorption (specific surface area, SSA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/DTG), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with Dispersive Energy X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), acid-base titration analysis. The catalytic activity of these materials was tested in the esterification of a waste from palm oil deodorization and the main results obtained (about 93.3% of conversion) indicated that these materials have potential to act as heterogeneous solid acid catalysts. The prepared materials exhibited satisfactory catalytic performance even after a very simple recycling process in three reuse cycles, without significant loss of their activities. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biorefineries valorize waste biomass to biofuels and bioproducts, but the associated wastewater treatment is costly and energy-intensive. This study demonstrates that not only the recalcitrant black liquor generated from biorefineries can be treated using a microbial electrochemical process, but also value-added materials including lignin, chemicals, and H2 can be separated to enable resource recovery. A lab scale microbial biomass recovery cell (MBRC) was developed to treat the actual black liquor from the deacetylation and mechanical refining (DMR) process, and the results show that 60.1-73.8% of organics, 52.0-54.6% of salts, and 30.8-49.5% of lignin were removed using different operational modes. Moreover, by utilizing the unique pH gradient generated between the different reactor chambers, tailored recoveries of lignin, chemicals, and H2 were realized for the first time. The recoveries of lignin and salts were up to 61.2 ± 2.7% and 92.2 ± 1.6%, respectively. Ion transfer and organic transformation were further analyzed to understand the reaction mechanisms and improve the system performance. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The present study demonstrates innovative and industrially viable in-situ biodiesel production process using coordinated ultrasound-microwave reactor. Reactive extraction process has been carried out by mixing grinded castor seeds with methanol in the presence of base catalyst (KOH). Response surface methodology coupled with central composite design has been applied for process optimization to achieve maximum yield. The result shows that maximum biodiesel yield of 93.5 ± 0.76% was obtained under favorable conditions of: molar ratio (350:1), catalyst (w/w) (1.74%), reaction temperature (43 °C) and reaction time (30 min). Regression equation obtained for the model having (R2), and (R2 adj) equal to 0.9737 and 0.9507 respectively shows goodness of fit. First time reaction kinetics as well as oil extraction kinetics studies have been performed on coordinated ultrasound-microwave reactor. Assuming pseudo first order reaction activation energy was found to be 28.27 kJ·mol−1 and activation energy for oil extraction was observed to be 9.11 kJ mol−1. Estimated activation energy for the reaction kinetics and extraction kinetics was reduced by 27%, reaction rate constants were eight to ten times higher and diffusion coefficient was found to be two times higher in case of hybrid system as compared to conventional mechanical stirring technique. Estimated thermo-physical properties of biodiesel were found in agreement with ASTM and DIN standards in comparison to gasoline diesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel derived from corn oil promise to be an alternative for the conventional diesel fuel due to their similarity in properties. In this present work, silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles are used as an additive to the corn oil methyl ester (COME) in the form of an emulsion. SiO2 nanoparticles are dispersed in the emulsions with different dosage levels of 50, 75 and 100 ppm. A single cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection CI engine is made to run on B20, and B20 dozed with SiO2 nanoparticles for different concentrations to study the effect of metal oxide nanoparticles on emission characteristics of the fuel. Experimental results show that addition of nanoparticles has a positive effect on emission characteristics as nanoparticles act as an oxidation catalyst. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The attributes of environmental balance, lower exhaust emission and renewability have made ethylic biodiesel production a preferable technique to methylic biodiesel production from inedible lipid oil. Hydrodynamic cavitation reactor (HCR), in particular has engaged a global interest due to its flexibility and desirable biodiesel properties. For the first time, the study adopted HCR to produce ethyl esters (biodiesel) from low FFA rubber seed oil (RSO). The effects of transesterification variables namely catalyst dosage (KOH) (3–5 wt.%), reaction time (30–50 min) and ethanol/RSO molar ratio (3.5 7.0) were examined on the biodiesel yield. The yield of rubber seed oil ethyl ester (RSOEE) (92.5%) was the highest at the ethanol/oil molar ratio of 6/1, KOH of 4.5 wt.% and reaction time of 40 min. The cavitational yield for RSOEE production in the cavitation reactor was 4.13 g/J. The fuel properties of the RSO ethyl esters synthesized from the HCR were within the ranges of the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 specifications. However, the oxidation stability (OS) did not comply with the standards. To further improve the low OS, the antioxidant can be included in the RSOEE to enhance the OS to an acceptable limit (> 6 h). Therefore, the HCR can be a feasible reactor for the production of cleaner and renewable fuel from various feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydrothermal pretreatment route is gaining research interest as a potentially green method for deconstructing lignocellusic biomass. Based on the relevant literature, the conversion of biomass into platform chemicals or energy carriers through hydrothermal processes has been found to be advantageous by reason of enhanced process performance, while being environmentally friendly and technologically innovative. In this review, an assessment has been made of recent research findings and reservations in regard to the synthesis of subcritical and supercritical hydrolysates and the production of platform chemicals namely ethanol, butanol, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, lactic acid, levulinic acid and its derivatives, succinic acid, sorbitol, and xylitol. This review also proposes a number of future research-oriented directions to harness the findings of primary research-oriented efforts for developing technically and economically feasible large-scale systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The economic viability of the biofuel industry could be improved by adding a high-value revenue stream for biomass supply chains: bioderived composites for the rapidly expanding large-scale additive manufacturing industry (i.e., 3D printing). Using fibrillated fibers derived from biomass (e.g., Populus) to reinforce polymers for 3D printing applications would be less expensive compared to using conventional carbon fibers. Poplar fibers of different mesh sizes (<180, 180-425, 425-850, and 850-2360 μm) were used to prepare poplar-polylactic acid (PLA) composites. The poplar/PLA composites were successfully printed using a large-scale 3D printer to create a podium support. The tensile strength of the composites increased from 34 to 54 MPa as the poplar fiber size decreased. The fracture surfaces of composites derived from smaller poplar fibers (<180 μm) were more compact with fewer voids compared with the composites made with larger poplar fibers. Because of the porous and hollow microstructures, smaller poplar fibers contained more pores on their outer surfaces, which were available for the access and penetration of PLA. Poplar has potential for use as a thermoplastic reinforcement for large-scale 3D printing. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Consistent material and substance flow diagrams for five alternative biorefinery scenarios for treating Chinese food waste were obtained by combining reported experimental research data and material flow analysis. The biorefinery alternatives produced biogas, biomethane, bioethanol and biodiesel in various combinations. The compiled statistical data compiled showed that 100 t of Chinese food waste could produce 16 ± 1.1 t of biogas as a single technology and that other advanced biorefinery concepts could produce 5 ± 0.4 t of biomethane, 4 ± 1.6 t of bioethanol and/or 3 ± 0.2 t of biodiesel. In terms of substance flow, biorefinery scenarios transfer up to 75% of the total initial carbon in the food waste into bioproducts, while 22% of carbon is emitted, primarily as carbon dioxide. The compost obtained by composting the dewatered digestate contained about 75% of input P, 27% of input K and 6% of input N. About 15% of input N was lost to the air during composting. The remaining C, N, P and K were in the wastewater. Introducing biorefinery concepts to the management of Chinese food waste can facilitate the generation of high-value bioproducts. However, biorefinery concepts are technologically complicated and the energy consumption may triple relative to that of only biogas production. The issue of a considerably large liquid fraction in all cases still needs to be addressed. The material flow diagrams in this work constitute a consistent platform for assessing future scenarios for treating Chinese food waste from a technical, economical as well environmental perspective. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enzymatic conversion of biodiesel was performed by using co-immobilized lipases. The surface modification of activated carbon (AC) was carried out to improve the stability and reusability of enzyme support. The surface modified AC (ACO: Activated carbon oxide) clearly showed porous and rugged surfaces by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. Subsequently, the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out to evaluate the generation of functional groups. The highest activity of immobilized lipase was about 10,360 U/g matrix under pretreatment with co-immobilization method. The activity was maintained about 80% after 20 times of reuse in the batch system. The immobilized lipases were applied to the biodiesel production from different sources of oils such as soybean oil, waste cooking oil and algal oil. The maximum biodiesel conversions from soybean oil, waste cooking oil, and algal oil were found to be 98.5%, 95.7%, and 93.8%, respectively, within 4 h. © 2019

AB  - To explore the feasibility of using herbal medicine waste (HMW)as solid fuel, HMW was torrefied under different temperatures and atmospheres. The physicochemical properties and combustion behaviors of the torrefied HMW were investigated. Temperature was found to be the most influential factor affecting the torrefaction. Torrefaction improved the hydrophobicity of HMW and decreased the equilibrated moisture uptake from 24.48(0.083)% to 15.22(0.054)%. The HMW samples torrefied under different conditions are easy to ignite. The comprehensive combustibility index (S)of the torrefied HMW increased by 3–5 folds compared to that of the raw sample. In general, the HMW torrefied under lower temperatures and under CO2 and O2 have better flammability. The present results revealed that the torrefied HMW exhibited good combustion characteristics and can thus be used for solid fuel production, such as fuels for co-combustion or raw materials for pelletization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aims to develop environmentally benign lubricant from by-product of palm oil processing through enzymatic reaction. Candida antartica lipase was employed as catalyst to transesterified reaction between palm stearin and methanol in a solvent-free system. The reaction parameters were varied in terms of molar ratio of methanol-to-palm stearin (3:1 to 8:1), temperature (between 40 and 70 °C), time (2–12 h)and concentration of catalyst (from 2 to 10 wt.%). Enzymatic transesterification demonstrated around 95.26% maximum yield of palm stearin methyl ester under the following conditions: 4:1 methanol-to-PS molar ratio, reaction temperature of 60 °C, reaction time of 8 h and 6.0 wt. % of lipase concentration. The Structural modification of palm stearin resulted in improvement in both physicochemical and tribological properties. The produced biolubricant demonstrated superior viscosity index (>120)and friction properties over commercial mineral oil-based lubricant. This study showed that lubricant derived from palm stearin has a great potential to be used as a base stock in regard to favourable biodegradability and tribological performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study is an assessment of using Turel Kongreng (river mussels) as a source of heterogenous catalyst in biodiesel production. After the calcination is performed at 800 °C for 1 h, the calcinated samples were subjected to characterization techniques such as X-ray dispersive analysis, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The characterizations showed excellent formation of calcium oxide (CaO) and the same is compared with CaO synthesized from other sources. A confirmation test using the newly synthesized CaO is conducted using waste cooking oil with catalyst loading of 10% (wt.%), alcohol to oil ratio of 10:1, reaction temperature of 75 °C and a reaction time of 60 mins. The study showed a conversion rate of 91.04%, which is well within the high conversion band among all other catalyst materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Developing highly efficient non-noble-metal catalysts for the upgrade of abundant and low-cost renewable raw biomass into high-quality biofuels and important chemicals is especially desirable, but still remains huge challenges. Herein, Sn 4+ -induced highly dispersed Cu-based catalyst, Cu/Zn-Al-Sn layered double hydroxide (Cu/ZnAlSn-LDH), is delicately constructed for catalytic transfer hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin to promising 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) biofuel using 2-propanol as hydrogen source and solvent without any external hydrogen supply. Nearly total MMP yield is achieved under moderate reaction conditions (180 °C, 4 h) and the turnover number (TON) value calculated in Cu/ZnAlSn-LDH is about 3 times higher than that in Sn-free catalyst (Cu/ZnAl-LDH). Characterizations results reveal that the Sn 4+ species confined in the lattice of brucite-like layer of ZnAlSn-LDH are existed in electron-rich state, which can promote the formation of smaller Cu nanoparticles (1.95 nm) in Cu/ZnAlSn-LDH compared to those in Sn-free Cu/ZnAl-LDH catalyst (6.08 nm), as well as stronger metal-support interaction, thus leading to the higher catalytic performance and stability. The present findings offer a new avenue to strategically fabricate highly dispersed non-noble metal catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance by adjusting surface structures and compositions of supports for a wide range of hydrodeoxygenation of other biomass-derived compounds without any external hydrogen. © 2019

AB  - Background: We have recently developed a one-step, genetically encoded immobilization approach based on fusion of a target enzyme to the self-crystallizing protein Cry3Aa, followed by direct production and isolation of the fusion crystals from Bacillus thuringiensis. Using this approach, Bacillus subtilis lipase A was genetically fused to Cry3Aa to produce a Cry3Aa-lipA catalyst capable of the facile conversion of coconut oil into biodiesel over 10 reaction cycles. Here, we investigate the fusion of another lipase to Cry3Aa with the goal of producing a catalyst suitable for the conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. Results: Genetic fusion of the Proteus mirabilis lipase (PML) to Cry3Aa allowed for the production of immobilized lipase crystals (Cry3Aa-PML) directly in bacterial cells. The fusion resulted in the loss of PML activity, however, and so taking advantage of its genetically encoded immobilization, directed evolution was performed on Cry3Aa-PML directly in its immobilized state in vivo. This novel strategy allowed for the selection of an immobilized PML mutant with 4.3-fold higher catalytic efficiency and improved stability. The resulting improved Cry3Aa-PML catalyst could be used to catalyze the conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel for at least 15 cycles with minimal loss in conversion efficiency. Conclusions: The genetically encoded nature of our Cry3Aa-fusion immobilization platform makes it possible to perform both directed evolution and screening of immobilized enzymes directly in vivo. This work is the first example of the use of directed evolution to optimize an enzyme in its immobilized state allowing for identification of a mutant that would unlikely have been identified from screening of its soluble form. We demonstrate that the resulting Cry3Aa-PML catalyst is suitable for the recyclable conversion of waste cooking oil into biodiesel. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The present work investigates the synthesis of a new and highly efficient sodium-doped nanohydroxyapatite, as a heterogeneous catalyst for the production of fatty acid methyl esters from Schizochytrium algae oil. Sodium nitrate supported on nanohydroxyapatite catalyst was prepared using wet impregnation technique and calcinated at different temperatures. The synthesized nanocatalyst was characterized to determine the structural and morphological properties, using BET, XRD, TGA, FTIR, ICP, and TEM. Characterization results reported that the catalyst calcinated at 900°C exhibits good catalytic property. The catalyst was utilized for the production of biodiesel, under different reaction parameters through transesterification process. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to evaluate the best combination of molar ratio, catalyst concentration, and reaction time for transesterification process. By using point prediction method, the optimum yield of 96% was achieved at the catalyst concentration of 9.5 wt% of oil, 1:12 molar ratio, and 121-minute reaction time. The physiochemical properties of the biodiesel were determined, and the result suggested that the biodiesel produced met ASTM D6751 standard. The catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance on reusability up to six runs without the loss of molecular activity. Therefore, the synthesized heterogeneous catalyst derived from animal bone could be efficiently used for the biodiesel production. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The present work reconnoitres the feasibility of utilizing class F fly ash and calcined animal bone powder (CABP) as raw material for the synthesis of heterogeneous solid base catalyst with varying ratios (CABP of 10, 20, and 30 mass%), that is subsequently used for transesterification of mustard oil. Physicochemical characterization of CABP revealed crystalline behavior, signifying one of the components as hydroxyapatite (HAP); when calcined at 900 °C transforms to β–tricalcium phosphate having a specific surface area of 100 m 2 g −1 . The synthesized catalyst showed improved catalytic activity when compared to the parental species and the optimal value to achieve the highest conversion of 90.4% would be at CABP loading of 10 mass%, 5.5:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, and 10 mass% catalyst concentration for 6 h. The prepared biodiesel had a calorific value of 36.2 MJ kg −1 with ash content &lt; 0.01 mass%. The catalyst could be reused five times with no loss in its activity. Results indicated that calcium enriched waste materials when impregnated in fly ash might be a potential source of catalyst in biodiesel production. © 2019

AB  - In this present work nanocomposite composed of Mn-ZnO capped with Poly Ethylene Glycol (PEG) was utilized as heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of oil extracted from Nannochloropsis oculata into biodiesel using methanol as an acyl acceptor. The synthesized Mn-ZnO novel nanocomposite capped with Poly Ethylene Glycol (PEG) was characterized by using SEM and XRD. Lipid contents from the microalgae were extracted by sonication and biphasic solvent method. The process parameters involved for heterogeneous catalysis of N. oculata to biodiesel were optimized and found to be oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:15 (mol:mol), catalyst loading 3.5% (w/w) and reaction temperature of 60 °C for 4 h of reaction time by Response Surface Method. The reusability studies showed that the nano-catalyst can be reused efficiently for 4 cycles. The yield of biodiesel obtained from N. oculata species using Mn-ZnO nanocomposite capped with PEG was 87.5%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to improve the storage stability of bio-oil from pine wood pyrolysis with fluidized bed reactor, methanol in different proportions (3 wt%, 6 wt%, 9 wt%, 12 wt% and 15 wt%) was added into bio-oil. The changes of physicochemical properties of bio-oil samples such as water content, pH value and viscosity and the aging chemical reaction mechanism during 35 days storage were investigated. Water content and viscosity of the methanol addition group were obviously lower than that of the raw bio-oil, which indicates that methanol could effectively inhibit the generation of water and greatly reduce viscosity during storage. When the methanol content was higher than 6.0 wt%, pH value began to increase with the storage duration. GC–MS and FT-IR analysis results showed that the component and structure of bio-oil were changed. During the storage, some reactions, e.g. polymerization reaction and aging reactions, occurred in bio-oil samples and the addition of methanol could delay the aging process of unimolecular elimination reaction (E1 elimination reaction). Phenols of methanol/bio-oil could react following three possible reaction mechanisms according to guaiacols ortho-methoxyl substitution, unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) reaction and bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction of ortho-hydroxyl substitution of catechol. As a conclusion, the addition of methanol could improve the bio-oil storage stability and be beneficial for its application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper aims to investigate the environmental and economic impacts of co-processing petroleum fractions with bio-based feedstocks for direct refinery integration versus the conventional drop-in integration of biofuels with compatible transportation fuels. Three different pathways of market diesel (commercial diesel fuel from a typical fuel station in Greece) production with 10% v/v biocontent (biomass feed) were explored by variant biomass utilization with fossil counter parts (diesel fuel). The first case study depicts the current market diesel production process via blending petroleum fractions with FAME (Fatty Acids Methyl Esters) biodiesel. The second case study involves the production of market diesel from blending petroleum fractions with hydrotreated residual lipids (Waste Cooking Oil, WCO), while the third case study explores the alternative approach of co-processing petroleum fractions with WCO. In all cases, the market diesel production chain was based on the hydrotreating process simulated using Aspen Plus. The results have shown that the most beneficial case, by environmental and economic viewpoint, for market diesel production with 10% v/v biocontent in the Greek market is co-processing of petroleum fractions with WCO. This approach accounts for a reduced production cost (751 €/m 3 ) and environmentally friendly profile (243 kgCO 2 -eq/m 3 ) compared with the other two case studies. Additionally co-processing of residual biomass with petroleum fractions utilizes existing infrastructure towards the production of sustainable fuels, rendering this pathway more attractive form a CAPEX point of view. © 2019

AB  - Liquefaction is a promising technology for the preparation of bio-oil and biochar products from sewage sludge (SS). Co-liquefaction of SS and agricultural/forestry biomass is likely a potential method for obtaining high yield/quality of bio-oil and biochar. In this work, rice straw (RS) and wood sawdust (WS) were selected as representatives of agricultural/forestry biomass and the effects of main process parameters during the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS on the yields/properties of bio-oil and biochar were explored in details. The proper reaction temperature, solid-liquid ratio and reaction time for the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS were suggested to be 280–300 °C, 0.1 g/mL and 10–30 min, respectively. Potassium/sodium salt (-OH and -CO3) catalysts could efficiently enhanced the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS. The introduction of RS/WS into the liquefaction of SS would reduce the contents of nitrogen and sulfur in bio-oil and enhance the formation of phenolic compounds. In addition, co-liquefaction of SS-RS could promote the percentage of lower-boil-point compounds in bio-oil. Although the thermal stability, surface area and pore volume of biochars slightly decreased, the contents of organic matters in biochars were obviously improved, suggesting higher potential in land application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transesterification of rapeseed oil with methanol was investigated over a heterogeneous catalysis system using sodium modified fluorapatite (Na/FAP) as a highly efficient, solid, bi-functional catalyst. Several parameters such as the impregnation ratio, calcination temperatures and catalyst loading were investigated and optimized for maximum biodiesel yield. The basic properties of the catalyst were estimated by phenol adsorption. The suitable reaction conditions for maximum biodiesel yield of 98% are the methanol to oil molar ratio of 10:1, temperature of 120 °C and reaction time of 8 h, with a 6 wt% of catalyst to oil weight ratio. The recycling studies have shown that the catalyst can be readily recovered and reused at least five consecutive cycles with significant loss of the activity. Several important physicochemical properties of the obtained biodiesel were evaluated and the results were compared with the standards for biodiesel specifications as described by EN14214. Results from waste cooking oil transesterification indicated that a FAME yield of 97% could be obtained by two-step transesterification process, thus giving rise to a potentially applicable possibility in biodiesel production from used cooking oil. © 2018

AB  - To circumvent the adverse impacts arising from an excessive use of fossil fuels, bioenergy and chemical production from a carbon neutral resource (biomass) has drawn considerable attention over the last two decades. Among various technical candidates, fast pyrolysis of biomass has been considered as one of the viable technical routes for converting a carbonaceous material (biomass) into biocrude (bio-oil). In these respects, three biomass samples (i.e., sawdust, empty fruit bunch, and giant Miscanthus) were chosen as a carbon substrate for the pyrolysis process in this study. A pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed reactor was employed for the pyrolysis work, and biocrude from the fast pyrolysis process at 500 °C were characterized because the maximum yield of biocrude (60 wt% of the original sample mass) was achieved at 500 °C. The physico-chemical properties of biocrude were measured by the international standard/protocol (ASTM D7544 and/or EN 16900 test method) to harness biocrude as bioenergy and an initial feedstock for diverse chemicals. All measurements in this study demonstrated that the heating value, moisture content, and ash contents in biocrude were highly contingent on the type of biomass. Moreover, characterization of biocrude in this study significantly suggested that additional unit operations for char and metal removal must be conducted to meet the fuel standard in terms of biocrude as bioenergy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Stringent emission regulations and depletion of crude oil are driving researchers toward alternative fuels. In this context, palm oil emerges as a good competitor as it is highly economical compared to other alternative fuels. The current research work centers around the impact of palm oil methyl ester on performance, combustion, and emission characteristics at varying injection timings and exhaust gas recirculation rates. In the first phase of this research work, various blends of palm oil methyl ester with diesel with volume concentrations of 10, 20, and 30% were prepared and tested at different load conditions. Injection timing was then varied for the optimized blend. In the second phase, the impact of exhaust gas blending with fresh charge was studied at optimized injection timing. The test outcomes revealed that 20% mix of palm oil at 27° bTDC with exhaust gas blending of 20% generated higher brake thermal efficiency, higher peak pressure, and less hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions compared to diesel at standard injection timing of 23° bTDC and no blending of exhaust gases with fresh charge. However, progression of injection timing with 20% exhaust gas mixing indicated a slight penalty in smoke discharges. Brake thermal efficiency at advanced injection timing with 20% mix of exhaust gases reduced by 7.7% for diesel and increased by 6.5% for 20% blend of palm oil when compared to standard injection timing of diesel and no blending of exhaust gases. Significant diminishments in oxides of nitrogen (lessened by 6.6%) and hydrocarbons (decreased by 30.43%) have been noted for 20% mix of biodiesel at advanced injection timing with 20% exhaust gas mix contrasted to diesel at standard conditions. Therefore, the present examination prescribes 20% merging of exhaust gases for 20% blend of palm oil with advancement of injection timing for diesel engine applications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Nonrenewable fossil fuels show increased demand and with fossil fuels at a rapid depleting stage, there seems to be an increase in requirement for alternative fuels too. Biofuels and blended fossil fuels are one of a kind. Nonedible jatropha (Jatropha curcas) oil-based methyl ester was produced and mixed with ethanol and blended with conventional diesel in various compositions. Jatropha biodiesel is used because of its great blending capacity with diesel. Sodium hydroxide is used as a catalyst which allows miscibility between ethanol and diesel. In present epoch, the paucity of fossil fuels and its adverse impact have driven researchers to focus on alternative fuels. Biodiesel is one of the most favorable and promising alternatives in the application of automobiles, boilers, gas turbines, etc. This study targets at finding the engine performance and emission characteristics under various load conditions on Kirloskar single-cylinder VCR research engine by blending both jatropha biodiesel and ethanol with base diesel at various compositions. Both jatropha biodiesel and ethanol have high calorific value which is a most important factor for engine power production. The performance analysis showed that the biodiesel blend of 98% diesel with 1.5% jatropha biodiesel and 0.5% (D98J1.5E0.5) of ethanol had a significant improvement in the engine performance than the conventional diesel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel is usually produced from edible oils which compete with the food market. Crambe abyssinica is a non-food crop referred as having high potential for biodiesel production. An entire cycle of seeding, harvesting, oil extraction and biodiesel production was performed with Crambe; probably, the first study carried out with this specie in Portugal aiming to evaluate its full viability. Biodiesel was produced from crude and refined oil of Crambe seeds cultivated (oil content of 26 ± 4 wt.%) and the results were compared to those obtained using a commercial oil originated from Brazil, where most studies are found. Biodiesel produced from the oil extracted from the Portuguese seeds showed good quality fulfilling almost all the requirements settled by EN 14214. The viscosity (5.80 mm2 s−1) and the cold filter plugging point (7 °C), which are mostly associated with the oil's nature, were close to the limits, indicating the need for blending at an industrial scale. Anyway, the biodiesel produced with the refined oil showed the highest quality, due to the lower level of contaminants. The high oxidation stability (16 h) of the biodiesel produced from seeds cultivated in Portugal can be argued as an advantage for this product. The study shows that Crambe oil might be a promising complementary alternative to the conventional edible oils used for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, the properties of pyrolysis products that obtained from the pyrolysis of Crofton weed was systematically researched. The effect of the different operation factors such as pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time, nitrogen flow rate and heating rate on the yields of three products was studied. The results showed that pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis time have important influence on bio-oil yield, and heating rate has a decisive effect on bio-oil quality. The optimum pyrolysis condition is pyrolysis temperature of the 600 °C, heating rate of 20 °C/min, pyrolysis time of 50 min and nitrogen flow rate of 200 ml/min. The components of bio-oil and bio-gas are characterized by GC–MS and GC under optimum pyrolysis condition, respectively. The main identified compounds of bio-oils were aldehyde, phenol and ketone, corresponding to the contents of the 28.09%, 13.04% and 15.39% of the total area, respectively. Therefore, it can be used as the potential chemical materials in the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries. In addition, Bio-gas mainly contains combustible gases, which accounts for as high as 82.51%. The method of the pyrolysis realizes comprehensive utilization of the Crofton weed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the influence of the ratios of zero-valent aluminum (ZV-Al) to bio-oil aqueous phase (1/25, 1.5/25, and 2/25 g/mL) on hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of crude bio-oil (CBO) with in situ hydrogen generated via the reaction of ZV-Al and the aqueous phase. The reaction of ZV-Al and the aqueous phase produced more hydrogen than the reaction of ZV-Al and water due to the aqueous phase reforming reactions. ZV-Al to the aqueous phase ratio had a positive impact on the in situ HDO of CBO. When the ratio of ZV-Al to the aqueous phase was 2/25 g/mL, the UBO yield was 39.03 wt% with a higher heating value of 38.53 MJ/kg. The highest degree of deoxygenation (76.38%) and the minimum of O/C molar ratio (0.07) were also obtained at the ratio of 2/25 g/mL. The reaction of ZV-Al and the aqueous phase for in situ HDO can significantly promote deoxygenation reactions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agroindustrial residual lignocellulosic biomaterial provides an economical and renewable natural bioresource for the large-scale, gainful biofuel production, as well as the production of fine bulk chemicals, which may include industrial biocatalysts. To this end, the laccase-inducing aptitude of some agroindustrial, lignocellulosic residues were appraised in submerged fermentation batch culture of two woodland betaproteobacteria (Hb9c; Achromobacter xylosoxidans HWN16, Hb16c; Bordetella bronchiseptica HSO16). Significant fermentation factors for laccase production were identified following a one-variable-at-a-time: OVAT screening method, levels of significant factors were optimized using response surface methodology: RSM. Mandarin peelings: MP and wheat bran: WB were suitable substrates for laccase production in Hb9c; 29.4 U/mL and Hb16c; 28.2 U/mL, respectively. However, the numerical optimization of significant factors for laccase production in both isolates presented an overall maximum laccase output encountered throughout the study (Hb9c; 169.39 U/mL, Hb16c; 45.22 U/mL), albeit the simulated conditions of the statistical model were outside the design space of the algorithm such as pH 5, 0.5 g MP, 100 rpm, 0.25 g NaNO3 for Hb9c and pH 3, 2.5 g WB, 50 rpm, 0.05 g yeast extract for Hb16c. Furthermore, a record 17.5 and 15.54 fold increase in laccase turnover depicts the astuteness of the statistical method in the valorization of these lignocellulosic residues for enhanced laccase production, hence, the incorporation of these outcomes at industrial scales might yield tremendous outputs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, a green solid acid catalyst derived from the waste material of the angel wing shell (AWS) was synthesized using a two-step method: calcination followed by sulfonation. The calcined angel wing shell (CAWS) was supported with varied concentrations of sulphuric acid to obtain an optimum high acidity level of the catalyst. The CaO-based calcined angel wing shell sulphated (CAWS-(x)SO4) catalysts, where x = sulphuric acid concentration, were analysed using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption of carbon dioxide and ammonia, BET surface area, and scanning electron microscope. The specific surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter of the CAWS was increased significantly after being sulphated at the optimum sulphuric acid concentration; whereas, the CAWS-(7) SO4 showed the highest total amount of acidity (4726 μmol/g). The optimal FAME conversion (98%) from the PFAD was acquired at the reaction temperature of 80 °C, 15:1 MeOH:PFAD molar ratio and 5 wt% catalyst loading for a 3 h reaction time. The CAWS-(7)SO4 catalyst was reused two times with a high FAME yield without further treatment under optimized reaction conditions. The use of the AWS for the synthesis of catalysts has enormous potential for biodiesel production from high FFA oils due to its lower production cost, abundant availability and high catalytic activity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Zeolite L featuring different size and shape (nanocrystals and discs), with and without alkaline metal exchange (Cs or Na), was used as catalyst support in bio-oil/bio-glycerol mixture Steam Reforming (SR). Zeolites were modified with CeO 2 to improve support properties before the impregnation of nickel. Then, prepared catalysts were tested in SR of a multi-component synthetic bio-oil/bio-glycerol mixture at 1073 and 973 K, under atmospheric pressure and using a Steam to Carbon (S/C) ratio of 5.0. Activity tests showed that catalysts deactivated during the experiments at 973 K. In addition, the sodium exchange produced the sintering of the Zeolite L crystals. Thus, Na containing catalysts produced low conversions and hydrogen yields lower than 30%. On the other hand, Cs containing catalysts resulted in slightly lower hydrogen yields than the supports without this metallic cation. Regarding the morphology of the zeolites, the ones with disc shape were the most active for bio-oil SR purposes producing hydrogen yields close to 80% in the first reaction stage at 1073 K and hydrogen yields close to the 50% at the last reaction stage at 1073 K. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Lignin is the second largest component of vascular plants and is the most abundant renewable aromatic polymer on our planet. The attractiveness of lignin valorization lies in its conversion into high value aromatic chemicals and biofuels through fractionation and upgrading. The literature has demonstrated that the presence of aryl ether bonds in native lignin was a key factor for the conversion, while the conventional technical lignins from carbohydrate-first processes, e.g. pulp and cellulose ethanol production, are intensively condensed and lack these linkages due to the intense delignification conditions. Here, by using the β-O-4 lignin model dimer GG, we reveal the dramatic degradation of GG and the synchronous formation of relatively stable intermediate β-O-4 dimers, C6C3 enol ether and the formylated enol ether, within the first 5 min under the conditions of 72 wt% aqueous formic acid and 130 °C, conditions suitable for biomass fractionation. Based on these findings, we propose a simple but effective strategy of rapid flow-through fractionation (RFF), which separates the dissolved lignin from the reactor in time and space, thereby preserving these labile aryl ether bonds in native lignin. The application of RFF of poplar wood with a short residence time of 2.6 min attained 75% delignification with an equivalent of the β-O-4 motif in native lignin. Structure-preserved lignins (β-O-4 retention, 75.0%-85.4%) were also harvested from wheat straw with good lignin yields (61.7%-78.5%). Contrarily, batch fractionation acted as a protracted war and resulted in extensive cleavage of aryl ether bonds as suggested by 92%-100% loss of the β-O-4 motif under the same conditions. Because of the well-preserved structure, RFF lignin can be used as a good feedstock to boost its downstream valorization, especially for hydrogenolysis into monophenolic chemicals and fuels. It is noteworthy that the carbohydrate fraction from RFF retained structural integrity and almost reached theoretical yields for glucan and xylan. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biodiesel is gaining more and more importance due to environmental issues. This way, alternative and sustainable crops as new biofuel sources are demanded. Safflower could be a sustainable raw material for biodiesel production, showing one disadvantage (as many biodiesels from vegetable oils), that is, a short oxidative stability. Consequently, the use of antioxidants to increase this parameter is mandatory. The aim of this research work was to assess the effect of two antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole, BHA, and tert-butylhydroquinone, TBHQ) on the oxidative stability of safflower biodiesel, which was characterized paying attention to its fatty acid methyl ester profile. For oxidative stability, the Rancimat method was used, whereas for fatty acid profile gas chromatography was selected. For the remaining parameters, the methods were followed according to the UNE-EN 14214 standard. The overall conclusion was that safflower biodiesel could comply with the standard, thanks to the use of antioxidants, with TBHQ being more effective than BHA. On the other hand, the combined use of these antioxidants did not show, especially at low concentrations, a synergic or additive effect, which makes the mixture of these antioxidants unsuitable to improve the oxidative stability. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The conversion of HMF to DMF has received great attention due to its potential as a gasoline alternative. Electrosynthesis is a powerful green tool due to its significant advantages and provides an efficient and environmentally friendly route. In this work, the process uses water as the hydrogen source in the electro-catalytic reduction of 5-hydromethylfurfural (HMF) for the synthesis of 2,5-dimethyl-furan (DMF). The performance of a non-noble CuNi bimetallic electrode was investigated in the electro-catalytic hydrogenation of HMF. The electrodes prepared were characterized using XRD, SEM, XPS, and BET techniques. 88.0% faradaic efficiency of DMF and 91.1% conversion selectivity of DMF were achieved. The CuNi bimetallic electrode also displayed a good stability during the reduction of HMF to DMF. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The present study was mainly focused on the production of biodiesel from Calophyllum inophyllum oil. The oil was characterized by GC–MS and stored for biodiesel production. The heterogeneous catalyst was synthesized for effective production of biodiesel. The synthesized catalyst was found to have good activity and stability. The surface and element characterization of zinc doped calcium oxide was characterized by SEM and EDAX. The size of nanocomposite was found to be in the range of 14.3–65.6 nm. The EDAX has confirmed the presence of zinc on the surface of the calcium oxide. The maximum biodiesel yield of 89.0% (v/v) was obtained at 55 °C in 80 min and catalyst concentration of 6% (w/v). The optimized methanol:oil molar ratio was obtained at 9:1 for the production of biodiesel. The produced methyl ester was confirmed by GC–MS analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The yield and chemical composition of pyrolysis products of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Schizochytrium limacinum were determined using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) by varying the temperature ranges. After further analysis on the total ion current (TIC) diagrams of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Schizochytrium limacinum, it was concluded that both the pyrolysis products of each sample were mainly comprised of hydrocarbons, aromatics, fatty acids, nitrogen compounds, PAHs, phenols, etc, however, the relative content of each compound from Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Schizochytrium limacinum was different. The pyrolysis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Schizochytrium limacinum at 350°C produced a maximum yield of bio-oil production (44.32% and 60.99%); moreover, Chlorella pyrenoidosa could lead to more pollutants (nitrogen compounds and PAHs) release (2.71%) compared to that of Schizochytrium limacinum (0.7%). Considering the reasonably bio-oil production and minimum release of pollutants, Schizochytrium limacinum was found to be superior for producing biofuel against Chlorella pyrenoidosa. © 2018, ABE Publishing.

AB  - This research aims to promote the use of second-generation biofuels based mainly on Castor oil, which is not adequate for food use, and Sunflower oil as a standard reference for recycled oils. They have been applied in the production of Ecodiesel, a biofuel that integrates glycerol as monoglyceride, employing sodium methoxide as homogeneous catalyst and ethanol as solvent, but operating in milder conditions than in the synthesis of conventional biodiesel in order to obtain a kinetic control of the selective transesterification. The behavior of biofuels has been evaluated in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The contamination degree was also evaluated from the opacity values of the generated smokes. The different biofuels here studied have practically no differences in the behavior with respect to the power generated, although a small increase in the fuel consumption was obtained in some cases. However, with the biofuels employed, a significant reduction, up to 40%, in the emission of pollutants is obtained, mainly with the blend diesel/castor oil/alcohol. Besides, it is found that pure Castor oil can be employed directly as biofuel in triple blends diesel/biofuel/alcohol, exhibiting results that are very close to those obtained using biodiesel or Ecodiesel. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Hierarchical aluminosilicate nanosheets composed of an MFI structure with various Si/Al ratios have been successfully prepared via a one-pot hydrothermal process with the aid of tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) as the bifunctional structure-directing agent (SDA). The MFI zeolite nanosheets exhibit outstanding properties, such as an extremely high external surface area and appropriate acidic properties. To illustrate the beneficial effect of the hierarchical structure of the zeolite nanosheets towards green and sustainable catalytic conversion of renewable resources to high value-added chemicals, direct bioethanol dehydration to ethylene over Brønsted-acid MFI nanosheets has been studied from both experimental and theoretical points of view. Interestingly, the hierarchical structure strongly effects an increase in surface acid density at the external surfaces, eventually resulting in an improvement in ethylene selectivity. The results obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations also reveal that ethylene is possibly produced over the Brønsted acid sites located at the external surfaces, whereas diethyl ether (DEE) formation is the predominant pathway over the internal acid sites of MFI. From these findings, hierarchical ZSM-5 nanosheets consisting of a high fraction of active sites at the external silanol surfaces can significantly enhance the selectivity of ethylene from ethanol/bioethanol dehydration. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the bioenergy potential of red macroalgae GF by evaluating its biofuel physicochemical characteristics, and conducting a kinetic study and thermodynamic analysis of pyrolysis for the first time. The thermal decomposition study was performed at low heating rates (5, 10, 20 and 30 °C min−1) under N2 atmosphere. The thermal behavior of GF pyrolysis indicated the presence of three different decomposition stages, which are associated with different components in its structure and consequently influence the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. The kinetic triplet obtained for GF provided a suitable description of experimental thermal behavior. The thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that GF is as a new promising feedstock for bioenergy and presented a similar potential to well-known bioenergy feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgal biotechnologies have emerged with high potential for removal of various organic pollutants, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), from waste streams. In the present study, the removal mechanisms for three typical PPCPs and the lipid performance of Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-03 were thoroughly investigated. Bisphenol A (BPA) and Tetracycline (TCY) achieved complete removal while only ~20% Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) could be removed, even at low concentrations of 1 mg L−1. The mechanisms of elimination showed variation as only SMX could be removed through biodegradation, while ~68.2% TCY and ~14% BPA were removed by a combination of photolysis and hydrolysis. Analysis revealed three intermediates of SMX biodegradation, two of which exhibited high toxicity. Moreover, the lipid content of Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-03 increased from 5 to 49.5% with the addition of SMX, TCY and BPA, with lipid quality varying according to the type of PPCPs. In particular, the dominant component (C18:1) abundance was increased by 15.2% at 10 mg L−1 TCY. Overall, these findings provide a baseline for optimization of microalgal biodiesel production coupled with efficient PPCPs treatment biotechnology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 500 h durability, performance and emission tests are conducted on a single cylinder high speed automotive diesel engine for the ethanol blended biodiesel fuel. Esterified cotton seed methyl ester of 5% by volume is mixed with 95% neat diesel to obtain the base biodiesel fuel (B5). The base fuel is mixed with 20% pure ethanol to derive the ethanol blended biodiesel fuel (B5E20). The parameters like blow-by, crank case pressure and lubricating oil consumption are experimentally investigated along with performance and emission characteristics for both the test fuelled engines. The result of these tests showed a significant loss in maximum brake power and maximum brake torque at the end of 500 h durability run when the engine is fuelled with B5E20. The lubricating oil consumption and positive crank pressure of B5E20 fuelled engine is comparatively higher than B5 fuelled engine during the durability trials. Reduction in smoke and CO emissions are noticed for B5E20 fuel over the entire range of speed whereas NOX and unburned hydro carbon emissions get decreased at lower to medium speed range and increases thereafter. As expected, all the engine emissions increase after 500 h of durability run for both the fuels. © 2019

AB  - In order to understand the pyrolysis mechanism, reaction kinetic and product properties of biomass and select suitable agricultural and forestry residues for the generation desired products, the pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis characteristics of three main components (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) of biomass were investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) with a fixed-bed reactor. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and elemental analysis were used for further characterization. The results showed that: the thermal stability of hemicellulose was the worst, while that of cellulose was higher with a narrow range of pyrolysis temperatures. Lignin decomposed over a wider range of temperatures and generated a higher char yield. After catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 catalyst, the conversion ratio increased. The ratio for the three components was in the following order: lignincellulose < biomass < xylan. The Starink method was introduced to analyze the thermal reaction kinetics, activation energy (Ea), and the pre-exponential factor (A). The addition of HZSM-5 improved the reactivity and decreased the activation energy in the following order: xylan (30.54%) > biomass(15.41%) > lignin (14.75%) > cellulose (6.73%). The pyrolysis of cellulose gave the highest yield of bio-oil rich in levoglucosan and other anhydrosugars with minimal coke formation. Xylan gave a high gas yield and moderate yield of bio-oil rich in furfural, while lignin gave the highest solid residue and produced the lowest yield of bio-oil that was rich in phenolic compounds. After catalytic pyrolysis, xylan gave the highest yield of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 76.40%, and showed selectivity for benzene and toluene. Cellulose showed higher selectivity for xylene and naphthalene; however, lignin showed enhanced for selectivity of C10 + polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Thus, catalytic pyrolysis method can effectively improve the properties of bio-oil and bio-char. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - In this work, microwave-assisted transesterification (MAT) of olive oil was performed to produce olive oil methyl esters. The different reaction variables affected the yield, purity, and physicochemical properties of methyl esters. The reaction variables were namely the microwave power level (100–900 W), methanol to oil molar ratio (3-15), catalyst concentration (0.4–2.0%), and reaction time (3–15 min). Also, the optimum reaction condition was compared with a conventional heating system. Methyl ester yield and purity increased parallel to the intermediary increase in the amount of catalyst, reaction time, methanol to oil molar ratio, and power level. In comparison with the conventional magnetic stirrer transesterification method, the MAT could effectively increase methyl ester yield and simultaneously reduce both the reaction time and the amount of energy consumption. Therefore, MAT can be introduced as a quick method for the transesterification of olive oil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was the modification of agricultural biofuels to allow for low emission combustion in domestic biomass boilers without slagging or other ash related problems. Four agricultural biomasses were additivated with kaolin. Fuel blends were produced from wheat straw and woody biomass. All fuels were combusted in a 30 kW biomass boiler while emissions and slag formation were measured. Due to additivation or fuel blending, total particle and CO emissions were reduced by 53–77% and 69–95%, respectively. At the same time, slag formation (determined as the mass of agglomerates &gt; 3.15 mm) strongly declined. For fuels containing high amounts of sulphur or chlorine, kaolin additivation may lead to increased HCl and SOx emissions. Moreover, NOx-formation may be higher during combustion of additivated fuels (up to 21%). Overall, additivation with kaolin or blending of fuels might be an interesting option for the utilization of agricultural biomasses. The selection of the optimal upgrading method should consider the chemical and physical biomass properties and address the minimum amount of additive or blending ratio to achieve a sufficient reduction of emissions and slagging. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Size-resolved elemental measurements were conducted for the water-soluble fraction of particulate matter at a central California coastal city, Marina, during two separate summertime field campaigns: the Nucleation in California Experiment (NiCE) in 2013 and the Fog and Stratocumulus Evolution (FASE) campaign in 2016. Two Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactors (MOUDIs) were used to quantify mass size distributions of 29 elements and a Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model revealed six characteristic sources during the measurement periods: (i) Crustal Emissions (3.9% of total mass), (ii) Secondary Aerosol (24.4%), (iii) Biomass Burning (13.1%), (iv) Waste Facilities (8.7%), (v) Vehicular Emissions (4.4%), and (vi) Marine Emissions (45.4%). Characteristic elements from each of these sources included the following: (i) Crustal Emissions (Fe, Al, Ti, Pt), (ii) Secondary Aerosol (Zn, As, Rb, K, Cu, V), (iii) Biomass Burning (Rb, K, Cu, Pt), (iv) Waste Facilities (Ag, Cd, Ni, Al), (v) Vehicular Emissions (Zn, Zr, V, Mn), and (vi) Marine Emissions (Na, Sr, V, Mn). Temporally-resolved results revealed higher PM levels associated with Vehicular Emissions (day/night mass concentration ratio = 31.3), Crustal Emissions (day/night = 20.0), and Secondary Aerosol (day/night = 27.2) during the day compared to night due to some combination of more daytime anthropogenic activity, wind speed/directional factors, and photochemistry. The Marine Emissions factor exhibited a day/night concentration ratio of exactly 1.0. Mass size distributions revealed characteristic peaks in four diameter ranges: 0.1–0.18 μm, 0.32–0.56 μm, 1.0–1.8 μm, and 3.2–5.6 μm. The number of modes varied depending on the species and degree of wildfire influence, with additional differences observed between the NiCE and FASE wildfire periods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In biomass conversion, Nb2O5 has attracted increasing attention as a catalyst support presenting water-tolerant Lewis acid sites. Herein, we address the design of Ni/Nb2O5 catalysts for hydrotreating of lignin to hydrocarbons. To optimize the balance between acidic and hydrogenating properties, the catalysts were first evaluated in the hydrotreating of diphenyl ether. The best catalyst candidate was further explored in the conversion of lignin oil obtained by catalytic upstream biorefining of poplar. As primary products, cycloalkanes were obtained, demonstrating the potential of Ni/Nb2O5 catalysts for the lignin-to-fuels route. However, the Lewis acidity of Nb2O5 also catalyzes coke formation via lignin species condensation. Thereby, an acidity threshold should be found so that dehydration reactions essential to the hydrotreatment are not affected, but the condensation of lignin species prevented. This article provides a critical “beginning-to-end” analysis of aspects crucial to the catalyst design to produce lignin biofuels. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - A thermodynamic analysis based on the minimization of the Gibbs free energy method was performed in order to study the steam reforming of real bio-oils (obtained from biomass fast pyrolysis) from different sources. For comparison purposes, four types of reactors were used, namely: traditional reactor (TR), membrane reactor (MR) with H2 separation, sorption-enhanced reactor (SER) with CO2 sorption, and sorption-enhanced membrane reactor (SEMR) with both H2 and CO2 separation. The CO2 capture was studied varying the sorbent (CaO) to feed molar ratio (SFR) while the effect of the H2 removal was assessed with the use of a removal fraction (fH2) of 0 to 0.8 (typical recoveries for an H2-selective membrane). The simulated results obtained for the TR showed a good agreement with those reported in literature experimental works at similar operation conditions. The optimum conditions for the production of hydrogen were obtained in the SEMR in which it was possible to obtain 99% of the maximum theoretical yield for spruce bio-oil and 97% of the maximum yield for wheat bio-oil. Furthermore, this reactor configuration minimizes CH4, H2, CO, CO2 and coke yields. In addition, the effect of pressure in a range of 1 to 10 bar was also assessed for the reactor configurations with H2 removal. It was shown that the increase of pressure decreases H2 yield; nevertheless, this can be offset by moderately increasing the WFR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOx) and four different quinone derivatives (p-benzoquinone (BQ), naphthoquinone (NQ), anthraquinone (AQ) and 1,5-Dihydroxyanthraquinone (15DHAQ)) based biocomposites were embedded in polyethyleneimine (PEI) and then immobilized on carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate (CNT/PEI/Quinone/GOx). These catalysts were then used as the anodic biocatalysts for the enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC). According to the performance investigations of catalysts, the catalytic activity for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) representing the electron transfer rate between GOx and glucose fuel is mostly enhanced in CNT/PEI/NQ/GOx. It is because two benzene rings of NQ play a role in attracting and releasing electrons effectively, increasing the catalytic activity for GOR, while other quinones have problems about attracting electrons (AQ and 15DHAQ) and wrong position of the reactive site for electron transfer (BQ). Excellent electron transfer rate constant (1.1 s -1 ) and Michaelis-Menten constant (0.99mM) are outstanding evidence for that. Furthermore, when the catalyst is utilized for EBC, high power density (57.4 μWcm -2 ) and high open circuit voltage (0.64 V) are accomplished. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Liquid hydrocarbon biofuels obtained from the catalytic cracking of animal fats and plant oils have become attractive because of their possible environmental benefits, and the current concerns over the depletion of fossil-fuel sources. In this work, five different metal-oxide (ZnO, La 2 O 3 , CeO 2 , NiO and MgO) modified SBA-15 (MeO-SBA-15) samples were prepared by a simple one-pot synthesis method and were used in the catalytic cracking of waste cooking oils. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, N 2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared techniques, and their catalytic performances were investigated in detail in the cracking of waste cooking oils. To obtain high-quality biofuel, all the pyrolysis products were separated into two compounds by distillation: (a) liquid hydrocarbon biofuels including gasoline and diesel fractions (distillation temperature ≤ 350 °C); (b) heavy oils (distillation temperature &gt;350 °C). The results indicated that the mesostructure of the SBA-15 was well preserved after metal oxide modification, and the MeO-SBA-15 catalysts improved the hydrocarbon biofuels yield and decreased the heavy oil yield. Among the catalysts, the ZnO-SBA-15 showed an excellent catalytic performance and produced the highest biofuel yield (37.3%) and the lowest yield of heavy oils (39.9%). The liquid hydrocarbon biofuels obtained using the ZnO-SBA-15 catalyst had a similar chemical composition to the diesel-based fuels and showed a lower density, lower viscosity and higher heating values than raw waste cooking oils. These results indicated that ZnO-SBA-15 can promote the chemical reactions, such as deoxygenation and decarbonylation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is an ever increasing need to innovate and provide alternative energy sources to reduce the overdependence on conventional fossil fuels. 2, 5-Dimethylfuran (DMF), a bio-based chemical, has gained a lot of attention due to its potential application as a biofuel additive and is synthesized through hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Bimetallic nano-catalysts have gained importance in recent years due to their excellent selectivity and activity. In this paper, a magnetically separable Fe-Pd/C bimetallic nano-catalyst was developed which not only showed excellent selectivity to DMF but also helped reduce the noble metal consumption, thereby making the catalyst cheaper. Using XPS, XRD and TPR characterizarion techniques, the Fe-Pd/C catalyst was found to exist as bimetallic containing a partially oxidized Fe and reduced Pd atoms. It exhibited 85% selectivity towards DMF with 100% conversion of HMF. The reaction was conducted in a liquid-acid-free environment, thus making the process environmental friendly. The oxidized Fe imparts magnetic properties to the catalyst making it easy to recover. The catalyst was found to be robust and showed excellent activity on repeated use. Overall a highly efficient, economic and green process for DMF synthesis was developed based on biomass as feedstock. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The process of extracting lipids from high-moisture Scenedesmus quadricauda microalgae biomass disrupted with microwave was examined. The study showed that microwave pre-treatment is effective in algae cell rupture while microwave power was found to be a significant factor to enhance the degree of cell disruption. Though microwave pre-treatment time had some effect, the degree of cell rupture seemed to decrease after a certain pre-treatment time. The total lipid from Scenedesmus quadricauda sp. were extracted using a mixture methanol and sulphuric acid as an organic solvent. In addition, it was discovered that microwave pre-treatment enhances the disruption of microalgae cells to attain a high level of lipid yields. Optimal lipid yield obtained in this study was 49% at power 600 W, heating time of 8 min and extraction time of 3.5 h. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The application of immobilized lipase in the enzymatic production of biodiesel has shown numerous advantages. In this study, surface of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) hollow membrane was first modified using nitrile-click chemistry in order to fit for interaction with enzyme proteins. Then sodium alginate (SA) was introduced and the membrane was post-treated by CaCl2. When the prepared PAN-PEI-SA-CaCl2 was used for lipase immobilization, the protein loading was 36.90 mg/g, and the enzyme activity reached up to 54.47 U/g, which was 2.5 times as much as that of Novozym® 435. As a result, the constructed immobilized lipase obtained a maximum biodiesel yield of 78.5%, which was 2.4 times that of the Novozym® 435 in transesterification reactions. Moreover, the biodiesel yield decreased by only 11% after the immobilized enzyme was continuously used for 20 times. This study exhibits that this technic has broad application prospects in the field of conversion of biomass resources. © 2018

AB  - The conversion of lignin to biofuels and biobased chemicals is currently attracting a lot of attention. We here report on the valorization of Kraft lignin by a catalytic hydrotreatment using Ni, Mo, and W phosphide catalysts supported on activated carbon in the absence of an external solvent. Experiments were carried out in a batch setup in the temperature range of 400-500 °C and 100 bar initial H 2 pressure. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, and transmission electron microscopy. The lignin oils were analyzed extensively by different techniques such as GPC, GC-MS-FID, 13 C NMR, and elemental analysis. Two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC-FID) was applied to identify and quantify distinct groups of compounds (aromatics, alkylphenolics, alkanes, etc.). Mo-based catalysts displayed higher activity compared to the W-containing catalysts. The reaction parameters such as the effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst loading were studied for two catalysts (15MoP/AC and 20NiMoP/AC), and optimized reaction conditions regarding yields of monomeric components were identified (400 °C, 100 bar H 2 at RT, 10 wt % catalyst loading on lignin intake). The highest monomer yield (45.7 wt % on lignin) was obtained for the 20NiMoP/AC (Ni 5.6 wt %, Mo 9.1 wt %, P 5.9 wt %) catalyst, which includes 25% alkylphenolics, 8.7% aromatics, and 9.9% alkanes. Our results clearly reveal that the phosphide catalysts are highly efficient catalyst to depolymerize the Kraft lignin to valuable biobased chemicals and outperform sulfided NiMo catalysts (monomer yield on lignin &lt; 30 wt %). © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, the adsorption desulfurization performance and adsorption diffusion study of B2O3 modified Ag-CeOx/TiO2-SiO2 adsorbent were investigated. The adsorption desulfurization performance was studied by batch and fixed bed tests. The homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM) was employed to investigate the adsorption and diffusion behavior of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) in diesel. It was found that the addition of B2O3 promotes the dispersion of CeOx species and then further facilitates the dispersion and oxidation of Ag species resulting in higher adsorption desulfurization activity. Ag species are in state of Ag, Ag2O and Ag2O2, among which, Ag2O and Ag2O2 are found to be the active centers. The kinetics of adsorption desulfurization of model diesel fuel was investigated to provide guiding significance for the prediction of breakthrough curves of fixed-bed adsorption columns. The batch kinetic experiment modeled by HSDM model indicates that surface diffusion controls the main rate. The surface diffusion coefficient Ds determined by batch adsorption experiments is independent of operation conditions, which can be used to directly predict the breakthrough behavior in fixed bed adsorption. The modified HSDM model is proposed to describe the breakthrough behavior. Results indicate that the breakthrough time is affected by bed height, flowrate and influent concentration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, response surface methodology (RSM) involving central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize the reaction parameters of biodiesel production from yellow mustard (Sinapis alba L.) seed oil during the single-step transesterification process. A total of 30 experiments were designed and performed to determine under the effects of variables on the biodiesel yield such as methanol to oil molar ratio (2:1–10:1), catalyst concentration (0.2–1.0 wt.% NaOH), reaction temperature (50–70°C), and reaction time (30–90 min). The second order polynomial model was used to predict the biodiesel yield and coefficient of determination (R2) was found to be at 0.9818. The optimum biodiesel yield was calculated as 96.695% from the model with the following reaction conditions: 7.41:1 of methanol to oil molar ratio, 0.63 wt. % NaOH of catalyst concentration, 61.84°C of reaction temperature, and 62.12 min of reaction time. It is seen that the regression model results were in agreement with the experimental data. The results showed that RSM is a suitable statistical technique for optimizing the reaction parameters in the transesterification process in order to maximize the biodiesel yield. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Macroalgae are emerging feedstocks for sustainable biofuel and chemical production. This study investigates microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) and analytical fast pyrolysis of three different macroalgae species, viz., Kappaphycus alvarezii, Sargassum wightii and Turbinaria ornata at 500 °C. With an aim to understand the effect of heating mechanism on the formation of products and their composition, pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a batch microwave reactor and in a Curie point analytical pyrolyzer. The bio-oil, gas and char yields from MAP of the macroalgae were in the range of 26-32, 41-46 and 22-33 wt%, respectively. Moreover, high yields of CO (37-40 vol%), CH4 (16-25 vol%) and H2 (29-32 vol%) were recorded. Furan derivatives and anhydrosugars were the major organics from analytical fast pyrolysis, while anhydrosugars were absent in the bio-oil from MAP of the macroalgae. High selectivities to aromatics (20%) and furan derivatives (40%) were observed. A higher degree of deoxygenation and condensation was observed from MAP as compared to analytical fast pyrolysis. Nitrogen in the macroalgae got transformed into ammonia and heterocyclic nitrogen-containing organics in MAP, while amines were the major nitrogen-containing organics from analytical fast pyrolysis. Sulfur was detected in the form of SO2 gas in both the pyrolysis processes, while it was also captured in the organic phase in MAP. Generally, secondary cracking reactions were more pronounced in MAP owing to the microwave plasma spots in the reaction mixture, while, owing to the short residence time in the analytical Curie point pyrolyzer, the primary pyrolysis vapors did not undergo secondary gas phase transformations or interactions with the bio-char.

AB  - Carbonaceous materials are currently the most extensively researched materials as catalyst supports for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). N-doping is an extremely effective strategy to tailor the unique electronic properties of carbon materials. However, the coexistence of electron-accepting pyridinic- and pyrrolic-N with electron-donating quaternary-N weakens the n-type behavior, resulting in lower electron mobility than that of pristine graphene, thus impacting a range of device applications. Herein, we demonstrate a covalently coupled ultrahigh quaternary-N-doped reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (QN-rGO@CNT) network through electrostatic interaction as a novel enzyme support for EBFCs. It is found that N bond types are controllable via thermal treatment, and the as-made QN-rGO@CNT composite with an interconnected porous structure, covalent coupling, and ultrahigh electron-donating quaternary-N-doping exhibits superior electrochemical properties. As a result, the present glucose/O2 EBFCs equipped with enzyme-functionalized QN-rGO@CNT electrodes can deliver a high open circuit potential of 0.89 V, a short-circuit current density of 2.25 mA cm-2 and a maximum power density of 0.9 mW cm-2. Using the high-throughput fabrication method reported in this work, the monotype N-doped carbon hybrid can be commercially utilized as a promising supporting electrode in BFC applications. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - As the largest consumer of petroleum and second highest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, the United States currently is a leading country in bioenergy production driven by a series of policies. One such public program that directly subsidizes biomass feedstock growers is the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP), which recently received attention for stimulating the development of bioenergy. However, critiques were also raised, concerning the possibility of intensifying the feedstock competition between bioenergy and forest products. This study, therefore, aimed at assessing the effects of BCAP on the forest product markets with the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM). Three alternative scenarios were designed to simulate three payments in BCAP. In the first scenario, the matching payment was simulated by adjusting the manufacturing cost of fuelwood and particleboard. In the second scenario, establishment payment was simulated by adjusting the supply rate of industrial roundwood. In the third scenario, the annual payment was simulated by linking the supply change rate with the soil rental rate for industrial roundwood. We found that, under the matching payment scenario, industrial roundwood and particleboard will experience a sharp decrease in production and an increase in price. For establishment payments, industrial roundwood will experience a continuous increase in production and a decrease in price. For annual payments, the industrial roundwood will experience a V-shape pattern production. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This paper investigates the biodiesel production by subcritical/chemical hydroesterification from crude palm oil. Hydroesterification is the innovation of biodiesel production in two-step: consists of hydrolysis of oil into free fatty acids (FFAs) in subcritical water and subsequent chemical esterification of FFAs into FAMEs (biodiesel). The purpose was to apply the experimental factorial design to evaluate the influence of reaction variables on the effectiveness of hydrolysis and determine the relationship of FFAs and FAMEs yields. Experiments were conducted in a batch reactor under various conditions and the optimal conditions (250 °C, 120 min, 100:1 water:oil molar ratio and 700 rpm) for hydrolysis was determined. The analyses indicated high FFAs yields (86 wt%). Esterification results revealed a conversion of the FFAs in 99.1 wt% of FAMEs in biodiesel production. This study shows that hydroesterification process produces biodiesel with excellent quality as well as traditional alkaline transesterification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of biomass converts it to bio-oil, which contains high oxygen content, reactive nature, and poor heating value and hence require upgradation prior to its utilization as fuel. It is desirable to convert the oxygenated compounds of bio-oil into oxygen deficient compounds in the context of converting biomass to biofuel. In this work, we show the generation of hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil from grassy biomass (taking Napier grass as a model compound) using vacuum pyrolysis coupled with online upgradation (or deoxygenation) of volatile products over an iron bed. A comparison between individual pyrolysis products, especially liquid compounds, without and with vapor upgradation treatment, is presented. Online deoxygenation of pyrolysis volatile products over iron bed significantly reduced oxygenated compounds within bio-oil and increased the formation of hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis gases after deoxygenation treatment predominantly contained hydrogen along with C1 – C4 hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Amongst liquid products, bio-oil mainly contained C9 – C23 hydrocarbons, phenols, and aldehydes, while, aqueous phase contained dissolved organics as alcohol, acid, aldehyde, phenolic compounds, and sugar chemicals. Additionally, the amorphous and alkaline biochar comprised of nanoparticles, having the porous surface and various functionalities suitable for acidic soil. Moreover, a reaction scheme for Napier grass-derived products is proposed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Non-precious metal doped carbonaceous materials are currently the most promising alternative towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts in terms of cost, accessibility, efficiency and durability. In this work, a simple one-step pyrolysis process was used for the synthesis of copper doped graphitic carbon nitride (Cu-g-C3N4) as electrocatalyst. The as-synthesized Cu-g-C3N4 material is displaying excellent electrocatalytic response towards ORR in alkaline medium. In comparison to commercial Pt/C catalyst, Cu-g-C3N4 exhibits high methanol tolerance, long term stability, without compromising (4e−) electron transfer pathway process and attaining less than 4% H2O2 formation. The enhanced electrocatalytic behaviour may be ascribed to the formation of active sites strongly coupled into the nitrogen-rich carbon matrix. Such a low-cost, extremely durable and stable electrocatalyst can therefore be regarded as an efficient cathodic material, which can be utilized for several renewable energy conversion technologies such as fuel cell, biofuel cell and metal-air battery. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was produced by using a heterogeneous acid catalyst made from brewer's spent yeast (BSY). BSY was initially activated by phosphoric acid followed by carbonization in inert atmosphere and sulfonation process to prepare the catalyst. It is completely characterized using sophisticated instruments to determine its physical and chemical properties. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the catalyst was analyzed by subjecting it to sonochemical esterification of an industrial low value waste product, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). The reactions were performed in the presence of ultrasound at a constant frequency of 25 kHz. An optimum methyl ester conversion of 87.8% was achieved at 8 wt% of catalyst, 21:1 methanol to PFAD molar ratio, 65 °C and 180 min of reaction time. The catalyst displayed a high catalytic stability up to four cycles due to firm [sbnd]SO3H functional group attached onto the surface. Furthermore, a novel sonochemical kinetic model was proposed for surface esterification reaction on the catalyst. The reaction rate was found and it followed a pseudo-first-order reaction mechanism. Furthermore, a deactivation model was also proposed to account for the loss of activity upon catalyst reuse during sonochemical reaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The removal of siloxanes (D4 and D5) and volatile organic contaminants (hexane, toluene and limonene) typically found in sewage biogas was investigated in a lab-scale biotrickling filter (BTF) packed with lava rock under anoxic conditions. Complete removal efficiencies for toluene and limonene were recorded at all empty bed residence time (EBRT) tested. The influence of EBRT was remarkable on the abatement of D5, whose removal decreased from 37% at 14.5 min to 16% at 4 min, while the removal of D4 and hexane remained below 16%. The packing material was supplemented with 20% of activated carbon aiming at increasing the mass transfer of the most hydrophobic pollutants. This strategy supported high removal efficiencies of 43 and 45% for hexane and D5 at the lowest EBRT. CO2 and silica were identified as mineralization products along with the presence of metabolites in the trickling solution such as dimethylsilanediol, 2-carene and α-terpinene. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The significant growth aviation has been observing is increasing the sector's pressure on the environment; in the EU28, passengers travelling by air in 2016 increased of 5.9% compared to 2015. The aviation industry voluntarily committed to significant aspirational goals, and identified bio-based aviation fuels as a potential means to improve its environmental performance. Despite of that, the market penetration of aviation biofuels in EU28 is almost negligible. In this paper, an assessment of the likely aviation biofuels demand has been carried out, under a baseline scenario of increasing total fuel consumption of +3% for 2016–2020 and + 3.5% up to 2030; the CO2 intensity of this growth has been calculated accordingly. Europe is a World leader in biofuel technologies; the current potential aviation biofuels is based on the HVO/HEFA technology, and the upper limit of the installed capacity can be considered approximately 2.4 Mt y−1. Nevertheless, lower production volumes can be expected as production plants are today optimized for road fuel production, not aviation. By 2025 the situation may change, with a total production capacity of 3.5 Mt y−1, and with an average potential production for aviation biofuels ranging 0.5–2 Mt y−1. The paper shows that even if today's EU nominal capacity appears large enough to support the expected aviation biofuels demand, other bottlenecks may limit the real market uptake: availability of sustainable feedstocks, competition with demand for road transport sector, etc. For this reason, a comparison of the cost for CO2 saving of other potential solutions to mitigate aviation's climate impact has also been carried out. © 2019

AB  - The renewable hydrocarbon-like biofuel from biomass is crucial to substitute fossil fuel. A series of mesoporous Al2O3-TiO2 mixed oxide catalysts with different TiO2 content (0.1Ti-0.9Al, 0.2Ti-0.8Al and 0.3Ti-0.7Al) have been synthesized. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM-EDX, BET, FTIR, NH3-TPD, FTIR-Py, and TGA. The deoxygenation (DO) of triglyceride (i.e. triolein) was carried out in the absence of hydrogen and solvent. The mesoporous Al2O3-TiO2 catalysts showed high catalytic activity performance as compared to that of Al2O3 and TiO2. It was found that 0.2Ti-0.8Al catalyst exhibited the highest conversion (76.86%), and selectivity (27.26%) toward n-C15 + n-C17 at 380 °C after 4 h. The excellence performance of mesoporous Al2O3-TiO2 was attributed to its acidity, mesoporosity and larger surface area. The results reveal that the mesoporous Al2O3-TiO2 catalyst is a promising catalyst for the synthesis of hydrocarbon-like biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study is aimed to investigate thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of banana peel. In the first part of the study, banana peel was pyrolyzed by varying the temperatures between 400 and 700 °C. It was seen that higher temperature caused in lower bio-oil and bio-char yields but higher gas yields and optimum temperature was determined as 550 °C. In the second part, the mesoporous material Al-SBA-15 with the typical hexagonal arrangement of SBA-15 verified via XRD possesses Lewis and Brönsted acid sites (NH3-TPD), large surface area and wide pore diameter (N2 physisorption) was able to catalyzing of banana peel biomass resulting in bio-oil yields of 18–28% with varying catalyst/biomass ratios (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 wt%). The highest bio-oil yield from the catalytic pyrolysis was 18.64% with 15 wt% catalyst/biomass ratios. The composition and physical properties of the bio-oils were reported that the catalyst increased oxygen removal from the bio-oil and also developed the production of desirable products like phenolics and aromatic compounds. The results confirmed the catalytic pyrolysis of banana peel was well related to the textural properties of catalysts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF) has been considered a promising biofuel additive, potentially derived from renewable resources. There have been various reports on DMF production from hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, most reports employed high hydrogen pressure, long reaction times, and reactions under batch conditions. In this study, Cu-Pd bimetallic catalysts incorporated on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were used for selective hydrogenation of HMF to DMF using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor under continuous flow conditions. Synthesized catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, SEM-EDX, XRD, XPS, TEM, and H2-TPR techniques. 10Cu-1Pd/RGO exhibited 96% HMF conversion with 95% DMF yield under optimum reaction conditions with good stability with time on stream. XRD and XPS results pointed to the presence of a palladium-copper alloy, which could enhance both the activity and especially the stability in the conversion of HMF toward DMF. The effect of temperature, pressure, and feed flow rate were also investigated on the catalytic performance. The stability of catalyst was tested for 8 h time on stream, where it was found that the catalyst displayed good stability. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Zirconia modified mesoporous silica such as Zr-SBA-15, Zr-KIT-6, Zr-SiO2, and Zr-FSM-16 with Si/Zr = 10 ratio over Ni-MoS catalysts were prepared under the hydrothermal condition and compared with Ni-MoS/Zr-Al (10). The prepared materials were characterized by various techniques like X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), N2-sorption studies, diffuse reflectance measurement–UV-Vis spectrophotometers (DR-UV-vis), NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)/H2-Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Laser-Raman, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. The activity of materials was investigated in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of jojoba oil to produce long-chain hydrocarbons at 225–375 °C under 10–40 bar H2 pressure in a stainless steel fixed bed reactor. Among the catalysts tested, Ni-MoS/Zr-K (10) exhibited the highest catalytic activity of 90% conversion and 79% yield of C18–C22 hydrocarbon. The structure-activity relationships and product distributions were also discussed in detail. © 2019

AB  - Background: Low-temperature swelling of cotton linter cellulose and subsequent gelatinization in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) greatly enhance rates of enzymatic digestion or maleic acid-AlCl3 catalyzed conversion to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and levulinic acid (LA). However, lignin inhibits low-temperature swelling of TFA-treated intact wood particles from hybrid poplar (Populus tremula × P. alba) and results in greatly reduced yields of glucose or catalytic conversion compared to lignin-free cellulose. Previous studies have established that wood particles from transgenic lines of hybrid poplar with high syringyl (S) lignin content give greater glucose yields following enzymatic digestion. Results: Low-temperature (- 20 °C) treatment of S-lignin-rich poplar wood particles in TFA slightly increased yields of glucose from enzymatic digestions and HMF and LA from maleic acid-AlCl3 catalysis. Subsequent gelatinization at 55 °C resulted in over 80% digestion of cellulose in only 3 to 6 h with high-S-lignin wood, compared to 20-60% digestion in the wild-type poplar hybrid and transgenic lines high in guaiacyl lignin or 5-hydroxy-G lignin. Disassembly of lignin in woody particles by Ni/C catalytic systems improved yields of glucose by enzymatic digestion or catalytic conversion to HMF and LA. Although lignin was completely removed by Ni/C-catalyzed delignification (CDL) treatment, recalcitrance to enzymatic digestion of cellulose from the high-S lines was reduced compared to other lignin variants. However, cellulose still exhibited considerable recalcitrance to complete enzymatic digestion or catalytic conversion after complete delignification. Low-temperature swelling of the CDL-treated wood particles in TFA resulted in nearly complete enzymatic hydrolysis, regardless of original lignin composition. Conclusions: Genetic modification of lignin composition can enhance the portfolio of aromatic products obtained from lignocellulosic biomass while promoting disassembly into biofuel and bioproduct substrates. CDL enhances rates of enzymatic digestion and chemical conversion, but cellulose remains intrinsically recalcitrant. Cold TFA is sufficient to overcome this recalcitrance after CDL treatment. Our results inform a 'no carbon left behind' strategy to convert total woody biomass into lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose value streams for the future biorefinery. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Catalytic upgrading of bio-oils derived from fast pyrolysis of sunflower stalk, cedar, knotweed and apple tree stem over H-ZSM-5, H-beta and H-USY zeolites with high alumina content was investigated at a reaction temperature of 500 °C. All catalysts showed high catalytic activity and selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons in the conversions of oxygenated compounds in the bio-oils, and 56.2–100% of aromatic hydrocarbons were found in the upgraded bio-oils which can be detected by GC/MS. Naphthalene was favored to be produced by using H-ZSM-5 while more monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as p-xylene, toluene and alkylbenzene were generated by using H-beta as well as H-USY. Furthermore, all catalysts maintained high activity and selectivity with the maximum aromatic hydrocarbons amount of 70% in the upgraded bio-oils detected in the third cycle. In addition, the spent catalysts were easily regenerated by simple calcination at 650 °C for 30 min, and the regenerated catalysts showed almost the same activity as the fresh ones. It is expected that these high alumina zeolites can be widely used in practical bio-oil upgrading processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A lithium based chicken bone (Li-Cb) composite has been synthesized by wet impregnation method followed by calcination at various temperatures (750, 800, 850, and 900 °C). The Li-Cb catalysts were characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), TG-DSC and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The catalytic activities of Li impregnated catalyst were described in term of basicity. 2 g of LiNO3 impregnated in 7 g of Cb and calcinated at 850 °C (2Li-Cb850) were found as the best combination to synthesize the efficient catalyst for the transesterification of canola oil with 96.6% conversion to FAME in 3 h of reaction time along with 18:1 of methanol:oil molar ratio, catalyst loading of 4 wt %, and reaction temperature of 60 °C. The pseudo-first order model with 0.58 h−1 rate constant (at 60 °C) and 16.9 kJ/mol activation energy was the best fitted to represent the transesterification kinetic. Moreover, the prepared catalyst (2Li-Cb850) showed sustained activity after being recycled and reused for 5 times with FAME content &gt; 82%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conversion technology of solid biomass to liquid fuel, named bio-crude oil, has been researched widely for the production of renewable energy to replace fossil fuel oil. As the result of many admirable researches, fast pyrolysis technology for bio-crude oil production is close to commercialization. However, bio-crude oil has unsatisfactory properties compared to general petroleum oil, for instance, low heating value, high water content, and high viscosity. In this study, pine sawdust (SD) biomass was co-pyrolyzed with waste polystyrene foam (WPSF), which was expected to improve the bio-crude oil quality due to high heating value and non-oxygen composition of polystyrene. The co-pyrolysis experiment was conducted in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor under the following conditions: temperature of 500 °C which was chosen based on the results from thermogravimetric analysis of SD and WPSF, nitrogen flow rate of 20–25 L/min., and feeding rate of 200 g/hr. Various mixing ratios of SD/WPSF by weight percentage were tested as follows: 100/0, 95/5, 90/10, 85/15, 80/20, 75/25, 70/30, 60/40, 50/50, 25/75, 0/100. Experimental results showed that in case of only SD feeding the bio-crude oil yield and higher heating value (HHV) were 48.83 wt% and 17.81 MJ/kg respectively. By contrast, oil yield and HHV in case of 25% SD with 75% WPSF mixture were 63.31 wt% and 39.65 MJ/kg respectively. Additional analysis showed that water content, and acetic acid concentration of bio-crude oil from co-pyrolysis of SD/WPSF mixture were decreased almost proportionally with the increasing WPSF ratio. Furthermore, measured values of water content, and acetic acid concentration were lower than the calculated values by linear interpolation, which means that the synergistic effect between SD and WPSF was achieved during the co-pyrolysis. In conclusion, co-pyrolysis of SD and WPSF was found as a promising solution to improve bio-crude oil quality. With this technology, the industrial growth of bio-crude oil area is expected as well as waste plastic. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste tires have an organic-matter composition of more than 90% and have been proposed as an excellent calorific fuel material. The objective of this study is to find an economic and efficient pathway for producing syngas by waste tires gasification. To achieve this goal, two most commonly used gasifier types of fluidized bed and fixed bed have been simulated and compared by using a semi-empirical model and a one-dimensional kinetics model, respectively. Moreover, economic analysis of the levelized cost of syngas is used to compare economic indicators of different gasifiers. Results show that the lower heating value of the tire-syngas product is 2.5–7.4 MJ/Nm 3 , moreover, equivalence ratio and tire mixture ratio have negative impacts on syngas heating value and syngas efficiency. Furthermore, the levelized cost of syngas of tire gasification is 0.33–0.60 ¢/kWh that is lower than the market price of natural gas at 0.68 ¢/kW, which indicates tire gasification is a potential technology for syngas production. Finally, compared with the fluidized bed tire gasification, the fixed bed tire gasification has worse performance but better economic indicators, indicating that fixed bed gasification is an economic pathway for the syngas product. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Acid washing is an alternative and promising approach for biomass to produce high-quality bio-oil. The hydrochloric acid washing pretreatment of sweet sorghum bagasse was performed in this study. The effects of acid washing on the ultrastructure of sweet sorghum bagasse were investigated using scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared, and the effects on pyrolysis using thermogravimetric analyzer and a fast pyrolysis device. The results indicated acid treatment obviously changed the surface morphology of the cell walls of sweet sorghum bagasse, effectively removed most metals from sweet sorghum bagasse, and increased the volatiles and bio-oil yields. The results showed that bio-oil produced from pretreated sweet sorghum bagasse contained less components categories, lower contents of phenols, aldehydes, furans and alcohols, while much higher contents of d-allose and ketones than that from the original sample. Hydrochloric acid-washing pretreatment of sweet sorghum bagasse can increase the contents of some high-value chemicals in bio-oil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sand apple oil seed that has relatively high oil yield is widely cultivated in Africa. Evaluation of the performance of sand apple ethyl ester is a missing link in establishing it as an alternative fuel for use in diesel engines. Performance evaluation of optimized yields of sand apple biodiesel was, therefore, conducted in a diesel engine at various loading rates. Oil was extracted from sand apple seeds via solvent extraction. A Central Composite Design was used to optimize biodiesel yields from sand apple oil transesterification using potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Engine tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of a stationary 5Hp diesel engine starting from 0% to 100% load conditions. The engine was run with diesel and four different blends of diesel/biodiesel. Values for speed, torque, fuel consumption rate and exhaust temperature were determined. The optimum biodiesel yield recorded was 94.6%. The torque, speed, fuel consumption rate and exhaust temperature recorded for best engine performance for all blends were 8.50 Nm, 2950 rpm, 2.925 × 10−6 kg/s, and 300 °C. The evaluated engine parameters showed sand apple biodiesel can be burned in diesel engines using appropriate blending ratio without any modification to the engine. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper we identify a concept of countries’ biomass-related sustainability through a revision of the literature and the opinion of professionals, and identify the main reasons that prevent biomass from being a major source of energy production (adversities and constraints). The Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodology was used for establishing the causal and hierarchical relationships among the variables linked with the adversities and constraints associated with the production of biofuel from biomass and their impact on countries’ biomass-related sustainability. At the base of the concept of biomass related countries’ sustainability we identify an important constraint associated with the high energy production costs, but also the necessity of supporting new investments, which will drive technological innovations in this sector and allow for an increase in efficiency. The paper presents an innovative approach to the research of biofuel production from biomass by suggesting not only a concept of countries’ biomass-related sustainability but also by exploring causal and hierarchical relationships between adversities/constraints of biofuel production and impact on countries’ sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Furfural (FF) is a biomass-derived oxygenate and a platform chemical that can produce a biofuel candidate, 2-methyl furan (MF), and valuable chemicals by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis. Electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (ECH) is a promising method for upgrading of FF to produce MF and valuable chemicals such as furfuryl alcohol (FA). The production rate, selectivity and faradaic efficiency (FE) of products on microcrystalline and nanocrystalline Cu electrodes were compared with a bare Cu electrode at different potentials. At near onset potentials of ECH of FF, the production rate of FA + MF on nanocrystalline Cu was 2.4 times that of bare Cu, with a negligible amount of side product, hydrogen gas. As the magnitude of applied potential increased to much beyond the onset potential, the production rate for FA + MF more than doubled on the nanocrystalline Cu catalyst compared to bare Cu, when a significant quantity of FF was present. The nanocrystalline Cu catalyst also maintained stable and repeatable FE and production rate for desired products during repeated cycles of ECH of FF. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, co-liquefaction (HTL) of Prosopis juliflora (PJ) biomass with polyolefin waste (PO) was performed to produce bio-oil. HTL on bio-oil yield was studied at varying PJ to PO ratios (0:1, 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1) and temperatures from 340 to 440 °C. Bio-oil and HTL by-products were characterized by Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Bio-oil yield was around 61.23%wt at 420 °C for 3:1 blends with 3 wt% of HCl activated bentonite catalyst at 60 min holding time. HHV value was 46 MJ/Kg with 88.23% purity (petro-diesel). Additionally gas possessed 26.28% of Hydrogen gas, 45.59% of Carbon dioxide gas, 7.1% of Carbon monoxide gas, 8.12% of Methane gas and other elements. The energy recovery (78%) and carbon recovery (94%) was higher for 3:1 blends bio-oil than PO and PJ processed bio-oils. HTL wastewater possessed higher degree of reusability nature as HTL medium. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Improvement of processes starting from renewable feedstocks to produce chemicals and biofuels up to now derived from fossil carbon feedstocks is paramount to creating environmentally sustainable industrial processes. Guerbet condensation of ethanol to give n-butanol represents a turning point not only respect to the traditional petrochemical “oxo” process, but also to the bio-chemical path (Acetone Butanol Ethanol “ABE” process). In this work, different Cu/Mg/Al hydrotalcite-derived mixed oxides catalysts, with Cu atomic content in the range 7.6–1.0%, were synthetised, characterized, and tested for the Guerbet reaction. The adopted catalysts are easy to produce, and based on available, cheap and non-toxic metals. Tailoring Cu-content in hydrotalcite-derived Cu/Mg/Al mixed oxides allowed us to selectively address this reaction towards n-butanol formation, highlighting how a low Cu-content favours the condensation to n-butanol and higher alcohols, in particular n-hexanol, decreasing the ester formation. The Guerbet selective co-production of [n-butanol + n-hexanol] is economically even more attractive than that of the sole n-butanol, being both saleable products. Good catalytic performances to n-butanol and n-hexanol were achieved, in a batch process carried out under subcritical conditions. These catalysts have required a simple procedure of recovery, showing good recyclability, in term of catalytic performances to give the target products, thus opening the way to applicative perspectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Low chemical stability and high oxygen content limit utilization of the bio-based platform chemical 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) in biofuels development. In this work, Lewis-acid-catalyzed conversion of renewable 6-deoxy sugars leading to formation of more stable 5-methylfurfural (MF) is carried out with high selectivity. Besides its higher stability, MF is a deoxygenated analogue of HMF with increased C/O ratio. A highly selective synthesis of the innovative liquid biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran starting from MF under mild conditions is described. The superior synthetic utility of MF against HMF in benzoin and aldol condensation reactions leading to long-chain alkane precursors is demonstrated. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Cyanamide functionalised carbon nitride powder is reported as a photocatalyst for direct Minisci-type coupling of heteroarenes with ethers, alcohols, and amides using atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant at room temperature. This mild protocol displays broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance and the catalyst can be easily isolated and reused for several cycles. It thereby addresses the two major limitations of previously reported photoredox-mediated Minisci reactions: (i) use of expensive and potentially harmful non-recyclable photocatalysts, and (ii) requirement of a stoichiometric amount of strong chemical oxidant. Finally, using platinum as a co-catalyst with the carbon nitride allows this light-mediated reaction to generate two value-added products under an anaerobic atmosphere-functionalised heteroarenes and H2 fuel.

AB  - The present work is dedicated to the experimental analysis on the influence of fuel-borne additives on ternary fuel blend operated in a single cylinder DI diesel engine. Alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) nanoparticles were chosen as fuel additives at dosing levels of 10, 20, and 30 ppm, respectively, and the ternary fuel (TF) is prepared by blending 70% diesel, 20% Jatropha biodiesel, and 10% ethanol. Performance characteristics like brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) and emission characteristics like HC, CO, NOx, and smoke along with combustion characteristics like cylinder pressure, HRR (heat release rate), and CHRR (cumulative heat release rate) were considered for analysis. Based on experimentation, it is observed that TF blended with 20 ppm alumina nanoadditive (TF20) resulted in higher BTE and lowered BSEC by 7.8 and 4.93% and lowered HC, CO, NOx, and smoke emissions by 5.69, 11.24, 9.39, and 6.48% in comparison with TF. Moreover, TF20 resulted in higher cylinder pressure, HRR, and CHRR of about 72.67 bar, 76.22 J/°CA, and 1171.1 J, respectively, which are higher than those of diesel and TF. Hence, it is concluded that the addition of 20 ppm alumina nanoadditive in TF can enhance the engine performance and combustion as well as lower the exhaust pollutants simultaneously. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Substitution of fossil diesel fuel by biodiesel is a realistic alternative due to its compatibility with commercial diesel engines. However, detractors consider that traditional raw materials used for biodiesel production may compete with human feeding (edible vegetables oils), land and water. So, new raw materials are needed. Annually, around 1.3 billion ton of food are discarded or wasted. This huge figure has led researchers to seek for new applications to this carbon source. The main goal of this work is biodiesel production optimization (with and without auxiliary energy assistance), and further characterization, by using the lipid fraction included in solid food waste, collected from local restaurants. Solid food waste oil (SFWO) characterization showed a fatty acid profile rich in oleic (C18:1), palmitic (C16:0) and linolenic (C18:2) acids, a remarkable fatty acid composition suitable for biodiesel production. Due to high free fatty acid content, acid esterification pre-treatment was conducted, followed by a basic transesterification optimization, by both conventional and ultrasound (US) assisted reactions. Response surface methodology was selected to perform the experimental design; optimal conditions for conventional transesterification were achieved at 6.08:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 1.28% w/w catalyst and 52.5 °C reaction temperature, providing 93.23% w/w fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) conversion. Biodiesel quality was also analyzed with excellent results considering cold properties (cold filter plugging point below −3 °C), although oxidation stability did not fulfill European standard limit. US-assisted reaction was also compared with conventional transesterification in terms of energy consumption and reaction time, providing significant savings in both energy and reaction time (40 min reduction). As a conclusion, US-assisted SFWO biodiesel meets most European standard limits, following circular economy. To extend its use, blends with diesel fuel and antioxidant addition are recommended, besides long-term engine tests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestate originating from food waste has been studied herein for two different purposes. Firstly, for combustion, co-granulation of the digestate and medium density fibreboard (MDF) dust with the addition of sodium silicate as the binder was used to produce the granular solid biofuel. It was found that increasing the content of the medium density fibreboard dust could increase the calorific value but had no significant effect on the strength of the final granules. Additionally, a significant reduction of the ash content was also observed. For heavy metal removal, granules made using the digestate and sodium silicate binder were carbonised to produce biochar which was characterised and applied as adsorbent materials. The biochar has a good removal capacity for both lead and cadmium, and the binder concentration had a positive correlation with the removal capacity of the resultant biochar. The maximum lead removal capacity (355.3 mg g−1) of biochar made using 3 wt.% sodium silicate binder, was six times more than the analogous commercial activated carbon. Langmuir model showed better fitting for adsorption data of Pb2+, while the Freundlich model showed better fitting of Cd2+. For both Pb2+ and Cd2+ kinetic data, the pseudo-second-order had a better correlation. Our approach helps aid and facilitate the concept of the circular economy by effectively up-cycling and valorising waste lignocellulosic biomass such as food waste digestate into value-added products. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The conventional method of lipid extraction mandatorily includes cell lysis which is considered an essential process for the enhancement of extraction efficiency. However, cell lysis method especially those incorporating mechanical and physical methods such as homogenization, sonication, microwave techniques, etc., are energy intensive and drastically escalates the biofuel production cost. Therefore, the development of an alternate route of extraction skipping the conventional mechanical cell lysis step remains a challenge to be accomplished. In this context, we discuss the reports involving passive techniques that are able to extract lipid from microalgae without significant cell wall shearing. This includes methods such as in-situ transesterification, direct saponification, supercritical fluid extraction, organic solvent extraction, etc. Moreover, the review discusses the employment of passive lipid extraction methods in a biorefinery set-up, outlining the various bioproducts that could be generated along with lipid. The review concludes with the analysis of the economics of microalgal lipid extraction using passive disruption methods and compares with the processes incorporating cell lysis steps. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Techno-economic models for three plants in Queensland, Australia using thermochemical conversion of 10 tonnes per hour of sugarcane bagasse to liquid crude biofuels were developed. Thermochemical conversion was chosen to maximise yield from second-generation feedstock. The process models highlighted the differences in mass and energy flows of each process. Factory models were generated reflecting current methods in heat and material recovery. Liquefaction generated the highest amount of product per kg feed, followed by pyrolysis and gasification. Key parameters affecting plant economics were also highlighted. Based on net present values, the profitability was ranked as follows: pyrolysis > liquefaction > gasification. The plants were all sensitive to product price, thermochemical conversion ratio and refining conversion ratio, thereby affecting profitability the most. Conversion ratios sharply affect the minimum selling price of products, but attenuated by high product volumes. Varying tax rates and capital costs do not affect the minimum selling price as much as conversion ratios, therefore, incentives around improving conversion rates and increasing product volume are recommended. © 2019

AB  - Biomass conversion into liquid products of interest for the fuel formulations has been draw remarkable attention to reducing the environmental pollution in the world. Biofuels play an important key to mitigating climate changes from the development of sustainable processes. Drop-in biofuels are oxygen-free biofuels composed by liquid hydrocarbons obtained from renewable sources. In the present work, a screening with different catalysts was performed for soybean oil deoxygenation. The niobium phosphate catalyst (NbOPO4) showed a great performance in the production of drop-in fuels in different conditions of reaction. The hydrocarbon yields are in the range of 76–90% (wt%). The redox and acid properties of NbOPO4 led to the simultaneous formation of bio-hydrocarbons, such as linear (38%) and branched alkanes (14%), cycloalkanes (1%), olefins (1%) and aromatics (36%) compounds. NbOPO4 exhibits higher selectivity to bio-jet fuel (58%), followed by green diesel (37%) and biogasoline (21%). This sustainable route to produce bio-hydrocarbons brings a process using N2 gas instead of H2 gas. This is an innovative, sustainable, efficient, safe and low-cost technology with great potential for industry application. © 2019

AB  - Second generation biodiesel, so-called bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD), can be produced from hydrotreatment of vegetable oils. The hydrogenation (HDO) of oleic acid and palmitic acid as model compounds of palm oil over unsupported Ni-Mo and Co-Mo sulfide catalysts was performed in a Parr reactor to produce BHD. The effects of reaction parameters: temperature, hydrogen pressure and the atomic ratio of catalysts (Ni/(Ni + Mo) or Co/(Co + Mo)) on the conversion and product yields (mainly n-C15, n-C16, n-C17 and n-C18 hydrocarbons) were evaluated. The results show that the high pressure favored HDO pathway, while high temperature strongly affected the decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways. At optimal conditions for oleic acid HDO, the efficient catalyst was NiMoS2 catalyst (Ni/(Ni + Mo) = 0.2) which gave high oleic acid conversion (100%), n-C18 selectivity (78.8%) and n-C18 yield (70.3%) whereas, for palmitic acid HDO, NiMoS2 catalyst (Ni/(Ni + Mo) = 0.2) also gave high palmitic acid conversion (95.2%), n-C16 selectivity (78.5%) and n-C16 yield (65.6%). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Wheat straw, the most abundant lignocellulosic biomass in China, is rich in cellulose that can be hydrolyzed and then converted into biofuels, such as bioethanol and biohydrogen. However, the accessibility of cellulose and the enzyme activity are greatly reduced in the presence of lignin. This significantly increases the enzyme cost in the saccharification, which hampers industrial production of lignocellulosic biofuels. In this study, a laccase treatment system mediated by 1-hydroxybenzotriazole was employed to modify and degrade lignin to enhance subsequent enzymatic saccharification of wheat straw. A kinetic model considering enzyme adsorption on lignin was proposed to estimate the saccharification performance. Results: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses showed that the peak intensity of lignin structure characteristics significantly changed after laccase-mediated system (LMS) treatment. 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses indicated that the aromatic ether bonds were cleaved and that guaiacyl (G) was oxidized after LMS treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses suggested that the crystallinity of lignocellulose increased due to the partial degradation of lignin. As a result, the nonproductive adsorption of the enzyme on lignin was reduced by 28%, while the reducing sugar yield increased by 26%. A semi-empirical kinetic model was used to estimate the reducing sugar yield, the initial hydrolysis rate (K M ) and deactivation rate coefficient (α) of LMS-pretreated wheat straw were 0.157 (h-1) and 0.214 (h-1), respectively. The model showed high accuracy (predicting error &lt; 10%) for describing the behavior of laccase-treated wheat straw hydrolysis when the solid loading is &lt; 5%. Conclusions: The adsorption ability of the enzyme to lignin was reduced after LMS pretreatment. Physicochemical analyses showed that the chemical groups of lignin and lignocellulose were changed, with the crystallinity of the lignocellulose increasing after LMS treatment. A semi-empirical kinetic model was proposed to estimate the reducing sugar yield, which showed high accuracy for predicting the hydrolysis performance of laccase-treated wheat straw. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Advanced third generation biofuels like pyrolysis oil generated from waste biomass paves way for a cleaner and sustainable environment. An experimental-cum-statistical analysis was performed with the aim of determining the optimal engine operating conditions (with respect to compression ratio, load and fuel blend) to enhance the engine operating characteristics (performance and emission) of a diesel engine. Multiple regression models designed by using response surface methodology (RSM) for the output response variables like brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), oxides of carbon (CO&amp;CO2), hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and smoke opacity were found to be statistically significant by analysis of variance. Optimization was carried out using desirability approach with a target of maximizing BTE and CO2 simultaneously by minimizing all other responses. From the results, it can be observed that the optimum conditions for bio-oil operation were 18:1 compression ratio, 20% fuel blend and 100% load. The models developed by RSM were validated through confirmatory experiments and found that the models were satisfactory to report the influence of compression ratio, load and bio-oil concentration on the operating characteristics of the diesel engine as the error in prediction is within 5%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated the production of cellulolytic enzymes from different agricultural residues. The crude enzyme extract produced was characterized and applied for saccharification of some agricultural residues. Maximum cellulolytic activities were obtained using soybean hulls. All enzymatic activities were highly stable at 40 °C at a pH range of 4.5–5.5. For stability at low temperatures, the enzyme extract was stored at freezing temperature and cooling for about 290 days without major loss of activity. The Km values found for total cellulase (FPase), endoglucanase (CMCase), and xylanase were 19.73 mg ml−1, 0.65 mg ml−1, and 22.64 mg ml−1, respectively, and Vmax values were 0.82 mol min−1 mg−1, 0.62 mol min−1 mg−1, and 104.17 mol min−1 mg−1 to cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and xylan, respectively. In the saccharification tests, the total amount of total reducing sugars (TRS) released from 1 g of soybean hulls catalyzed by the enzymes present in the crude enzyme extract was 0.16 g g−1 dry substrate. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, production of biodiesel from palm oil mill effluent (POME) using immobilized Candida rugosa lipase was optimized using Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized parameters chosen were methanol/POME ratio, reaction time, weight of the immobilized beads and agitation speed. The highest yield of both palmitic acid methyl esters (PAME) and oleic acid methyl ester (OAME) was obtained at the following optimum conditions; agitation speed (300 rpm), oil/methanol molar ratio (1:6), incubation period (5 h) and weight of the immobilized beads weight (2 g). The important fuel properties of the biodiesel such as flash point, kinematic viscosity, water and sediment and copper strip corrosion were evaluated according to the American Society for Testing of Materials (ASTM D6751) and European Standard (EN 14214) and were found to be in good agreement with the standard quality and specification. © 2018

AB  - Fish oil is a sustainable, abundant, and low-cost raw material, as it is extracted from fish processing waste. This work suggests that fish oil is appropriate for biodiesel production and evaluates its potential through ethyl esters (EE). Initially, fish oil showed an acid value of 10.86 ± 0.05 mg KOH g−1. But after a neutralization reaction, the acid value was reduced to 0.68 ± 0.01 mg KOH g−1. Alkaline transesterification reactions were performed on a laboratory scale, using a central composite rotational design with three variables and a triplicate over the center point. We studied the appropriate concentrations of ethanol and catalysts, and the temperature that provide the best EE yield. The results showed the optimal condition is with 0.7% of a NaOH catalyst, a temperature of 54 °C, and an ethanol:oil molar ratio of 11.7:1. In such conditions, it was possible to acquire an EE yield of 96.4% with a low acid value of 0.32 ± 0.08 mg KOH g−1, which presented physicochemical properties consistent with the parameters by the Petroleum National Agency's (ANP). In the conditions studied, the results showed high levels of EE from the residual fish oil. This suggests that this raw material, rich in unsaturated fatty acid, can be beneficial for biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulose extracted from cornstalk was liquefied in supercritical organic solvents at different liquefaction parameters. Different organic solvents (methanol, ethanol and acetone) were used to disintegrate cellulose at different temperatures (240, 260, 280, 300 and 320 °C), reaction time (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min) and solvents dosage (0, 80, 120, 160 and 200 mL). The results showed that similar liquefaction characteristics of cellulose were observed in three different solvents. The larger bio-oil yield and smaller residue yield obtained from cellulose liquefaction in solvents were achieved under the suitable conditions (320 °C, 160 mL, 60–90 min), respectively. And the type of solvents was the main effect to the distribution of the composition of bio-oil. The dominant constituents of bio-oil that were produced in supercritical methanol was hydrocarbon, and ketones and esters were mainly produced in supercritical ethanol, whereas ketones compounds were primarily derived in supercritical acetone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, we provide detailed information on the change in product distribution and bio-oil quality during extended feeding of biomass derived fast pyrolysis vapors over ZSM-5. The effect of catalyst deactivation by coking on the resulting oil product characteristics was clarified in order to determine when the vapor upgrading should be stopped and the regeneration initiated. Obtaining a stable catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) oil while maintaining good energy recovery is important within the context of potential coprocessing of these oils with petroleum feedstocks via fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) or hydrotreatment of the whole CFP oil. Wheat straw derived fast pyrolysis vapors were upgraded in an ex-situ fixed bed reactor containing a steamed ZSM-5 catalyst at 500 °C. Oils were collected both for runs starting the upgrading over a fresh (or regenerated) catalyst and for runs which were continued over an increasingly coked zeolite. The oils were characterized for water content, elemental analysis, total acid number (TAN), chemical composition by gas chromatography mass spectrometry with flame ionization detection (GC-MS/FID), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), evaporation characteristics by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13 C NMR, and two-dimensional heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (2D HSQC) NMR. With increasing biomass-to-catalyst mass ratio (B:C), the yield of deoxygenated hydrocarbons decreased, accompanied by a breakthrough of primary pyrolysis vapors leading to an increasing organic liquid yield. The oxygen content of the condensed, phase separated oil fraction increased and the molar O/C ratio of 0.05 and TAN of 6 mg KOH/g for oil collected during B:C = 0-1.1 increased to O/C = 0.18 and TAN = 14 mg KOH/g for oil collected during B:C = 3.6-6.2. Oil produced at 90% reduced catalyst amount and B:C = 0-6.5 and 0-12.9 increased the carbon recovery into the oil product to 23% and 27%, respectively but led to an increase in O/C ratio from 0.18 to 0.22, thus approaching the noncatalytic reference case (SiC bed at 500 °C) of O/C = 0.24. Clear differences in the evaporation behavior of the collected oils were observed, with a shift to more volatile fractions and less charring for products obtained at low B:C ratio. Characterization of the upgraded oils with 13 C NMR and 1 H NMR indicated a clear enhancement of the aromatics content and a reduction of sugar and aldehyde compounds. The concentration of carbon within carbonyl, carbohydrates, and methoxy/hydroxyl groups was effectively reduced for oils obtained at low B:C ratios. Catalyst characterization was performed with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH 3 -TPD), N 2 and Ar-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). After steaming and four repeated upgrading/regeneration cycles corresponding to an accumulated B:C ratio of 40, the zeolite's concentration of strong acid sites measured by NH 3 -TPD (T des &gt; 275 °C) reduced from 0.43 mmol/g for the calcined version to 0.07 mmol/g and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area decreased from 468 to 385 m 2 /g. The hot gas filter upstream of the zeolite bed was found effective in preventing accumulation of potassium on the catalyst. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Switchable solvents with hydrophobicities that can be reversibly changed were evaluated as single solvents for oil extraction from wet biomass. Three switchable solvents, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA), N-ethylbutylamine (EBA), and dipropylamine, were used to extract oil from the undisrupted wet paste of harvested Chlorella sp. microalgae. The oil extraction yields for the three solvents were 13.6%, 12.3%, and 7.0%, respectively. However, single hydrophobicity solvents n-hexane and [Bmim][PF6] were unable to extract any oil, achieving yields of 0% and 0.7%, respectively. A parametric study was performed to evaluate the effects of temperature, cell disruption duration, and extraction duration on the effectiveness of oil extraction. The results were used to develop a statistical model to predict oil extraction effectiveness under different conditions. The switchable solvents were also evaluated in simultaneous extraction-reaction systems used to convert the oils extracted from wet microalgae into biodiesel. The use of enzymes was found to enhance the production yield of biodiesel by 33%. The highest biodiesel yield of 47.5% was achieved using DMCHA at 35 °C with a methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1 and a 30% enzyme loading employing a solvent program comprising 1-h cell disruption, 1-h extraction/reaction, and 1-h phase separation steps. The proposed strategy of using a single solvent for simultaneous extraction and reaction could substantially simplify biodiesel production from wet microalgae. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Safflower plant is a promising energy crop, which is compatible with arid and semi-arid climate conditions. This study is set to perform a techno-economic assessment of an integrated biorefinery located in Iran, using safflower seed and safflower straw as feedstock for production of bioethanol as the main product, biodiesel as the most valuable byproduct while biogas, glycerol, solid residue, and sodium sulfate are the other valuable byproducts. In the first Scenario (A), glucose, xylose, and arabinose are fermented into ethanol by using Zymomonas mobilis produced in a seed train unit. While in the other Scenario (B), Saccharomyces cerevisiae is supplied externally by a yeast production facility and is used to ferment glucose into ethanol. Both scenarios are simulated using Aspen Plus software and a cash flow analysis is performed using well-known economic indices for the biofuel industry presented by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The profitability index is 1.14 for Scenario A, showing its cost-effectiveness. However, this index is found to be 0.81 for Scenario B, revealing the fact that this approach is not economically-justified for implementation. More specifically, the use of Z. mobilis instead of S. cerevisiae as fermenting microorganism enhances the profitability of the project by lowering ethanol production cost from 0.12 $/L to 0.09 $/L and minimum ethanol selling price from 0.67 $/L to 0.43 $/L. Moreover, in both scenarios, biodiesel production boosts the total annual sale values by 39% and 55% for scenario A and B, respectively. In general, 1.86 and 2.44 times improvements in this economic index are respectively obtained for scenario A and B because of byproduct credits. The outcomes of sensitivity analysis also shows that the discount factor and safflower seed price have large impacts on the profitability of the developed biorefineries. Overall, Z. mobilis appears to be a preferred biocatalyst for bioethanol fermentation through the biorefinery platform from the techno-economic viewpoint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work comparatively studied the catalytic effect of MgO and MgCO3 on pyrolysis of rice husk (RH). The apparent activation energy (E) was reduced significantly by pyrolysis of RH with MgCO3, thus lowering the decomposition temperature during pyrolysis. MgO could not obviously influence the gas evolution during pyrolysis, while MgCO3 had a better performance on the syngas (H2 and CO) generation at around 600–700 °C. Also, the generation of CO2 was suppressed by the RH pyrolysis with MgCO3. The phenols were the dominant compounds in the bio-oil derived from RH. Furthermore, co-pyrolysis of RH and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the presence of MgO or MgCO3 at 600 °C could improve the oils quality by decreasing the acids content and increasing the hydrocarbons content. Particularly, the resulting oils had high hydrocarbons content (&gt;35%) and low acids content (&lt;2%). The decrease of acids, alcohols, and phenols contributed to the increase of hydrocarbons. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to enhance the quality of biofuel through microwave torrefaction pretreatment for lignin. Low density polyethylene (LDPE) was added as a hydrogen source during microwave co-pyrolysis along with the microwave-torrefied lignin (MTL). The thermal degradation behavior and kinetic study of MTL co-pyrolysis with LDPE by microwave-assisted heating was investigated as well. The results indicated that the hydrocarbon content in the bio-oil obtained from microwave co-pyrolysis of MTL and LDPE increased significantly (about 80%). It was also noticed that the aromatic hydrocarbon content increased from 1.94% to 22.83% with the addition of LDPE. Thermal behavior analysis and reaction kinetic study showed that the addition of LDPE into MTL had the effect of promoting thermal degradation and improving reaction rate during microwave-assisted pyrolysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article presents the full study (lab-scale experimental study and large-scale techno-economic analysis) results of a two-step catalytic process for the conversion of organic waste–derived butyric acid to butanol. The two-step process consists of the (1) esterification of butyric acid to methyl butyrate and (2) hydrogenolysis of this methyl butyrate to butanol. The first reaction, esterification of butyric acid, was optimized using carbon-based catalysts. The production of butanol from methyl butyrate via hydrogenolysis was investigated using bimetallic Pt–Co catalysts. The hydrogenolysis of methyl butyrate on these catalysts under optimal conditions of 250 °C, 5 MPa H2, and a feed/catalyst weight ratio of 11.2 led to 54.1% selectivity toward 1-butanol. Based on the experimental results, an integrated process simulation model was developed to determine the economic potential of the two-step production of butanol from butyric acid. Using this model, the techno-economic feasibility of the two-step process was analyzed. The minimum selling price (MSP) of 1-butanol produced from butyric acid using this process was US$ 3.388 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE). This MSP is in the range of recent biofuel market prices of US$ 2.03/GGE to US$ 3.83/GGE. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The green utilization of biomass waste and its eco-friendly conversion into biofuels and value-added chemicals play a crucial role in resolving energy demand and environmental pollution. Herein, we report a win-win strategy to utilize biomass waste to fabricate functional materials and then transform biomass-derived source into valuable products. We developed a one-step strategy using the green solvent CO2 deposition method to spatially confine monometallic Pd and Pt and bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles in a porous carbon fabricated from biomass waste sorghum at a very low temperature of 40-70 °C. The synthesized monometallic Pd and Pt and bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles display superior performance in the selective conversion of biomass-based furfural into fine chemicals, furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. With only 3 wt % Pd or 3 wt % Pt supported on the synthesized porous carbon, these catalysts are far superior to the commercial 5 wt % Pd or Pt on carbon support, respectively. The turnover number of the as-prepared 3 wt % Pd/C catalyst shows ∼7 times improvement compared with the commercial 5 wt % Pd/C. This study provided a one-step method to precisely confine monometallic Pd and Pt and bimetallic Pd-Pt in the porous channel of the carbon support, offered more catalytic active sites, and presented excellent performance and high stability. The methodology developed in this work is promising for the synthesis of various metallic nanoparticles and valorization of biomass. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Effect of combined pretreatment on the mechanism of pyrolysis behavior and pyrolysis products (bio-oil, non-condensable gas and char) of rice husk was investigated using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor. A coupling method combining iso-conversional method and model-fitting method was used to obtain the pyrolysis kinetic parameter. Pyrolysis kinetics results indicated that activation energy (E) gradually increased with the increase of conversion rate (α), which was due to the differences in thermal stability of biomass components. Acid washing pretreatment slightly increased the average activation energy (Ea), and then subsequent torrefaction process further increased it. The entire pyrolysis reaction process of all the rice husk samples can be described by the reaction-order model. In addition, a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor was used to investigate the yields and detailed characteristics of pyrolysis products. The results suggested that phenols and sugars contents in bio-oil increased, while that of small-molecule components with high thermal instability decreased, which was favor for the storage and subsequent utilization of bio-oil. Rice husk char obtained from pyrolysis also has the potential for preparation of silica products. We concluded that combined pretreatment of washing and torrefaction significantly improved the thermochemical utilization potential of rice husk for fuels and chemicals by pyrolysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Novel sulfonated magnetic solid acid catalysts (ZrFe-SA-SO3H) with both Bronsted and Lewis sites were synthesized, which provided both a high density of surface acidity (4.4–8.4 mmol/g) and considerable magnetization (3.7–8.1 Am2/kg). The synthesized catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis, XRD, ICP-OES, FT-IR, BET, SEM-EDX, TEM, TG-DSC, VSM and Boehm titration. The prepared catalysts were tested in the esterification of oleic acid, with high yields of biodiesel (92.7–99.5%) for the first catalytic cycle at 90 °C for 4 h. A High biodiesel yield of 90.3% was still achieved after five cycles of Zr1.0Fe1.0-SA-SO3H. A similar situation was also observed when using sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to replace SA during catalyst preparation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the catalytic co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over faujasite-type zeolite derived from electric arc furnace slag (FAU-EAFS) in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of reaction temperature, catalyst-to-feedstock ratio, and HDPE-to-SCB ratio on product fractional yields and chemical compositions were discussed. The co-pyrolysis of SCB and HDPE over FAU-EAFS increased the liquid yield and enhanced the quality of bio-oil. The maximum bio-oil (68.56 wt%) and hydrocarbon yield (74.55%) with minimum yield of oxygenated compounds (acid = 0.57% and ester = 0.67%) were achieved under the optimum experimental conditions of catalyst-to-feedstock ratio of 1:6, HDPE-to-SCB ratio of 40:60, and temperature of 500 °C. The oil produced by catalytic co-pyrolysis had higher calorific value than the oil produced by the pyrolysis of SCB alone. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to obtain the N-containing organics from cellulose under mild conditions, hydrothermal liquefaction of cellulose in the presence of ammonia was conducted in this study. The results showed that the increasing reaction temperature and prolonging time facilitated the conversion of cellulose in hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) with NH3·H2O and decreased the amount of solid residue. Reaction temperature showed more influence than reaction time on solid residue formation. The components of bio-oil were significantly affected by reaction temperature and reaction time. Electrospray ionization-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) provided an insight for understanding the distribution of the different kinds of N-heterocycle compounds in the bio-oil. The possible reaction pathway of N-heterocycle compounds formation from cellulose during hydrothermal liquefaction with NH3·H2O was proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The issue of sustainability assessment of biodiesel production has increasingly gained importance due to the interest of governments in drawing up sovereignty strategies, to diversify their energy matrix and to determine the impact of biofuels production. In this context, this work proposes a system dynamics model to assess biodiesel production in a specific context. A System Dynamics model was developed and applied to assess the sustainability of the conditions in the baseline scenario of biodiesel production in Colombia. Simulation of current biodiesel production showed that a strong support from government policies is required related to the promotion of an increase of the contents of biodiesel in the biodiesel-diesel blend, as well as of the production capacity. Certain dynamics were observed as a result of the modeling, the increase oil palm cultivation, can be related to a lesser rate of displacement of the population, of poverty and of emissions of pollutants affecting air quality (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter). Results also predicted that the increase in oil palm cultivation under baseline scenario could boost inequitable distribution of land ownership and increase greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) in palm oil cultivation, and reduce food security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of robust electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of guaiacol and related lignin model monomers is necessary for the stabilization or upgrading of bio-oil. Additionally, the efficiency of biomass conversion to bio-oil products remains below the minimum requirements for its implementation at scale. Herein, a PtNiB/CMK-3 catalyst with pronounced ECH performance in the conversion of guaiacol and related model lignin monomers to bio-oil under optimally mild conditions, through a modulation strategy that modified the electronic structure of PtNi via boron alloying, is prepared. Notably, the optimized PtNiB/CMK-3 exhibited an inspiring high faradaic efficiency of 86.2%, which is significantly higher (13.7 times) than that of the PtNi/CMK-3 without B-doping (6.3%). Experimental results and theoretical calculations showed that the B-doping optimized the PtNiB alloy surface electron structure, simultaneously promoting substrate and intermediate adsorption and the ECH process. In addition, the uniform dispersion of PtNiB nanoparticles embedded within the mesoporous channels of CMK-3 ensures an enhanced utilization efficiency, leading to improvements in stability and bio-oil product generation. The lab-scale ECH experiment of guaiacol also certified the scale-up potential. This work opens a promising avenue to the rational design of advanced and highly efficient electrocatalysts for biomass upgrading. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The esterification of levulinic acid (LA) and ethanol into ethyl levulinate is an attractive biomass conversion process since the product EL has wide applications as food additive, fragrance and fuel. Herein, a metal-organic framework (MOF)-supported phosphomolybdic acid [Cu-BTC][HPM] was synthesized with 1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid, copper nitrate and phosphomolybdic acid in a one-step process at ambient temperature. The synthesized [Cu-BTC][HPM] was used for the catalytic esterification of levulinic acid to EL in ethanol, and showed excellent activity with a high EL yield close to 100% at 120 °C for 6 h, which should be ascribed to the uniform dispersion of HPM embedded in the MOF. The [Cu-BTC][HPM] catalyst could keep stable crystal structure and active component contents, and thus exhibited good stability in recycling process. © 2019

AB  - In this study, effects of different abiotic factors were studied on biomass and lipid yield of green microalga Chlorella minutissima (C. minutissima) Various concentrations of abiotic factors like nitrogen, phosphorus, glucose, iron, zinc, different values of pH, temperature, light intensity and different photoperiods were observed on the biomass growth and lipid yield of C. minutissima cultivated with modified CHU-13 medium. Initially, three cultivation media namely, Bold’s basal medium (BBM), modified CHU-13 and blue-green-11 (BG-11) were used to culture C. minutissima in batch mode. Microalga cultivated with modified CHU-13 medium resulted in maximum biomass and lipid yield of 970 ± 0.21 and 356.63 ± 0.51 mg/L, respectively. To maximize biomass and lipid yield of microalga further, it was cultivated with modified CHU-13 medium and variation of above mentioned abiotic factors was done. Different biomass and lipid yields were achieved for different abiotic factors varied. Highest biomass of 1840.49 ± 0.62 mg/L was achieved with 12 g of glucose containing medium and highest lipid yield of 579.86 ± 0.76 mg/L was achieved with 0.3 g of nitrogen containing medium. GC-MS analysis of biodiesel obtained from C. minutissima biomass cultivated with modified CHU-13 medium shown the presence of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, C20:0, C20:1 and C22:0. Properties of biodiesel obtained from C. minutissima were found in compliance with ASTM-6751-02 and European biodiesel standards EN14214. These results suggest that C. minutissima can be used as a potential biodiesel feedstock for microalgal biodiesel production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fossil derived fuels available for application within the maritime sector have been dominated by heavy fuel oil (HFO), which is conventionally used in low speed (main) engines, and more refined fuels such as marine diesel oil (MDO), which is consumed in fast or medium speed engines. However, increasing fuel costs and regulatory pressure such as the restrictions placed on sulphur content have increased interest in the use of alternative fuels. A number of alternative fuels have been identified and may be viable for use within the maritime sector including straight vegetable oil (SVO) as an alternative to HFO in low speed engines, biodiesel to replace MDO/MGO in low to medium speed engines and bio-liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) in gas engines using LNG. The potential sources of biomass feedstocks, conversion pathways and technologies are identified. The key parameters limiting their potential application are examined, in particular, availability, technological development, technical integration, and operational consequences. A proposed solution to overcome these limitations is recommended. The effective implementation of these strategies will enable the more widespread use of biofuels in marine applications, significantly reducing emissions from ships and improving global air quality and also protecting the ecological environment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this study Scenedesmus abundans was used as a biosorbent material for removing hydrocarbons from simulated petroleum wastewater. Batch experiments resulted in the removal of 92.16% of hydrocarbons from simulated wastewater within 60 min. The spent biosorbent was converted to bio-oil through hydrothermal liquefaction process (HTL) at temperature range from 220 to 320 °C with 1 h holding time. Liquid hydrocarbons (bio-oil) yield was 43.4 wt% at 300 °C with 15 g of spent sorbent loading and possessed HHV of 39.10 MJ/Kg. Additionally the HTL wastewater (aqueous phase) was recycled as reaction medium and studied for its effects on bio-oil yield which increased till second cycle (47.91 wt%). HTL bio-char was employed as adsorbent to remove heavy metals from wastewater. It showed greater removal efficiency of 86.5% to Ni(II) ions. From the results it was concluded that the petroleum residues can be effectively recycled back into liquid hydrocarbons with simple waste management pathway. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass generates a liquid product, known as pyrolysis oil, that can be further processed into biofuels and value-added chemicals. During pyrolysis, cellulose and hemicelulose fractions are converted into a range of water-soluble sugar derivatives, for which several valorisation strategies exist. On the other hand, lignin is broken down into so-called pyrolytic lignin, a water-insoluble complex mixture of aromatic oligomers that requires different upgrading strategies than the sugar rich fraction. Here, we report an experimental study on the valorisation of pyrolytic lignin via catalytic hydrotreatment in the absence of an external solvent. A variety of carbon-supported noble-metal heterogeneous catalysts were tested (Ru/C, Pd/C, Pt/C and Rh/C), as well as conventional hydrotreatment catalysts (sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3) to obtain valuable low molecular weight aromatic and phenolic compounds. Overall, depolymerized liquids were obtained with organic yields of up to 63 wt%. Pd/C was shown to be the best catalyst, yielding 59 wt% of monomers based on the organic product (i.e. 33 wt% based on pyrolytic lignin intake). While noble metal catalysts favored higher monomer yields, though with some over-reduction of aromatic rings to saturated hydrocarbons, sulphided catalysts were more efficient in deoxygenation and aromatization reactions, but yielded less monomers. The hydrocracking efficiency was shown to be strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. Based on the experimental data, a global reaction network is proposed. The high monomer yields reveal the potential of catalytic hydrotreatment for the upgrading of pyrolytic lignin into valuable phenolics and aromatics. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Deoxygenation and molecular structural modification is a critical step before the practical application of triglycerides in aviation biofuels. For low quality waste triglycerides with high viscosity, traditional way of direct hydrogenation usually has problems such as catalyst deactivation and pipe clogging. Herein, we demonstrate a facile catalytic biorefinery process for high viscosity waste triglycerides for the production of aviation biofuels via a two-step catalytic conversion. Several typical plant oils (soybean and rubber seed oils) and waste triglycerides (waste cooking and acidified plant oils) are tested, which indicate that this approach is widely applicable, and can be used to produce aviation range products, linear hydrocarbons, at high yields (55%–60%), accompanied by a diesel range fuel of 15%–40% by adjusting the operation parameters. The aviation range hydrocarbons are further catalyzed by an Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst to achieve aromatization and hydrogenation in a one-pot synthesis. Three dominant components existing in aviation fuels, including chain hydrocarbons, aromatics and cycloalkanes, can be obtained, which present the same physical-chemical properties and components as petroleum-based aviation fuels. The proportion of the three main components can be modified by the amount of molecular sieve catalyst and the initial pressure of H 2 , in order to meet the requirements of variable-grade aviation fuels. Overall, a catalytic refining process of decarboxylation and molecular structural modification of low quality waste triglycerides for the entire/total substitution of petroleum aviation fuels from waste triglyceride is reported. © 2019

AB  - This manuscript describes the research and development undertaken at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory subsequent to an earlier bio-oil hydrotreating historical development review in 2007. It also includes the implications for future development needs related to hydroprocessing of biomass fast pyrolysis bio-oil for liquid hydrocarbon fuels production. The results of the research, the needs and implications for additional research and development, as well as the future potential for technology transfer to industrial application are included. The progress over the 10 years of research can be captured by the technoeconomic assessment in the reduction in cost of the product by nearly 80% of the starting assessment. Design catalyst lifetime was extended from <10 days to half a year through improvements in operational details such as catalyst formulations and operating temperatures, with introduction of sulfur guard beds (with regeneration protocols) to protect precious metal catalyst in the low-temperature stabilization bed, as well as the recycle of the heavy ends of the hydrotreated product back to the hydrotreater for product finishing. Attempted operation of an ebullated bed reactor system was unsuccessful but enlightening as to the complex phase structure experienced in bio-oil hydrotreating. © 2019

AB  - Camellia Oleifera Shell (COS) is a kind of renewable lignocellulose resource and contains abundant hemicelluloses. In this work, the hemicelluloses in COS were extracted by alkali treatment and precipitated by ethanol with different concentration. Thermal pyrolysis kinetics of COS hemicelluloses were investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer at the heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 °C/min based on Coats-Redfern, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) model. The results showed that the best fitting thermal pyrolysis mechanism of COS hemicelluloses was one-dimensional diffusion reaction analyzed by Coats-Redfern model. The activation energies of COS hemicelluloses ranged from 175.07 to 247.87 kJ·mol−1 and from 174.74 to 252.50 kJ·mol−1 calculated by FWO and KAS, respectively. The thermal stabilities of COS hemicelluloses were enhanced with the precipitated ethanol concentration increasing, and reflected by thermodynamic parameters ΔH, ΔG and ΔS. This study may provide basic theoretical supports for the thermochemical conversion of COS hemicelluloses. © 2019

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fueling methyl ester derived from green algae species, Chlorella emersonii in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes Chlorella emersonii methyl ester (CEME) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in freshwater, marine and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. CEME was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single cylinder diesel engine at a constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion and emission (regulated and unregulated) characteristics. Test results indicated that, the characteristics of 20% CEME+80% DIESEL fuel blend was in par with neat DIESEL fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, THC (total hydrocarbon), CO (carbon monoxide) and smoke emissions. However, CEME blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and NO x (oxides of nitrogen) emissions. In terms of unregulated emissions, CEME blends in DIESEL showed lowered toluene and acetaldehyde emissions. However, acetone and formaldehyde emissions increased with higher percentage of CEME in DIESEL blend. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of CEME were comparatively lower than DIESEL fuel. Overall, it can be concluded that B20 (20% CEME +80% DIESEL fuel) blend can be a positive variant feedstock and it can be utilized in an unmodified diesel engine with minimal tailpipe emissions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this work, we investigated the deactivation of a commercial ZSM-5 based catalyst during ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). The experimental runs were carried out in a novel cascade dual fluidized bed reactor system where thermal pyrolysis of biomass was carried out in the first reactor, while ex situ catalytic conversion of the pyrolysis vapours was carried out in the second reactor. Consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles were realised using the same catalyst batch in order to evaluate catalyst deactivation over time. A comparison between in situ and ex situ CFP revealed that in contrast to what was observed in the case of in situ CFP, no accumulation of biomass-derived metals on the catalyst was observed during ex situ CFP. Both acidity and surface area were less affected compared to in situ CFP and the catalyst maintained higher activity. Product distribution and composition exhibited some variation over time which was attributed to the accumulation of biomass ash in the pyrolysis reactor and not to the poisoning of the catalyst bed. These results clearly demonstrated that ex situ CFP is an effective way to avoid catalyst poisoning during the CFP of biomass and to prolong catalyst lifetime. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Present work demonstrates the pyrolysis of sagwan sawdust for the production of bio-oil and biochar. Thermal degradation characteristics of sawdust by thermo-gravimetric analyzer revealed different zones of degradation. The effects of temperature, nitrogen flow rate and packed bed height were observed and optimized using response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design. For both cases, the quadratic model proved non-linear behaviour of the model response. Co-efficient of determination (R2) value for bio-oil and biochar yield was 0.9905 and 0.9975, respectively justifying excellent fitting of the model. Optimum yield (bio-oil and biochar) were obtained as 48.7083 and 25.5627 wt. %, respectively at the temperature of 640 °C, packed bed height of 8 cm and nitrogen flow rate of 180 mL/min. Presence of various organic compounds and chemicals were confirmed by GC-MS, FTIR analysis and physicochemical analysis described the fuel characteristics. Also, biochar was characterized by proximate and ultimate analysis, HHV, BET, FTIR and SEM-EDX. The above results revealed the utility of bio-oil as engine fuel or source of valuable chemicals. The HHV, porous nature of biochar along with high BET surface area and valuable nutrients indicates its utility as solid fuel, as an adsorbent or in soil amendment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oleaginous yeasts have emerged as a sustainable source of renewable oils for liquid biofuels. However, biodiesel production from them has a few constraints with respect to their cell disruption and lipid extraction techniques. The lipid extraction from oleaginous yeasts commonly includes dewatering and drying of cell biomass, which requires energy and time. The aim of this work was to establish a process for the lipid extraction from wet biomass applying acid catalyzed hot water, as well as microwave, and rapid ultrasonication-microwave treatment together with the conventional Bligh and Dyer method. In the wake of testing all procedures, it was revealed that rapid ultrasonication-microwave treatment has great potential to give high lipid content (70.86% w/w) on the cell dry weight basis. The lipid profile after treatment showed the presence of appropriate quantities of saturated (10.39 ± 0.15%), monounsaturated (76.55 ± 0.19%) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (11.49 ± 0.23%) which further improves biodiesel quality compared to the other methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of using rapid ultrasonication-microwave treatment for the lipid extraction from wet oleaginous yeast biomass in the literature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Green technologies have emerged as useful tools for the generation of clean fuels with the potential to minimize the effect of human activity on the environment. Currently, these fuels are mainly composed of hydrocarbons obtained from crude oil. Over the past two decades, biomass has gained significant attention as a renewable feedstock for more sustainable biofuel production and has been a great candidate to replace fossil fuels. The principal components of most of the available biomass are cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin. Although the available green technologies for biofuel production are progressing rapidly, productivity and chemical yield from these techniques are still below the required values. Therefore, there is a need for interdisciplinary studies to meet the requirements for more global and efficient production by streamlining processes, integrating technologies and achieving techno-economic improvements. In this context, we aim to give an overview of available biomass such as agricultural wastes suitable for the generation of different classes of biofuels including next-generation biofuels. Unfortunately, expensive, wasteful and energy-consuming pretreatment processes are still used. Therefore, novel technologies that allow a more efficient separation with low resource consumption and the generation of a low number of residues are required. In this regard, novel technologies such as efficient fractionation techniques and genetic and metabolic engineering including the application of CRISPR/Cas tools, as well as microfluidic platforms to improve the overall yield of biofuel production are discussed. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A catalyst comprising highly-efficient and magnetically-separable bimetallic ZnO and Co nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on N-doped carbon nanotubes (ZnO/Co@N-CNTs) was synthesized by the direct calcination of the bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazolate framework (Zn/Co-ZIF) for the effective hydrogenation (HD) and hydrodeoxygenation (HD) of lignin and its derived species. During the calcination of Zn/Co-ZIF, Zn was dislocated from the framework to the particle surface to form amorphous ZnO NPs and metallic Co NPs, which activated the growth of the N-CNTs. Because of the highly Lewis acidic amorphous ZnO, high HD/HDO ability of metallic Co NPs, and high wettability of the N-CNT, an almost complete conversion of vanillin into its corresponding deoxygenated species, creosol, was achieved in an aqueous medium without the production of byproducts under mild reaction conditions (150 °C, 0.7 MPa H2, a reaction time of 2 h). When kraft lignin and bio-oil derived from concentrated strong acid hydrolysis lignin were converted over ZnO/Co@N-CNTs, high degrees of deoxygenation of 74.2% and 34.4%, respectively, could be achieved at 350 °C, 5.0 MPa H2, and a reaction time of 6 h in water. A detailed chemical composition analysis of the deoxygenated bio-oil revealed that cyclohexanone and its alkyl group-substituted derivatives were the major species. To gain insight into the HD/HDO mechanisms, various types of lignin-derived monomers (syringaldehyde, acetovanillone, acetosyringone, 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol, cinnamaldehyde, isoeugenol) and holocellulose-derived monomers (furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural), different types of catalysts, and various reaction parameters were tested. The mild reaction conditions, use of a non-noble metal catalyst, and use of water as the solvent make it possible to develop a cost-effective, easy to scale up, and environmental-benign process for biofuel and biochemical production. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this research, Oenothera lamarckiana seed oil (OLO) has been investigated as a novel feedstock for biodiesel production in Iran. Ripe shrubs of Oenothera lamarckiana were collected from farms in Kohgiluyeh and Boyerahmad (around city of Yasouj) and seeds were extracted after drying of the stems. Then oil was extracted by a chemical method (Soxhlet extraction system). A maximum oil content of 26% has been found by chemical method extraction. Physical and chemical characteristics of Oenothera lamarckiana oil (OLO) have been investigated. Biodiesel has been prepared using Ultrasonic set-up. By using the response surface methodology (RSM), the biodiesel production process was optimized to obtain the highest yield of biodiesel conversion. In this research, reaction parameters such as molar ratio (methanol to oil), reaction time, amplitude and pulse are studied. Moreover, the performance and the exhaust emissions of a diesel engine have been investigated. All of the experiments are performed at a constant speed of 2100 rpm at loads of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The results of research showed that the conversion of biodiesel was 92.06% under the optimized conditions of 7.73:1 M ratio (methanol to oil), amplitude of 62.59 (%), and 91.22 pulses for a reaction time of 9.65 min. Experimental engine test results indicated that by using the biodiesel-diesel blends, brake power, and concentrations of the CO2 and NOx emissions were increased, while the specific fuel consumption (SFC) and concentration of CO and HC emissions were decreased. Investigation of the properties of fuel, engine performance and emission parameters revealed that biodiesel from Oenothera lamarckiana oil complied with the limits prescribed in the ASTM D6751standards, and this seed oil can be introduced as a new feedstock for biodiesel production in Iran. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Efficient transformation of renewable biomass into chemicals and biofuels, including liquid biomass-derived nonedible oils to biodiesel, is of great importance. Developing heterogeneously functional materials is being deemed as a subject of particular interest to scientists in selective catalytic chemistry especially for biomass valorization. In this regard, porous polymers, featuring high surface areas, prominent stabilities, and chemically adjustable moieties, have attracted extensive concerns. In this Review, recent developments on the application of heterogeneously functionalized porous polymeric catalysts of high performance, including acid/base chemosynthetic organic polymers/natural biodegradable biopolymers like chitosan, organic-inorganic hybrid polymeric materials such as functional porous coordination polymers, and porous polymers immobilized with enzymes for effective upgrading of oil feedstocks into biodiesel are summarized. Catalytic protocols using functional polymeric catalysts provide significant benefits for realizing biorefinery procedures because of the following reasons: (i) no polluting reagents, (ii) high activities and selectivities, and (iii) simple and convenient catalyst recycling. Attention has been drawn, in particular, to understanding the role of acidity/basicity, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, swelling property, and porosity of polymer materials in biodiesel production through transesterification and esterification reactions. In addition, plausible reaction mechanisms are also depicted accordingly, while highlighting the main remaining challenges and future prospects. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis (MACP) of cellulose was carried out using modified HZSM-5 catalysts for bio-oil production. The catalysts of Fe/HZSM-5, Ni/HZSM-5 and Fe–Ni/HZSM-5 were developed and characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The bio-oil was characterized by the Fourier transform infrared analyzer (FTIR) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results showed that Fe/HZSM-5 enhanced the yields of bio-oil by 11.4% and decreased the coke by about 24% compared to HZSM-5 without modification. The saccharides in bio-oil disappeared and were totally converted into phenols and low molecular compounds with the catalysis of Fe–Ni/HZSM-5. Fe–Ni/HZSM-5 showed high selectivity of phenols (20.86%) in the bio-oil. It was a unique finding because usually phenols can only be obtained by the pyrolysis of lignin, not cellulose. The formation of phenols from MACP of cellulose was probably caused by the conversion of furans to aromatics in the pores of HZSM-5, and followed by further conversion of aromatics into phenols on the external surface of HZSM-5. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - Hydrochar microsphere as clean and facile carbon materials have great potentials to be used in biomass valorization for producing value-added chemicals. In this study, the hydrochars obtained from cellulose and xylan were prepared. The effect of hydrothermal conditions on hydrochars’ chemical composition, thermal stability and the porosity obtained from cellulose and xylan were evaluated. In order to explore the application of the hydrochar in biofuel production, the cellulose derived hydrochar supported Al catalyst (Al-Cel-HTC) was prepared by one-step hydrothermal process for catalysis glucose isomerization. We found distinct physicochemical properties between cellulose and xylan derived hydrochar. The specific surface area (SBET) of cellulose derived hydrochar (118 m2/g) is significantly higher than that of xylan derived hydrochar (28 m2/g). The hydrochars are composed of carbonaceous microspheres as evidenced by SEM. The catalytic performance of Al-Cel-HTC was investigated. Results shown that 77.8 mol/% selectivity of glucose to fructose can be obtained in aqueous by the catalyst. The SEM-EDS images of the catalyst shown the strong crystal-hydrochar microsphere interaction benifit in diminishing the agglomeration of hydrochar microsphere. The BET specific surface area and crystal structure (AlO(OH) and Al2O3) of hydrochar supported aluminum catalyst have positive correlation with the catalytic selectivity. © 2019

AB  - As lactate is a useful biomarker for evaluating conditions of the body and also has a high theoretical energy density as a fuel, enzymatic biofuel cells (BFCs) that utilize lactate as a fuel have received considerable attention. In this study, we have developed a high-power lactate/O2 BFC that comprises composite electrodes made from carbon cloth as a current collector and MgO-templated porous carbon as an electroenzymatic reaction field and enzyme support. The bioanode contains lactate oxidase as an enzyme and 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate as a redox mediator. The biocathode contains bilirubin oxidase as an oxygen reduction electrocatalyst and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as a mediator. To obtain an efficient gas diffusion biocathode, the hydrophobicity of the carbon cloth is modulated by modification with PTFE. The lactate/O2 BFC shows a maximum power density of 4.3 mW cm−2 at a lactate concentration of 300 mM. This high performance is promising for the development of BFCs for wearable applications. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol is one of the most important biofuels, yet its commercial production is hindered by the low-efficiency and high-cost bioconversion process. Here, we report a new chemocatalytic approach for the one-pot production of cellulosic ethanol. With a multifunctional Mo/Pt/WOx catalyst, cellulose is directly converted to ethanol in a one-pot reaction with a yield as high as 43.2 C%. Kinetic analysis reveals that such a one-pot process involves tandem catalysis from cellulose to ethylene glycol (rapid) followed by hydrogenolysis of ethylene glycol to ethanol (slow). Characterizations show that isolated and low-coordinated MoOx bonds to metallic Pt particles on the mesoporous WOx support, constituting xOMo–Pt–WOx interfacial sites, which offer high activity for C–O cleavage of ethylene glycol. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
Cellulosic ethanol is one of the most important biofuels, yet its commercial production is hindered by the low-efficiency and high-cost bioconversion process. In this work, a new chemocatalytic approach for the one-pot production of cellulosic ethanol is developed, by the use of a multifunctional Mo/Pt/WOx catalyst. Ethanol yield of more than 40% is obtained even when the raw biomass miscanthus is used, and the catalyst shows excellent resistance to CO poisoning and reasonably good recyclability. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
The increasing concerns over global climate change have motivated great interest in the utilization of renewable biomass for the production of fuels and chemicals. Among various platform and end-use products derived from biomass, cellulosic ethanol is the most important one. While great progress has been made in engineering microbes for biofuel production, the economically viable production of cellulosic ethanol remains a great challenge because of the recalcitrance of lignocellulose. In this contribution, we report the one-pot direct conversion of cellulose to ethanol with a yield of 43.2 C% over a multifunctional catalyst Mo/Pt/WOx, which effectively catalyzes the tandem reactions of cellulose to ethylene glycol and then to ethanol. The inherent advantages of a chemocatalytic process in continuous operation and scalability will make it a promising alternative to the current bioprocess. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a promising route for the upgrading of bio-oils to eco-friendly biofuel produced from lignocellulose. Herein, we report the sequential synthesis of a hybrid nanocatalyst CoxP@POP, where substoichiometric CoxP nanoparticles are distributed in a porous organic polymer (POP) via solid-state phosphidation of the Co3O4@POP nanohybrid system. We also explored the catalytic activity of the above two nanohybrids toward the HDO of vanillin, a typical compound of lignin-derived bio-oil to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, which is a promising future biofuel. The CoxP@POP exhibited superior catalytic activity and selectivity toward desired product with improved stability compared to the Co3O4@POP. Based on advanced sample characterization results, the extraordinary selectivity of CoxP@POP is attributed to the strong interaction of the cation of the CoxP nanoparticle with the POP matrix and the consequent modifications of the electronic states. Through attenuated total reflectance-infrared spectroscopy, we have also observed different interaction strengths between vanillin and the two catalysts. The decreased catalytic activity of Co3O4@POP compared to CoxP@POP catalyst could be attributed to the stronger adsorption of vanillin over the Co3O4@POP catalyst. Also from kinetic investigation, it is clearly demonstrated that the Co3O4@POP has higher activation energy barrier than the CoxP@POP, which also reflects to the reduction of the overall efficiency of the Co3O4@POP catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in POP-encapsulated cobalt phosphide catalyst synthesis and comprehensive study in establishing the structure-activity relationship in significant step-forwarding in promoting biomass refining. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the present study, the ultrasound–assisted biodiesel production from mixed feedstock of non–edible oils in presence of KI impregnated ZnO as a catalyst in batch reactor was investigated. The production was optimized by using two approaches (1) feedstock optimization and (2) process parameters optimization. Various non–edible oils at optimum volumetric ratio were blended and used as feedstock for transesterification reaction. Biodiesel yield was optimized by Box–Behnken statistical design. The maximum triglyceride conversion of 92.35 ± 1.08% was achieved at optimized conditions of catalyst loading = 7% (w/w); alcohol/oil molar ratio = 11.68:1 and reaction temperature = 59 °C. Transesterification process with mechanical agitation was used as base case for identification of role of sonication in the process. The transesterification process was analysed for kinetic behaviour using pseudo first order kinetics and Eley–Rideal mechanism based model. Overall activation energy of transesterification process for mechanically agitated and ultrasound–assisted systems was calculated as 135.4 and 123.65 kJ/mol, respectively. However, the sum of activation energies of three reaction steps of Eley–Rideal mechanism (64.69 kJ/mol and 46.63 kJ/mol, for mechanically agitated and ultrasound–assisted system, respectively) was much lower. This discrepancy is attributed to mass transfer limitations in the system, even in presence of sonication. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Macroalgae contain significant amounts of inorganic compounds (K, Na, Mg, and Ca) that cause problems during thermal processing (ash fouling or agglomeration of char and bed material). The macroalga Saccharina japonica (S.J) was demineralized with diluted acid solution to remove inorganic species before using this matter for fast pyrolysis in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor. The effect of acid washing on the product yield and the quality of bio-oil was systematically investigated. When the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 to 500 °C, the bio-oil yield was 39.70–45.36 wt%. The major compounds in the bio-oil were levoglucosan and di-anhydromannitol. The fractional catalytic pyrolysis of pre-treated S. japonica using HZSM-5 catalyst (calcined at 550 °C) was investigated in fluidized-bed reactor under the same conditions. Pyrolysis of the pretreated sample with catalyst resulted in 35.37–39.05 wt% liquid yield, which was lower than that from using silica sand. Using HZSM-5 catalytic pyrolysis bio-oil showed a decrease in dianhydromannitol and 2-furyl methyl ketone, and an increase in aromatic compounds such as derivatives of phenol, indole, and naphthalene. The effect of pretreatment by acid washing, and the effect of this catalyst on the pyrolysis product distribution and composition were clarified in relation to previous work. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil fuel depletion and the environmental concerns have been under discussion for energy production for many years and finding new and renewable energy sources became a must. Biomass is considered as a net zero CO2 energy source. Gasification of biomass for H2 and syngas production is an attractive process. The main target of this research is to improve the production of hydrogen and syngas from palm kernel shell (PKS) steam gasification through defining the optimal operating parameters’ using a modern optimization algorithm. To predict the gaseous outputs, two PKS models were built using fuzzy logic based on the experimental data sets. A radial movement optimizer (RMO) was applied to determine the system's optimal operating parameters. During the optimization process, the decision variables were represented by four different operating parameters. These parameters include; temperature, particle size, CaO/biomass ratio and coal bottom ash (CBA) with their operating ranges of (650–750 °C), (0.5–1 mm), (0.5–2) and wt% (0.02–0.10), respectively. The individual and interactive effects of different combinations were investigated on the production of H2 and syngas yield. The optimized results were compared with experimental data and results obtained from Response Surface Methodology (RSM) reported in literature. The obtained optimal values of the operating parameters through RMO were found 722 °C, 0.92 mm, 1.72 and 0.06 wt% for the temperature, particle size, CaO/biomass ratio and coal bottom ash, respectively. The results showed that syngas production was significantly improved as it reached 65.44 vol% which was better than that obtained in earlier studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sulfonic acid functional strong acidic catalysts are largely used in various chemical reactions. However, in many reactions with water as product, the catalytic activity and selectivity are unsatisfactory, because hydrophilic acid sites of SO3H would suffer from acidity decreasing and some hydrolysis side reactions would occur via water adsorption. Herein, a novel hydrophobic arenesulfonic acid functionalized biochar was successfully prepared for the first time by one-pot diazo reduction method of biochar with amino-arenesulfonic acid (such as, 4-aminbenzenesulfonic acid, 4-amino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 8-amino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-amino-3-hydroxy-1-naphthalenesulphonic acid). It has a large specific surface area of 200–400 m2/g, a hydrophobic network with water contact angle higher than 120° and a higher concentration of sulfonic acid over 1.0 mmol/g. Moreover, the hydrophobicity-oleophilicity and acidity are increased with the arene length and grafting amount of arenesulfonic acid. In the esterification reaction of fatty acid with methanol as well as the transesterification reaction of glycerol trioleate with methanol for the production of biodiesel, the sulfonated biochar shows a higher conversion of 96.7% for esterification and 86.3% for transesterification compared with amberlyst-15 (86.7%, 39.9%) and traditional sulfonation biochar-SO3H (27.4%, 32.6%). In the alkylation reaction of 2-methylfuran with cyclopentanone for the production of high-density biofuel, its catalytic efficiency with target product yield of 76.1% is higher than that of amberlyst-15 (50.2%) and traditional sulfonation biochar-SO3H (13.2%), because of its hydrophobicity and strong acidity. Furthermore, the catalyst is stable and shows an excellent cycle performance after 6 runs. The successful preparation of hydrophobic biochar-based acidic catalysts not only provides a new way for high-value utilization of biochar, but also eliminates the negative effect of water on many catalytic reactions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and optimization of co-digestion using sewage sludge (SS), maize straw (MS) and cow manure (CM) as feeds, and the effects of the mixing ratio and C/N ratio of the substrates were analyzed in detail. Among the three substrates tested, CM/MS exhibited better digestion than CM/SS and SS/MS in terms of all measures, including total daily biogas and net methane volume production, due to the hydrophilic characteristics and high level of biodegradability of CM, as well as its higher C/N ratio. The average biogas production was 613.8 mL/g VS for the co-digestion of CM/MS at a feed concentration of 15 g VS/L and using a 1:1 mixing ratio (C/N ratio of 28.3). The co-digestion of SS/CM/MS performed better than the individual digestion of the components because of the balanced C/N ratios and supply of carbon. The optimum conditions for maximizing methane potential were an SS:CM:MS ratio of 30:35:35 and a bulk VS concentration of 15.0 g VS/L, which led to a maximum methane production of 8047.31 mL (C/N ratio of 12.7). The high-throughput sequencing analysis showed clear differences in microbial communities during the entire co-digestion process. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of Ulva prolifera macroalgae (UM), an aquatic biomass, was carried out in an autoclave reactor at different temperature (270, 290 and 310 °C) and reaction holding time (10, 20 and 30 min.). The catalytic reactions of UM were carried out in the presence of three basic catalysts (KOH, NaOH and Na2CO3) with the different catalyst amount. Maximum bio-oil yield for non-catalytic liquefaction was (12.0 wt%) at 290 with 10 min reaction time. In the catalytic reaction the maximum bio-oil yield (26.7 wt%) was observed with KOH (0.1 g) catalyst. The chemical components and functional groups present in the bio-oils are identified by GC–MS, FT-IR, 1H-NMR, TGA and elemental analysis techniques. Majorly nitrogen containing compounds were found with catalytic reaction in bio-oils. The higher heating value (33.6 MJ kg−1) as well as the higher carbon content (64.2%) was observed in the case of catalytic liquefaction bio-oil. © 2019

AB  - Lipases from Candida antarctica B (nonspecific lipase) and Rhizomucor miehei (1,3-specific lipase) were simultaneously immobilized on epoxy functionalized silica gel under mild conditions. The results showed rapid and simple immobilization of 4–15 mg of CALB:RML (different ratios 4:1, 2:1, 1.5:1, 1:1) on 1 g of support after 6 h. The thermal stability of derivatives and also their stability in methanol were greatly improved compared to the single immobilized enzyme. All the derivatives were also used to catalyze the transesterification of palm oil with methanol to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Response surface methodology (RSM) and a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used to study the effects of five factors, reaction temperature, methanol/oil ratio, reaction time, t-butanol concentration and CALB:RML ratio on the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield. A quadratic polynomial equation was obtained for methanolysis reaction by multiple regression analysis. The optimum combinations for the reaction were CALB:RML ratio (2.5:1), t-butanol to oil (39.9 wt%), temperature (35.6 °C), methanol:oil ratio (5.9), reaction time 33.5 h. FAME yield of 78.3.5%, which was very close to the predicted value of 75.2%, was obtained. Verification experiment confirmed the validity of the predicted model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, macroalgae are widely discussed as advantageous alternative feedstock for crude bio-oil production using pyrolysis. In the present work, pyrolysis products of Enteromorpha clathrata washed with 7% phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid were studied. In general, washing with diluted acids resulted in significant increase in the yields of bio-oil and non-condensable gas over the control in favor of the bio-char. In addition, HCl pretreatment enhanced the relative contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil by 1.5 times over the control. Furthermore, HCl pretreatment showed 37% and 52.6% reduction in acids and oxygen-containing compounds, respectively, with respect to the control. FTIR analysis showed that acid-washing led to reduction in O–H stretching vibration, confirming that it can disrupt hydroxyl bonds reducing phenols, carboxylic acids and water impurities in the bio-oil. In conclusion, washing of biomass using diluted acids could play a key role to enhance the bio-oil yield and significantly influence products characteristics; particularly, HCl enhanced bio-oil yield with higher aliphatic hydrocarbons proportion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biofuels production from alternative and renewable raw materials is mandatory to achieve sustainable growth based on a bioeconomy. Eucalyptus bark is a waste generated during the chemical manufacturing of Eucalyptus pulp that can be used as an alternative source of biomass, suitable for the production of biofuels. In this work, Eucalyptus nitens bark (ENB) was fractionated by organosolv treatment for ethanol production. For that, a Doehlert experimental design was carried out to evaluate the dependent variables: temperature (170–200 °C), time (30–90 min) and ethanol-water percentage (50–80 %) on delignification of Eucalyptus bark. Organosolv process was suitable for the fractionation of E. nitens bark. After treatment, 74–93 % of glucan was recovered and 25–52 % of delignification was achieved. Delignified ENB was subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process for bioethanol production. The results showed that the variables temperature and time of organosolv process had significant influence on ethanol production. The organosolv pretreatment improved the ethanol yield from 32 to 99%. This work shows a suitable process for the valorization of Eucalyptus bark into bioethanol. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Supercritical methanol was used for one put biodiesel production from microalgae biomass. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) hydrocarbons, and oxygenates were produced in catalytic and non-catalytic procedures in the presence and absence of subcritical water. The CaO nanoparticles were synthetized using photochemical method on TiO2. Addition of catalyst and water to supercritical methanol could increase total product yield up to 51.6%, FAMEs yield up to 28.1%, hydrocarbons yield up to 2.5 times, and oxygenates yield up to 3.8 times. No CaO was detected in products and no color change occurred for product over time. The effects of catalysts and subcritical water on quality and quantity of products were described using reaction mechanisms. Accordingly, it can be proposed that water in subcritical condition dissolves cell wall of biomass and facilitates mass transfer of bio-oil to catalyst surface. In addition, it produces intermediates on catalyst surface that can accelerate FAMEs and oxygenates production. © 2019

AB  - In this study, three types of lignin feedstocks were introduced into the microwave assisted depolymerization process over solid acid catalysts. The effects of lignin structures, solvents and catalysts were investigated to improve bio-oil yields and properties. A common phenomenon was observed that the highest bio-oil yields were all obtained in methanol under optimal conditions with microwave heating. The highest bio-oil yield from alkaline lignin, dealkaline lignin and lignosulfonate was 57.4%, 82.9% and 70.9% respectively, all obtained in methanol. The promotional effect of methanol over HSZ-640 (or HSZ-660) in the depolymerization process was confirmed due to the higher polarity of methanol, and higher acidity of catalysts. The promotional effect on the elemental composition and HHV of bio-oil was observed, finding that HSZ-640 (or HSZ-660) exhibited to be effective to convert lignin to liquid fuels with higher HHV, and the HHV of obtained bio-oil increased to about 28–32 MJ/kg, confirming that hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation took place during the depolymerization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymatic production of biodiesel from waste cooking oils (WCOs)is expected as an efficient procedure for resolving the problems of energy demand and environment pollutions. But, high cost of lipases has been found as a main obstacle to commercialize the enzymatic transesterification. In the present study, cross-linked enzyme aggregates of Km12 lipases have been coupled with amino coated magnetite nanoparticles. SEM analysis showed that mCLEAs-lipase (mCLEAs-lip)nanocomposites have spherical structures. The mCLEAs-lip displayed a shift in optimal pH towards the alkaline, whereas optimal temperature was also shift towards low temperature. mCLEAs-lip nanocomposite reserves its total activity up to 6 cycles of enzyme re-using. Furthermore, it reserves 60% of its initial activity more than free enzyme after 24 days of incubation at 4 °C. Biodiesel production from waste cooking oils by immobilized enzyme increased about 20% more than free enzyme. Therefore, the present study displays great practical latent to produce renewable fuel such as biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technique of producing crude bio-oil (biocrude) from wet biomass. This work conducted the co-HTLs of microalgae (chlorella) and sewage sludge (SS) at 340 °C, 18 MPa, 0.3 MPa of initial H2 addition, 30 min of residence time under different feedstock mass ratios conditions, and explored the effects of three kinds of SS ashes on biocrude properties during microalgae HTL for the first time. Corresponding biocrude yields, elemental compositions, higher heating values, energy recoveries, boiling point distributions, and compound compositions were examined systematically. The results show that there was a certain synergistic effect on the improvement of biocrude yield other than biocrude quality in the co-HTL of microalgae and SS, especially at the 1:1 of mass ratio condition. This co-HTL could improve the actual biocrude yield by 4.7 wt% and decrease the actual solids yield by 3.6 wt% in contrast to corresponding theoretical yields. The pyrolysis-state SS ash could reduce the N and O contents, increase the C and H contents and HHV, and improve the proportion of low-boiling-point (&lt;250 °C) compounds in the biocrude from microalgae HTL, while the oxidation-state or reduction-state SS ash was able to increase biocrude yield by approximately 3.3 wt%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, the pyrolysis treatment of sewage sludge is studied in a fixed bed reactor at temperatures range of 400–600 °C. Meanwhile, the catalytic effect of Fe2O3 on the characteristics of the resulting gases, bio-oil and bio-char are also investigated. The experimental results indicate that the yields of gases and bio-oil respectively increase from 8.69 wt% and 32.54 wt% to 11.62 wt% and 38.74 wt%, and the char yield decreases from 58.77 wt% to 49.64 wt% during Fe-embedded sewage sludge pyrolysis when Fe2O3 is added equal to 5% in the dried sewage sludge. Meanwhile, Fe2O3 promotes the CO and H2 formation and inhibits the CH4 formation, while it exhibits no significantly effect on the composition of the bio-oil. Moreover, the bio-oil should be direct combustion for power generation due it contains higher oxygenated hydrocarbons. In addition, the bio-char exhibits good desulfurization activity. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - The utilization of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), an efficient thermochemical conversion technology, can produce biofuels from biomass, but also a large amount of processing wastewater. In the present paper, the aqueous phase from the HTL of Spirulina Platensis was recycled as the intermediate reactant and its effects on the bio-oil yield from the HTL of Spirulina Platensis, α-Cellulose, and Lignin were investigated. The results revealed that the best bio-oil yields obtained from HTL of Spirulina Platensis and α-Cellulose in pure water were 30 and 7.03 wt% at the optimized operation conditions. Aqueous phase obtained from HTL of Spirulina Platensis could be introduced return into HTL system and result in an obvious increase in the bio-oil yield by 10 wt% and 6 wt% from HTL of Spirulina Platensis and α-Cellulose, respectively. Energy recovery rates from bio-oil were improved greatly by applying aqueous phase recycling during HTL. However, aqueous phase recycling inhibited generation of bio-oil, suggesting the presence of the antagonistic reaction between protein aqueous and Lignin. Based on the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis of the aqueous phase and bio-oil, the possible reaction pathways were deduced. © 2019

AB  - Catalytic esterification of fatty acid with methanol, alkylation of 4-ethylphenol with benzyl alcohol as well as 2-methylfuran with cyclopentanone are of great significant for the production of biofuels. However, the in-situ produced water decreases the acidity of catalyst and induces side reaction, leading to an unsatisfactory catalytic activity and selectivity. Herein, a novel biochar-based hydrophobic benzenesulfonic acid is prepared for the first time by one-pot sulfonation method of biochar with 4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid. It has a large specific surface area of 100-400 m2/g, a hydrophobicity with H2O contact angle higher than 110° and a high concentration of sulfonic acid over 1.0 mmol/g. In the esterification reaction of fatty acid with methanol for synthesis of biodiesel, it shows a higher conversion of 96.0% than sulfonic acid resin amberlyst-15 (86.7%) and traditional sulfonated biochar-SO3H (28.0%). In the alkylation reaction of 4-ethylphenol with phenylmethanol/2-methylfuran with cyclopentanone for high-density bicyclic/monocyclic biofuel, its catalytic efficiency with target product yields are 69.4% and 70.5% respectively, which are also higher than that of amberlyst-15 (74.3%, 49.4%) and biochar-SO3H (14.7%, 13.0%). Furthermore, the catalyst is more stable than biochar-SO3H. The preparation of hydrophobic biochar-based sulfonic acid catalysts not only opens a new way for high-value utilization of biochar, but also provides a novel efficient catalyst in many acid-catalyzed transformation reactions that the product H2O causes deleterious effects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of a blend of neem-rubber seed oil together with calcined husk of elephant-ear tree pod as catalyst for biodiesel production via transesterification aided with microwave irradiation. The essential process parameters involved in biodiesel production were optimized using central composite rotatable design combined with response surface methodology. The free fatty acid of the blend of neem and rubber seed oils in ratio 60:40 used in this work was effectively reduced from 17.76 to 0.67% using methanol/oil blend ratio of 25:1, catalyst [Fe2(SO4)3] dosage of 10 wt.%, reaction time of 120 min and reaction temperature of 65 °C. The E. cyclocarpum pod husk ash was calcined at 700 °C for 4 h and characterized. The results obtained show that the calcined ash is rich in K, Mg, Ca and Fe, which was responsible for its high catalytic activity. The optimal condition established for the microwave-assisted transesterification of the Fe2(SO4)3-pretreated oil blend was methanol/oil blend molar ratio of 11.44:1, catalyst dosage of 2.96 wt.% and reaction time of 5.88 min under microwave heating power of 150 W with a corresponding biodiesel yield of 98.77 ± 0.16 wt.%. The fuel properties of biodiesel produced were within the standard specifications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For the current research work, New Zealand origin sheep skin fat (NOSSF) with 7% free fatty acid (FFA) content was chosen for biodiesel production. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the acid catalyzed esterification of NOSSF. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed methanol to NOSSF mole ratio as an important parameter for the acid esterification reaction. The p-value &lt; 0.05 and F-value = 401.18 showed that quadratic model is significant. NOSSB yield of about 92% was achieved, when the acid esterification was carried out with 0.5 wt% H2SO4, 18:1 methanol: NOSSF mole ratio at 65 °C for 4 h followed by alkali-catalyzed transesterification of NOSSE with 0.5 wt% NaOH, 6:1 methanol: NOSSE mole ratio at 65 °C for 2 h. The physicochemical properties of NOSSB-PBD blends were evaluated and were observed to be well within the limits of ASTM D765 standards. Among all the blends, the NOSSB20 blend, showed good performance in par with PBD fuel operation with respect to BTE, BP and BSFC at full load. NOSSB-PBD blends emitted less CO and HC but more CO2 and NOx emissions than PBD. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental concerns in fossil fuel depletion intensified the search for alternate fuel from renewable resources. The focus of this study is to produce biodiesel from low-grade cooking oil by using Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3 as bi-functional heterogeneous base catalyzed transesterification reaction. The investigation of Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst on the calcination temperatures, dopant ratios to zinc oxide based and number of alumina coatings had significantly affected the catalytic performance. The physicochemical properties examined by XRD, XPS and TEM analyses over Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst indicates polycrystalline structure dominated by cubic Al2O3, hexagonal ZnO and monoclinic CuO species that presumably acted as active species which contributed to the catalytic transesterification of biodiesel. The design of experiments was performed using Box-Behnken design coupled with response surface methodology in order to optimize Cu/Zn (10:90)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst preparation conditions. The experimental value achieved 88.82% production of biodiesel that closely agreed with the predicted value from RSM. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Populus (poplar) tree species including hybrid varieties are considered as promising biomass feedstock for biofuels and biochemicals production due to their fast growing, short vegetative cycle, and widely distribution. In this work, poplar was pretreated with acetic acid (AC) to produce xylooligosaccharides (XOS), and hydrogen peroxide-acetic acid (HPAC) was used to remove residual lignin in AC-pretreated poplar for enzymatic hydrolysis. The aim of this work is to produce XOS and monosaccharides from poplar by a two-step pretreatment method. Results: The optimal conditions for the AC pretreatment were 170 °C, 5% AC, and 30 min, giving a XOS yield of 55.8%. The optimal HPAC pretreatment conditions were 60 °C, 2 h, and 80% HPAC, resulting in 92.7% delignification and 87.8% cellulose retention in the AC-pretreated poplar. The two step-treated poplar presented 86.6% glucose yield and 89.0% xylose yield by enzymatic hydrolysis with a cellulases loading of 7.2 m/g dry mass. Very high glucose (93.8%) and xylose (94.6%) yields were obtained with 14.3 mg cellulases/g dry mass. Both Tween 80 and β-glucosidase enhanced glucose yield of HPAC-pretreated poplar by alleviating the accumulation of cellobiose. Under the optimal conditions, 6.9 g XOS, 40.3 g glucose, and 8.9 g xylose were produced from 100 g poplar. Conclusions: The AC and HPAC pretreatment of poplar represented an efficient strategy to produce XOS and fermentable sugars with high yields. This two-step pretreatment was a recyclable benign and advantageous scheme for biorefinery of the poplar into XOS and monosaccharides. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The effect of Na2CO3, Fe and Na2CO3 + Fe during hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wheat stalk with different temperature and reaction time was investigated in this study. The results indicated that Na2CO3 + Fe can promote the cracking of wheat stalk compared with Na2CO3 or Fe. Meanwhile, higher temperature favored the decomposition of wheat stalk and formation of heavy bio-oil. The highest heavy bio-oil yield was 24.25 wt% and the maximum liquefaction conversion rate was 89.45 wt% in system of Na2CO3 + Fe at 270 °C. The analysis results indicated that longer reaction time could promote liquefaction conversion especially for heavy bio-oil with Na2CO3 + Fe during the process of HTL. GC–MS, UPLC-MS and FT-IR analysis indicated that the major organic compounds in heavy bio-oil were aromatic compounds, alcohols, ketones, alkanes, and aldehydes, among of them aromatic compounds were the most prevalent. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present work, cross linked enzyme aggregates of Lipase (CLEAs-lip) was synthesized and immobilized on the magnetic amino functionalized graphene oxide (maGO-CLEAs-lip) nanocomposites. The immobilized lipase showed a broad range of temperature activity about 40–60 °C, as compared to free enzyme. In the case of maGO-CLEAs-lip nanocomposite, the observed lower Km value state 2.25 folds affinity for the p-nitrophenyl palmitate. Enzyme activity of maGO-CLEAs-lip nanocomposite was the highest up to 5 cycles. Storage stability results displayed maGO-CLEAs-lip retained about 75% of its original activity after 30 days of incubation. Remarkably, maGO-CLEAs-lip formed the highest biodiesel construction (78%) from R. communis oil after 24 h of incubation. The biodiesel yield of this nanocomposite was 3.0 folds higher than free enzyme, making it talented as an excellent nanobiocatalyst for efficient production of biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Noble metal catalyst has an outstanding catalytic activity on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process, but its high cost limits large-scale application. Herein, we put forward a novel photochemical method to prepare the highly dispersed Pt/TiO2 catalyst with a low metal loading. And it presented an efficient performance on the HDO of phenolic compounds and real bio-oil. Guaiacol could be converted into cyclohexane with 95.1% selectivity at 280 °C under 1 MPa H2 atmosphere. Characterization results revealed that the high Pt dispersion was the critical factor for the high catalytic activity. And the photochemical method preferred to achieve high metal dispersion due to the room temperature condition. Other typical phenolic monomers and dimers were able to transform into hydrocarbons with most yield above 80%, wherein not only the deoxygenation step, but also the cleavage of ether bonds can be realized in one pot. This catalytic system was also effective on the upgrade of bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of cotton straw. Hydrocarbon content increased to 33.80% from 11.33%. Alkylphenols content increased to 51.38% from 27.86%. These two products can be used as value-added fuels and chemicals, respectively. Guaiacols and syringols were completely converted into alkylphenols and hydrocarbon. The amount of other oxygenated compounds also decreased significantly. This simple and active catalytic system is potential to apply widely for the upgrade of raw bio-oil. © 2018

AB  - There is an increasing need forwearable diagnostic sensor devices and for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) as efficient power sources. In this study, a six-glucose/O2 biofuel cell array connected in series was fabricated by screen printing as a self-powered glucose sensor exhibiting an electromotive force of 3.2 V. Porous carbon electrodes were formed by screen printing ofMgO-templated carbon on water-repellent paper to improve the performance of the cathode and thus prevent it from being the limiting step. The bioanode contained glucose oxidase as a catalyst and tetrathiafulvalene as a mediator, and the cathode contained bilirubin oxidase as an oxygen reduction catalyst. A good linear relationship was obtained between the output of EBFCs and glucose concentration (1-25 mM), which contains the range of urine glucose levels. The artificial urine components did not interfere with the output of the EBFC, but it was limited by low ion conductivity and low buffer capacity. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

AB  - This work aimed at producing fermentable sugars and bioproducts from rice husks by subcritical water hydrolysis at 25 MPa in a semi-continuous mode. The influences of temperature (180 °C; 220 °C; 260 °C) and liquid/solid ratio (7.5 g water/g husks; 15 g water/g husks) on reducing sugar yield (YRS), efficiency (E), kinetic profiles (0–15 min), composition of sugars, inhibitors and organic acids, and physicochemical characteristics of the remaining solid material were evaluated and discussed in the work. The highest YRS (18.0 ± 2.9 g/100 g husks) and E (39.5 ± 1.7 g sugars/100 g carbohydrates) were obtained at 220 °C and 7.5 g water/g husks. In such condition, the hydrolyzed solutions presented cellobiose (18.0 g/L), xylose 17.7 g/L), arabinose (3.6 g/L), glucose (1.5 g/L), and levulinic acid (0.7 g/L). The fermentable sugars and bioproducts can be applied in several industrial fields, especially for the production of bioethanol and other higher value-added chemical compounds. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Zeolites have been widely used as catalysts in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass to produce biofuels and/or bio-based chemicals, which could lead to the replacement of fossil sources by renewable ones. However, conventional zeolites often suffer from diffusion resistance for large intermediate oxygenates. To solve this problem, a micro/mesoporous core–shell composite zeolite ZSM-5@SBA-15 was prepared and employed as a catalyst in the catalytic pyrolysis of maize straw. ZSM-5@SBA-15 was synthesized by crystallizing mesoporous silica on the external surface of ZSM-5 using the triblock copolymer Plunoric P123 as the template. The core–shell and hierarchical structures were verified using PXRD, TEM, and N2 sorption experiments. In the catalytic pyrolysis of maize straw, ZSM-5@SBA-15 significantly enhanced the yield of valuable phenols and hydrocarbons in bio-oil, compared to ZSM-5 and SBA-15. The results demonstrated the potential application of micro@mesoporous core–shell composite zeolites in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports the use of lignin-rich residues from second generation bioethanol production, to produce syngas that can be applied in the gas fermentation process. Three gasification technologies at a different scale were considered in this study. Fixed bed updraft gasification of about 30 kg/h solid feed, bubbling fluidized bed gasification of about 0.3 kg/h solid feed and indirect gasification of about 3 kg/h solid feed. Two lignin-rich residues with different properties were tested and the results were evaluated in terms of feedstock pretreatment (grinding, drying and pelleting) and syngas quality requirements for the fermentation process. The molar H2/CO ratio (ranging from 0.6 to 1.0) and the tar yield (18–108 g/Nm3) obtained from the three gasification technologies was quite different. For the syngas fermentation process, low H2 to CO ratio is preferred, as most of the organisms grow better on CO than H2. Furthermore, different contents of impurities that can reduce the fermentability of the gas (such as hydrocarbons, HCN, HCl, NH3, COS and other organic S- compounds) were detected in the product gas. The concentration of these compounds in the syngas is related to the content of the corresponding compounds in the original feedstock. The different characteristics of the lignin-rich feedstocks are related to the specific pre-treatment technologies for the (hemi)cellulose extraction. By tuning the pre-treatment technology, the properties of the feedstock can be improved, making it a suitable for gasification. Tar and unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds need to be removed to very low levels prior to the fermentation process. As a next step, the combination of the gasification and the appropriate product gas cleaning, with the syngas fermentation process for the production of bio-alcohols will be evaluated and the overall efficiency of the gasification-fermentation process will be assessed. © 2019

AB  - Application of metal nanoparticles as combustion catalyst in diesel biodiesel fuel blends has grown recently. Efficient utilization of modified nanofluid fuels (MNF) is possible only when engine operating, fuel injection parameters are optimized accordingly. In the present research, experimental and statistical analysis is carried out on a commercial diesel engine (3.5 KW) with the aim to determine the optimal doping rate of nanoparticles and engine operating parameters using response surface methodology (RSM) and desirability function approach (DFA). The modified nanofluid (MNF) fuels used are blend of Acacia Concinna biodiesel (40% by vol.) and diesel (60% by vol.) mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO2) metal nanoparticles in different concentrations. Initially, the prepared fuel blends are characterized by SEM, TEM, blend stability (Uv–Vis spectrophotometery and sedimentation analysis) and various other properties. The optimal value, TiO2 doping rate of 150 mg/liter (MNF150), injection timing of 22.5 °CA btdc and 82.37% engine load is found to be the most suitable combination. Under these condition, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), ignition delay (ID), hydrocarbon (HC), smoke emissions are improved by 3.25%, 18.42%,7%, 38%, 20% respectively with slightly higher NOx emissions in comparison to diesel. This is observed with an overall high desirability value of 0.707. The modeling of engine output responses are (assuming quadratic model order) found to be statistically fit at 95.0% C.I level with residuals to be normally distributed. Further, a close agreement between experimental and model predicted values of responses, prove the adequacy of developed models. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chlorella vulgaris algae is comprised of a complex mixture of compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and is a suitable feedstock for biofuels. The aim of this study was to convert commercial and a low cost field cultivated algae, via pyrolysis, to produce bio-oil, synthesis gas, and biochar products. The thermal degradation behaviour of algae was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. Proximate, ultimate, fatty acid methyl ester and carbohydrates analyses, and pyrolysis–GCMS were further employed to characterize the chemical components of algae. Commercial and field cultured C. vulgaris algae was pyrolyzed (450, 500, and 550 °C) and their pyrolysis products were collected and characterized. The highest biochar yield was 42% at 450 °C and the highest bio-oil yield was 47.7% at 550 °C. The biochar physical and chemical properties were assessed using proximate and ultimate analysis, calorific value, specific surface area, butane absorption activity, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. Algae biochar was found to be mostly composed of condensed phenolic compounds and majorly disordered amorphous carbon. The bio-oils were characterized by the combination of GC–MS, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Fatty acids, carbohydrates, nitrogen-containing compounds, and aromatic hydrocarbons were abundantly found in the algae bio-oil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coke formation is one major problem during thermal conversion of bio-oil and its main components. Fundamental knowledge about the evolution of the structure of cokes is a prerequisite towards a deep understanding of coking of bio-oil. This study investigates the structure (morphology, elemental composition, O-containing functional groups and aromatic structures) of cokes generated from the pyrolysis of aromatic-rich fraction (ARF) and the aromatic-poor fraction (APF) of bio-oil. The effects of interactions of ARF and APF on properties of the coke formed during the pyrolysis of bio-oil are also studied. The results show that the cokes from the pyrolysis of APF (APF-cokes) are sponge-like while the cokes from the pyrolysis of ARF (ARF-cokes) have a dense structure. The matrix of cokes from the pyrolysis of the whole bio-oil (oil-cokes) is similar to the matrix of ARF-cokes, while its surface is similar to that of APF-cokes, which should be due to the interactions between different bio-oil fractions. The APF-cokes contain more C–O, O–H and C[dbnd]O functional groups than the ARF-cokes due to the higher O content of APF. Moreover, the interactions between ARF and APF can promote more O-containing species to be transformed as C–O, O–H and C[dbnd]O functional groups in the oil-cokes. The aromatic rings of ARF-cokes and APF-cokes can be cracked to form smaller ring systems at 300–500 °C, while it is opposite for the oil-cokes because the aromatic structures formed via the interactions between ARF and APF are more stable. At higher temperatures (>500 °C), the interactions (e.g. self-gasification) lead to the highly condensed cokes, while the secondary cokes, which are spherical particles, are preferentially consumed by the steam. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Based on published literature and typical profiles from the Nankai University source library, a total of 3326 chemical profiles of the main primary sources of ambient particulate matter (PM) across China from 1987 to 2017 are investigated and reviewed to trace the evolution of their main components and identify the main influencing factors concerning their evolution. In general, the source chemical profiles are varied with respect to their sources and are influenced by different sampling methods. The most complicated profiles are likely attributed to coal combustion (CC) and industrial emissions (IE). The profiles of vehicle emissions (VE) are dominated by organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), and vary due to the changing standards of sulfur and additives in gasoline and diesel as well as the sampling methods used. In addition to the sampling methods used, the profiles of biomass burning (BB) and cooking emissions (CE) are also impacted by the different biofuel categories and cooking types, respectively. The variations of the chemical profiles of different sources, and the homogeneity of the subtype source profiles within the same source category are examined using uncertainty analysis and cluster analysis. As a result, a relatively large variation is found in the source profiles of CC, VE, IE, and BB, indicating that these sources urgently require the establishment of local profiles due to their high uncertainties. The results presented highlight the need for further investigation of more specific markers (e.g., isotopes, organic compounds, and gaseous precursors), in addition to routinely measured components, in order to properly discriminate sources. Although the chemical profiles of the main sources have been previously reported in the literature, it should be noted that some of these chemical profiles are currently out of date and need to be updated immediately. Additionally, in the future, specific focus should be placed on the source profile subtypes, especially with respect to local IE in China. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis (CHP) of scrap tire was investigated for production of gasoline fuel. Effects of CHP process variables such as catalysts type ((activated carbon, AC), Ir/C, Rh/C, Pt/C, Ru/C, and Pd/C), temperature (200–450 °C), time (30–120 min), catalyst loading (0–40 wt%), and hydrogen pressure (0.1–12 MPa) on the CHP products distribution and properties of the hydropyrolysis oil (HPO) were examined. Ru/C was identified as the most suitable catalyst in terms of the HPO quality and the catalytic effect predominantly came from the noble metal. Temperature was the most influential factor affecting the yield and quality of the HPO and followed by the order of catalyst loading &gt; H 2 pressure &gt; time. Higher temperature, time, and catalyst loading would decrease the yield of HPO and increase the yield of gaseous product whereas contrary results were observed with increasing the H 2 pressure. With added noble metals, the hydrodenitrogenation, hydroSization, and hydrodeoxygenation reactions of the HPO were promoted and greatly lowered N, O, and S contents of the HPO with increasing the temperature, time, catalyst loading, and H 2 pressure. The lowest N, O, and S contents of 0.02, 0.41 and 0.41 wt% of HPO were achieved at 430 °C, 60 min, 10 wt% Ru/C, and 12 MPa H 2 . The higher-heating value of the HPOs varied between 44 and 46 MJ/kg depending on the reaction conditions. More than half of the energy of the ST was converted into the HPO. The HPO mainly consisted of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons one to five benzene derivatives. The distillate fraction between 35 and 250 °C of the HPO is more than 80 wt%. Thus, we view that CHP is an alternative way to produce high quality hydro-carbon fuel from scrap tire. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper evaluates the efficiency of sustainable activated carbons obtained from the valorization of lignocellulosic waste in removing siloxanes and volatile organic compounds for the purification of anaerobic digester biogas. Pyrolized and non-pyrolized lignocellulosic residues generated in food and wood industries were used as precursor materials to obtain experimental adsorbents by a chemical activation process using several activating agents. The highest porosity was obtained by non-pyrolized residue activated by K2CO3 at 900 °C. The performance of the experimental materials was compared with that of commercial activated carbons in gas adsorption tests of siloxanes (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and hexamethyldisiloxane) and volatile organic compounds (toluene and limonene). The waste-based activated carbons developed in this work proved to be more efficient for the removal of both siloxanes and VOCs than the commercial samples in most of the conditions tested. Adsorption capacities correlated with porosity, while the more relevant pore size depends on the adsorbate. © 2018

AB  - One prevailing issue for assessing the performance of hydrothermal liquefaction is understanding the role of the extraction solvent used for product separation. This study evaluated the extraction agent's impact on the hydrothermal liquefaction products and energy efficiency. Three representative solvents (acetone, dichloromethane, and toluene) were chosen with three representative high-carbohydrate, protein, and ash content feedstocks (Chlorella sp., Nannochloropsis sp., and Enteromorpha pr., respectively). Extraction of the oil using dichloromethane led to the highest biocrude oil yield (dry biomass) for Chlorella sp. (48.8%), toluene for Nannochloropsis sp. (23.3%), and acetone for Enteromorpha pr. (9.8%). The solvent selection led to a maximum variation of 20.4% for all oil yields. Dichloromethane produced high energy recovery values (maximum: 67.1%) and low energy consumption ratios (minimum: 0.06) regardless of the feedstock chemical composition. Dichloromethane also led to consistently high net energy values and high fossil energy ratios amongst all feedstocks. We speculate that the solvent polarity, chemical structure, hydrogen bonding, and dipole-dipole interactions influenced output parameters by the selective isolation and extraction of the chemical compounds in the biocrude oil. This study suggested that the extraction solvent selection should be carefully considered and normalized for the reporting of hydrothermal liquefaction yields and energy efficiency values. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The system comprises a biogas dry reforming process to produce syngas, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and a combined-cycle process. A detailed reaction model of the dry reforming process is implemented in the simulation of the system in Aspen Plus®. Inventory data obtained mainly through process simulation are used to evaluate the environmental performance of the system in terms of global warming, cumulative non-renewable energy demand, ozone layer depletion, acidification, and eutrophication. In particular, the life-cycle environmental profile of synthetic biodiesel as the main product of the biogas-to-liquid plant is calculated and compared with that of conventional diesel. Overall, the performance of the synthetic biodiesel product is not found to be environmentally favourable, which suggests the need for further optimising the biogas-to-liquid system to make it competitive with conventional systems. In this sense, biogas production and direct emissions to the air from the biogas-to-liquid plant arise as the main sources of impact. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and polystyrene was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor, followed by an analysis of the organic phase for possible further application as a drop-in fuel. Significant positive synergistic effects were found with the addition of polystyrene (5–40 wt%) to the conventional pyrolysis of grape seeds. There was a considerable improvement in the organic phase yield, in particular, reaching values over 80 wt%, markedly higher than those obtained from conventional pyrolysis (61 wt%). Fuel properties of the bio-oil were also upgraded, with a decrease in oxygen content and an increase in the heating value. An organic bio-oil fraction with pH values ranging from 5.4 to 6.2 was obtained, reducing the issues associated with handling bio-oils obtained from common pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, usually ranging pH between 2 and 3. Finally, an increment in the desired compounds, mainly aromatics, was also attained, while at the same time achieving a low content of undesired compounds, such as phenols. It was demonstrated that polystyrene can act as a H2-donor, favoring oligomerization, cyclation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions into aromatic compounds. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In-depth knowledge on pyrolysis behavior of lignocellulosic biomass is pivotal for efficient design, optimization, and control of thermochemical biofuel production processes. Experimental thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)is usually employed to peruse the pyrolysis kinetics of biomass samples. In addition to that, the main constituents of biomass (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin)as well as the process heating rate can excellently reflect its pyrolysis characteristics through modeling techniques. However, the application of statistical and phenomenological models for extremely complex and highly nonlinear phenomena like lignocellulose pyrolysis is challenging. To address this challenge, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)was consolidated with particle swarm optimization (PSO)algorithm to prognosticate the kinetic constants of lignocellulose pyrolysis. More specifically, the PSO algorithm was applied to tune membership function parameters of the ANFIS model. Three ANFIS−PSO topologies were designed and trained to estimate the kinetic constants of lignocellulose pyrolysis, i.e., energy of activation, pre-exponential coefficient, and order of reaction. The input variables of the developed models were biomass main constituents and the process heating rate. The developed models could predict the kinetic constants of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis with an R2 &gt; 0.970, an MAPE &lt; 3.270%, and an RMSE &lt; 5.006. The pyrolysis behaviors of three different biomass feedstocks (unseen data to the developed models)were adequately prognosticated with an R2 &gt; 0.91 using the developed models, further confirming their fidelity. Overall, the lignocellulose pyrolysis behavior could be reliably and accurately estimated using the trained ANFIS–PSO approaches as an alternative to the TGA measurements. In order to make practical use of the trained models, a handy freely-accessible software platform was designed using the selected ANFIS−PSO models for approximating biomass pyrolysis kinetics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel appears as a replenishable and sustainable energy source and can be used a direct replacement to petro-diesel without any major transformations in ongoing diesel engines. This work concentrates on production of Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel (CIB) and preparing 10% blend (CIB10) sample to investigate the effects of varying the injection strategies and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in common-rail direct injection engine. The experimental results shows that 10% of pilot fuel and 90% main injection strategy (B10@P10-M90) is superior among all others injection strategies with respect to pure diesel. B10@P10-M90 fuel injection strategy produces the maximum efficiency of 35.8% and lowest fuel consumption of 0.25 kg/kWh compared to all the injection strategies. The carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are also found to be quite low compared to all the other test samples including pure diesel. However B10@P10-M90 results in higher average oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission which is 18.9% higher in contrast to conventional diesel at full load condition. With the implementation of 10% and 20% EGR with B10@P10-M90, the average NOx emissions decreased by 14.4% and 27.6% respectively compared to B10@P10-M90 without any EGR without significant loss in the performance of the existing diesel engine. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-digestion of acorn slag waste (ASW)and dairy manure (DM)with two bio-based carbon (BC)accelerants are investigated via batch experiments under mesophilic condition. With the favorable synergistic effect of the mixed substrate and BC accelerant, the anaerobic digestion (AD)systems assembled with aloe peel-derived BC (2.16 g/L)show significantly improved methanogenesis on the basis of the optimum wet weight ratio of ASW to DM (1:3). The cumulative biogas yield is 580.9 mL/g VS, and the total chemical oxygen demand reduction is 79.37%. These results are higher than those of the AD systems without carbon-based accelerants. The feasibility of digestate utilization is evaluated by thermal and fertilizer analyses, which manifest outstanding stability and excellent fertility (6.93%−7.40%)of digestate in co-digestion systems. A general strategy for understanding the enhanced methanogenesis pathways, induced by BC in AD systems, is demonstrated. These important findings open an innovative opportunity for developing carbon-based accelerants in anaerobic co-digestion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metal oxides are frequently used in the formulations of the catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. This study aims to investigate the catalytic behaviors of the transition metal oxides (CoO, Cr2O3, CuO, Fe2O3, Mn2O3, NiO, TiO2 and V2O5) as well as CeO2 for the catalytic pyrolysis of poplar wood. The metal oxides, especially TiO2 and NiO could suppress further cracking of primary products, increasing the tar yield and simultaneously decreasing the gas yield. The V, Mn, Ti or Co-based catalyst promoted the formation of the heavy bio-oil, while the Ce, Cr, Cu or Fe-based catalysts were the opposite. The metal oxides (except Fe2O3) promoted the formation of alcohols, furan, ketones, acetic acid and phenolics in bio-oil. Fe2O3 catalysts suppressed formation of the derivatives from cellulose and hemicellulose except hydroxyl acetone. Hydroxyl acetone formation was promoted by almost all the oxide catalysts while hydroxyl aldehyde formation was the opposite. Remarkable coke formed over the V, Mn, Cu and Co-based catalysts. These oxides contain multiple valences and could be partially reduced to generate oxygen vacancies, which played important roles in the polymerisation reactions. In addition, the coke species formed on the oxide catalysts were mainly polymeric with low thermal stability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Utilizing lignin feedstock along with cellulosic ethanol for the production of high-energy-density jet fuel offers a significant opportunity to enhance the overall operation efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency, economic viability, and sustainability of biofuel and chemical production. A patented catalytic process to produce lignin-substructure-based hydrocarbons in the jet-fuel range from lignin was developed. Comprehensive techno-economic analysis of this process was conducted through process simulation in this study. The discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) method was used to evaluate a 2000 dry metric ton/day lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery with the co-production of lignin jet fuel. The minimum selling price of lignin jet fuel at a 10% discount rate was estimated to be in the range of $6.35–$1.76/gal depending on the lignin and conversion rate and capacity. With a production capacity of 1.5–16.6 million gallon jet fuel per year, capital costs ranged from $38.0 to $39.4 million. On the whole, the co-production of jet fuel from lignin improved the overall economic viability of an integrated biorefinery process for corn ethanol production by raising co-product revenue from jet fuels. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Lignin nanofibers (NFs) have been fabricated by electrospinning of a new formulation system: lignin, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixture. The ternary phase diagram of this system has been realized in order to define bead free nanofibers electrospinnability domains. Resulting NFs mat were carbonized in a temperature range 550–1200 °C and then characterized by X-Ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements. It revealed the influence of the carbonization temperatures on the structural properties in the resulting CNFs. Lignin NFs yarns have been for the first time manufactured by twisting the initial electrospun lignin NFs precursor mats. The structure and properties of the obtained lignin-based twisted carbon nanofibers (TCNFs) have been characterized as function of the degree of twist. Electrochemical capacitance and electrical conductivity of the TCNFs have revealed the influence of an increase in the twisting level (from 330 mF.g −1 to a few mF.g −1 and from 11 to 22 S.cm −1 ). It has been established that the compaction and the densification of highly TCNFs yarns are the reasons of these electrochemical and electrical behaviors. Manufactured bio-resourced conductive TCNFs yarns can be promising candidates as microelectrodes in biosensor or biofuel cells applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The establishment of catalyst systems for the chemoselective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons, such as the HDO of long-chain fatty acids to alkanes, is important for biomass to biofuel conversion. As the most abundant and probably the cheapest transition metal on the earth, iron is a promising non-noble-metal alternative to precious metals for large-scale conversion of biomass. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory activity. In this work, a nitrogen-doped carbon-alumina hybrid supported iron (Fe-N-C@Al 2 O 3 ) catalyst is established for chemoselective HDO of carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons. By using stearic acid HDO as the model reaction, n-octadecane and n-heptadecane are produced with yields of 91.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Triglycerides can also be converted into liquid alkanes with a total molar yield of &gt;92%. In addition, the iron catalyst can chemoselectively catalyze the HDO of the carboxylic acid group in the presence of other functional groups such as an aromatic ring. This chemoselectivity has rarely been seen before because the aromatic ring is usually more easily hydrogenated in comparison to HDO of the carboxylic acid group. The characterization results showed that both the formation of a nitrogen-doped carbon-alumina hybrid and the iron loading are important for the Lewis basicity of these catalysts, in order to adsorb the acid substrates. The addition of melamine as the nitrogen precursor during pyrolysis eliminates undesired reactions between the iron precursor and alumina support to form an inactive hercynite phase, leading to the formation of an Fe 3 C active phase for the hydrogenation of -COOH to -CH 2 OH and the hybrid of N-C and alumina for the HDO of -CH 2 OH to -CH 3 . © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present research work comprises of the study of Momordica charantia (L.) seeds as an alternative for biodiesel production. A new source of heterogeneous catalyst: duck egg shell derived calcium oxide (CaO), as catalyst is used in the transesterification reaction. The catalyst has been synthesized and analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and the results were compared with works of other researchers. The MCME thus obtained is characterized through FTIR and Gas chromatograph-Mass spectrometer (GC-MS) for determining the fatty acid methyl ester composition and content. The yield of methyl ester using duck egg shell derived CaO was found to be 96.8%. The engine test at variable engine speed (1200, 1500 and 1800 rpm) and loading (low, medium and full) showed that use of B20 MCME has significant reduction in NOX emissions (51.68%, 55.88% &amp; 55.68% in 1200, 1400 and 1800 rpm) while other emission components- CO, CO2, PM and SO2 were close to that of diesel. Performance and combustion characteristics were observed to be lower than that of diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present scenario, the utilization of petroleum fuel is expanding forcefully worldwide in the vitality store and plays a highly hazardous role in the ecological system. Biofuel stands out among the most tenable keys for this issue. The lemongrass oil is used as a biofuel because of low density and viscosity when compared with diesel. The lemongrass oil is extracted by steam distillation process. In the present investigation, partially stabilized zirconium, due to its higher thermal conductivity, is selected as coating material. The top surface of the piston and the inlet and exhaust valves are coated up to the preferred thickness of 500 μm by the plasma spray technique. The lemongrass emulsion fuel is prepared in the proportion of 94% of lemongrass oil, 5% of water, and 1% of surfactant span 80. The nanoparticles of cerium oxide were used with lemongrass oil (LGO) nano-emulsion in the measurement of 30 ppm. The four-stroke diesel engine execution, ignition, and the outflow extent were contrasted in the diesel and lemongrass oil (LGO) compared with the base diesel engine. The performance characteristic curves of lemongrass-cerium oxide nano-emulsion fuel show the increase in brake thermal efficiency of 17.21% when compared with the mineral diesel fuel. The emission characteristics of lemongrass-cerium oxide nano-emulsion fuel show a drop in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emission by 16.21% and 15.21%, respectively, when compared with base diesel fuel and also there is a decrease in oxides of nitrogen and smoke emission by 24.1% and 6.3%, respectively, when compared to mineral diesel fuel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The valorisation of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW)in the circular economy context is of outmost importance. This review aimed to examine the state-of-the-art valorisation technologies of OFMSW as resource for bioethanol and biodiesel. Firstly, feedstock mapping was performed, where high fluctuation of parameters was revealed. Considering the mean values, the stoichiometries of mechanically and source-sorted OFMSW are C22H44O28N and C20H36O16N, respectively. The substrate's mean carbohydrates (50%)and lipids (13%)contents reflect its potential in bioethanol and biodiesel production, respectively. As far as bioethanol is concerned, this paper critically reviewed the existing variance of second-generation bioethanol production methodologies from OFMSW revealing that high bioethanol yields (over 80%)could be achieved if the treatment steps of pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation are synergistically compiled. To this end, bioethanol yield could benefit from suitable enzymatic blends. Furthermore, this paper discussed about different ways of oil extraction from OFMSW and various biodiesel production techniques. Soxhlet extraction combined with alkaline transesterification emerged as the most widely applied biodiesel production line from OFMSW. The novelty of this literature review lies in the integration of both bioethanol and biodiesel production processes, in a biorefinery concept that would allow the production of both biofuels along with that of biogas. This integration scenario rendered an energy efficiency expressed as energy content in products per energy in raw materials equal to 68%, proving that OFMSW is a feedstock that could meet the sustainability criteria for biofuels production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A massive reduction in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning is required to limit the extent of global warming. However, carbon-based liquid fuels will in the foreseeable future continue to be important energy storage media. We propose a combination of largely existing technologies to use solar energy to recycle atmospheric CO2 into a liquid fuel. Our concept is clusters of marine-based floating islands, on which photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electrical energy to produce H2 and to extract CO2 from seawater, where it is in equilibrium with the atmosphere. These gases are then reacted to form the energy carrier methanol, which is conveniently shipped to the end consumer. The present work initiates the development of this concept and highlights relevant questions in physics, chemistry, and mechanics. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bio-oil upgrading through its hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) using sulfided catalysts has attracted significant attention because of its potential to provide advanced biofuels. Although many studies have been undertaken, a detailed understanding of the changes in the chemical composition on the molecular level that would allow the better design of catalysts for bio-oil upgrading is still insufficient. Therefore, we have subjected straw bio-oil and products obtained from its hydrotreatment over a broad range of experimental conditions to a detailed quantitative chemical analysis. Most of the volatile compounds were quantified by GC-MS. Among them, 115 compounds were quantified directly (i.e., using the appropriate standards) and more than 100 indirectly (i.e., based on their structural similarity with corresponding standards). Moreover, the total concentrations of carboxylic acids, carbonyls and phenols were quantified by the carboxylic acid number (CAN), Faix, and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, respectively, to obtain complementary and supporting information on the chemical composition to the GC-MS data. The detailed quantification of most volatile compounds in the feed and the products allowed us to create a reactivity order of the oxygen-containing functional groups present and to understand the origin of some of the compounds. On the basis of the results, the upgrading of straw bio-oil from ablative fast pyrolysis at 340 °C and 4 MPa seems to be optimal when evaluating the severity of the reaction conditions and hydrogen consumption, on the one hand, and the products quality, on the other hand. This provides a good starting point for further catalyst development and optimization allowing the long-term upgrading of the bio-oil for obtaining petroleum-refinery-compatible feedstock. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel is produced by transesterification reaction of oils catalyzed by homogeneous catalysts, with the latter being non-recoverable and promoter of solubility of the produced glycerol into the otherwise immiscible ester phase, which have to be purified. The need for purification of products is eliminated if heterogeneous catalysts are employed, with the added advantage of the catalyst recovery, however, with disadvantage of requiring drastic reaction conditions (elevated temperatures and pressures, longer reaction times) significantly increasing the costs of production. To overcome such problems, several catalysts were developed, with the sulfonated ones being the most prospective for industrial applications. Thus, the objective herein was to develop a sulfonated heterogeneous catalyst using activated carbon produced from corncobs as precursor material and employ it in microwave-assisted transesterification reactions of soybean oil with ethanol. The optimum operational conditions employed for the reaction were microwave variable power of 0–600 W, catalyst-to-oil mass ratio of 20%, alcohol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1 and reaction time of 20 min. The catalyst successfully catalyzed the transesterification reaction in times as short as 20 min, resulting in a pure biodiesel phase with yield of 88.7%. The catalyst was reused in five subsequent reaction cycles without loss of its catalytic activity. © 2019

AB  - 5-Na/ZnO loaded SBA-15 has been prepared by one-pot method in atmospheric conditions (without employing hydrothermal treatment) and following wet impregnation method. The prepared catalyst was characterised by using several techniques viz., BET method for determination of surface area, FE-SEM for morphology of catalyst, XPS study to determine the oxidation state of constituent elements. The catalyst was utilised for transesterification from virgin cotton seed oil and the catalyst activity was dependant on its basic strength. Under optimal reaction conditions of catalyst amount 12 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 24:1 at reaction temperature of 65 °C, the prepared catalyst yielded &gt; 98% fatty acid methyl ester in 4 h of reaction duration. The catalyst was able to yield conversion level as good as ∼74% even in 5th cycle after regeneration. Leaching of &lt; 5 ppm metal content was observed, in 4th and 5th cycle, which was within the ASTM specified limitations. The thermodynamic parameters for the reaction, viz., activation energy Ea, ΔH‡, ΔS‡, ΔG‡ were calculated as 77.3 kJ mol−1, 74.2 kJ mol−1, -0.064 kJ mol−1 and, + 93.2 kJ mol−1 respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass is a promising conversion technology in which wet biomass is treated under high temperature (280–350 °C) and pressure (5–21 MPa), and the associated water in the wet biomass forms the reaction medium. A significant fraction of the microalgae can be converted into biocrude, which separates from the aqueous layer by gravity and/or chemical/mechanical methods. Since the HTL process uses the whole biomass, increasing lipid content during microalgae cultivation is not essential. With an overall goal to utilize highly productive algal strains as feedstocks for liquid hydrocarbon fuel precursors, we investigated the HTL conversion of a marine microalgae (Tetraselmis sp.) in the presence of co-solvents. HTL was performed using a 1.2 L Parr reactor at 275–350 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of a co-solvent (ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol). Results showed that the conversion of Tetraselmis sp. was promoted by higher reaction temperature. The biocrude yield increased from 26.3 ± 1.6% to 31.0 ± 2.1% as the temperature increased from 275 °C to 350 °C. Addition of 10% isopropyl alcohol as co-solvent promoted a 14.5 ± 4.9% increase in biocrude yield and also increased production of gaseous products. In contrast, the use of ethylene glycol as co-solvent did not have a significant effect on biocrude yield. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sludge contains numerous organic matters that benefit the production of fuels. In this study, the effects of different pretreatments on the hydrothermal liquefaction of sludge were investigated. The results showed that the release of bound water from sludge promoted liquefaction reactions at lower temperatures and inhibited the macromolecular chain-breaking into low-molecular compounds at higher temperatures. Compared with bio-oil from the raw sludge, the nitrogen content in the bio-oil was reduced from 6.1% to 2.9% after subcritical water (SCW) pretreatment. The calorific value of the bio-oil increased from 32.2 MJ/kg to 35.2 MJ/kg after cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) pretreatment. The alcohol content in the bio-oil increased eight fold, and the contents of hydrocarbons and their derivatives increased by 11.5 times after fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (AEO9) pretreatment. CTAB–AEO9 could promote various reactions (e.g., nucleophilic, elimination, and oxidation), but the transesterification reaction dominated. CTAB–AEO9–SCW pretreatment increased the oil yield one fold and reduced the acid content by 95.2%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to improve fuel quality of sewage sludge, fruit and agricultural wastes have been selected for hydrothermal co-carbonization. After hydrothermal co-carbonization, organics retention was facilitated, while O/C and H/C atomic ratios of hydrochars were substantially upgraded. Particularly, hydrochar from hydrothermal co-carbonization of sewage sludge with peanut shells at mass ratio of 1:3 (denoted as “SS:PS = 1:3”) showed the highest fuel ratio of 0.79 and its carbon content was increased to 50.0% with significantly decreased O/C and H/C atomic ratios. Furthermore, higher heating value of hydrochars from hydrothermal co-carbonization was increased by nearly 2.65-fold and reached 21.72 MJ/kg. Moreover, the most favorable aromatization occurred when sewage sludge and peanut shells blending ratio was 3:1 or 1:1, whereas hydrothermal co-carbonization induced more [sbnd]C[dbnd]O and [sbnd]OH than [sbnd]COOH in hydrochars due to synergistic decarboxylation. A relatively higher value of point of zero charge for hydrochars from hydrothermal co-carbonization implied improved hydrophobicity. Combustion kinetics results indicated that hydrothermal co-carbonization balanced activation energies of hydrochars in devolatilization/combustion stage and char combustion process, rendering a more stable and lasting combustion profile. Hydrochars “SS:PS = 1:3” demonstrated desirable combustion performance. Therefore, hydrothermal co-carbonization can realize sustainable utilization of organic solid wastes towards superior hydrochar solid biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Vegetable oil based fuels are promising substitutes for diesel fuel for transport and industrial applications. Converting raw vegetable oils into their ethyl or methyl esters has reasonably solved the problems associated with their high viscosities. The purpose of the research is to investigate experimentally the effect of injection pressure on the combustion characteristics of a biodiesel engine using cerium oxide nanoparticles as a fuel additive. Biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil mixed with mineral diesel in the proportion 20:80 is used along with cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles as additives. The engine is run at several fuel injection pressures (180, 210 and 240 bar) and with a nanoparticle concentration of 80 ppm. The experiments demonstrate that the higher injection pressure associated with nanoparticle addition improves engine combustion characteristics, e.g., it leads to a higher peak pressure and a higher heat release rate. The best performance was observed at an injection pressure of 240 bar with a 80 ppm nanoparticle concentration. Concentrations of hydrocarbon, oxides of nitrogen and smoke decreased for higher injection pressures with nanoparticle addition. Hence an enhancement in engine performance and decrease in emissions can be achieved in a biodiesel engine by employing higher injection pressures with nanometer sized cerium oxide particles as additives. This helps in conserving the petroleum based fuels and also avoiding the emissions of contaminants to the atmosphere. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Living cells do not interface naturally with nanoscale materials, although such artificial organisms can have unprecedented multifunctional properties, like wireless activation of enzyme function using electromagnetic stimuli. Realizing such interfacing in a nanobiohybrid organism (or nanorg) requires (1) chemical coupling via affinity binding and self-assembly, (2) the energetic coupling between optoelectronic states of artificial materials with the cellular process, and (3) the design of appropriate interfaces ensuring biocompatibility. Here we show that seven different core-shell quantum dots (QDs), with excitations ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared energies, couple with targeted enzyme sites in bacteria. When illuminated by light, these QDs drive the renewable production of different biofuels and chemicals using carbon-dioxide (CO2), water, and nitrogen (from air) as substrates. These QDs use their zinc-rich shell facets for affinity attachment to the proteins. Cysteine zwitterion ligands enable uptake through the cell, facilitating cell survival. Together, these nanorgs catalyze light-induced air-water-CO2 reduction with a high turnover number (TON) of ∼106-108 (mols of product per mol of cells) to biofuels like isopropanol (IPA), 2,3-butanediol (BDO), C11-C15 methyl ketones (MKs), and hydrogen (H2); and chemicals such as formic acid (FA), ammonia (NH3), ethylene (C2H4), and degradable bioplastics polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Therefore, these resting cells function as nanomicrobial factories powered by light. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Drop-in biofuels are non-oxygenated biofuels composed by biohydrocarbons produced from different biomass. These drop-in biofuels (biogasoline, bio jet-fuel and green diesel) show a great importance due to their properties similar to those observed for fossil fuels. Lipids are one of the most important raw material used for deoxygenation reactions over special catalysts. In this work, niobium phosphate was investigated as catalyst in the production of drop-in biofuels from soybean oil, using mild experimental conditions. The performance of niobium phosphate was evaluated under different reaction time (3–5 h), catalyst amount (0–25%) and temperature (300–350 °C), using 10 bar H2. The composition of the liquid products was determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The optimization process led to high yields of hydrocarbons in the range of C9–C17. About 62% of bio-jet fuel, 40% of green diesel, and 18% of gasoline range hydrocarbons were obtained in a single reaction step. Their composition included mainly linear and branched alkanes as well as aromatics compounds. The pathways for the involved reactions are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Exploration of non-edible oil as a feedstock and the use of new heterogeneous nanocatalyst could contribute to bioenergy research. In this regard, the present work is focussed on the use of cobalt doped zinc oxide nanocatalyst for production of biodiesel from Mesua ferrea oil. The synthesized catalyst has been analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Under optimal reaction condition, maximum biodiesel conversion of 98.03% was obtained in 3 h at 60 °C with 2.5 wt% catalyst loading and 1:9 oil to methanol molar ratio. The produced biodiesel has been characterized using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C NMR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) techniques. Fuel properties of the produced biodiesel have also been determined. The result showed good catalytic activity of cobalt doped Zinc oxide nanocatalyst and could be used for large scale biodiesel production from Mesua ferrea oil by further enhancing its stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is considered to be a promising route for biofuel production from wet biomass. Transportation fuels and chemicals can be accessed through this process. However, a high strength aqueous phase is also produced during HTL. The conversion of the aqueous phase could significantly contribute to energy and nutrient recovery. Anaerobic fermentation has recently been proposed to biologically convert the HTL aqueous phase into biomethane. However, only a limited amount of information about the fate of the HTL aqueous phase and its conversion during anaerobic conversion is available, and it suffers from a few setbacks, including a low degradation efficiency of organics (33-64% COD) and high dilution rates (5-1000). Herein, the fates and conversion of organics in the HTL aqueous phase during anaerobic conversion were investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis combined with organics/nitrogen balance indicated that the remaining organics (over 30%) after anaerobic conversion might come from nitrogen-containing polymers (over 1000 Da). These nitrogen-containing polymers tended to be converted into oligomers and led to a decrease in the molecular weight (100-300 Da) by anaerobic microbes but could not be further converted into methane. Organic acids and potential inhibitors (N-heterocycles and aromatic compounds) could be completely converted into methane, but the acetogenesis of anaerobic fermentation was inhibited with an increased fermentation concentration. Ozone pretreatment and granule activated carbon (GAC) addition were integrated to improve the anaerobic conversion efficiency of the HTL aqueous phase. Ozone pretreatment significantly improved the conversion of organics and methane production by 109% through converting the inhibitors. At the same time, ozone pretreatment could convert nitrogen-containing polymers into low molecular weight organics, but organics with a molecular weight ranging from 500 to 1000 Da were produced and could not be converted by microbes or adsorbed by GAC. In comparison, GAC addition increased the methane yield more remarkably by 298% at a 2× dilution rate of the HTL aqueous phase through adsorbing inhibitors and enriching robust microbes, such as detoxification bacteria and syntrophic acetogens. Moreover, GAC adsorbed the recalcitrant organics and resulted in a removal of organics of 93.3-96.8%. Therefore, clean water with polished nutrients could be achieved through intensified anaerobic conversion, which could enhance the following biomass production and nutrient recovery through algae cultivation. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The rise in global atmospheric temperature due to increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration needs to be tackled immediately before it reaches the point of no return. The application of innovative technologies based on the concepts of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) can contribute in this direction by simultaneously sequestrating CO2 and producing value-added products in the process. Wastewater treatment with simultaneous bioenergy and biofuel recovery is also one of the added advantage of employing BESs for CO2 fixation. This review focuses on the potential of employing BES-based technologies like microbial carbon capture, plant-microbial fuel cell and microbial electrosynthesis cell for the concomitant production of valuables and CO2 sequestration. Also, various parameters affecting performance of BES that need to be optimized for the proper field-scale demonstration of these technologies are discussed. © 2019

AB  - Production of syngas with tunable CO/H2 ratio from renewable resources is an ideal way to provide a carbon-neutral feedstock for liquid fuel production. Ag is a benchmark electrocatalysts for CO2-to-CO conversion but high overpotential limits the efficiency. We synthesize AgP2 nanocrystals (NCs) with a greater than 3-fold reduction in overpotential for electrochemical CO2-to-CO reduction compared to Ag and greatly enhanced stability. Density functional theory calculations reveal a significant energy barrier decrease in the formate intermediate formation step. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) shows that a maximum Faradaic efficiency is achieved at an average silver valence state of +1.08 in AgP2 NCs. A photocathode consisting of a n+p-Si wafer coated with ultrathin Al2O3 and AgP2 NCs achieves an onset potential of 0.2 V vs. RHE for CO production and a partial photocurrent density for CO at −0.11 V vs. RHE (j−0.11, CO) of −3.2 mA cm−2. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The main objective of this work comprises the investigation of biodiesel production from rapeseed oil using potassium impregnated Fe3O4-CeO2 nanocatalyst. The various concentration of potassium impregnated Fe3O4-CeO2 was screened for catalytic conversion of rapeseed oil to triglyceride methyl ester. The 25 wt % potassium impregnated Fe3O4-CeO2 nanocatalyst showed best biodiesel production. Nanocatalyst was characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, BET and Hammett indicator for basicity test. The characterization of biodiesel was performed with GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR. Moreover, the optimum reaction parameters such as catalyst amount (wt %), oil to methanol ratio, reaction time and reaction temperature for transesterification reaction was analyzed and yield was determined by 1H NMR. The maximum yield of 96.13% was obtained at 4.5 wt % catalyst amount, 1:7 oil to methanol ratio at 65 °C for 120 min. The properties of biodiesel such as acid value and kinematic viscosity were observed as 0.308 mg KOH/g and 4.37 mm2/s respectively. The other fuel parameters such as flash point and density were also determined. The reusability of catalyst was observed and it showed stability up to five cycles without considerable loss of activity. The recovery of excess methanol after transesterification reaction was achieved using distillation process setup. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein we report that the Ti 8 -BDC (MIL-125) (BDC is 1,4-benzenecarboxylate) metal-organic framework (MOF) supports single-site solid Ni II -hydride catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of aryl ethers containing α-O-4, β-O-4, and 4-O-5 linkages to exclusively afford hydrocarbons under mild conditions without the addition of a base. The catalytic activity of Ti 8 -BDC-NiH is highly dependent on the reduction of Ti 8 (μ 2 -O) 8 (μ 2 -OH) 4 nodes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed two key steps of σ-bond metathesis in the catalytic cycle of Ti 8 -BDC-NiH catalyzed hydrogenolysis. This work highlights the potential of MOF-supported single-site catalysts in aryl ether bond scission and other processes for the efficient production of biofuels and chemical feedstocks. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This research work investigated the optimization of biodiesel production from Sweet Almond (Prunus amygdalus) Seed oil (SASO) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models through base (NaOH) transesterification. The Central Composite Design (CCD) optimization conditions were temperature (30 °C to 70 °C), catalyst concentration (0.5%w/w to 2.5% w/w), reaction time (45 min–65 min) and oil/methanol molar ratio (1:3 mol/mol to 1:7 mol/mol). The physico-chemical properties of the seed oil and the methyl ester were carried out using standard methods. The fatty acids were determined using GC-MS and characterized using FT-IR techniques. An optimized biodiesel yield of 94.36% from the RSM and 95.45% from the ANN models respectively were obtained at catalyst concentration of 1.5w/w%, reaction time of 65 min, oil/methanol molar ratio of 1:5 mol/mol and temperature of 50 °C. The quality of the RSM model was analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Model statistics of the ANN showed comfortable values of Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 6.005, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.786 and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 1.89306. The RSM and ANN models gave coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9446 and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.96637 respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid acid catalyst was synthesized from sugarcane bagasse, a residue left behind during sugar milling, through a simpler and less energy-intensive one-step process, simultaneous carbonization-sulfonation. A range of synthesis temperature (150, 200, 250 °C) and time (4, 6, 8 h) were investigated in the preparation of the catalyst to determine their effects on the catalytic activity and conversion during esterification of oleic acid and methanol. Extensive washing of the freshly synthesized catalyst have significant influence on the performance of the catalyst, as loosely bound acid sites are removed in the process lowering its activity but improving its stability. The catalyst synthesized at 150 °C for 8 h, having a sulfonic acid density of 0.59 mmol/g, exhibited the best performance during a 4-h esterification assay using oleic acid and methanol, resulting in an FFA conversion of 46.5% and catalytic activity of 4.62 mmol oleic acid/mmol-SO3H ·h. Additionally, the catalyst could be used for at least five 24-h esterification cycles, where an FFA conversion of as high as 87% was achieved. The catalyst retained 76.5 and 86% of its initial catalytic performance and sulfonic acid density, respectively, after the fourth cycle, offering good operational stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioelectrochemical conversion of CO2 to CH4 is a promising way to increase the calorific value of biogas produced during anaerobic digestion. There are two groups of methanogens enriched in these systems, hydrogenotrophs and acetoclastic methanogens that can also directly accept electrons from an electrode or another microorganism. In this study, a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) poised at −500 mV (vs. SHE) was operated for biogas upgrading. Methane content in the biogas increased from 71% to &gt;90%, and 8.2% of the CO2 was converted to methane. Methanothrix, an acetoclastic methanogen that can participate in direct electron transfer (DET), and Azonexus, an acetate-oxidizing electrogen, were enriched on the cathode.

AB  - The efficient fixation of excess CO2 from the atmosphere to yield value-added chemicals remains crucial in response to the increasing levels of carbon emission. Coupling enzymatic reactions with electrochemical regeneration of cofactors is a promising technique for fixing CO2, while producing biomass which can be further transformed into biofuels. Herein, a bioelectrocatalytic system was established by depositing crystallites of a mesoporous metal–organic framework (MOF), termed NU-1006, containing formate dehydrogenase, on a fluorine-doped tin oxide glass electrode modified with Cp*Rh(2,2′-bipyridyl-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid)Cl2 complex. This system converts CO2 into formic acid at a rate of 79±3.4 mm h−1 with electrochemical regeneration of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor. The MOF–enzyme composite exhibited significantly higher catalyst stability when subjected to non-native conditions compared to the free enzyme, doubling the formic acid yield. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - A series of 5 wt% NiO/Al-SBA-15 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of ordered, mesoporous Al-SBA-15 supports (Si/Al molar ratios spanning 5–75) synthesised by a true liquid crystal templating (TLCT) method. The catalytic activity of the resulting catalysts was studied in the solvent-less, hydrogen-free deoxygenation (DO) of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), using a semi-batch reactor at 350 °C. 27Al and 29Si MAS-NMR was used to quantify the speciation of framework and extra-framework Al as a function of Si:Al ratio, before and after NiO functionalisation; TEM and XRD confirmed the formation of 9–10 nm NiO nanoparticles in all cases. NiO/Al-SBA-15 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity for PFAD deoxygenation, with hydrocarbon yields reaching 86% and a selectivity to the diesel fraction (C11–C17) of 91%. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although currently microalgae biomass is not considered as a sustainable feedstock for biofuel production, future developments of microalgae cultivation and harvest could make the commercial application of such fast-growing photosynthetic biomass economically and environmentally feasible. This article aims at reviewing thermochemical conversion of microalgae into bio-crude oil through pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction technologies. Subsequently, possible solutions to overcome the constraints to achieve the sustainable conversion of microalgae biomass are discussed in detail. The drawbacks of bio-crude oil as a transportation fuel and the technologies required for its upgrading are highlighted. Currently, microalgae-derived bio-crude oil is inferior to biodiesel and diesel in terms of quality, thus cannot be used as a transportation or jet fuel. It requires catalytic upgrading steps and further processing, including durable and cost-effective catalysts with strong regenerative capabilities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Both value-added utilization of low-rank renewable feedstocks to prepare catalytic materials and selective transformation of bioderived aldehydes are very attractive topics. Herein, lignosulfonate, a waste by-product from the paper industry, was simply assembled with ZrCl4 under non-toxic hydrothermal conditions for scalable preparation of Zr-containing polyphenolic biopolymer catalysts (Zr–LS). Systematic characterizations indicated that the strong coordination between Zr4+ and phenolic hydroxyl groups in lignosulfonate led to the formation of strong Lewis acid-base couple sites (Zr4+−O2−) and porous inorganic-organic framework structure (mesopores centered at 6.1 nm), while the inherent sulfonic groups in lignosulphonate could serve as Brønsted acidic sites. The cooperative role of these versatile acid−base sites in Zr–LS afforded excellent catalytic performance for Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction of a broad range of bioderived platform chemicals under mild conditions (80 °C), especially of furfural (FF) to furfuryl alcohol (FA), in quantitative yields (96%) with high FA formation rate of 9600 μmol g−1 h−1 and TOF of 4.37 h−1. Kinetic studies revealed that the activation energy of the MPV reduction of FF was as low as 52.25 kJ/mol, accounting for the high reaction rate. Isotopic labelling experiments demonstrated direct hydrogen transfer from the α-C of 2-PrOH to the α-C of FF on acid-base sites was the rate-determining step. Moreover, Zr–LS showed good recyclability for at least seven reaction cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Limited fossil fuel reserves led to focus on alternatives fuels for combustion engines. Several studies reported optimal (20%)biodiesel blend for utility in compression ignition engine at constant compression ratio. Literature lacks on the study of palm-based biodiesel in blended form at varying engine compression ratios. In this study, an initiative was undertaken to study the effect of variable compression ratio (16:1, 17:1 and 18:1)on various engine characteristics by fuelling 20% palm biodiesel blending compression ignition engine. The ignition delay period decreased, whereas the peak cylinder pressure and brake thermal efficiency increased with increase in the engine compression ratio from 16:1 to 18:1. At 3.5 bar bmep, brake thermal efficiency values were observed to be 28.9, 30.8 and 33.8% at 16:1, 17:1 and 18:1 CRs, respectively in B20 fuel. Moreover, increasing compression ratio from 16:1 to 18:1, the average reduction in emissions of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and smoke opacity were observed to be 47.8, 41.0 and 35.7%, respectively whereas, oxides of nitrogen emissions increased by 41.1%. Thus, it is inferred that B20 fuel performed well at high engine compression ratio. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bio-oil obtained from a general pyrolysis process contains a higher concentration of oxygenated compounds and the resultant physical and chemical properties make it an unsuitable drop-in fuel. The oxygenated compounds in the bio-oil can be converted into hydrocarbons or less oxygenated compounds with the application of catalysts. This study demonstrated the bio-oil upgrading with the application of catalysts, comparing the catalytic effect of combined mono-metallic catalysts (Cu/zeolite and Ni/zeolite) and sole bi-metallic catalyst (CuNi/zeolite) on the composition of bio-oil and pyrolytic gases. The results demonstrated that in comparison to the combined mono-metallic catalysts, the sole bi-metallic catalyst showed better deoxygenation for all the oxygenated compounds and favoured the production of aliphatic hydrocarbons, whereas the combination of mono-metallic catalysts generated higher proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. In both cases, the catalysts equally favoured decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions, as CO2/CO of approximately 1 was obtained during the pyrolysis process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The traditional method of biodiesel production is based on the transesterification of triglycerides using an alkaline catalyst dissolved in methanol. The aim of this study was to replace a homogeneous alkaline catalyst with a heterogeneous catalyst on the carbon support. The use of a carbon enables the catalyst to be reusable in the production process, eliminates the formation of soaps and increases the glycerol purity. Fatty acid methyl esters were obtained from the transesterification of corn oil using KOH supported on activated carbon (KOH/AC). The effect of the molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction time and catalyst amount were used to optimize the transesterification reaction. The optimum condition for waste corn oil transesterification to methyl ester was obtained below 0.75 wt.% catalyst amount. The yield was up to 92 wt.% at 62.5 °C, 1 h reaction time and 3:1 methanol-to-oil ratio. This study demonstrated that the transesterification of the waste corn oil using methanol can be effectively catalyzed by the developed catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, the acidity of MCM-41 was improved by Al addition (Si/Al molar ratio of 50) and it was used as support in nanocatalysts with various loadings of calcium (10, 20 and 30 wt %) for biodiesel production. The catalysts were synthesized by two methods: impregnation and sono-dispersion. The synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, FESEM, EDX, TEM, BET and FTIR analysis. The XRD patterns of the samples demonstrated formation of the crystalline structure of MCM-41 and CaO. The FESEM images of the samples proved the nanoscale of catalysts and along with EDX and TEM analysis showed a better dispersion of calcium on support for ultrasonic irradiated sample compared to impregnated one. The performance of nanocatalysts was examined under constant conditions (Temperature of 70 °C, Methanol/Oil ratio of 12 and catalyst loading of 10 wt %). The result showed that the conversion of transesterification reaction and following that the quality of produced biodiesel was increased significantly by increasing the calcium amounts in catalysts. Furthermore, for two samples with the same amount of calcium loading, the sonicated sample showed a higher conversion. Among all of the samples Ca(30)/Al-MCM-41(U) showed the maximum conversion for biodiesel production reaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the bioenergy potential of two invasive aquatic macrophytes, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and yellow velvetleaf (Limnocharis flava), were investigated through thermochemical characterization, kinetic study and thermodynamic analysis. Thermochemical characterization indicated that the two study specimens have a good potential for use as abundant low-cost biomass to solid biofuel. Pyrolysis experiments were performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer under an inert environment at six low heating rates (5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 °C min−1). The thermal degradation of two invasive aquatic macrophytes exhibited a similar behavior, which occurs in multi-step events. Non-isothermal experimental data were used to analyze kinetic parameters through isoconversional methods: Friedman (FR), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Starink (STK) and Vyazovkin (VYA). The KAS, STK and VYA methods showed a similar value of Ea for water hyacinth and yellow velvetleaf (Ea(Stage1) = 92.58 and 160.66 kJ mol−1, Ea(Stage2) = 119.56 and 105.55 kJ mol−1, Ea(Stage3) = 229.07 and 160.99 kJ mol−1, respectively) due to the approximation equations have the lowest relative errors. The endothermic and non-spontaneous process occurred for the invasive aquatic macrophytes due to the positive ΔH, positive ΔG, and negative ΔS values. This study provides useful data for future simulation, design, optimization and scale-up of reactors for pyrolysis processes of invasive aquatic macrophytes. Sustainable, abundant and low-cost invasive aquatic macrophytes have considerable bioenergy potential comparable to established bioenergy feedstock for bioenergy production, and at the same time, acting as a solution to the problems caused by these invasive plants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Numerous research studies have recently demonstrated a huge physical potential of the cascade companies' utilization of the renewable waste ligno-cellulosic biomass sources by the fractionation, de-polymerization and valorization of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, separation, and subsequent catalytic conversion of the monomeric building blocks to biofuels, bio-based chemical substances and biomaterials. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), levulinic acid (LA) precursors, and furfural (FUR) are, in most characteristic platform compound compositions, produced by the water-mediated acidic hydrolysis of furans, pentose, and hexose carbohydrate sugars, which can be hydrogenated, oxidized, or dehydrated. These processes were subjected to surprisingly many systematic modeling applications on various operation scales. However, only a limited representative number of works managed to link any of atomistic- (ab initio density functional theory (DFT)), meso- (kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC), mean-field mechanistic rate micro-kinetics and diffusion) or macroscales (computational fluid dynamics (CFD), process model simulations and techno-economics), or integrate them together with classical equipment environment engineering tools (reaction energy thermodynamics, optimizing heat, momentum and mass balances and applicative reactor design). This Review article highlights the integration of interface chemistry methods as an emerging development approach that allows linking the insights about the molecular level measurements with elementary surface steps, while further with diffusive/convective transfers and process integration. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study investigated the transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) with methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide as the catalyst. A semi-industrial pilot of microreactor with 50 tubes with a diameter of 0.8 mm was used to produce 5 L/h biodiesel. Initially, the acidity of waste cooking oil was reduced to less than 1 mg KOH/g oil by using methanol at 60 °C in the presence of 1% sulfuric acid. Using Box-Behnken design method, the effects of methanol to oil molar ratio (6:1–12:1), catalyst weight (0.5–1.5 wt %), and reaction temperature (55–65 °C) were studied. The methanol to oil molar ratio of 9.4:1, the catalyst concentration of 1.16 wt %, and the reaction temperature of 62.4 °C was achieved under optimum condition. Finally, the effect of reaction time (30–120 s) was examined at the optimum condition. The highest level of biodiesel purity or fatty acid methyl esters % (FAMEs %) was 98.26%. In addition, the properties of produced biodiesel were determined and compared with those of the standard ASTM D6751. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article presents the results of investigations carried out to evaluate the improvement in combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with neat petro-diesel (PD), soybean biodiesel (SB), and 50% SB blended PD (PD50SB) by using carbon nanotube (CNT) as an additive. The acid–alkaline-based transesterification process with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a catalyst was applied to derive the methyl ester of SB. A mass fraction of 100 ppm CNT nanoparticle was blended with base fuels by using an ultrasonicator and the physiochemical properties were measured based on EN standards. The measured physiochemical properties are in good agreement with standard limits. The experimental evaluations were carried out under varying brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) conditions in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, and natural aspirated research diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The results reveal that the SB and its blend promote shorter ignition delay period (IDP) that is resulting in lower in-cylinder pressure (ICP) and net heat release rate (NHR) compared to PD. The SB and its blend increase the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and reduce the brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT), due to lower heating value, and efficient combustion, respectively. As far as the emission characteristics are concerned, the SB and its blend promote lower magnitude of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and smoke emissions compared to PD except for oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) emission. The CNT nanoparticle inclusion with base fuels significantly improves the combustion, performance, and emissions level irrespective of engine load conditions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present study investigates biodiesel production from waste palm oil (WPO) using coconut coir husk (CCH) derived solid acid catalyst. The catalyst was prepared by the direct in-situ concentrated sulfuric acid impregnation. The presence of active sites, such as sulfonic, carboxylic, and phenolic OH functional groups on the catalyst was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The highest biodiesel yield of 89.8% was obtained under optimum conditions of 10 wt % catalyst, 12:1 methanol:oil (molar ratio), after 3 h at 130 °C and 500 rpm, in a laboratory autoclave reactor. It was found that biodiesel yield increases with increasing reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst loading, up to an optimum value. The catalyst can be reused for four cycles and the biodiesel yield was &gt;77%. Relatively higher activity may be due to the high acid density of the catalyst due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups bonded to the hydrophobic carbon structure. It was found that, kinematic viscosity (2.9 mm2 s−1), pour point (−6 °C), heating value (38.1 MJ kg−1), and oxidation stability (3 h) of the produced biodiesel are in accordance with the international standards. Therefore, the produced biodiesel can be used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae is an alternative feedstock for biofuel production and has been considered to be a potential biotechnology. However, the systems for industrial biofuel production from microalgae are still costly and unsuitable. In addition, the complex and changeable processes contained in different bioenergy conversion systems make it difficult to reasonably compare these systems. This study aim to obtain an optimal microalgae-based industrial system using life-cycle assessment, and to unify the uncertainties caused by the discrepancies of each process. Two types of bioenergy conversion systems were modelled and compared: (1) transesterification, hydrothermal liquefaction, and pyrolysis for renewable diesel production and (2) anaerobic digestion without/with hydrothermal pretreatment for biogas production. The life-cycle impacts of these systems were quantified in terms of net energy ratios (NERs) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results show that anaerobic digestion system with hydrothermal pretreatment is more industrially feasible and eco-friendly at the industrial scale due to its low NER (0.71) and GHG emissions [−60.84 g CO2−eq (MJ biogas)−1]. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the pyrolysis of plant acidified oil, aiming to upgrade the quality of oil for fuel use. The decomposition temperature of plant acidified oil was in the range of 300oC-500 °C in 10 K/min according to TG-DTG. The Py-GC-MS results showed that except alkane, alkene and oxygen containing compound, plant sterol derivatives were also detected. The ESI FT–ICR MS results showed the presence of some products produced from hydrogenation and polymerization reaction occurred in pyrolysis process. The yield of the liquid product reached the maximum of 90% at 500 °C. The acid value and viscosity of pyrolysis products were relative high compared with diesel oil. The calorific value has no difference with that of diesel oil. According to above experiments, it was confirmed that pyrolysis components and characteristic of plant acidified oil was different with vegetable oil or fatty acid. Plant acidified oil was potential renewable source to obtain bio-fuel oil using pyrolysis method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The lignin-first strategy provides significant potential for producing value-added phenolics and high-quality biofuels. In this contribution, stepwise extraction and depolymerization of lignin in corncob residue towards the production of phenolic monomers, lignin-derived dimers and trimers was investigated. H2O/n-butanol (4:6, v/v) co-solvent could extract 87.1% of lignin in corncob residue, retaining a high-purity (86.0%) cellulose pulp. Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts with different Ni loadings were prepared and applied for further degradation of organosolv lignin. Over 5% Ni/HZSM-5, the highest yield of phenolic monomer was 19.5% with the selectivity of 66.7% towards 4-ethyl phenols (4-ethyl phenol and 4-ethyl guaiacol) at 300 °C, and liquid products with higher heating value (HHV) of 29.2 MJ kg−1 were obtained. The 5% Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst promoted the cleavage of intramolecular β-O-4 and Cβ-Cγ linkages, resulting in substantially decreased weight-average molecular weight (Mw)/number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the organosolv lignin from 2541/1064 Da to 562/391 Da, which implied the degradation of high-Mw oligomers to dimers and trimers. The catalyst also contributed to the hydrogenation of Cα[dbnd]Cβ bonds in unsaturated intermediates (coniferyl alcohol and coumaryl alcohol). The possible cleavage mechanism for the degradation of lignin-derived oligomers was also proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The identification of biomasses for pyrolytic conversion to biofuels depends on many factors, including: moisture content, elemental and volatile matter composition, thermo-kinetic parameters, and evolved gases. The present work illustrates how canola residue may be a suitable biofuel feedstock for low-temperature (<450 °C) slow pyrolysis with energetically favorable conversions of up to 70 wt% of volatile matter. Beyond this point, thermo-kinetic parameters and activation energies, which increase from 154.3 to 400 kJ/mol from 65 to 80% conversion, suggest that the energy required to initiate conversion is thermodynamically unfavorable. This is likely due to its higher elemental carbon content than similar residues, leading to enhanced carbonization rather than devolatilization at higher temperatures. Evolved gas analysis supports limiting pyrolysis temperature; ethanol and methane conversions are maximized below 500 °C with ∼6% water content. Carbon dioxide is the dominant evolved gas beyond this temperature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the olive cake was successfully developed and applied as a substrate to produce a lignin-based catalyst for biodiesel production. Three lignin-based solid acid catalysts were prepared from the incomplete carbonized alkali lignin using concentrated sulfuric acid. The catalyst underwent a detailed characterization analysis in terms of its functional groups of active sites, surface area, acid sites density and morphological structure. For the catalytic activity test, prepared catalysts were studied for their ability to catalyze both esterification and transesterification reactions of waste vegetable oil (WVO) ≈2 FFA (% w/w). The results revealed that a sulfonated lignin-derived acid catalyst has a high potential to esterify waste vegetable oil to about (92%) conversion. Furthermore, it demonstrated about 57% conversion to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) under the following optimum condition: sulfonation time of 1 h, catalyst loading of 10 wt %, the methanol-to-WVO molar ratio of 35:1, a reaction temperature of 65 °C and reaction time of 6 h. Also, the results showed that the lignin-based acid catalyst can be reused at least ten times with high FFA conversion (>75%). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology is a promising sustainable energy alternative to combat issues pertaining to non-renewable energy consumption, climate change, and environmental pollution. MFC technology employs anaerobic microorganisms, which convert biodegradable substances into simpler substances and produce bioelectricity. MFCs show promise for low-cost energy yielding wastewater treatment. Recent research efforts have shown that the technological know-how of MFC technology has evolved beyond the primary applications of wastewater treatment and energy generation. Hence, research attention has shifted towards other specific value-added applications of MFCs such as small implantable health devices, robotics, and environmental quality monitoring sensors, etc. This article concisely addresses the potential applications of MFC technology past power production and wastewater treatment for biofuels such as biogas, and hydrogen production, and in the fields of medical implantable devices, robotics, and as biosensors for heavy metals and detection of toxic chemicals among others. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Selective formation of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) by hydrogenolysis of lignocellulosic biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is highly desirable for renewable liquid biofuel production. Here we have synthesized Cu-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles embedded in carbon matrix (Cu-Pd@C) by simple pyrolysis of Pd-impregnated Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by conventional hydrogenation route. It was found that Cu-Pd@C-B (solid-gas-phase hydrogenation route) with Cu-Pd bimetallic alloying exhibited brilliant catalytic performance at 120 °C under 15 bar H2 pressure to produce liquid DMF biofuel with 96.5% yield from HMF as compared with the Cu-Pd@C-A catalyst (liquid phase hydrogenation route), which gave 46.4% yield under the same conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) studies reveal that Pd in Cu-Pd@C-B catalyst is electronically promoted by Cu with the unique intrinsic synergy of increased Pd-Pd bond distance and decreased Cu-Cu bond length, which eventually modulate the local atomic structural environment and result in enhanced catalytic activity. Moreover, the entrapped bimetallic nanoparticles with carbon shells in Cu-Pd@C-B catalyst further protect the active catalytic site from migration, aggregation, and leaching during hydrogenolysis reaction and improve the stability of the catalyst. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This research seeks a coupled solution for managing the large amounts of biochar produced by microalgae biofuel production, and the necessity for novel, economic and accurate heavy metal sensing methods. Therefore, this study evaluated the transformation of microalgae biochar (MAB) into carbon dots (Cdots) and their subsequent application as heavy metal ion sensors in aqueous systems. The experimental phase included the transformation of MAB into microalgae biochar-derived carbon dots (MAB–Cdots), MAB–Cdot characterisation and the evaluation of the MAB–Cdots as transducers for the detection of four heavy metal ions (Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+). MAB–Cdot fluorescence was stable over a wide range of pH and resistant to photo-bleaching, making them suitable as fluorescence probes. The MAB–Cdot fluorescence was quenched by all of the metal ions and displayed different quenching levels. Depending upon the ions involved, MAB–Cdots were used to detect the presence of heavy metal ions from concentrations of 0.012 μM up to 2 mM by measuring the reduction in fluorescence intensity. Neutral and slightly alkaline pHs were optimal for Cu2+ Ni2+ and Pb2+ heavy metal quenching. To quantify the concentration of the heavy metal ions, linear and logarithmic functions were used to model the MAB–Cdot fluorescence quenching. The sensing mechanism was determined to be reversible and purely collisional with some fluorophores less accessible than the others. This work demonstrated the ability to produce Cdots from microalgae biochar, examined their application as a transducer for detecting heavy metal ions in aqueous systems and paves the way for novel sensing systems using MAB-Cdots. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Upgrading of bio-oils to value-added products through simple and cost-efficient catalytic routes is always a big challenge in the energy utilization field. Herein, we prepared a highly dispersed 2 wt% Ru/TiO2 catalyst using a simple and novel photochemical method at room temperature. The synthetic catalyst exhibited an efficient performance on the HDO of phenolic compounds and real bio-oil, owing to its high Ru dispersion. Guaiacol could be converted into cyclohexane with 91.3% selectivity at 260 °C under 1 MPa H2 atmosphere. Other typical phenolic monomers (phenol, anisole, etc.) and dimers (α-O-4, 4-O-4, etc.) were transformed into cycloalkanes with most yield close to 100%. Results showed that the cleavage of ether bonds and the HDO step can be realized in one pot. This catalytic system was also effective on the upgrade of bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of cotton straw. A upgraded product composed of 32.4% hydrocarbons and 57.6% alkylphenols was achieved at 280 °C, which can be used as fuels and chemicals respectively. The enhanced reaction temperature (300 °C) enabled hydrocarbon contents increased to 41.4%, leaving the other oxygenated compounds only 4.2%. This work provides a promising reference for the valorization of raw bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work presents a case study on the first large-scale industrial biogas upgrading process with simultaneous purification of methane and CO 2 in one of Europe's largest biogas production and purification plants in Northern Italy. A preliminary study was performed on a pilot plant, constructed as a model of the industrial plant where the final experiments were performed. The full-scale anaerobic digestion plant has a digestive capacity of 400000 tonnes of biomass per year and it can treat 6250 m 3 h -1 of biogas. The first objective was a biogas upgrading process that achieves distribution grid-quality methane via different purification steps. The second objective and most innovative aspect is the further purification of CO 2 from a useless waste product to a high purity gas for the food and beverage industry. The chemical purity of different process streams was analysed by a certified laboratory and was compared with the guidelines of the European Industrial Gas Association and International Society of Beverage Technologists (EIGA/ISBT) for CO 2 used in the food industry. The microbiological purity was found to be far below the limit values defined in the European Collaborative Action. With a purity of 96.3 vol%, methane respects the purity requirement for the household network. With a purity of 98.1 vol% before, and 99.9 vol% after the final distillation process, CO 2 proves to be chemically and microbiologically suitable for food applications, thus closing the CO 2 loop in biogas production. An evaluation of the economic and energetic aspects and a comparison with alternative purification processes highlights the profitability of the process. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Coffee is the second largest traded commodity after petroleum and the second most popular beverage after water. This big industry is believed to generate huge amount of waste with spent coffee grounds (SCGs) represents one of the main by-products. Recycling of such waste to fuels and value-added products through bio-refineries is a promising way to solve the problem of many countries that face daily challenges and heavy cost in waste disposal. This review aims to shadow the light on SCGs recycling potential in which over 230 published papers on SCGs recycling topic were gathered and discussed. Various opportunities to produce biofuels such as biodiesel, biogas, bioethanol, bio-oil and fuel pellets besides value-added products such as bioactive compounds, adsorbents, polymers, nanocomposites, and compost were discussed. Moreover, the potential of membrane technology related to various processes of biorefining, separation and purification in the proposed SCG-integrated biorefinery are presented. Based on the presented review, it is obvious that recycling of SCGs offers many worthwhile options to policymakers that can contribute towards huge financial saving on taxpayers of running and maintaining landfills besides saving the environment from harmful emissions. In conclusion, this review emphasizes that SCG-integrated biorefineries to produce different types of biofuels and value-added products are a very promising approach that shall be economically more scrutinized in the foreseen future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the energy recovery through biodiesel and bioethanol production from Scenedesmus obliquus in a sequential route of lipid extraction followed by fermentation, with recycling of waste glycerol (WG) as a nutrient supplement into the culture. Low WG concentrations significantly enhanced the cellular dry weight over the control, recording the maximum significant value of 3.63 g L−1 using 2.5 g L−1 of WG (WG2.5). In addition, the maximum carbohydrate and lipid contents were recorded in WG2.5, which represented 16.4% and 21.7%, respectively, over the corresponding control, with simultaneous reduction in protein content. Moreover, total fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) recovery from biomass increased after WG2.5 supplementation, recording an increase of 24.6% over the control. Fermentation of lipid-free biomass increased the rate of bioethanol production, reaching its peak of 4.82 g L−1 at the 27th day. However, using of WG2.5 for microalgal growth and the residual lipid-free biomass for fermentation showed the highest bioethanol production peak of 5.58 g L−1 at day 27. Due to the accumulation of carbohydrates under WG, the biomass treated with WG2.5 showed increase in maximum bioethanol productivity up to 0.185 g L−1 h−1. However, sequential fermentation after lipid extraction enhanced the maximum bioethanol productivity by 32.3% and 15.1% over the whole cells from synthetic wastewater (WW) and lipid-free biomass from WW, respectively. The highest gross energy output of 21.4 GJ ton−1 dry microalgae was estimated from the integrated route where S. obliquus was grown in WG-enriched medium and sequential fermentation was applied for the residual biomass after lipid extraction, with the highest recorded energy conversion efficiency of 62.9%. These findings provide an innovative practical integrated approach for waste recycling and high conversion efficiency of microalgal biomass for liquid biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) followed by catalytic hydrotreating of the produced biocrude is increasingly gaining ground as an effective technology for the conversion of biomass into liquid biofuels. A strong advantage of HTL resides in its great flexibility towards the feedstock, since it is able to treat a large number of different organic substrates, ranging from dry to wet residual biomass. Nevertheless, the characteristics of biocrudes from different typologies of organic materials result in different challenges to be met during the hydrotreating step, leading to differences in heteroatoms removal and in the typology and composition of the targeted products. In this work, biocrudes were catalytically hydrotreated with a commercial NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst at different temperatures and pressures. Sewage sludge biocrude was found to be very promising for the production of straight-chain hydrocarbons in the diesel range, with considerable heteroatoms removal even at mild hydrotreating conditions. Similar results were shown by algal biocrude, although complete denitrogenation is challenging. Upgraded biocrudes from lignocellulosic feedstock (miscanthus) showed high yields in the gasoline range, with a remarkable content of aromatics. Operating at a higher H2 pressure was found to be crucial to prevent coking and decarboxylation reactions. © 2019

AB  - CO2 is main contributor of global warming crisis. Among various existing carbon-capture technologies, microalgae based biological carbon-capture is one of the promising less energy consuming technology. Microalgae are gaining attention for bridging carbon mitigation and bioenergy production. Microalgae biomass is considered as CO2-neutral substitute for fossil fuel which results through net transfer of atmospheric CO2 into biomass. Traditionally, biofuel production process utilized lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock. Recently, microalgae rise as 3rd generation bioenergy feedstock due to its attractive higher CO2 fixation efficiency, higher biomass productivity and relatively easy pretreatment processes for various biofuel extractions. Although commercial microalgae CCS process is still at pilot scale and microalgae derived biofuels are nonviable. Further technological development in microalgae cultivation and bioenergy conversion enable the effective CO2 reduction and sustainable energy development simultaneously, and this review will update the progress in microalgae cultivation, biomass conversion to biofuel technology which can be utilized under BECCS technology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Natural sources display a high potential for the production of sustainable materials because of their exceptional structural and physical features, nontoxicity, biocompatibility, availability and cost-effectiveness. Nanostructured systems show high surface/volume ratio, and unusual electrical, mechanical, surface and magnetic properties. The preparation of heterogeneous nanocatalysts from natural resources has recently become increasingly attractive for researchers. The present overview discuses extensively and comprehensively the main natural sources used to prepare the new generation of safer and cheaper catalytic nanosystems. We place a significant emphasis on both the different synthetic strategies for the preparation of the Nature-inspired nanocatalyst and the role of the natural materials over the structural and morphological properties of the resulting nanocatalysts. The catalytic applications of nature-inspired materials were finally featured, highlighting the advantages of using nanotechnology and environmental resources as well as their potential towards the production of alternative energies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of present research was to study the pyrolysis of wood sawdust in a semi batch reactor and explored the influence of pyrolysis process parameters on the products yield. Pyrolysis process parameters such as temperature, heating rate, nitrogen (N 2 ) flow rate and particle size of wood sawdust were varied as 350–650 °C, 10 and 50 °C/min, 50–200 cm 3 /min and &lt;0.25 to &gt;1.7 mm, respectively. The maximum bio-oil yield was found as 44.16 wt% at temperature of 500 °C, heating rate of 50 °C/min and nitrogen flow rate of 100 cm 3 /min for particle size range of 0.6 &lt; d p &lt; 1 mm. The composition and characteristics of bio-oil and bio-char were determined. Different methods such as ultimate analysis, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H NMR) were used to characterize bio-oil. Boiling point range of bio-oil was found in between 63 and 360 °C. Bio-char and original biomass were analyzed by physicochemical, thermogravimetric as well as analytical methods using sophisticated instruments such as Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). © 2019

AB  - TiO 2 -ZnO heterogeneous catalytic system provides a good replacement of a homogeneous catalytic reaction due to its easier recovery. In this study, biodiesel was produced from Ulva lactuca seaweeds using TiO 2 –ZnO nanocomposite catalysts with particle size of ~12 nm. The size controlled TiO 2 –ZnO nanocomposite was characterized by powder XRD analysis and TEM. The result of that TiO 2 –ZnO catalyst is a promising catalyst for the production of biodiesel under mild reaction conditions and high yield of hydroxydecanoic acid conversion of 82.8%. The various conditions optimized for the higher conversion to FAME (15.8 ml of FAME) were 4 wt% catalysts at 4 h under 60 °C and further there is no increase of conversion to FAME above 60 °C–80 °C. The total product yield was calculated as 82.8% of conversion to FAME. The evaluated biodiesel was found to be up to the mark of ASTM standards. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by using leftover biomass of algae obtaining after lipid extraction of U.lactuca. AgNPs particle size was achieved as ~12 nm and was confirmed by UV–Visible spectroscopy, XRD and TEM analysis. Antibacterial activities of the synthesized AgNPs were analyzed and compared. The antibacterial activity was excellent against bacterial pathogens and treatment against P. vulgaris shows the maximum zone of inhibition (13.8 mm). The present work identified that the unutilized bioresource such as U.lactuca can be effectively utilized for biodiesel production so as to replace fossil fuel usage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study polystyrene waste (PS) was collected from a drop off site in a local market and pyrolyzed at heating rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min and temperature range 40–600 °C under nitrogen condition. The apparent activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A) were determined using 6 different kinetic methods. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor were found in the range of 82.3 – 202.8 kJmol −1 and 3.5 × 10 6 –7.6 × 10 14 min −1 respectively. The results demonstrated that the calculated values of Ea and A vary with fraction of conversion, heating rates and the applied model. Moreover, pyrolysis of waste polystyrene was carried out in an indigenously manufactured furnace at temperatures ranging from 340 to 420 °C. The composition of liquid and gaseous fractions was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Temperature and reaction time were optimized and the results revealed that temperature of 410 °C and exposure time of 70 min are the best conditions for maximum fuel oil production. Methane and ethane were found as the main products in the gas phase constituting about 82% of the gaseous fraction. The liquid products composed of broad range of C 2 – C 15 hydrocarbons depending on the pyrolytic parameters. A comparison of the composition of pyrolysis oil with standard parameters of diesel, gasoline and kerosene oil suggested that pyrolysis oil from polystyrene waste holds great promise for replacing fuel oil. © 2019

AB  - The effect of ash removal pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass prior to catalytic pyrolysis for producing biofuels was investigated. Non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of demineralized and raw biomass was performed in Py-GC/MS and bench-scale experiments to study the performance of in-bed and ex-bed upgrading. Pre-treated biomass shows a significant increase in the organic liquid yield in experiments performed at 600 °C: from 31 to 42 wt% compared to raw biomass, as well as a significant reduction of char yield. The performance of in-bed catalytic pyrolysis of pre-treated biomass over HZSM-5 is limited compared to the corresponding raw material. However, ex-bed catalytic pyrolysis of pre-treated biomass at 600 °C results in an overall increased yield of BTX compounds. Pyrolysis vapors from pre-treated biomass present a suitable composition for catalytic upgrading after secondary vapor-phase reactions. Additionally, demineralization reduces the total acid number of derived liquids in catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Kitchen waste (KW) is one of the most important solid wastes in cities. The amount of KW generated in China's cities is very large per capita, and processing technology is simple. Based on a data analysis, field investigation and experimental research, KW is acidic, has high moisture content, has high organic matter content, and has a big difference in C/N ratio. It is found that comprehensive utilization of KW has great advantages by means of SWOT analysis. Complete KW resource utilization can be achieved through a comprehensive treatment technology consisting of pretreatment, wet solution, oil-water separation and anaerobic digestion. Grease is converted to ester through acid catalytic pre-esterification and alkaline catalytic transesterification reaction, followed by vacuum distillation to generate biodiesel. Biological desulfurization was effective in purifying the biogas. The comprehensive treatment products include biodiesel and biogas. This study has important guiding significance for the treatment of KW. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Decarbonizing the air transportation sector remains one of the most challenging hurdles to mitigating climate change. Lignocellulosic biomass-derived jet fuel blendstocks can contribute to the shift toward renewable, low-carbon energy sources for aircrafts. Producing these renewable jet fuel molecules from biomass requires advanced pathways with the potential for efficient and affordable conversion routes. This paper presents a detailed techno-economic analysis and sensitivity analysis, including estimated minimum selling price (MSP), and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation costs for five routes to four potential bio-jet fuel molecules-limonane via limonene, limonane via 1,8-cineole, tetrahydromethylcyclopentadiene dimer (RJ-4), bisabolane, and epi-isozizaane. The simulated biorefineries utilize biomass sorghum and an integrated high-gravity ionic liquid-based biomass deconstruction process. We present results reflecting the current state of the technology and potential future scenarios with improved yields. Among the conversion pathways and the fuel molecules evaluated in this study, limonane, bisabolane, and epi-isozizaane could reach an MSP of $0.73-$0.91 per L-Jet A ($2.75-$3.45 per gal-Jet A) in optimized future cases, without a hypothetical lignin-derived co-product. RJ-4 requires a more costly upgrading process and catalysts, resulting in a comparatively higher MSP ($1.33 per L-Jet A or $5.04 per gal-jet A). Based on the GHG footprints of each fuel, the minimum achievable carbon mitigation cost relative to conventional Jet-A is $29 per metric ton CO2e, which is just under double the current cap-and-trade market price in California. In the absence of any policy support, the economics could be improved through high-value uses for lignin. To reach a target selling price of $0.66 per L-Jet A ($2.50 per gal), lignin-derived products would need to be sold for at least $1.9 per kg. However, the higher energy density of these bio-based blendstocks offers valuable improvements in aircraft efficiency/range; we find that commercial airlines may be willing to pay a 4-14 cent per L premium for these bio-jet fuels. Our results highlight the need for improvements beyond currently-reported yields for the biologically produced intermediates, identification of ideal microbial hosts, selection of metabolic pathways to achieve competitive production costs, and a focus on fuels with attractive properties that increase their value. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Transesterification is a promising technology for the biodiesel production to provide an alternative fuel that considers the environmental concerns. From the economic and environmental protection points of view, utilization of waste frying oil for the production of biodiesel addresses very beneficial impacts. Production of higher yield of biodiesel is a challenging process in order to commercialize it with a lower cost. The current study focuses on the influence of different parameters such as reaction temperature (°C), reaction period (min), oil to methanol ratio and amount of catalyst (wt%) on the production of biodiesel. The main objective of this work is to develop a model via fuzzy logic approach in order to maximize the biodiesel produced from waste frying oil using montmorillonite Clay K-30 as a catalyst. The optimization for the operating parameters has been performed via particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach. During the optimization process, the decision variables were represented by four different operating parameters: temperature (40–140 °C), reaction period (60–300 min), oil/methanol ratio (1:6–1:18) and amount of catalyst (1–5 wt%). The model has been validated with the experimental data and compared with the optimal results reported based on other optimization techniques. Results showed the increment of biodiesel production by 15% using the proposed strategy compared to the earlier study. The obtained biodiesel production yield reached 93.70% with the optimal parameters for a temperature at 69.66 °C, a reaction period of 300 min, oil/methanol ratio of 1:9 and an amount of catalyst of 5 wt%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising technology to convert wet biomass into bio-oil with high calorific value and without drying process. To evaluate the potential application of liquefaction bio-oil in industry, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis on the properties of liquefaction bio-oil derived from food waste. The food waste is pretreated with K2CO3 at 100 °C for 1 h, followed by liquefaction in a semi-pilot reactor at 320 °C for 30 min. The higher heating value of produced bio-oil is 34.79 MJ kg−1, accounting for 53% increase when compared to the feedstock (22.74 MJ kg−1). The ignition and burnout temperatures of the bio-oil are lower than other liquefaction bio-oils, reflecting its higher reactivity and combustibility. Meanwhile, the bio-oil has a higher oxidation onset temperature than pyrolysis bio-oils, showing its higher thermal stability. The independent parallel reaction model in association with the particle swarm optimization indicates that the pyrolysis kinetics of the bio-oil can be approximated by four groups. The component analysis further reveals two important groups of fatty acids and amides in the bio-oil, stemming from the conversion of carbohydrate and protein in the food waste. The comprehensive analysis shows that the liquefaction bio-oil from food waste, characterized by higher energy density and better combustibility, is a potential substitute to the fossil fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current fossil fuel reserves are not sufficient to meet the increasing demand and very soon will become exhausted. Pollution, global warming, and inflated oil prices have led the quest for renewable energy sources. Algal biofuels represent a potential source of renewable energy. Algae, as the third generation feedstock, are suitable for biodiesel and bioethanol production due to their quick growth, excellent biomass yield, and high lipid and carbohydrate contents. With their huge potential, algae are expected to surpass the first and second generation feedstocks. Only a few thousand algal species have been investigated as possible biofuel sources, and none of them was ideal. This review summarizes the current status of algal biofuels, important steps of algal biofuel production, and the major commercial production challenges. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the influence of various catalysts on biodiesel production, especially from non-food feedstocks with an ambition to optimize the catalytic biodiesel production. Homogenous acid catalysts are mainly used in biodiesel production, but they cannot be recovered and demand costly fuel purification as being corrosive. Similarly, enzyme catalysts are expensive in industrial-scale production of biodiesel. However, heterogeneous catalysts simplify the easy separation of product and by-products from the catalyst along with catalyst reusability and reduction of waste. Solid acid and base catalysts offer more advantages due to their non-toxicity, high surface area, reusability, higher stability, and the simplicity of purification. Solid base catalysts yield better activity than solid acid catalysts, however, they cannot esterify large amounts of free fatty acids (FFAs) in non-food feedstocks. The solid acid catalysts have the added advantages of being more tolerant to high amounts of FFAs and being able to simultaneously esterify FFAs and transesterify triglycerides in cheap feedstocks like waste cooking oil. Recently, an array of inorganic, organic and polymeric solid acid and nanomaterial-based catalysts have been developed using cheap feedstocks. However, the issues of low reactivity, small pore sizes, low stabilities, long reaction times, and high reaction temperatures still need to be solved. The developments of producing efficient, cheap, durable, and stable solid acid and nanomaterial-based catalysts have been critically reviewed in this study. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives of production of biodiesel and its industry growth have also been discussed. © 2019

AB  - To meet the expected requirements of the proposed EU Renewable Energy Directive for the next decade (RED II), it is necessary to increase the availability of second-generation biofuels. One promising way of doing this involves using ablative fast pyrolysis units to transform an agricultural by-product, for example straw, into bio-oil. To obtain straw bio-oil suitable for processing in a typical refinery, we optimized the key parameters of its hydrotreatment. For the upgrading, a continuous flow reactor with a fixed bed of a commercial sulphide NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was used. The reaction temperature and pressure were tested at 240–360 °C and 2–8 MPa, respectively. The reaction off-gas was analysed by GC-FID/TCD. A detailed physicochemical analysis of the products was carried out. Under most conditions tested, the product was separated into an aqueous and an organic phase. For the best products, &gt;85% of the feed energy content remained in the organic phase and a significant decrease in viscosity and acidity was achieved. The product prepared at 360 °C and 8 MPa was the only one completely miscible with straight-run gas oil and, thus, appears to be the most suitable for co-processing in a refinery. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper shows the direct comparison of 4 different catalysts (homogenous alkaline (KOH), heterogeneous alkaline (CaO), homogenous acid (H 2 SO 4 ) and a new biocatalyst (lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) immobilized on octadecyl methacylate)) in the production of biodiesel from cooking oils. The reactions for each catalyst were optimized using response surface statistical methodology, considering as main parameters: substrates molar ratio, percentage of catalyst and reaction time, whereas for enzymatic catalysis instead reaction time, we studied water concentration. Alkaline homogenous catalysis was found to be the most effective, as expected from literature. However, for first time, the new biocatalyst from TLL is just around one order of magnitude under the homogenous catalysis in reaction rate and surpassed the heterogeneous catalysis or the acid catalysis (similar yields in 2 h versus the 1 h of the alkaline catalyst). Moreover, the reaction product using the biocatalytic approach was much cleaner and less energy demanding than the other catalytic approaches. From our view, this is the first report where biocatalysis is close to conventional catalysis in the production of biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The majority of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) predominantly operate as monooxygenases, but recently a class of P450 enzymes was discovered, that can act as peroxygenases (CYP152). These enzymes convert fatty acids through oxidative decarboxylation, yielding terminal alkenes, and through α- and β-hydroxylation to yield hydroxy-fatty acids. Bioderived olefins may serve as biofuels, and hence understanding the mechanism and substrate scope of this class of enzymes is important. In this work, we report on the substrate scope and catalytic promiscuity of CYP OleTJE and two of its orthologues from the CYP152 family, utilizing α-monosubstituted branched carboxylic acids. We identify α,β-desaturation as an unexpected dominant pathway for CYP OleTJE with 2-methylbutyric acid. To rationalize product distributions arising from α/β-hydroxylation, oxidative decarboxylation, and desaturation depending on the substrate's structure and binding pattern, a computational study was performed based on an active site complex of CYP OleTJE containing the heme cofactor in the substrate binding pocket and 2-methylbutyric acid as substrate. It is shown that substrate positioning determines the accessibility of the oxidizing species (Compound I) to the substrate and hence the regio- and chemoselectivity of the reaction. Furthermore, the results show that, for 2-methylbutyric acid, α,β-desaturation is favorable because of a rate-determining α-hydrogen atom abstraction, which cannot proceed to decarboxylation. Moreover, substrate hydroxylation is energetically impeded due to the tight shape and size of the substrate binding pocket. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The electrochemical upgrading of bio-oil is a potential renewable approach toward generating liquid biofuels or industrial chemicals under mild reaction conditions (≤80 °C and ambient pressure). The aromatic structural evolution in bio-oil is a key consideration in bio-oil application. In this study, a bio-oil sample produced from the fast pyrolysis of rice husk at 500 °C and its lignin-derived oligomers were electrolyzed in an electrolytic cell with platinum electrodes. The samples at discrete time intervals were extracted and analyzed using ultraviolet fluorescence spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Results showed that aromatic compounds with one and two benzene rings decreased with a prolonged processing time. The unsaturated aromatic compounds were hydrogenated and converted into saturated compounds. Species with more than two aromatic rings were the main compounds detected by FT-ICR MS. The lignin-derived oligomers contained the most phenolic compounds with more than two aromatic rings of the bio-oil. However, the evolution of these phenolic compounds showed different trends between the electrolysis of bio-oil and the lignin-derived oligomer fraction. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of the light components derived from cellulose/hemicellulose species in the bio-oil. These species were reactive and able to produce radicals that enhanced the hydrogenation reactions. Accordingly, interactions among bio-oil compounds occurred during electrochemical treatment.

AB  - In these studies, the microwave-assisted transesterification of non-edible Papaya oil was investigated under the fixed microwave power of 700 W and constant magnetic stirring. Optimization of the yield of Papaya oil methyl ester was investigated using response surface methodology. Within the range of the selected operating conditions, the optimized values of temperature, catalyst amount, time, and methanol to oil molar ratio were found to be 62.33 °C, 0.95 wt %, 3.30 min, and 9.50:1 respectively. Current studies revealed that the methanol to oil molar ratio and temperature have significant effects on microwave-assisted transesterification of Papaya oil. The high values of R2 97.72 and R2adj 95.60 indicate that the fitted model shows a good agreement with the predicted and actual FAME yield. Based on the optimum condition, the predicted biodiesel yield was 99.9% and the actual experimental value was 99.3%. Papaya oil methyl ester (POME) exhibits property close to ASTM standards. In conclusion, these studies revealed that biodiesel obtained from Papaya seed oil feedstock has a potential to use as an alternative of diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the biochar which was obtained from peat was modified and served as the support for the preparation of cost-effective solid base catalysts for the transesterification reaction. The composition, structure and texture of prepared catalysts were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), N2 adsorption/desorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the Hammett indicator method. It was found that the surface area and pore volume of the peat biochar were increased significantly (from 80.25 m2/g and 105.36 mm3/g to 230.86 m2/g and 296.23 mm3/g, respectively) by chemical activation treatment with KOH. The best performance is observed for the resulting 30Ca/APB-700 catalyst (30% CaO loading and 700 °C calcination temperature), and over biodiesel yield of 93.4% was achieved at catalyst amount of 5 wt.%, methanol/oil molar ratio of 8:1 and reaction time of 150 min. Besides, after reused for 10 cycles, the catalytic efficiency had a slight deactivation in biodiesel production (above 81.6% of yield obtained). The high stability of catalyst was mainly attributed to the formation of Ca–O–Si bond on the catalyst surface. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this review, the conversion (thermochemical, biological and hybrid) of chemical energy chiefly enclosed in biomass structures i.e. as 30–50% cellulose, 15–35% hemicellulose and 10–20% lignin into various forms of fuels/energy products is comparatively analyzed. Cellulose and hemicelluloses formulate almost ∼70% of the biomass and are definitely linked to the lignin structural units all the way through covalent and hydrogenic bonds; thereby, the structure formulated is tremendously rigid and resistive against processing. Hence, the vital confront towards the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into important bio-yields via biorefining is to overcome this obstacle. This article gives an outlook over the major conversion technologies to produce biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass feedstock, by focusing on their typical performances. The core points outlined and argued will be the currently positioned pathways, utilizing the lignocellulosic materials to produce (bio) fuels, prospect on biomass supplies, and discussion on the impact of sustainability criteria, main influencing factors and uncertainties. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work aimed to explore the optimized conditions of hydrothermal co-liquefaction (co-HTL) of the green seaweed “Enteromorpha clathrata (EN)” and the lignocellulosic agricultural waste “rice husk (RH)”. Separate hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of EN and RH showed bio-oil yields of 26.0% and 45.6%, respectively. However, co-HTL under optimized conditions showed significant increase in the bio-oil yield by 71.7% over that of EN, and insignificant difference with that of RH. Nevertheless, the conversion ratio of co-HTL showed 10.6% significant increase over that of RH. GC-MS results showed that main compounds of EN and RH bio-oil lump into the C15–C20 and C5–C12 regions, mainly representing carbon range of diesel and gasoline, respectively. Short-chain (C5–C12) and long-chain (C14–C20) compounds in the bio-oil obtained by co-HTL represented 72% and 28%, respectively. In addition, the ratio of aromatic compounds in the bio-oil of RH was reduced by 9.3% as a result of co-HTL. In conclusion, results suggested 50% ethanol as a co-solvent, 300 °C and 45 min as optimum conditions for co-HTL of EN:RH (1:1 w/w). The present study demonstrated an efficient route for co-HTL of 3rd generation feedstocks with 2nd generation feedstocks which will have a significant impact on large-scale applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pinewood sawdust and the waste rubber from truck tyres have been co-pyrolysed in order to improve the properties of bio-oil for its integration in oil refineries. In addition, an analysis has been conducted of the effect the interactions between these two materials’ pyrolysis reactions have on product yields and properties. Biomass/tyre mixing ratios of 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100 by weight percentage have been pyrolysed in continuous mode at 500 °C in a conical spouted bed reactor, obtaining oil yields in the 55.2–71.6 wt% range. Gaseous, oil and solid fractions have been characterised for the 50/50 biomass/tyre mixture, paying special attention to the oil fraction by determining its detailed composition, elemental analysis and calorific value. Co-processing enables the stabilization of the liquid, as the co-pyrolysis oil has a stable single phase, being composed mainly of water, aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols in concentrations of 14.5, 11.1 and 9.7 wt%, respectively. Adding tyre rubber to the biomass in the pyrolysis feed improves the oil's properties, as a liquid with higher carbon content and lower oxygen and water is obtained, even if sulphur content is also increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Altering recalcitrant structures of bamboo is essential to obtain high yield of bioethanol via bioconversion process. With the goal of improving cell wall digestibility, alkaline liquid hot water was used to pretreat N. affinis. The effects of temperature and alkali dosage on structural alterations were determined by chemical composition, Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The relationship between these changes and substrate digestibility was addressed by separate enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF). The results indicated that pretreatments partly removed and degraded hemicelluloses and lignin, reducing yields of substrates and molecular weights of carbohydrates. With the change of cell wall structure, specific surface area of materials increased after LHW pretreatment but decreased with further removal of lignin and hemicellulosic fractions. Maximum bioconversion was obtained by pretreatment with 0.5% NaOH aqueous at 170 °C and SHF, yielding 4.8 g/L ethanol. © 2018

AB  - Lignocellulosic waste material serves as a considerable renewable feedstock that could be used to replace oil refineries with biorefineries. Indeed, all biomass components can be converted into platform chemicals, bioenergy and materials. However, thermochemical and conventional catalytic conversions suffer from a number of drawbacks. Enabling technologies, such as microwave (MW) technology, can reduce process times and energy consumption, leading to improvements in product quality and yields. The remarkable advantages of MW over conventional heating, which originate from its direct dielectric interaction with biomass, are documented in this comprehensive survey. Moreover, the use of alternative solvents that interact strongly with MW in biphasic systems can circumvent the need for additional upgradation and separation steps. Finally, this review discusses some of the challenges that MW irradiation faces, including the poor dielectric properties of some substrates and issues related to its large-scale application in pyrolysis, hydrothermal conversion and catalytic routes to biofuels, materials and platform chemicals. Waste biomass may well be the benchmark feedstock for the development of a circular bioeconomic approach. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Calcium oxide (CaO) catalyst was prepared using chicken egg shell waste and tested as a catalyst for the production of biodiesel from Chlorella vulgaris biomass. The calcination method was adopted for the synthesis of CaO catalyst. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image showed that the catalyst had a spherical structure with average particle size of 46.1 ± 2.1 nm, further analysis was carried out using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Transesterification process was conducted by using response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD). The optimum reaction conditions were observed at 70 °C, 10:1 methanol: dry biomass ratio, 1.39% catalyst loading, 3 h reaction time, and 140 rpm stirring rate resulted 92.03% biodiesel yield. The key fuel properties includes; iodine value (88.5 g I2 100/g), cetane number (50.0), cloud point (9.2 °C), pour point (3.1 °C), oxidation stability (7.4 h), higher heating value (44.7), kinematic viscosity (4.5 mm2/s) and density (0.9 g/cm3) resulted good quality of microalgae biodiesel. Our research finding shows that the CaO catalyst derived from egg shell waste is an economically potential and eco-friendly catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Intense utilization of natural fuel resources is threatening the global environment and societal sustainability. It triggers up the need for finding environmental-friendly and sustainable sources of energy. In this perspective, microalgae have emerged as a potential alternative. Microalgae are featured with distinct ability to provide ecological services and respond to the sustainability challenges simultaneously. Microalgae can fix atmospheric CO2, valorize waste resources and can produce a wide variety of bio-products. The promising features of microalgae pitch the idea of establishing a sustainable bio-refinery to draw multifaceted benefits and reinforce the objectives of resource efficient bio-economy. Unfortunately, in the last few years, preferential studies have been carried out to assess the potential of microalgae-based integrated bio-refinery. This review critically discussed the recent developments, opportunities, and barriers in the microalgae bio-industry and wastewater treatment. Particularly, microalgae potentials for biofuels and resources recovery are addressed towards sustainable biorefinery. Moreover, techno-economic and commercial viability of microalgae-led bio-refinery is reviewed to drive this technology towards practicality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Zhao et al. find that ammonia has the lowest source-to-tank energy cost for vehicle fuel cells when considering carbon-neutral pathways starting from sun, wind, air, and water. A direct ammonia fuel cell with high power output is achieved, reducing the key technological barrier to realizing the economic and environmental benefits of ammonia as a transportation fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
Alternative carbon-neutral synthetic fuels are needed to decarbonize the transportation sector, bridging the gap between batteries and biofuels. Herein, we analyze the economics of hydrogen-, nitrogen-, and carbon-based fuels made by carbon-neutral pathways in a post-fossil world where only water, air, and renewable electricity are available for fuel synthesis. We find that ammonia has the lowest source-to-tank energy cost by a significant margin. With this technoeconomic analysis as motivation, we demonstrate a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC) prototype with a peak power density of 135 mW cm−2. The DAFC employs an ammonia-tolerant precious-metal-free cathode catalyst and a high-temperature-stable hydroxide exchange membrane. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
Hydrogen has attracted the most research and development interest due to the efficiency and performance of hydrogen-fueled proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, transmission, distribution, dispensation, and storage are expensive for hydrogen as a highly compressed gas. Switching to a liquid or liquefied fuel offers substantial savings but requires a high-performance power source. When considering carbon-neutral pathways starting from sun, wind, air, and water, we show that ammonia has the lowest source-to-tank cost. We then focus on the direct ammonia fuel cell as the key technological barrier to realizing the economic benefits of ammonia. We show how a high peak power density of 135 mW cm−2 can be achieved using ammonia-tolerant catalysts, high-stability hydroxide exchange membranes, and optimized operating conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The ongoing requirements for fuel in meeting the ever-growing demand in commercial sector have pushed researchers in finding and optimizing the production of biofuels from cheap sources, enabling for a sustainable production. The present study aims at bridging the gap in optimizing the process parameters which are required for converting cheap waste cooking oil (WCO) into methyl esters, using cost effective source of heterogeneous catalyst (Egg shells). Characterization of synthesized calcium oxide (CaO) and the methyl esters were performed. Catalyst calcinations temperature (CTemp), catalyst calcinations time (CTime), catalyst loading (CL), alcohol to oil ratio (AO), reaction temperature (RTemp) and reaction time (RTime) were being analyzed in a 3-level-6-factor array using an L27 Taguchi orthogonal array (OA). Response surface methodology (RSM) optimization and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test are carried out for determining the most significant parameter. Amongst the entire variable, the transesterification reaction temperatures have a contribution of 30.14%, followed by calcinations temperature with 29.70%. A confirmation test is conducted using the optimal values from both RSM and ANOVA and a yield of 96.6 ± 0.05% and 96.3 ± 0.10% respectively is obtained which is more than the predicted value of 96.08% and at par with studies of researchers work. Thus, at same OA design, RSM and ANOVA can be equally applied for optimization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The issues over increases in energy demand and environmental pollution attributed to excessive use of fossil fuel have been the driving forces of the exploration for eco-friendly resource. Lignocellulosic biomass consisting of carbohydrates and lignin can be a renewable feedstock for replacing fossil fuels in the future because it is a plentiful and carbon neutral material. Especially, lignin, cross-linked phenolic polymers, is a topic of interest owing to its abundant production from pulp/paper industries as well as lignocellulose based biorefinery. The large potential of platform chemicals and biofuels from lignin has opened up an extensive range of opportunities to develop thermal and catalytic conversion technology. Over a few decades, several lignin conversion processes including catalytic pyrolysis, catalytic depolymerization, and catalytic oxidation have been developed to improve target products yields and to suppress side reactions. More recently, lignin-first approaches which maintain carbohydrates intact by selective extraction of lignin as valuable phenolics from whole biomass has been suggested. This review introduces recent ten years progress on thermal and catalytic conversion technology in terms of process type, catalyst development, and target products. This review is expected to offer an influential information for future research into the thermal and catalytic conversion of lignin as well as lignocellulosic feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, centrifugation was used as a standard harvest method, while chemical flocculation was comparatively used as a cost-effective harvest method for microalgae. Lipid recovery from the centrifuged cells was 17.4%, which significantly increased by flocculation to 20.7%. Although both harvest methods showed similar thermal decomposition patterns, flocculated biomass showed 15.7% higher bio-char formation than the centrifuged cells, which resulted in significant reduction in the bio-oil yield by 18.5%. The estimated energy output of bio-oil using centrifugation and flocculation were 0.87 and 0.68 GJ per ton, respectively. For biodiesel production, the energy output using centrifugation and flocculation were 0.177 and 0.211 GJ per ton, respectively. Due to the higher biodiesel yield, better bio-oil quality and lower energy consumption, flocculation was suggested by the present study as a superior method over centrifugation for microalgae harvest from the economic point of view. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fuelling biodiesel derived from water hyacinth in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes water hyacinth biodiesel (WHB) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in freshwater, marine and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. WHB was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel in diesel engine. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single cylinder diesel engine at constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion and emission characteristics. Test results projected that, the characteristics of 20% WHB +80% diesel fuel blend was in par with neat diesel fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, HC, CO and smoke emissions. However, WHB blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO2 and NOx emissions. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of WHB blends were closer to the diesel fuel. Thus, the present work identifies the novel water hyacinth biodiesel as a viable biofuel for diesel engine applications towards sustainable environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents an overview of the context and global impacts of recent International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations on the marine fuel oil refining industry, future marine fuel mix and ship emissions. IMO limited marine fuel sulphur content in both Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and Nitrogen Oxide Emission Control Areas (NECAs) to 0.1% (wt. %) by 2015, and to 0.5% globally by 2020. It is anticipated that the newly implemented IMO regulations will help to mitigate negative impact of ship emissions on public health and environment. IMO regulations require significant changes to refineries to increase the production of low sulphur fuels through a shift to distillates, use of novel deep desulphurization techniques, or fuel blending. Changes to the refinery processes can bring forth increases in greenhouse gas emissions and high capital investments. Alternative fuels will need to meet the required reduction of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions in coastal areas. Alternative marine fuels consisting of liquefied nature gas (LNG) and biofuel may be suitable fuels to meet both targets. These two fuels are predicted to account for 50% of shipping energy demand by 2050, while the remainder will still be supplied by conventional heavy fuel oil (HFO)/marine gas oil (MGO). Switching to low sulphur fuels as a results of the new IMO regulations has led to measureable reductions in ship emissions generally. This fuel switching also resulted in changes in engine emission characteristics, especially on particulate matter chemical composition. © 2019

AB  - It is highly profitable to transform glycerol – the main by-product from biodiesel production to high value-added chemicals. In this work, we develop a photoelectrochemical system based on nanoporous BiVO 4 for selective oxidation of glycerol to 1,3-dihydroxyacetone – one of the most valuable derivatives of glycerol. Under AM 1.5G front illumination (100 mW cm −2 ) in an acidic medium (pH = 2) without adscititious oxidant, the nanoporous BiVO 4 photoanode achieves a glycerol oxidation photocurrent density of 3.7 mA cm −2 at a potential of 1.2 V versus RHE with 51% 1,3-dihydroxyacetone selectivity, equivalent to a production rate of 200 mmol of 1,3-dihydroxyacetone per m 2 of illumination area in one hour. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The present work encompasses combustion, performance, and emission parameters of experimental investigations of a single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled, direct injection (DI), naturally aspirated compression ignition (CI) engine with a rated power output of 3.7 kW at constant engine speed (1500 rpm) using diesel and different blends of microalgae spirulina. The microalgae spirulina blend of ratio with diesel (BYY) where YY indicates blending percentage (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% volume basis with diesel respectively) with different engine loading condition (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were compared with diesel at CR17.5:1. The output illustrates that the most optimum value is B20% when compared with diesel. The result depicts firstly that there is a reduction in brake thermal efficiency by 0.98%, exhaust gas temperature by 1.7%, hydrocarbon (HC) by 16.3%, carbon monoxide (CO) by 3.6%, NOX emission by of 6.8%, and smoke emission by 12.35% respectively. Secondly, there is an increase in specific fuel consumption by up to 5.2% and CO2 emission by 2.8% for spirulina blend ratio (B20%) as compared to diesel (B0%) at full load condition engine with constant engine speed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Optimization of the operating factors to achieve the maximum yield of biodiesel through transesterification reaction was performed by using face-centered central composite design (FCCD) approach of response surface methodology. A total of 29 independent batch experiments were considered in this model to carefully observe the effect of operating factors, such as the volume ratio of methanol/oil, catalyst (KOH) weight percent, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The FCCD model predicted that a maximum yield of 99.5% biodiesel would be achieved from flaxseed oil at a reaction temperature of 59 °C, 0.51% catalyst, the reaction time of 33 min, and a molar ratio of methanol to flaxseed oil of 5.9:1. Experimental verification of the predicted yield under the optimum conditions gave a maximum yield of 98 ± 2%, which is in very good agreement with the predicted value of the model. The physicochemical properties of the flaxseed oil-derived biodiesel were compared with those of standard biodiesel to identify and verify the quality of the produced biodiesel. All observed physicochemical parameters of the flaxseed oil-derived biodiesel were closely in agreement with those of standard biodiesel. Thus, demonstrating that the production of high-quality biodiesel from flaxseed oil is a viable option. © 2019

AB  - The application of heterogeneous catalysis in biomass pyrolysis is considered as one of the most promising methods to improve bio-oil quality by minimizing its undesirable properties (high viscosity, corrosivity, instability, etc.) and producing renewable fuels and high-value chemicals. Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of biomass refers both to the “in situ” and “ex situ or two-stage” upgrading. A plethora of catalytic materials have been investigated in the literature for both approaches, including conventional microporous zeolites, ordered mesoporous aluminosilicates, promoted or not with several transition metals, as well as various metal (nano)oxide catalysts with Lewis acidity. Recently, hybrid micro/mesoporous and basic materials have been also suggested exhibiting most promising results due to combined micro/mesoporosity and adequate balance of acid and basic sites. Optimum catalysts are required to retain deoxygenation, enhance yields of aromatics, and other valuable compounds (such as phenolics), while limiting coke formation. Coke formation is one of the reasons of catalyst deactivation; a very challenging issue during biomass CFP, especially using zeolites. The deactivation process is affected by many factors, including the composition of the feedstock (inorganic minerals present in the feedstock may also deposit on the catalyst), reaction conditions, and the nature/properties of the catalysts used in CFP. Precoking on the surface of zeolites or MgO deposition are among the proposed effective ways to suppress coke formation and thus, catalyst deactivation.

AB  - This paper evaluates the feasibility of using fusion waste chicken and fish bones as the reusable and low cost solid catalyst for synthesis of biodiesel from used cooking oil via two-step transesterification. A catalyst characterization of the prepared fusion waste chicken and fish bones catalyst was made in order to study their catalytic performance through various techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Particle Size Analysis (PSA), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared spectra (FTIR), Carbon Dioxide-Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD-CO2) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The used cooking oil transesterification was optimized using a response surface methodology (RSM) based on five level three variables central composite design (CCD). The RSM results revealed that the optimal operational condition for the transesterification has defined as: catalyst loading, 1.98%w/v, reaction temperature, 65 °C and time, 1.54 h, whereas the alcohol/oil molar ratio, 10:1 is a fixed variable in this study. The actual biodiesel yield of 89.5% was achieved under the predicted optimal conditions and fulfilled the ASTM D6751 biodiesel fuel standards. The promising features of the chicken and fish bones catalyst are inexpensive, easily obtained, simple work-up, simple recovery, reusability without significant drop in catalytic activity for up to four consecutive runs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Washing pretreatments of rice straw were performed using three different solutions, namely water, dilute hydrochloric acid solution (HCl solution, pH = 2.9), and aqueous phase bio-oil (APBO, pH = 2.9). The raw and pretreated samples were pyrolyzed at 550 °C in a fixed bed reactor. Results showed that among the three pretreatments, washing with APBO had the highest removal efficiency of alkali metal and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs). Among the pyrolysis products, bio-oil from APBO washed sample had the highest mass, energy, and carbon yields, lowest water content of 36.9%, highest HHV of 17.2 MJ/kg, and highest relative content of anhydrosugars of 31.2%. Its biochar had the lowest ash content of 27.3% and highest specific surface area of 98.6 m2/g, and its non-condensable gases had the highest HHV of 11.9 MJ/m3. Therefore, APBO washing was effective in improving the quality of biomass and its subsequent pyrolysis products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Peels from tucumã, a widely consumed fruit in the North of Brazil, were calcined at 800 °C and employed as heterogeneous catalyst in biodiesel synthesis. The catalyst characterization by WDXRF showed it was mostly composed of K, P, Ca, and Mg. The catalytic activity was evaluated by transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. The transesterification conditions were optimized at 1% w/w of the new catalyst, 4 h reaction time, 80 °C, and 15:1 methanol:oil molar ratio, yielding-biodiesel high oil conversion (97.3%). Because of its heterogeneous and non-leachable nature, the catalyst derived from tucumã peels could be reused 5 times under optimized conditions; a 17.3% decrease of catalytic activity was observed in the fourth reuse. Catalytic activity was also observed in reactions at room temperature and pressure, yielding conversions higher than 80% in 6 h of reaction time with 5% w/w of the catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Formic acid is a main product from biomass-derived carbohydrates and is attracting ever more attention as a sustainable hydrogen source, owing to its high volumetric hydrogen density of 53 g of H2 per liter. In this review, we give an overview of the formic acid mediated transformations of biomass-based feedstocks into added-value products, including biofuels; attention will be primarily focused on the transformation of biomass-derived platform chemicals, with an emphasis on levulinic acid. Formic-acid mediated lignin depolymerization and biomass-oil upgrading will be also discussed. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A simple and clean synthesis for Nd2Sn2O7-SnO2 nanocomposites as high-efficiency visible-light responsive photocatalyst is described applying extract of pineapple, for the first time. As novel and non-toxic biofuel, extract of pineapple, is employed to fabricate Nd2Sn2O7-SnO2 nanocomposites through an environment-friendly procedure. The findings denote that the applied biofuel can play a meaningful role as capping agent during preparation of Nd2Sn2O7-SnO2 nanocomposites. Depending on the applied dosage of pineapple extract as well as time for fabrication, the grain size, photocatalytic yield and morphology of Nd2Sn2O7-SnO2 structures changed. A suite of identification methods like XRD, TEM, EDS, DRS, BET and FESEM are utilized for investigation of the produced Nd2Sn2O7-SnO2 nanocomposites. Nd2Sn2O7-SnO2 structures are utilized as visible-light responsive photocatalyst to degrade the rhodamine B and eosin Y contaminants. The produced Nd2Sn2O7-SnO2 nanocomposites have been found to be very effective as visible-light responsive photocatalyst to degrade contaminants which may bring to environmental pollution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the major factors in the success of renewable energy is finding a proper location for production facilities. At a national level, different parts of a country (e.g. provinces) can be seen as alternatives that can be assessed based on a set of criteria, and ranking them to identify the best location. The focus in this paper is on identifying the best location for the production of bioethanol. After a comprehensive literature review, an evaluation framework is proposed based on the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental and social). Using data provided by a sample of experts in a developing country – Iran – and applying the best-worst method (BWM), a number of decision-making criteria are evaluated. Performance data involving the various provinces of Iran are collected from different sources. The performance data and the weights identified through BWM are used to calculate an overall score for each province, which is then used to rank the provinces, with the province of Khuzestan (closely followed by Tehran) being identified as the most suitable province for bioethanol production in Iran. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Firstly, the operating conditions were screened for biomass pyrolysis in a fixed bed with respect to higher oil yield. A temperature of 600 °C with an N2 flow of 80 ml/min exhibited the highest bio-oil yield. Then, the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass with various catalysts (Al2O3, CaO, MgO, CuO, Fe2O3, NiO, ZnO, ZrO2, TiO2, HZSM-5 and MCM-41) was studied to identify the selective deoxygenation method with respect to improve bio-oil quality with smaller drop in bio-oil yield. With the addition of CaO, the oxygen was mainly removed in the form of CO2, while, in other cases, more oxygen was removed in the form of H2O. Furthermore, more decarboxylation or less dehydration is better for the balance between yield and deoxygenation amount, and the preferred decarboxylation would lead to a higher pH and lower moisture content of bio-oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production using intensification of methyl ester is becoming very important due to its considerably lower energy requirement and shorter reaction time in obtaining feedstock oil. The present study investigated utilisation of Reutealis trisperma oil to produce biodiesel. A Box-Behnken experimental design was used to optimise the transesterification process. The process variables were explored and the optimum methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time were 8:1, 1.2 wt%, 64 °C and 68 min respectively and the corresponding methyl ester yield was 98.39%. The experiment was conducted in triplicate to validate the quadratic model. Results showed average methyl ester yield was 97.78%, which is close to the predicted value, indicating reliability of the model. Results also indicated that using infrared radiation method has many advantageous, such as less energy consumption as a result of deeper penetration of reactant mass which can improve mass transfer between the immiscible reactants in order to improve quality of biodiesel. The physicochemical properties of Reutealis trisperma methyl ester produced under optimum transesterification process variables were also measured and the properties fulfilled the fuel specifications as per ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Southeast Asian countries stand at a crossroads concerning their shared energy future and heavily rely on fossil fuels for transport and electricity. Within Asia, especially India and China lead the world renewable energy generation undergoing a period of energy transition and economic transformation. Southeast Asian countries have huge potentials for sustainable energy sources. However they are yet to perform globally in renewable energy deployment due to various challenges. The primary objective of the study is to examine the renewable energy growth and analyse the government policies to scale up the deployment of renewables for power generation substantially. The study also offers policy recommendations to accelerate renewable energy exploitation sustainably across the region. To achieve the ambitious target of 23% renewables in the primary energy mix by 2025, ASEAN Governments should take proactive measures like removal of subsidies of fossil fuels, regional market integration and rapid implementation of the existing project. Eventually, each of this strategy will necessitate sustained leadership, political determination, and concrete actions from stakeholders, in particular, increased cooperation across the region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Isolation of earth abundant biopolymer, Lignin, from Dendrocalamus sinicus and their structural properties were investigated to achieve its large-scale practical applications in value-added products. Two lignin fractions (MWL, DSL) were isolated with successive treatments of dioxane and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) from dewaxed and ball milled bamboo (D. sinicus) sample. The two-step treatments yielded 52.1% lignin based on the total lignin content in the dewaxed bamboo sample. Spectroscopy analyses indicated that the isolated bamboo lignin was a typical grass lignin, consisting of p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl units. The major interunit linkages presented in the obtained bamboo lignin were β-O-4′ aryl ether linkages, together with lower amounts of β-β', β-5′, and β-1′ linkages. The tricin was detected to be linked to lignin polymer through the β-O-4′ linkage in the bamboo. In addition, phenyl glycoside and benzyl ether lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC) linkages were clearly detected in bamboo (D. sinicus), whereas the γ-ester LCC linkages were ambiguous due to the overlapping NMR signals with other substructures. The detailed structural properties of the obtained lignin fraction together with the light-weight will benefit efficient utilization of natural polymers as a possibly large-scale bio-based precursor for making polymeric materials, biochemicals, functional carbon and biofuels, and multifunctional polymer nanocomposites. © 2018

AB  - A comprehensive exergoeconomic performance analysis of a municipal solid waste digestion plant integrated with a biogas genset was conducted throughout this study in order to highlight its bottlenecks for further improvements. Exergoeconomic performance parameters of each component of the plant were determined by solving exergy and cost balance equations based on Specific Exergy Costing (SPECO) approach. The analysis was conducted to reveal the cost structure of the plant based on actual operating information and economic data. The exergy unitary cost of two main products of the plant, i.e., bioelectricity and biofertilizer were determined at 26.27 and 2.27 USD/GJ, respectively. The genset showed the highest overall cost rate (101.27 USD/h) followed by digester (68.41 USD/h). Furthermore, the net bioelectricity amounted to 67.81% of the overall cost rate of the products, while this value was 32.19% for both liquid and dewatered digestates. According to the results obtained, efforts should mainly focus on enhancing the efficiency of the genset in order to boost the overall performance of the system exergoeconomically. In addition, minimizing the investment-related cost of the digester could also substantially enhance the exergoeconomic performance of the plant. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent developments in nano additives focuses on lowering the diesel engine exhaust emissions. While the usage of biodiesel in diesel engine at lower blend percentage (10%–30%) with mineral diesel can be well utilized without any engine modifications, the main striking factor in biodiesel application in diesel engine is higher NOx formation due to excess in-built O2, which could be overcome with the usage of EGR (exhaust gas recirculation). However, EGR usage raises the concerns of HC, CO and smoke emissions. Overcoming the above existing problem, the current research proposal focuses on EGR of B30 (30% palm biodiesel-70%diesel) blended with 25 ppm TiO2 nanoparticles (PBN). Experimental test results obtained for PBN-EGR were outstanding than the conventional PB-EGR system since there is a noticeable drop in BSFC, HC and CO emissions with increase in EGT (exhaust gas temperature) than PBN. NOx emissions of PBN-EGR were on par with PB-EGR throughout the load. At higher engine loads, smoke emitted by PBN-EGR were lower than PB-EGR. With increase in EGR percentage in PBN, cylinder pressure was only marginally lower and heat release rate was higher than PBN. The present investigation enumerates that the synergic effect of nanoparticle, biodiesel and EGR is effective in improving the performance with minimized exhaust emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the effect of fuel injection pressure on the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fuelled with waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) and its 5–30% (v/v) blends with diesel fuel were investigated and compared with diesel fuel. The engine experiments were conducted under six different fuel injection pressures (170–220 bars), eleven different engine speeds (1000–3000 rpm), and full load to find the optimum pressure which gives best results is identified for each fuel. The results compared with diesel fuel showed that biodiesel fuels confirmed that the reductions in the engine torque, brake power, CO, UHC, and smoke opacity; however brake specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, NOX and CO2 emissions increased. On the other hand, the increased injection pressure caused to increase in the engine torques, brake powers, and brake thermal efficiencies up to 210 bar. Moreover, the increased injection pressure caused to decrease in UHC, and smoke opacity, while the increase NOX and CO2 emissions. The results indicated that fuel blends can be used in the diesel engine without any modification. When over all the results were evaluated, the optimum fuel injection pressure was found to be at 210 bar for WCOB and fuel blends. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The authors of the article explain the necessity of using eco-friendly biofuel for motor vehicles. The possibilities and ways of using biofuel in motor vehicles on the basis of alcohols (methanol, ethanol) and methyl ester of rapeseed oil are analyzed. The physical and chemical properties of these biofuel types are presented. In order to develop, determine and optimize the composition of eco-friendly biofuel for motor diesel engines, the authors have tested them during their work in methanol, ethanol-fuel emulsions and methyl ester of rapeseed oil. It has been experimentally established that the use of eco-friendly fuel in transport diesel engines is possible in the form of alcohol-fuel emulsions (alcohol (methanol or ethanol) is 25.0%, detergent-dispersant additive succinimide C-5A is 0.5%, water is 7.0%, diesel fuel is 67.5%) and in the form of separate supply of methanol (88.0%) and methyl ester of rapeseed oil (12.0%). The experimental research of motor diesel engines working on eco-friendly biofuel types of the above mentioned compositions has been carried out and the perspective decision of improving their environmental performance has been explained. When the diesel engine is operating on a methanol-fuel emulsion, the reduction in the pollutant content in the exhaust gases takes place: nitrogen oxides reduces by 41.3%, carbon soot reduces by 85.5%, carbon dioxide reduces by 6.7%, carbon monoxide reduces by 45.0%. When working on ethanol-fuel emulsion there is a decrease in nitrogen oxides by 50.2%, in carbon soot by 80.7%, in carbon dioxide by 23.8%, in carbon monoxide by 25.0%. And when working on methanol and rapeseed oil methyl ester there is a decrease in nitrogen oxides by 47.4%, in carbon soot by 90.4%, in carbon monoxide by 44.8%. © 2019.

AB  - Food wastes are generated massively across global food supply chains. Conventional treatments of food waste (e.g., landfilling and incineration) cause environmental, economic, and social problems. There is a more sustainable and profitable management option by valorization of food waste into value-added chemicals. Consumer chemicals, including acids, sugars, and their derivatized forms, can be synthesized from food waste. Refined specialty chemicals from food waste ranging from solvents to antioxidant materials can be important for nutraceutical and biomaterial applications. Meanwhile, commodity chemicals derived from food waste such as biofuel, biogas, and biochar help meet the global demand for large-scale reutilization of resources and energy. Niche chemicals (e.g., chitosan, glucose, and free amino nitrogen) converted from food waste also show great prospect in nutrient recycling and use for industrial applications. This paper reviews and discusses the latest technological advances in different physical, chemical, and biological treatments of food waste, such that the productivity of value-added chemicals and cost-effectiveness of these valorization methods can be improved for future scaled-up operations. This paper covers holistic comparison and in-depth discussion regarding the feasibility and sustainability of food waste derived chemicals, together with the market outlook of recycling and valorization of food wastes from state-of-the-art perspectives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
